Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ____________ I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 2, thinking it would be the best electronic device. It was a disappointment from the beginning. After reading about the problems, I found this site and gave up on it. I think the only reason I was able to buy a new phone was that I was on the blackberry. This Tab S has terrible speakers and is very uncomfortable to hold. I have to use it on the couch with my feet up. I'm on the computer and can't listen to music. If I want to watch tv and listen to it on my TV, I have the sound muted on my computer. So I can't watch tv in the shower or on the beach. It is very loud even at low volume and has terrible battery life. Even though this is not a big deal for me, because I'm a student, it's an issue for me to not be able to use my phone for the things I need to do.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first time i have tried to use a smart phone. I am a very good photographer. I have purchased some great digital cameras, the Canon 5D Mk II, and the Canon 6D, but I have had a hard time getting the best pictures with these cameras.  My camera is not smart.  I had the smart phone in a case, so I couldn't use the smart touch screen.  After i used the phone for two weeks,  I am very sad that I will be selling it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very skeptical at first about buying this item, but it turned out to be one of the best purchases I've ever made. The unit itself is very good quality, and the quality of the sound is better than it looks. The best part, is that you can still listen to the radio and other music on the device, while you're using it. The only problem I've had is that it's very hard to change the input from the device to the speakers, so I usually use the aux out jack to do that. Otherwise, this is the perfect stereo unit for my car and my home.    Best stereo   When it comes to sound quality, there are only a few I consider to be best. This unit fits that description to a T. It is my goto sound system for cars, trucks and motorcycles.

You can buy a new one for $25 and not have to think about it for a year or two. So that's why the original antenna was very popular - it was always there and it would always work. It could not work if you didn't have the antenna. You could always just buy a better one - and then you would always have a good and working antenna. What I mean by that is, you should always buy a good piece of antenna. If you don't you could have a bad one. If it works sometimes and not at all sometimes - then it probably just isn't working as much as it should be. One other thing I did:  I put a piece of copper wire around the inside of the door. I cut off the end and then used a soldering iron to heat the end until it became very hot. Then I put a small piece of solder around the top and bottom of the copper wire. I found it was much better for my antenna than the rubber seal. That thing didn't seal very well at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for a couple of years now and its the most annoying device ever ive gotten in my life because every time i wake up the screen is black and the sound just goes away the speaker comes on it's like i hit the "record" button and it just plays for like a few seconds but i just want it to shut off when i wake it up ive tried several times to turn it off and it never does but this is not the worst thing i have to deal with this thing is the worst ive ever had
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________ The product works great, i bought it with the idea to make the sound more clear (i dont know how well this works in practice though) and it doesnt help at all at all. It seems the device doesnt do much to improve the sound quality. i had to turn the sound up so loud to get it to work, this is not a problem if i do that anyway, so how does the sound work as a whole, im trying to get the volume to not be too loud to hear, but it isnt easy to do. I did buy a new amplifier as well, but that did not help and the volume sounds almost normal, so im hoping this does something to improve it, but Ive been looking for something different to do with my tv with my mp3 player for a while now. Also theres a bit of a delay when playing music, i have the sound turned on but have a hard time listening to it for a long time, but i know that it is there, i guess it may have to do something with the speakers. If you want to listen to music and not have a good set of speakers, and you do not mind the delay/delay when it starts, this sound is ok. The only problem i can see is that it has to be plugged in or in a speaker, it does not just go out. Theres a good product, but be warned, you may have problems.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a sony digital recorder for 5 years and its just awful to work with. it sounds horrible to me and it breaks so much. i have had to replace it at least 5 times now.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, November 11, 2013  by Chris from San Antonio TX USA  Pros: easy to use, inexpensive  Cons: no mic, not very clean audio, mic not very high quality  Review: I bought this for my son who works in a radio studio. It allows him to monitor the microphones and the audio coming out of the microphones. It also allows him easy access to the input of the mic and the mic level control.   It is a little noisy (my studio is located in a large apartment complex), so you might want to upgrade to a high quality, more noise resistant microphone. But I bought one anyway.  . . ,,  . Review: I purchased this to replace an aging model that would no longer accept my Tascam DR1. I have had the new unit for over 2 months now and it has improved dramatically in the audio department. The microphone is excellent, as is the audio quality. I had the old unit and it performed the same in the beginning. I highly recommend this product.  with the exception of the 1 microphone connection, it's pretty straightforward.   and the microphone volume control. great  I'm an audiophile and i do alot of recording.  this is the best mic I've ever used. I've used it with my sennheiser omni 110 and it's very comparable to the omni's mic but not as good.   great product and great price.  the only negative thing is that the mic is not very clear in the studio, when recording, because the microphone has a very low output and can be very thin, or too close to the mic. but that's only in the recording. when playing the audio back the sound is very clear.  in the mixing stage, it has great sound quality and very nice output.  for the money, it makes an excellent replacement for my old omni110's. 's just a great product. I will never go back to my old mic.'  was this review helpful to you?)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------------------- I bought this as a replacement for an iphone 4S, and i'm glad i did. I was impressed that it was fast, and easy to setup and use. However i'm not sure if it's possible to run more apps on it since its a pretty beefy phone. I would definately recommend this. Pros: - iphones are awesome - ilymp is so useful for people like me with multiple monitors - ics is great - the battery life is great! Cons: - I would like to see an extra microphone on the back for my son to use on camera calls (i'm not a fan of the rx2 mic - that can cause problems for the phone itself)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It just didnt work  by: Steve from Las Vegas, NV on 5/24/2016  Value:  Review: ,but it's pretty cool.  My only issue is the lack of an "on/off switch" - no way to turn it off when the device is not in use. The buttons do work but they have to be pressed very lightly to activate them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had this since October. It works great and is very small and light. However, there's only one button, and it's a bit difficult to reach.  My problem is it was a bit cheap so I'm sure it'll get worse with the time but it's not as bad as I feared. It's very cool.  in the end it's just for looking at but it was fun to build. .  is so good!  Great quality and very easy to set up!  a bit slow to come to life, like this review is at least 4 times too big for what it says on the box.. it's only the case and power cord, all others in the box it's all the parts needed to put together a pc. i'm a total newbie and i'd say it's actually the easiest to put all the things together in less than an hour!   and i got the black one in the picture in my case, but i had the white one for this review! but they both work great and are perfect for my little project!  for what they're selling, for under $20 i think its worth it!  the price and the quality of this product is amazing. i would buy from this website again.    The only drawback is the size, I could easily hide my usb keyboard in it and it would be more than enough to run my PC.  or you could also add a cd/dvd burner in the side and mount it on the top or the bottom of the device.  I'd suggest you do that  Very good, simple pc box  This is my second PC, after my original was stolen. I had a lot of trouble installing this because it was very easy for a beginner to use, but my first one I bought was very old (had not been used for over 2 years) and the software was very dated. The new one, however, is very good. I've put a hard drive in it, a mini drive and an external hard drive. I would highly recommend this to anyone new to PC's and would buy again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ****************************** I really was expecting this to work like a charm, but the first time I took it on a hike, it worked great. My wife and I walked for a bit, went for a run, and I went to go check my cell phone. I was not at home in my home, I just had to use my cell and I was on it in no time. This thing was so easy to use and so quick to do. I just wish it was made with more power in the battery, I am almost out of it and I am not going to buy a whole new pack just to last through this trip. It would be better if you had a way to control the volume with the volume rocker, it works great for music but for movies and everything else, it will not work. I am really bummed because it is easy to get used to it and it really does come in handy but I wish they could add a little power to the battery.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had one of these for about 5 years now, and the display is horrible. i bought this device so i could use my old iphone and ipad at the same time. well, i figured out that i cant even use one of them at the time of the purchase, or the other isnt even connected. i even called and spoke to one of the tech support people and was on hold for over an hour with him. it wouldnt turn on, no sound, and i lost 20 bucks that i had saved up for this product. i know the iphone and ipads have different chips and that the device might be not worth all that money, but the display needs to be redone. it looks and feels cheap, and its not worth 20 bucks for a product like this to fail. just wish it didnt have a display problem.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! This thing just doesn't work, I used it to replace my broken laptop. I bought it with the hopes of keeping the battery fresh and I was a little disappointed, the battery is still going strong but I can't get the touch screen to do anything because the LCD screen is not moving. It is as if it was only made for one thing and that is to control the light on my house. I have tried the battery replacement program and after spending $400 dollars in one phone call they said it would take 2 weeks to get it done and that would have to come out of my pocket. They were very nice and they explained the whole process which was awful. When I called the number and the tech called me back they said the battery was dead and if I did not want to buy a new one he could not do it for me. I am still looking for a solution to this problem but I will not be buying another iGadget in the future!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! It's junk. It just doesn't work! It just don't WORK!! I had my new Samsung in my drawer for over a month, and when it was time for my old one, I couldn't take it out. So I put it back on the shelf and the old one started again. That's when I called and complained, and they said "Oh, it's just a bad apple" and gave me a new one. I bought it a couple of months ago and it just stopped working! My old one worked like a charm, and I just want to get it fixed before I use the old ones! You should get rid of these and give us something that works!  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Not as advertised!!! I have only had this unit for a few months and the battery is no longer on the unit. I have had the unit for several weeks now and have had no problems with it. It is not being charged any more and I have no idea when it will charge up. Also, it does not have a USB port and there is no software available for it. I guess if you don't want to deal with using the software on the computer then don't buy this product. So sorry but I would not buy this piece of crap again!!!  Customer Review Review by Michael From Texas

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a few issues with this and its always the same. it freezes up. i know it works because when it does it takes a while to boot up and once it does its stuck at the black screen that looks like it isnt even on. i am sure there are ways to force it into doing what its supposed to do but its always a bummer and when i get one to work well it was worth the money to me because i was able to do all my gaming. i dont like paying extra money for things that dont work. the one that worked for a year wasnt worth it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________ This is NOT a "nice" little tablet. It is a "disastrous" one. This is by FAR one of the most annoying "disasters" that I have ever used. It's such a massive pain to use, and I can't seem to figure out what the difference between "OK" and "NOT OK" are. It always seems to be one step slower than I'm used to and I get so frustrated trying to figure it out and get my pictures to turn out right. It literally makes my life miserable, and to make matters worse, there is NO manual for the tablet. You have to do things with your eyes closed that I don't know what to do! I don.t know if I want to give this device two stars or if I should throw it in the trash.  Write a positive review about the best buy you've ever made: _________________ THIS TAPETABLE IS A GREAT PRODUCT I bought it the first time for my 12 year old son's birthday party. The family loved it. I bought one for my daughter when she was 16. They were both so impressed. My daughter asked me if I was going to buy one for her when she grows up. I told her it will depend on how fast she grows. She grew up to be 15 so I gave her one and bought her a tablet when she turned 19. She loves her tablet too. The only thing about the iPad is that it's really easy to get lost. I had to buy a GPS to be able to find my iPad. It will also be expensive to replace the battery every 6 months so I am going to hold off on buying one until she grows out of it.   - John H. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!!!!  I bought this as a gift for a friend for Christmas. I was very excited. The battery life is great. I play the computer game Battlefield 3 for about 4-5 hours before the battery dies. I have a lot of games on it. There is no way the battery life will last that long.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******** I am very disappointed with the fact that the batteries I received were so cheap and had almost no capacity, but what made things worse, the charger I used for them didn't work at all, even when the batteries were recharged with the charger. I guess I'll have to start buying new batteries.

After trying several different models, her ipod will not turn on and does not sync to her cell phone.

Recommend this product if you have an ipod and can't wait for a newer model to come out. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had an hdtv for about a year now and i use it to watch youtube videos, i have an usb remote that is a little small to hold all the buttons for the hd tv and its so difficult to find a remote that i can hold in my hand and not have to reach over to my desk to press the buttons. ive tried the one from google and the other from samsung but they dont fit in my hands.  ive also tried a few brands of usb to micro usb adapters but the ones i have didnt work and made it harder to access the hdr tv's buttons. the usb to usb cable that i bought works but it has two very short plugs that the tv doesn't like and sometimes i have to unplug it when i switch on the tv in order for the tv to see it.  the tv is so easy to use that if the people at samsung read this and read my issue, they could make a usb to USB cord that fits in my palms and is longer than the ones that i use.  this is such a terrible product.  I was going to buy a better one for my tv but now i don't know what to do
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________________  i have an iphone 6, it is great for watching movies, however it is VERY loud, if you are using headphones you can barely hear the movie in its full glory without them, very uncomfortable to wear, the charging and connecting is awful, they have to be connected in their case, once they are on you have to turn them on, once you do you have a 5 min wait.  and i had to use my phone like a tablet, I had a great tablet until they changed it and made it sound terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to use on my cellphone to turn off my car alarm. I was disappointed when it didn't work! The manual indicated that I would be able to connect a shorted battery and it would turn off, but it didn;t. After trying this thing a couple of times, I went to my dealer and he said he could have this fixed and that I just needed to come back and he would send me a new one. I ended up having to take my car to a mechanic and get the shorted batteries replaced! I am so disappointed with the customer service. I've already sent the new one back to Apple, and I am not going to keep using the crappy unit that the dealer gave me!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - The device only works for a limited time and then gets destroyed  - This device requires constant recharge and never lasts as long as advertised (6 months ish)  If you buy this product, do it with caution! If this were a phone, it would be terrible!   It works like this:  This is what I received: , and it has a battery, usb, and a usb-c. It has a camera and a mic.   First, I put the charger into a mains outlet. It worked fine for a bit. Then I put it into an outlet for charging and I was going nuts. I had to plug it into the mains and charge. I plugged it into my computer, then put it back into the outlet for my computer. The device did not charge and it died. So, I plugged the charger back into my mains. The USB port was dead. I turned the computer on and got the usual Windows 7 pop-up saying it cannot find an Internet connection or a valid connection. I unplugged the USB cord, plugged it back in and it worked again. I got Windows 7 to load. I set up a computer account. I went on YouTube and started playing videos for a while. Then all of a sudden the device went dead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------ I am a novice to electronic devices but I just found this. I bought it to make a webcam and I was skeptical. I was worried that it would be difficult to set up and would be too heavy to carry around. What a complete and total disappointment. It took 3 weeks for my first photo shoot and the quality is so much better than the computer I bought. The software, camera settings and lighting are so much more intuitive and I feel like I am on a different planet. I have bought this product and it is definitely worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to use as a remote control for my tv but it didn't work. I had to run into the living room to get it to turn on so I couldn't watch anything, my tv was on but it wouldn't turn on. The next day when I came to use it it wouldn in a different way. The remote was attached to the box by the wire that goes between it and the tv. I tried unplugging and plugging in the remote and no difference. The box has a small battery that can be recharged at the bottom of the remote box so it was a good thing I hadn't tried that yet, as I would be wasting my time on trying to get this to work.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item was delivered in 2 days! The item was on the way to my home in 4 days! My only problem with this is that there is no way to disable the device to avoid sending it on its way. My wife is an active duty service member and was supposed to get it before the end of the week! This thing is not made for the military! So you know... I think i may end up giving this one to my nephew as he wants to play video games. He wants a wireless game controller for his computer. He said it was a really fun idea and i will keep an eye out on him for the next one to be delivered. I wish it was like that with the first one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received my Bose QC35.7 in January 2016 and immediately plugged it in after plugging in the original Bose speaker. I was pretty surprised to see that the quality of the sound was worse. The soundstage seemed thinner and I was no longer able to hear the instruments in the music. I called Bose about the problem and they said the sound problem was with the QC35 and I should return it for a new unit. I did not want to return the QC but didn't have a better option. This speaker was shipped with the original cables and the original remote control. I asked Bose to return me the remote as well. After returning the QC, the speakers sounded better. I have been using the Bose speakers with a Yamaha HS-30, Sony STR-D2, Sony CX500, and the Bowers & Wilkins P7. So far, I am very happy with the BOSE QC35s!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had the watch for a month. This watch is very nice. I bought it as a Christmas present, and it's been my life for over a month now. But I bought this in January of this year (2016). I bought my LG G watch from B&H first because I like what they do. I like that it has a watch face, so I can get notifications on it without actually having to open the phone to look at it. Also, they've got their product down so well that they offer a $15 off coupon, which I bought at B&h to use. I used that coupon on my LG watch and got the watch in January. So, my $79 LG watch is a lot better value than the $300 Watch Urbane 2 I bought in February of this years. In the last month I've used the $15 coupon a few times to save money on my phone and my phone bill (which I pay with my phone). The only problem I've had with this watch is that the batteries last about 10 hours (maybe 15) before needing to be charged (by the watch itself or by your phone) or the watch has to be connected to power by a cable. When I was using the watch, I thought I was going to have to charge it every few days, so maybe I just have to be more careful about charging it in the morning. Other than that, the watch is easy to set up, has the same apps that my watch does, and the watch face is awesome.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******************* I got this device to run my iLife software on. I am very disappointed with the quality of the display and the sound. It was a $49.99 iMac screen with a sub par sound and iLife, it was simply unacceptable. i lost my job as a result of the poor display quality. I had to pay an attorney to get my job back. I have also heard from other workers at this facility that they were told the display was defective and they were ordered a new one, not for replacement. My iLife application was never going to run at all unless I could see the screen. Not only was it bad, the audio was horrible, just a bit tinny but not horrible. I do not know what I would do with a $30 device to go from using an iMac to running an application I am a programmer on. The only way that I am going to get back on my feet is to find a new job with another firm and use the iLife on that. I did not want to spend $49 on an iLife that would never work. My advice to other workers is to check the iWork software and the graphics drivers on their machines before you order it. I will never purchase from this facility again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------------------- I purchased this as an upgrade for my other iMac. It arrived well in the mail, but the sound of the speakers is the only thing that would make me want to upgrade to an external unit. The sound of my external unit is better than the one with this unit, and it even sounds a bit better than my other external unit (I don't have the other model to compare, but I will check it out in a week or so). So, I am sticking with it for the time being. I'm not sure if it's my setup, but sometimes it gets louder than the external unit I have. I am hoping to get a better quality unit and not have to change out the speakers.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this and it only has a battery life of about 4 hours. The light is not bright enough, the buttons are not responsive and it does not work very well. I would only recommend this to people with very low budget and who want a cheap remote. Also I would recommend buying a second remote for your phone. I am a beginner and this remote doesn't even work for my phone. If your looking for a cheap smart remote or just want something that works then get this one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst product I ever bought.  I ordered the watch and it did not ship out.   After waiting for over a week with no response from a customer service rep.  They told me they would send a replacement.  When the replacement arrived they sent it by overnight mail with no tracking or anything.  My watch was not shipped.  The replacement arrived a few days later in great condition.  I will not buy any Apple products again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I have only been using this for about a week, and have already installed it in my vehicle (I have a 1998 Honda Insight). When I plugged it in I realized it did not detect the car's computer. I thought this was some sort of malfunction, but then it seemed like the computer just would not recognize it. It was very annoying at first, but I eventually got used to it. I also realized that I can not easily use the internet on the car as I have to pull the device out of the dash as I go. I can only see the car on the screen and it shows a lot of useless information.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is the first keyboard that I have owned and it is not good at all. I have 2 previous mechanical keyboards (K70 and K95) that both worked well. This new keyboard is so bad. I use the keyboard on a Lenovo laptop that has been broken in and I found that the key travel is too short, the key is too close to the body, and it doesn't have a dedicated key for caps lock. There are also problems with the "light" button (the blue light that comes on when you type), it's too hard to press the "on" button, and when you press it, it turns red! I have had to press it so hard it knocked the laptop off the table. It's also not comfortable to use. My current mechanical keyboard and it works well. I bought this just to replace my old one and I hate it and it should be given a bad rating because it doesn''t fit well.  Novelty keycaps? I like them, but when you try to use it for a while it starts to lose the typing speed and feel. When you type faster and more accurately, the keys will feel less mushy. This was a good investment, but it is going back to the old style keyboard with better quality.  and  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No  15 of 15 people found the following review helpful:
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The e-sport controller and its battery lasted about 18 hours. That's not great, and the charger lasted an hour and a half. It was pretty weak, too, which isn't ideal for this type of device. The controller has some serious issues and it doesn't work with a wide range of batteries and chargers. I would not recommend this for serious gamers.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have this for over a year and I still have not been able to use it. It always has to be replaced by Samsung.   This   is supposed to connect to the computer and transfer files to it.  But, all it does is connect and turn on then the screen goes black then goes into standby and does nothing for 20 minutes then it starts the same thing over and over again.  My kids even try to connect and it just disconnects from the computer. This  is very frustrating as   when   my kids want   to transfer photos, music, and other data to   their computers.  they want the   convenience of   this   but when  they can't use   the  device, I have to  use  it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!   I have two of these bad boys. The first one is very very bad. I have had it for 2 years and just bought a newer one, and it works perfectly, no problems at all, however after I took my earbuds out and looked at it I realized my old one had a cracked screen. I'm sure that's why they came with the new one with the cracked screen, I thought the screen would be stronger.   Anyway, I have never had any problems with them but now I have one of them that won't charge, and I'm going to have to pay a repair person $60 to return them. No big deal, but I have two good phones and these are the worst.  - - - -   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________________________________________ The XO Pro2 is a really good laptop. I really wish there was more of it in the market. The Xo Pro2 feels sturdy and it is quiet in the system. I can actually work comfortably while I am wearing it. I have a desktop computer and an iPad that is very noisy, so the XoPro2 is much quieter. There is a huge gap between the XO-Pro2 and the screen. If the screen is angled correctly, the screen looks to be almost in line with the laptop body. The only other thing I dislike about the X-Pro is the USB port on the right side. It is on the bottom of the laptop and is very difficult to use. It needs to be on the top edge of the tablet or the laptop would not fit in the tablet dock. Other than those minor problems, the X Pro2 provides all of the features the X series offers. My only con is that the screen on the XA Pro2 and XA is a little smaller than the XF Pro2. My desktop has a 19" monitor and the iPad 2 is 15.6" It would be better if the screen was larger. But then again, that would be an upgrade.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have to say this is one of the worst digital cameras i've ever bought.  1. the battery has a very small capacity and a very high discharge rate, meaning it will last about two hours at a low charge, or about two and a half hours at the highest charge. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________________________________________________________________________  I love this phone! It is very well built. But it's not for me. My issue: I wanted an android phone and this was not a good fit. I do not want a phone that will constantly be draining my battery, I want a very good phone that lasts a long time. I think that this phone was never meant for me but this phone will last me a very long time and I have had many problems with it before but they have not fixed it yet.   And the warranty is crap. I called and they did not replace it. They told me that it's their policy to replace your defective device. And they also told me they can do nothing about the warranty issue. And then they never called me back to explain it.  ,   If I could give it zero stars I would. This phone is so poor that I will not be able to be happy with my new one in 6 months, even with an Android update.   the reason I gave it 5 is because I know that there are other good phones out there. I am just very unhappy with the phone I received. I will only be using it as my daily driver from now on. I hope my experience wasn't too bad, but I was pretty disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------ I bought this after I lost my phone, I was in the middle of my work and I had to go and pick it up from work, so I thought I'd try this out and it was not a good purchase. When I got it, it did not connect and my internet didn't work. I was wondering if maybe it was my internet or if maybe the connection was bad, but after I started going through the steps again and again, it started working properly. But I can't say anything bad about it, I would not use this product again.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from poor quality i bought this product to replace my old one and it lasted less then a month after a month and a half of use the screen was falling off it was very easy to install. if anyone has the same issue you can return it and the company will help you  Customer service I bought a replacement battery and it had some very large gaps in the plastic that make it seem like it is loose but that is an easy fix. . ,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! This is my first experience with an electronics device and I cannot say I am impressed. First of all, it does not have the "fuzzy" sound and is "drier" sounding that I heard online. I would much rather listen to the other speakers with these features. Second, the sound quality is a joke, it's horrible to the point I can't believe I bought it. I tried for about an hour to get to an area in my house that the speaker was at and I got nothing out of it. The speaker is so bad it is almost annoying. I have a great set of subwoofer that I use with these speakers and it just makes my system sound so bad I had to listen to my stereo while using this one. Very very very bad for the price. It's going to end up on my scrap pile.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: fobreel

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! This item is a disappointment. There are two problems, 1. The connector to connect the USB to the phone is too short and weak. 2. It does not work well. It keeps breaking while I am trying to make phone calls. I have used other USB cable with similar performance and it does not break. I do not have this type of phone but I would be glad to have this device. It's a waste of money.  Rated 1 out of 5 by James from Bad Plug Connector This is the second time I have had to return an item I bought. The first was the battery charger for my Samsung S7 and S7 Edge. In the time it takes to describe this item, I will show you the problem with the USB connector. It is too weak to hold the cable in place. It easily breaks off and falls out and that is if you have a thick cable.  "Rated" Review:    I do like it and the "Rated 5 star" for the quality is not warranted. I recommend using the standard USB 2.0 type cord instead for a more secure connection. (from the store and not this website). I am returning this item because the "Standard USB 2 M.A.C." has more than enough power to power my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and not the Note 6 or Note 7 with their fancy new "dual-sim" phone technology. Also the "2 USB 2M.A.'s" charge at more than 2A which is why my Samsung Note 5 battery is nearly empty. This phone needs more than a 2 USB 2 A's. In the 2 months I've had this phone I've lost a few devices to dropping them on my hard floor while taking pictures, but I don't care. I can't return this to the store because Samsung has ruined this device by sending it back so quickly. Posted by Steve on December 23, 2016

This unit worked well and he has been using it ever since I got it. I am extremely impressed with the battery life, but he is getting a lot of use out of it already.

The instructions that came with the unit are also rather confusing and should have come with the purchase, not the one I bought. It would have saved me time and money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The design of this product is a horrible shame. I was in the middle of installing the printer when the device suddenly froze up. It had lost the power, was no longer responding and refused to power up. After several attempts to try and recover from the freeze, I decided to return it and get a new one, as I knew it was the same. The new printer had a longer power cable and a more reliable control pad to get the printer back on. The only reason for having purchased this product was to make a nice presentation to my boss who works at an IT department and to show off to his co-workers, as they were very impressed with it. I did not have any issues with the quality, but I wish it had come with the power cord or the cable as I would have been able to connect it to my computer with my printer.

Yes No Tuesday, October 13, 2011  Good value   by Charles from North Hollywood CA USA ,  Overall: I'm a casual music listener. I own a Macbook Pro running the Mountain Lion operating system and recently discovered the ability to play digital music on my Sony headphones over Bluetooth. Since I've already had Bluetooth playback working with my Apple headphones, it's not a big deal to just buy an external drive and have it work in a similar fashion. I was a little nervous about the internal drive. My first impression was that it would not be very durable, but the internal and external drives have the exact same capacity. The only difference is that the internal one is a 1TB drive, while the external one is only 1TB. However, the drive is small enough, and the internal has no problems with the hard drive failing due to over storage or any other type of problem. The external drive is well built and easy to use. It's a great buy.  the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had to do some research before I finally decided to purchase the external drive. The seller on the website does not do good communication, and when I contacted him to ask him some questions, I was left hanging. The product arrived in a very short period of time, but there was a mixup in shipping

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The bad battery is a pain to deal with, especially since the charger is made to work with different batteries, and I need to charge from the laptop to my phone.   One issue was I plugged in the phone to charge on my laptop, but the battery would not charge. I was able to plug the charger in the opposite way and the phone charged to full. The next day I tried again with the opposite direction, and it charged just fine. So, I have to guess that the battery is not being charged properly or is somehow not good enough. I guess there is a limit to the charging circuit. I should have charged to 100% on the first attempt.

(Posted on 6/23/2014)  My new best friend It's been 3 months of using the Nokia EOS 5, and I'm so impressed. After all the fuss over the EOS 6, I was actually very surprised at how the 5 just works better. It's not as fast as the 6, but it works better and more smoothly. It has almost all the features you can ask for, including the camera and mic, great speakerphone, nice touch screen, and the only complaint that I have is that the camera is so much more of a hassle to use than my other phones. It would be much easier to just put a camera on it, I suppose, but I find the phone so easy to use I just want to do things I've done before. -H  (Posted on 5/31/2014, 7:43 am)  in response to: Nokia Eos 5 review The new Nokia E OS 5 is the best in the category. It really does a very good job as an all-round phone. It handles the basics well, but does so at a speed which is exceptional for this size of a phone. I have the 8gb model, and have used it every day for a year now, so my opinion is solid, and if you are considering this phone, just buy it. (Posted by: John in USA)  the best phone ever, for the price! this is the ultimate phone for the money. I own the iphone and the Nokia 5. This phone is so freaking good, its amazing, and its really light weight. The best phone you can buy for
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm in the market for a new mp3 player and found this product at walmart. The box that this thing came in was in bad condition with the outer wrap peeling and the actual product inside not being that great. I don't see myself replacing this item and I was only looking to get a cheap mp3 for my phone but after reading some of the reviews and not being very impressed with the quality of this product I threw it away. I guess I'll try some of these products online and see what happens.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------- When I bought this phone, I was excited to see what a high quality phone it was. It was supposed to be very durable, which it was, but I didn't expect to have to replace it every few months due to the battery. The battery would start smoking after about 4 months. It took me over a week and a half of trying to find a replacement battery until I found this one at a local store. However, after charging it with this battery for about 4 hours, the phone starts smoking again! I finally got a replacement after about a month. I guess I'll have to stick with my older phones.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had it for a month now, and its been running great, but recently its gotten a bad bit of wire that is loose in the cable, and i can't tighten the damn thing because it won't go in the connector, the other side that the power wire goes into is also the opposite side of the same one, if you have to use the connectors in that side its too much trouble, so i will be getting a new one, i bought mine on amazon for $30 dollars
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased a Bose QuietComfort 25 for my daughter because she had a headache so bad she couldn't get up from her bed. The earphone worked great, except the sound never stopped. Every time she went to sleep she would start to cough, and when she woke up it would be gone. Now, this is a pretty expensive headphone so I'm not saying this as a bad thing. However, the earphone isn't made to be put in your ears. It doesn't make any sense. I tried putting it on and off, but it always goes back to sleep if I do it that way. You have to put it on/off constantly so it's not even that bad. Not sure if I'll be returning this one because I paid $100. I wouldn't recommend this to my friends.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Quiet Comfort 25 Great sound and great sound quality! Love the earphones and the price was so good.  and the best thing is this earphone is on sale for $99 on amazon and the next day the price had dropped to $79.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ************************ I had a very poor experience with this phone. I bought this phone when it was on sale. It worked for less then an hour and a half. I turned it off and tried to turn it back on and the battery was dead. I was like "what the hell". The phone had very little battery life. It would die after only 15 minutes of being on. I tried a different phone from a different store. They said it was just the battery. So I decided to just return it and not spend a lot of money on a defective phone. So about 10 days later when I started buying again, I found this phone at a different local store. I told them I was returning it because I wanted to see what it would be like. I went and bought this one and I am glad I did. This is a better phone than the other one and it will last much longer than that other one. I love my Moto G and it was definitely a good investment. I am really glad I bought it and will be coming back here for all my phone needs. ******************************
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So much to complain about! I was not happy with my Sony VCR until I read about the HD-VP12. It was only about $20 less than the VCR and all the other features that I wanted. I am so happy with this HD-VCR that I have been using it for over 5 years now. I have a new set up and am planning on getting a digital video recorder for my new computer. This unit is great in that it can store a huge amount of information on one large SD-card. It even comes with a USB cable. It's the only one that comes with the HDMI adapter! This is the first digital video product that I bought and I'm very happy with it. I wish that they had made it a little bit bigger and it had the ability to hold some of the other media. But, all in all I can't fault it for the features that it has. So please, for the cost it's a great product that will serve you well for a long time to come!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! It is just a piece of junk!!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, February 05, 2017  Great Product  by Brian from Portland OR USA  Pros: Works great!  Cons: No USB port.  Review: This is an inexpensive and easy way to connect your cell phone and keep it there while charging at the same time. My only real complaint is that it only comes with one USB port and that's all. The included USB cable is not included either.   I used it to hook my phone to my computer to charge while working. You have to be careful that it isn't plugged into a USB port with a "host" machine plugged into it.     The only thing I'd change is to have some sort of indicator that lets you know when the device has enough battery power to last until the next time you plug it into a machine.  the device itself is great and does the job. The only negative thing is the lack of a USB Port.  on the plus side it works great and makes it easier to stay connected to my phone.  to me it works like an extension cord so you can stay in touch with friends and family. ,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had two of these so far and they both fail every single time. i replaced the batteries and this is the result. after the first time my screen died completely. i tried to reattach it and it didn't work. after all the other issues i've had with this company its just time to go with the "big boys"  " This is an awesome item. I bought it to replace a broken iPad. The only problem with this item is the battery, it's a good battery, but the connection between it and the screen is not really solid. It is a little tricky to re-wire without breaking the battery. But other than that its pretty awesome. Its a great price for what you get. I just wish they'd make a stand for it. I wish they made a stand! I have no idea why you couldn't just sell it a few feet from the charging base, but I guess you got what you paid for.

I bought two and have never had a problem. My phone is very sensitive to my voice. I am very happy with this product.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, December 18, 2010  This works great  by A Customer from West Bloomfield MI USA  Review: Very easy to use and very reliable. The sound quality is perfect for using with my cell phone.  the only thing I dislike is that the button to change modes is located in the bottom right corner, not the top one.  on top of that, the directions are confusing. The main screen says you turn off the phone, turn it on, turn off and turn on. I just wanted to be able to press the buttons with one hand. the instructions say "just" press the button, it says "press the button and wait a moment."

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone 4. It worked fine for me until i accidentally installed a virus onto my phone. the phone would not boot or would shut off randomly and the phone came to a dead battery. So i have called apple and they will send a new one to me for free if i send it back. ive had my phone for a year now so i dont want to risk it by putting a virus on it. iphones are just junk if you want to get a nice phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:............................................  This was my first electronic device I have ever purchased. I love it, and its easy to install. However, the sound is not very loud, and the buttons are all very small. I do not understand why there are no audio controls on the device, so I can adjust it for my ears. The buttons are easily accessible, and they don't interfere with the use of my other electronic devices. Also, the instructions are very simple, but need to be updated as the unit was manufactured in 2011, and newer units require some knowledge of electronics. This will make your life a bit more difficult.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A few months back, I purchased a $300   3D Printer   The printer   I was very disappointed   As   Soon as   Assembly   began   failure of   Power   connectors   And   software   is very poor   It took me over two hours   to assemble the printer  and   that   was before the   LCD   arrived   After   all   parts   were   attached to the      printer . I am not sure why   but I wanted to give up   when the   3D printer  came   into   my hands   it   worked   and it    printed   on    my   desk. I   will   not   buy   the  printer for   this   price   any more   if   someone does   something. This   does not    deserve   an   extremely   low   rating    Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Excellent machine, I've owned several others, the reason I bought this is that I had to buy a new one due to a broken motor and the parts were so expensive and hard to come by, I have yet to have any problem with it, the main reason I'm giving this 5 stars is that the case is pretty cool, I love the light blue of the case and the silver screws, it is very sturdy and I love that I can get my printer out of the box in no time at all, I recommend this to everyone I know.  2 out of 2 found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for a friend who wants to play with a Nintendo Switch for an Xbox One controller. It works great, but the cable that came with it was too short for him, so I had to return it and get an extra cable to make up the difference. I'm not sure if I got the right cable. Also, the color is way off and it looks like they used some cheap plastic parts. I've read good reviews but this is not one of them. Overall, this is a decent product but not worth the extra cost.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  this one had a terrible time when I was in the air.  It would not hold the battery charge, and the power button would not work.   I had to hold down the power for a while.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have owned this electronic cigarette for a few weeks now and I have to say that I am very disappointed in the product. The first problem I had was getting the coil to work. The product does have a good coil design, however the problem is that I had to remove the 510 connection in order to get it to work again. I also had to replace the 510 connector because it leaked. In addition to that, it leaks quite a bit, especially when the battery is low. After the first few weeks of use, I had a very difficult time getting the cartridge to start. The battery works great, however, the cartridge is not very easy to get started. I have also had difficulty with keeping the batteries in the cartridge. I did not realize the batteries inside the cartridges were not removable. If it wasn't for the cartridge leaking, I would be a happy customer, but unfortunately, I will be returning this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________________________________________________ A friend bought this gadget in a local store. It works very well, but I found that it does not work well with other gadgets. My iPhone 6 worked so well with my iPhone 5 that I had to buy two devices to use with the iPhone. It does not have enough volume for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. I tried several different volumes on the device to make it work, but it just made the sound muffled. I don't understand why the volume levels were not as high as it could have been, and the speaker doesn't work well either. I hope they fix these issues. This is my third iPhone. I already own a 7 and a 5. If they ever make this thing work, I will gladly pay a little extra to add another iPhone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jjm from Amazing gadget! It is very fast and easy to set up. I am happy I purchased it  Good product I have one and it works great!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this monitor on a whim, I was very excited, had the monitor for a couple of days before it quit working. Had to return it and buy a new one. I had it for a month before it started acting up again and the second time it quit. I returned it again. After several tries with this monitor, it just doesn't work for me. The sound is horrible and the video is grainy and low resolution. The only reason I bought it is that I don't have a lot of room on my computer for other monitors and this is a great deal, if you don't need a 16 monitor or more, don't buy it. You will be disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! I bought this because of the good reviews but the poor support I received with my replacement unit makes this purchase a waste of money. After a week of the unit working well it was replaced by my local Radio Shack with no problem. When I got my new one in the mail the same day it was to be my last unit. When the dealer emailed me to update the serial number, he emailed back and said he forgot. I tried calling the local Radio shack store and they said they were going to call the supplier and would come out. Instead, they called me again and said they could not order a new unit and would call the dealer again. I called the supplier again. This time I called to talk to a manager. He told me they had sent me a new one after all and I would get a letter in the next week. That was a week ago. Now I still have not heard from the Radio Shack dealer and the unit is in storage in my garage. I'm so upset that I spent money on this great product that is now so unusable.

When I purchased the monitor, I found that one of the screws that hold the screen on broke and the other one was loose, so I purchased a screen protector as well as a new screws to replace the ones that were missing. The screen protector works wonderfully and covers the bottom of the screen, but I purchased it anyway because I thought there would be some sort of a problem if I didn't. By buying a screen protector, I saved myself about $20.00 and I'm a happy camper!  Did you find this helpful? 1 of 1 users found the below review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this device for about 2 months now and it is a complete disappointment. It is the most worthless piece of crap you can own.   The design is the only thing that saved this product for me and I will admit that I was a little skeptical about buying this device but it is now my main computer.  This is the one of the first gadgets i got and it has been a disappointment. The USB hub is the worst part of it and the screen is so bad that you can hardly read it at all. The only saving grace of it is the keyboard and mouse are ok but I feel like they just need to do a better job on the touch pad.  I don't like to say this but for a $60 device it just really doesn't have that much to offer. I'm going to try and find a second hand one that is actually functional if I can't get rid of this useless piece of garbage.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone 3s   In the last month I have owned these phones and they seem fine, I have to change the battery once or twice a week to keep them working, I'm very happy with them I just don't like them as they have the best of both worlds: The price and size. The camera quality seems good as the picture is very clear. But I really like my iPhone 5 which is much better at taking good pictures, and it's much more cost effective, if you do not really like phones, I would strongly recommend this phone because they will last a lot longer and it doesn't feel like you are carrying a heavy thing.   Pros:  good camera  great camera phone  pretty phone  "small" Cons:  of course   Overall rating:  not good   I just got one of these phones for my husband and I thought it was great, we use it on the subway and around the house, it is very compact but I have some concerns with it. 1. The battery lasts only 2 years and I really can't think of a situation that it will be useful. 2. The micro USB cable is kind of annoying and not worth the money. 3. The build quality is kind too cheap, some of the components just seem very cheaply made. The only other complaints I have are that the screen is hard to read, it doesn`t seem to get warm or warm to the touch after use and the charger does not last a very long time but that has nothing to do with it having problems. I have 2 other cell phones and all of them last more than 2 years. I am really looking forward to the iPhone 6.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I bought this thing, I was very excited because my old one broke when I plugged in the wall charger. I didn't want to pay $100 for a replacement, so I tried to install this from the factory. When I plugged it in, the display was not working and the screen came down on the screen. I did not have the charger with me so I returned it, and got the charger at the dealer for $30. After installation, I started to get some sort of buzzing noise from the unit and I noticed a "click" noise every once in a while. I have not had to use the unit for quite a while now, so i did not put it on charge and it died. I was thinking about returning it, but decided to try and fix it myself because I want to be able to use my unit on my 3DS. I figured this would cost me about $40 in parts because I bought a "cheap" power supply, but there are no instructions or pictures to tell you how to do it. After reading up on other people's problems, I figured I could use some old circuit boards that my DS3 has and solder together the pieces. I used a pair of solder wicks and got it together very fast. I found that I could get it to work on my DS for like an hour or so with battery power, but after charging the battery it only lasted for about 10 minutes, and after charging it for a while it started buzzing more and more. I returned the unit, and went with my DS and tried the new one and now I don't know if I'll get it working or not because I don the battery is gone! I'm very disappointed in this purchase and I am considering going back to my DS. I don a little bit for the money and got a lot for the time. But I think the unit should have a warranty.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this mouse for about a year and it is horrible. I would rate it below one star and then would say its awful but that would mean that it needs to be fixed. Its only worth buying to use on a small laptop. I have an HP ZBook. I love the HP Zbook and i dont like having to use this. I think that i may replace it as i want to use a laptop that is better and have more power and better input devices. It has a lot of flaws. The mouse is way to small to click on a lot. I get better performance by a mouse that is way larger. The scroll wheel is a bit too wide. The dpi is way too small. The tracking on this mouse is terrible. The mice sensor is not very good but it does work well enough for the most part. It works better than the mouse that i use. I use a mice that is much more advanced than this mouse and it does not work well. Its also very hard to use with Windows 7. I can get great performance with other mice.

Review of DJI Inspire 1 - Introduction and Specs - by Eric on September 20, 2014 :  I'm a big fan of the DJI Phantom series and the new Inspire 2 has been one of my favorite purchases of all time. I'm really looking forward to my review and am very excited for it. Here is my review!  Key Specs:  Product Name: DJI Intelligent Flight Battery (IFLB)  DJI Intelligent flight battery (I.FLB): 1-1630mAh (13.5v) , 1-1700mAh (14.4v), 1-1900mAh (16.8v) - 13.5V (15.2V, 14.8V)  The battery is very convenient to carry around because it's very thin and compact. I would recommend the battery for any DJI drone because of the quality and price point  1. The included charger has a lot of power and the battery can be charged from any USB port on your PC  2. The batteries can be cycled on and off via the included transmitter  3. IFLB has a charging light that flashes to alert you of the charging process  4. The IFLBs are not compatible with the Phantom 3 Standard because of it's lower power (14mah compared to DJI's 12mah)  " DJI Mavic Pro" & " DJ I3/4"  The DJI I3, I4, and Inspire series are pretty much all interchangeable and interchangeable DJI can make almost any drone look just like any other with interchangeable parts, and you can make it almost as durable as any other drone  Here's a photo of the interchangeable battery pack:   Here are the different parts for a Phantom 4 Pro and I2S drone. The Phantom 4 is about $1500, and the I2s are about $1200.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used this for a few months, but the phone stopped working, just when I wanted to use it to call my mother who lives in NY.   I called and said the phone is a bit noisy and I don't hear what people are saying, and the woman that answered said they are trying to figure it out.   the next day, I got an email saying they would send it to my house. They called again, and after about 15 minutes of talking, they said they found that a part is bad on the bottom of the phone, and they would not send it out until I went to a repair store to get it fixed.   The guy said they have to send it back to the store so they could charge me $45 to send me a new part. That was after I told him that I had used it and it wasn't noisy, and that he should fix the problem instead of sending me out the money to fix it.  ,   The thing is, I am not a "smart" phone user. I don`t use the smart phone app or anything, I do my communication with people who use the computer. This is a very basic electronic device, and it does not work that well. It does, however, have a very good battery life. I will still use it, but I wouldn`t bother paying extra for it just to be able to use that feature in the future.

I purchased this device a month ago and now I can't get it to turn off because it always turns on even though I told it to shut off after 3 seconds. Also, when I am away from home it will show the wrong power level. Last edited by rpaull; 08-03-2013 at 11:32 AM..
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used this product for over a year and I am sad to say that it has stopped working after an hour with the same problem. When it works it is a good product. However this one keeps on breaking. The reason that it doesn't work is because my usb port has a crack in it and the cable that I was given breaks easily. I tried all possible means to get it fixed but all to no avail. It is now the same as the one that i had before. There is no other alternative than a new one.  Product Rating: 4 out of 5-stars.  a small and simple solution to many a problem. .  at first i used this to play music on my iPod (which has a problem with the USB port) and it worked like a charm. however i decided to look for another solution, and this one was the winner. if you are just looking for music, i suggest you look elsewhere but if you want to get rid of your bad phone charger and not have to spend a lot of money on new batteries, this is a perfect solution. We are also very sorry to hear that it did not work for you. We are constantly looking at new and better solutions, and we are working on some new products as well.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- this is a bad device --------------- The usb cable that came with it i thought was the one that came from the ios tv but it is actually a newer model. the problem is the video quality is very bad and the video signal quality can get a lot worse if you get it on a bad usb hub. i would not recommend this device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!    I love it, but the charger for my phone will not hold the voltage for more than a few minutes before its too low.  I tried to use the chargers of my two devices (the same phone) for a little more than an hour without any luck.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to use at work for my son's hearing aids. I purchased the battery charger because it was the only one on the market that was made to take the 5v input from the hearing aids and allow the hearing aid to work normally. After one week it broke. The battery charger and the unit itself were very cheap and made no sense for the price. If it broke after one week, why would you not replace it immediately. The thing is so flimsy, I could not even use it for the hearing devices.   This is a very good product, but not worth $30.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------- I just got a new tablet. The new model works well. -------------- This is a great tablet, if you buy this, you should do your homework so you can purchase a real one. --------------- Great app, but the new Android version doesn't have any support for bluetooth headsets. ------------ It is a little hard to download stuff. ------------------------ The new tablet doesn't play some of my audio files, not sure what the problem is. ------------- Works fine for me, but you should also check out the other apps in the Marketplace. --------------------------------- If you do not know anything about the device, buy it and find out what you want to use it for. I got a good one for about the same price as my old one did and it works fine for everything that I used it for and still works well today.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good Buy I don't know much about tablets, so my purchase was a surprise. For the first week I just did some basic online research on tablets to determine what kind I was looking for. After using it for about a week, I am impressed. My main use is reading emails from work. When I read them on my home computer they are very easy to read with the E-ink screen, and then I read on the tablet. When reading on the desktop screen, I just click the back button to go back and read in the same page. My only complaint is the power button on the top. My tablet has been in my bag with my iPhone in the pocket for the last few days, so I don' t know if it can be used with the iPhone. I just wish that the tablet would have an SD card slot so I can add some music files and movies. I'm happy with the purchase, and I will get more when the price drops.  the display is very nice and easy to navigate. its very easy for me to use and with the screen size it really is easy to get to things I need quickly.  a little on the small side but I think with all the other features it works perfect for me  5 5 9
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is an electronic device. It is not an audio player. I was using a cheap, no sound portable digital audio player for over a year to watch my son in a local theater. After a while I finally figured out I could use my iPad instead. It works as a video player, but I can't get audio from the player. Maybe there is a problem with my iPod? I've used several digital players over the years and they never worked well with an iPad or my iPod. If this device is as good as it claims, I'd be more than happy to pay $30 for this and have it work. No matter what the problem is, I could buy 3 of these and have great sound and video for less money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I purchased a "Bose QC25" to replace my old Apple earphones. The QC25 headphones are nice, but the cords are too long to use in my MacBook Pro (the other headphones I had on this computer can get used in the other computer). As you can see from the pictures, I was able to use my old earphones (with the cord attached) in the new machine. However, the new headphones have a too-short cord, and I can't use them in this computer because I'm sure the cord will come off the headphones if I bend them in any way. I tried the cord attachment thing on the new earphones and it did not work (it was loose, and came off easily). I'm a bit disappointed with these headphones. They are nice and comfortable, but are too big to use with a laptop. I've looked everywhere, and Amazon is the ONLY place I could find these headphones for the same price or less than $10. I would recommend them to someone else, but not for my MacBook.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------This was a decent first year with this thing...not great, but good. My first experience with this was on a flight to Seattle. The computer was dead in the middle of the trip, but luckily the crew were able to get the computer up and running. The only thing that needed fixing was the flight computer...The other problems with this device was that the screen was always a shade over half an inch too low. The video quality was great, and the batteries lasted almost a year. But if you want to have a good time on the road, this isn't the computer for you. If it is your first computer, I would get a PC.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my children. They love it and we are all really pleased with the purchase. However, it is not possible to reset the device. The device is a hard drive.   In my family we have different computers. I have a Mac computer that is an older model. Our oldest is 8 and the youngest is only 6. The youngest had his last computer when he was 9. We had the most expensive computer at the time. The computer he had was a Mac Pro. The last computer he ever used was a Gateway laptop. We are now going to buy a new laptop for him. The current laptop he is playing on has a hard-drive that can't be changed without completely destroying it.   of course we have tried it. The old Mac was not able to be restored. The Mac Pro was not compatible with the new one. And the Mac Pro is the most costly computer that we ever had.   the only reason that we bought this was because it was cheaper than a new computer. This was the cheapest computer that was available for the same amount of money as we spent for the computer that he had when he had his first computer. I'm sorry but i have no idea how to work around a hard disk on a computer that has a screen. How do I change the hard-disk. How to access the file system on the hard drive that can not be changed?  No one else seemed to be having this problem.  Did anybody else with a macbook touch or other device experience this problem?   Please be informed this is a very popular computer among computer science majors, especially ones in computer engineering.  .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________. The unit is not good at all. You have to push buttons, click buttons, and get this thing to do anything. My husband had no idea I had this thing until I showed him the receipt!  Product Rating: 4.3  Service Rating:  Posted a few years ago  Works great.  Excellent product, but there is a flaw  Worked great until it lost the battery!  the battery is a very bad part, just keep the battery and put the back together. i will not be using it again but that is only a fault with this product. the other reviewers were right on.  (Posted on 4/11/2014)  Nice gadget!  The battery's life is great. It's not bad, but I have had a few of these, and they do not last very long. (Posted On 3/26/2014 )  Worth It  I got the device to replace my old one. I liked it so much I bought another. I'm very satisfied with my purchase, great features, great price. (It's a bit pricey for what it is but I think it's well worth it.)  The only complaint I have is the battery. My original one had a bad cell, so I replaced that with a new one. The battery I bought is the same battery I replaced the one with a few weeks ago. I have not used the second one yet, but from reading reviews, it doesn't look like it's doing anything right. :-(  (Posted On 1/23/2014. Last updated: 12/30/2014.)  the problem i am having is when i am plugging in the item,it gets stuck. and if i try to push it down, it will not stay in place.  the part that i am replacing has not been used yet  and the part my old unit has is the one that is still working. i need the item that is the exact same as the one I am replacing.  of course the item I am replacement for should be exactly the same. (But I think the new one is not because it doesn\'t look like the old one anymore.)  I\'m so frustrated, i think that this product is just a good for novelty but not for a true use, and the batteries don't last long at all.(Posted On 12/29/2013.)  to
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a ps4 for a while now and had the issue of getting the ps4 hard drive working properly. ive heard other peoples problems so i decided to get one of the cheap ones.  the ps5 was even cheaper and still had issues with the ps1 hard drive and ps4 games. i will try to use my ps4 all the time so this wasnt a big deal for me. the first night i plugged it in it was the first time and i was surprised how well it played games.  then one day the ps3 wasnt working and i wanted to find out what was going on so i plugged in my ps5 and it was working perfectly. so so far this is the best cheap ps5 ive found. i am very satisfied.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _______________________________________________________________________________ This was not my first e-cigarette (I have purchased many, many others), and my first experience with an e-cig was a major disappointment. After trying it, I felt like a complete idiot and should have known better. I bought this to replace my older device that was in a garage, and this one is almost the same size. This one is not as well designed or durable, it has a plastic body, and does not have a battery. There is also no light, and the e-liquid has a very unpleasant smell that is not pleasant to the other people that use this product (this happens more often with other electronic cigarettes I've purchased). I don't know if I will keep buying this item, but there are other alternatives that I am very satisfied with.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      I purchased the Sony XB650F for the money spent. I was hoping this would be an upgrade to my sony XB700. The XB750 is great, but it's just too big and heavy. The camera is better than the sony's, but still big. I use a Sony XC100 for my video recording needs, and it's way more light and easy to transport. The only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 is because the battery life was horrible with it on high speed. I thought I was getting a better camera than the one sony offers. I also expected the camera to charge quicker. I would say after about 4 hours, I had to plug it in to charge the battery. Not a huge deal, but I wish the camera would do it's job for me and charge faster.   There are no good things about this camera. It's just way too big, heavy and hard to lug around. There are better cameras out there for the price. I'm giving this a 2 star.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is great, i bought it as a present for my son and his friends for christmas, it worked great as intended it was the first thing i got when i got home from work, I have a bad memory of using computers as a kid, it was my dad's phone and he was never one for computers and he used a computer for a small amount of the time and just kept it in his desk drawer and in a corner for most of the rest of the day, i remember playing games with my friends at school and my brothers playing with the game and making up stupid stories to do with the things they saw. this thing works perfect and does everything i need it to do, you cannot fault the hardware or the firmware, i have it running windows 7 on it, my son had his old Xbox one for some time now and it was always broken when he got it so he got his father one as a gift and it works great! it was easy to set up and when it comes time to use it, it just works, you can get in the game, you are connected to the internet and it plays games like a champ. the only problem i have with this is that the software for it sometimes takes a little while to install, sometimes you can barely even get the game to launch, but thats what you get when you get a gift from an old friend, its a shame they did this to it but they made this a special device for me and it has done me very well, i got it for Christmas as a Christmas present and it still works perfect the next day i use it to make an album and have the kids play it to keep my brain going, the best part is that i can go into my computer and put in a disk and it takes it right to my computer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been buying this for years now but there always seems to be a flaw with this particular model. its very fragile, has a short battery life, and the usb port is terrible. i always end up running my own cable to the computer and the phone and have to do everything with my own two hands. the keyboard on this one is terrible too. it does not have any sort of anti-ghosting function so typing on this thing is horrible. the mouse is fine but the joysticks on this unit are a little annoying. and i am really not a gamer so i would not recommend this as an all day mouse. i also feel the usb ports are more of an annoyance than anything. i really need a keyboard that has anti ghosting and a built in usb port. you get what you pay for with these and you cant go wrong.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jt_man from It was good for my needs for a month. Used it with a laptop and the mouse worked well. Used to use a keyboard to play with a keyboard. Bought a laptop for my other PC. Works with that now. The power supply for this unit is great. It doesn't take much juice to power this up. But it is noisy and I had to replace it after a month so it could be used more regularly. If you don't need the mouse, this may be for you. It works well for what I needed, but it could have been better.    Rated 1 out of5 by David from Didn't work as intended. This is my third one. All had the same problem. Keyboard would not turn on, no response. Mouse would not work. And the battery wasn't very long, meaning it would die very quickly. So far, this is the worst unit I have purchased.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ***************************** This is my second (and last) Apple keyboard. First one died within 24 hours after being on a plane. The other one was purchased new and it broke after three weeks. This one is a disaster. You have to put your computer and its case on the keyboard to use it. So you either go with a wireless keyboard, or buy one of those cheap keyboard that plugs into a computer case. If you buy one like that, then be sure you buy a usb adapter for your computer. I have to buy another one of these keyboard to plug into my computer case when I get back. You may want to read the other negative review on this one. It has been a total disaster since it came out. It was designed to be a basic keyboard that plugged into the computer. You could get something like this one at Walmart, Target, etc. for half the price of this one, but it is still terrible. Buy a better keyboard if you want to use your computer with it, because this one will cause your computer to crash after 30 minutes of use.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this unit for about a month now. i bought it to replace a cheap old one i had. when i got it out of the box i was really disappointed that there was nothing on the device to get me started with it. so i got the tutorial to turn it on and when i tried to install it it told me that its not installed correctly. its on the bottom of the door. i took it to a local repair shop and they said that i should be able to get it back to the door in no time. i gave it back and returned it to the store and told them to charge me for the time i was there. the guy told me i should have been there earlier when the owner came in and asked him about the issue. he then said that they would be replacing it for free. so now i have to have the guy come out and install the new one for me. i have heard of many online reviews where people said its a piece of junk. i think the reason this thing is bad is because it is new. the owners manual says to use it. but i don't think that is always good advice. it will save your butt many times and be more fun if you like playing games. you could probably put the money into a better video game system. but if you want a simple to use console that costs less than a new video game player then this is a good option. ive heard great things about this company from other owners of their models. i might buy another one in the future because it worked out great for me... just wish it had a little more power and maybe a little bit more storage space..

I cant watch TV. I have the tv set on mute. i can watch movies and tv shows but i can't watch TV at all. I cannot watch my movies on it. Its been 2 weeks now and the sound is so low. I've been trying to turn it on and off a million times. The TV is so bad i think i may have to get a new tv but this thing is soooo much worse than the tv i had before. I can't use it at all on a plane as i can hear my speakers. I'll probably switch to the lg soon, maybe this one will be better.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been trying to figure out how to get this to work as well as the other three I bought from my favorite electronic store. I've never gotten my laptop's to work with my TV until now. Now, I've got a very nice LCD TV and have the ability to watch my laptop screen. I'm hoping it works just as well for watching a movie as it does for playing my computer games! The good:    It does work.  I don't have the perfect picture, but it's very clear.  You can even see the pixels if you look close enough.  The buttons are not the most responsive, but they work just fine.   I'm not a fan of the case (the only reason I got the one that came with it was that it was cheaper), but it does do its job.  And it doesn't really seem to be that hot. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a nice little unit, but the volume on my phone is horrible when I want to listen to music. Not sure why. It is hard to hear and not in stereo like it should be.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Steve from Not as pictured. The unit comes with the screen on, but it only comes up to volume 5 or so, so I had to get a screwdriver and open the top panel to access the volume setting. Then I had a small problem. When I connected to it I saw that there was a line in the input that was broken. When you listen on the unit, the noise is too loud. If it had been as pictured it would be an ok product.  that was my only complaint.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a great idea, however I could not use it due to its small screen and terrible performance. I was looking for a product to use for a game controller and I really like the fact that this does not require a wall mount, just plug it into my TV and it is all set up to go. However, it is so small that when you need to read a message on it to play a game, it becomes unreadable and is a pain to read. Also it is really heavy and not rechargeable. It is also expensive compared to some other similar products.  Was this review helpful to you?

My 3G is running great but it cannot connect to WiFi in a hotel and I can't get it to download any apps.   Product Rating: 5 out of 5-stars.  Review ID: 1710  Reviewed: 2015-08-19 By:Family pet. Dan Blevins From WA   Bred in England. Hunts. Family pet.  (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)   The first thing that I noticed with this was that it was extremely heavy and I had to make sure that it wouldn't get me in trouble. The new iPad Air is a bit more portable and easy to handle, but this is still very heavy and cumbersome to have to carry around.   the battery lasts a while but not as long as I thought it would. I've taken it out of the house several times since receiving it and had to power it down before I went to sleep at night. I wish that the battery life was longer than 3 weeks but I can live with it for now.   to replace the batteries, the original iPad battery can be purchased at most any Walmart. the only thing that could have been improved is the way that it is put into the unit. I would recommend that a tool that can be used to pull the old battery out be added.     Overall I'm very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend this to anyone that is considering upgrading from the current models.   is the only one I can recommend. I can say that I am very happy with my new tablet and it's performance in the kitchen, at work, and at home.   I am impressed and very happy!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this for Christmas and I have been using it since then. I have an older Motorola Droid. The battery life is great but that's only for 10 minutes. Then the phone goes dead. This works on my Droid and the Motorola SGH-T999. I used it yesterday and it charged my Droid. I bought another one to use and it also charged my SGH. This has not been so good for my Droid because it keeps the phone from recharging for long periods of time. The Motorola SDR doesn't go dead with the USB port unplugged. I am a computer geek and was hoping to use my computer to stream music to the phone instead of my Droid, but it is not very well built and will require additional components to work properly. The Best Value I've Ever Found...The Bottom Line:    The G2S2 USB USB dongle can be a lifesaver for anyone who has a smartphone that needs more juice than the battery provides. You can use it to charge an extra battery or recharge a dead one, and it can also be used to hook a wireless keyboard, mouse, or USB headset directly into a device. It's a little bulky, but the price is good, the product works, and the quality is excellent.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is like a broken down car. I have had this device for over a year now and it constantly keeps failing. The only good thing about this device is that it works great on the computer. It is very slow on the other devices that I've tried. I will continue to purchase this device until it fails on me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using this laptop since early 2011, and had no issues with it whatsoever. but now it's starting to give me problems that it wasnt before. first i ran out of charge on my usb slot and i was unable to boot my machine. now after unplugging my usb cord i was able to run it but i was not able to turn on and off, so i had to use the keyboard to turn it on and i had the computer on the first boot i booted. later after uninstalling all the software on my machine it was starting to show the usb cord in my computer, so then i unplugged my usb cords and started to reinstall the software again, and it worked again, i am sure its just an issue with my computer that i didnt want to fix. so i cant recommend this product at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ________________________________________ _______________  My first e-cigarette was a Kanger Protank II and it had no problem but this new version (which is actually cheaper) has the same problems. 1. Battery life is terrible. After the 20 hour battery life, it still doesn't last more than a few hours. 2. It's difficult to get to the bottom of the tank or even the tank itself because it is made in a strange manner. 3. The bottom of my tank is too small so my liquid can't flow into it. 4. It has to be screwed in to a glass tank which is a pain in the ass.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this product for a year, and i had no problems with it until today, when my wife called my cell phone. We both saw the red light in the device, she asked me to turn it off, and im sure i saw it but it was still on, so i turned it off to find it running very loud, and a loud buzzing, this problem lasted for about 5-10 min, then it went to sleep. The next day, I woke up to the same thing as my wife did. This product is the worst i have ever used, i would never use it again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had a problem with this phone. The phone is supposed to work well for a month and after about a month the screen would go crazy. I turned it off and on and tried different things, but after a month it would work but when I went to use the phone the screen was all red. I put it back on and it worked fine. The next day the screen went crazy again. I unplugged it from the charger and plugged it in to turn it off again. It kept going and went off, then the screen just went red and off again, and the next day it worked, but again, the screen kept going off. I've tried all the different methods and nothing has worked for the screen to go off when I plug it in. It has been like 3 weeks now and I'm still stuck with that problem, but I am thinking I could just keep trying and trying until it works for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! After using this product I was not pleased. The power supply is the weak link and the battery is weak as well.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My iPad fell out of its cradle and broke when i picked it up because the cable was cut in two.

I got this for my husband and he loves it but the video on YouTube says it is too big to fit in his iPad which is why i bought it for him. I'm not buying it for myself as I've heard all of the horrible things about it. The only thing i got out of it is the case that it comes in. I didn't know it was supposed to come with one and i have to go buy one myself

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for several months and it has been breaking down almost every month or so, so i have to have a new one every time it is on sale. the only reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the remote is actually pretty decent, it is an i2c wireless one and works well with the controller. there are just some very bad things with it that make it terrible. the touchpad doesn't work at all, the screen goes blank after a few minutes of continuous touch, the buttons are too small, the bluetooth won't work. this one should have been a 5 in the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My iPad Pro  is not very good. I use my iPad as a productivity device. The problem is that I do not have enough apps that have been developed to work well on the iPad. The biggest problem with my iPad is that the battery doesn't last very long. The iPad is also very expensive. So, I can't justify the expense if my iPad will not work well.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- When I bought this, I was really excited to use it as I already own one of those. After installing it, I found that it was a really terrible device, and not a good deal for me. The first thing I noticed was the sound from it. It was horrible, and even after the update to iOS7, the sound was not fixed. The battery was very weak, the micro SD card slot is horrible, the screen was not so great, the camera was also really bad, and the interface was just terrible. And of course, the interface is just not great. The problem with using the iPod touch is, that the app store and the application store are different. So you have to download the app before you can even use it. I had to download everything, then I had problems getting it to work. So now I have a new Apple product, and I can't recommend it. If you want an iPod Touch with a nice screen, this isn't the one. If your looking for an iPod, buy a computer. This iPod Touch is just a step backwards.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I love my ereader and all of the apps it comes with... it is really fast and is so clear to read... however, I bought this to read and listen to music and it is very choppy on these 2 things... I am on the last 3 books of a series (and I only read the beginning)... If this would improve in the future I would give it a five star... but I think my only consolation is that this is my first ereader... I want to buy the Kindle version next and see if I can get it to play music, read aloud... and to be able to read books at a faster speed...  Write a positive review about an excellent electronic device that is hard to find in good condition:!! My ereader is a bit slow. I don't read as fast as I do with my Kindle, but it's fast enough that I don the covers of books. The colors are so vivid and the cover is very easy to read. I have an iPod touch and the eReader has a much higher resolution. If this didn't have a screen that is not made of glass, this would be the e-reader.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for a few years. i have gotten some great deals on it, and had a good experience with it. it was always in good shape and worked perfectly. i got it as a birthday gift a few months ago and it was only 2 days after i recieved it. i used it the next day and it didn't even last 2 days. i bought another one because of how nice it was and was planning to get the perfect one for my son. i went back to that one and it only had a few scratches and dents. i was thinking about returning it but decided to give it another try because i had already spent a couple bucks on my other one. the best part is the price. ive never been happier with a digital timer i have had.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought 3, but not for the main one, i would give this product 4 stars, but i have to admit the one i have isnt very good, i was expecting something of the same quality and with better features than this. the first one i bought was faulty and had to return it to the store, the replacement was also faulty, but still very good at best. the second one is a good product, but the software is pretty poor, i had to get it to update the software and it didn't go quite right and now its stuck on a menu that requires a reboot to finish. ive also had to go into the "downloads" menu every now and then for updates, and every time the update is about to finish i have the same problem, so i will not be using it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! I have been trying for about 2 months now to get my Dell PC to boot up correctly. After some research I found that the Dell boot disc needs to be replaced because its bad. I followed the instructions and waited for about 4 hours but the same thing happens. I even tried unplugging the drive and turning the PC on with the drive plugged in. I finally gave up and had to order a new boot disc from Dell but I still dont know why. I was trying to figure out if I could reset the computer by using the PC diagnostics tools on the computer or a program I have found in another reviews that would do the same job. It doesnt work, but the computer says the PC is working properly. I tried the repair program and it didnt fix it. I have spent over $350.00 so far on this computer and have done everything the manufactures instructions say. It was a total waste of time and money and I am so sad I wasted it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive owned this keyboard for about 2 years now i love it and it has the best keys i have ever used the only problem i have had is the micro usb cable. i had to buy the micro one it was cheaper on ebay but when i bought it it didnt work well i thought the keyboard was dead but it wasnt it it just didnt work it was just a problem with the micro cable so id suggest that u dont buy the mini micro one because its not going to be any problem in the long run because you dont need a computer to use the keyboard u just plug it into your tv and pc to get your programs to work you can even use it on your mac because it has usb built in too but its a little hard to get it to work on a mac i tried using a usb to usb adapter but it didnt help either the keyboard is well built and has the perfect key spacing and size to type at my desk with no movement you get your word with speed and precision it is great I am glad i bought the micro mini one for the money but its just not the best but still great buy  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: bestbuy
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device is quite slow. It is a bit slow to open it for the first time (2 to 3 minutes) and you have to force it open. It also takes much longer for the phone to boot up. After you try it out for a few minutes you will know if it is going to be able to save you from a lot of problems.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first time I've had to order a replacement unit from an online seller for my defective product.  After contacting them, I was told by the technical support that there is no way that I could get a replacement for the item that I am getting, as they would not be able to track down the original manufacturer.    It was said that this is because they cannot find my order in their systems, and that they would send a new one for free.  I really think this has something to do with the fact that the company is owned by the Chinese.  After reading this, I found that the order number that I have is "000849".  I also have a receipt from them.  My order was made over three weeks ago, and I only had a week to return it to them.   I was contacted via email that this was not okay, so that I would have an item number.  They then told me that they don't have that information.  When I asked about it, I got a reply from the contact info that they sent me saying that it would not help me since they could not track the original order, and so they are unable to help me.  This is not the first case I've heard of where the order tracking system is unreliable and they are incapable of helping.  There are other reviews on this website, so I did a search, and found this review on the site that I purchased from.  You can find all the information that I can find at that site, and there were plenty of reviews of other electronic devices that are not working as well.  Hopefully this company will be more reliable in the future.  Overall, this is a very hard to use product. If you are looking for a good electronic device, or want to invest in a good one, but are worried that you may get a poor quality one, then I would suggest you to not get this product. I can't recommend it as I purchased it as a gift for a friend.  Also, if you are a new or current customer, I would like to recommend you to check out the reviews on the product here. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- --------------- Just for the sake of the others who have this device, here is the info on the device I had: ------------- The device is a Sony Ericsson MP-CL1 with Sony Erickson software, so it has a 3.5 inch screen and is running on a CDR-500, which is a CD drive. The device works ok and has the cd-rom option, but you are stuck with the cd roms, which have no sound either, so if you are a fan of the old days with CDs playing, this device is not for you. The software is very poor, and you cannot open any other program on the computer except the camera software. So, if you do not like Sony Ericson's crap software, and the device you purchased is a poor copy, then you will have a bad time. If you are in for the money, and want a cheap CD player with sound, and an in-house CD player that also has the ability to play CDs, then this is a good device. It does not have a ton of features, and I will have to buy a couple of the cheaper Sony Ericnerds and a couple others, as the Sony Ericler is too expensive. Overall, I would not recommend this device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The phone is not as nice as what i was promised it to be. It is way too slow. I can hardly even call for help. I have to press a few buttons before I hear anything. Not sure if it is the battery or the system, but it is very slow. The quality of the phone is great as well. I used to own a phone that was so crappy it still worked. That phone was the HTC Sensation 5.0. It was made by Nokia. It lasted about two years before it died on me. I thought it was the battery but after the battery died, I was really depressed. After I got my phone, I got a Sony Ericsson S-650 which is made by Sony. It worked so well that my phone was running for four years before I went to China to buy a new one. I will definitely use a Sony in the future, as the phone was amazing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this item as a replacement for my previous one that started losing its functionality within 5 months. The new device does not work at all. I called a customer service representative from my bank who gave me advice to return the item. I did so and was charged for a return shipping fee on top of the product. I do not believe that I got any value from the return shipping cost at all, especially with the fact that the device does have an warranty. I have to give this item 1 star because I did give it a try. I believe I was just trying to return a bad item instead of purchasing a new one, but it was not a good experience.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had one of these for about a year and still has the same problem the first time i turn it on they take to long to charge, even if you get one with a larger capacity battery that is less of a problem because i keep my device off the wall while it charges and have to charge it off of battery life alone. my problem has only gotten worse and worse with it still being a year old. I even tried a new charger they give you that is for a newer model of it and it didnt work. not sure if i will be able to deal with this company again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I am very unhappy with this little piece of junk. I bought this as a gift, not expecting it to perform any better than an old CRT monitor. My monitor works perfectly and I am not able to watch any videos or anything with this monitor. It has the screen of a standard monitor. The problem is, after watching the same video on the CRT screen, on this little beast, the image is so grainy, I have to zoom way in. Also, the picture is so poor, that you have to turn the picture mode from 60 to 120 to get it to look good. This is a complete ripoff. This thing sucks! I was very skeptical because of its small size and that it is not an HDMI monitor, but that is just not true. The picture is terrible. I'm going to throw it out!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: *********************** I was so excited about the new Apple iPad because the screen was really pretty, but this thing is a mess and I am very disappointed. It's so slow, so difficult to navigate, and I find all the menus to be very confusing. My iPad is extremely sensitive to the touch and sometimes it just doesn't register where I am touching it. It won't even recognize the iPad on my desk so that is very frustrating. There's also a ton of lag on this thing and you can't hold it. All you can do is drag it around and that causes a ton more lag as well. I had to do a few quick things on the keyboard to get it up and running again. It is so annoying and slow, and the lag is pretty much a dealbreaker. I am going to return it.  Style of Music: ******** I don't know how to describe it. I love anything that has a great sound, and this one does just that. There are no digital distortion like on the other iPod models I've heard. This one seems to have a much deeper bass than the first ones, and it's just really sweet. It just sounds good!  Build Quality: ************ I'm just a newbie, but I'm impressed. I have only used it a couple times, but it's well built, feels sturdy, and works very smoothly. The display is great and bright.  was just a little disappointed, and really didn't like the design of the case at all, but other than that, it works perfectly!  and was just just a tiny little bit of a disappointment. the display is not very bright, and its battery life is also very short. The speakers are not bad at all however, and you could listen to a very good stereo system if you don't mind a small speaker.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive owned two in my life and always thought they were great but this one had all the issues i had with it. the display was very grainy and looked like it was made in the 80's, the camera lens was way out of alignment and i couldn't even get the camera to focus on the subject. the battery lasted 4 days on high battery mode and then gave out. also the screen was very difficult to read when the phone was on. I had to turn off "auto rotation" which was the default on the phone, just to be able to view the screen on the camera, but it didn't even help much. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it was my first electronic device. I think there are better phones and i would gladly buy another and spend twice the amount of money on it. I would recommend this product but be aware of the problems i have with it and be ready to buy another one.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

I am glad to be getting the cheaper keyboard.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: *************************** *********************** ********* **********  I bought this for my father for Christmas in 2005. He got it with all the software included and a battery backup. I have had it for years and it was never really used. It had been used a lot by our dogs to help them with their bladder problems but the batteries ran out. I got it repaired and it works like a charm. My dogs are the most active I have ever seen. I don't see the point in having a small dog run around with a big ball or chasing his toys. I use it for my little girls and it is perfect. I get many compliments from them whenever they see it. Now I am waiting for it to die after all these years of use. I am very upset with the price. I had to go online and look up what battery replacement for it I would need. I found one that lasted 3 years!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device was a total flop. I bought it to replace a device with a different size battery which has a higher capacity. I am having issues with this device. One of the features of this device is that it is always on. This means that I cannot use my computer for anything else other than what this device controls. When I use my phone, I cannot type, type text messages, etc. I can type to check the weather, to read the news, to send text messages and emails. To do anything else, the phone has to be on. Also, when I plug this device in, it shuts off all other functions until the battery is fully charged. I get about 4 hours of power for my phone. If I am using my computer, then I have to plug it in all the time to get any work done, even when I am not using this device, so it drains the battery quite fast. I also noticed that it has very poor battery life. It will not stay on for more than 20-25 minutes. So, for any kind of work that requires more than 10 minutes of use per day, I would not recommend this device to anyone. I had to return it, and now I have a different type of battery that I am planning on getting.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used the product for the first time and I am amazed by the results. It's amazing how easy it is to create a pattern, as well as how easy they are to transfer a pattern into a new style. You can make really awesome patterns with them, as I made one for a dress which is now perfect for my wedding dress. The only downside is that the material it comes in is a lot more scratchy than other products, but I still really love it. I will definitely buy more!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Rene C from Good quality but no software Needed something to use for my sewing machine to cut out patterns. After researching several other patterns and then trying the new Kwik Pla and using my ZX Spectrum, I was able to cut the pattern in a couple of minutes on my Z. I was really impressed with the finished product. The design of the pattern fits very well with my machine and the hardware works well. The fabric is a very light one, so it is very easy to work with, no matter what machine you are using.  The only problem I have with this product is that it doesn't come with any software that can help you make a pattern.  The only thing that I bought is a program that helps me create patterns.  I am a beginner and i would like some help to understand how to use it.  of course i wont buy the actual item as its too pricey but the software is the only thing you need to make patterns that i can use.  to be able to do something that will give me an idea to do for my project.

It is really hard to even get a hold of someone to get them repaired or to replace them.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit is garbage. I am new to this hobby and this piece of junk is the most annoying and useless item I have owned in my entire life. I was very disappointed to find that this thing had a broken button and the buttons do not work. I had to contact the company that made this unit and they said that the device would be shipped back and that I would have to pay for the unit. I bought two of these units, and they both broke and I had no choice but to pay to have one shipped back.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ---------------------------  This is the second set I have purchased and I will not be buying any more. The first one had a dead battery and the second one had to be re-wired in order to get it to work properly. I am sure it is the same problem with this one and I am not going to try to take it apart again since it's the same as the first one.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________________________________________________________________________ 1) Do NOT turn on power while using it. 2) DO NOT plug the phone in while it is charging. 3) DO turn on the phone when you are done using it (and leave it charging) and make sure that the phone is not charging when you turn it off. 4) Do not turn the charger on when it is plugged in. 5) DO not use the charger while you are charging it (when using in the car) or while it was charging. If the charger stops working for some reason while charging (or when it gets full or starts to charge too slow), try plugging the phone back in with a good battery.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from My phone never dies on me I used the battery in my iPhone 6+ for the last 3 months and it has never died on me. I have used it almost everyday. I had a bit of a hard time finding a replacement because I couldn't find one that lasted the amount of time I do. This battery is much smaller, better than my old one and it looks just as good. It was my first time buying a new cell from a store and my satisfaction with the service was excellent. If your not sure if you need this then you need it. I am not a heavy phone user and I use this as much as I can, I am always on the go. If you don't own this and you are thinking of buying one, don't hesitate to buy it. It is well worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was pretty excited about this device when it was released in February. It's been a couple of weeks and I've noticed some pretty significant problems. First off, it's hard to get the volume up when it's sitting on top of my monitor. I can hear my monitor quite clearly and the sound coming from the device is extremely low compared to the volume of the monitor. Then there's the fact that the battery doesn't last quite as long as the other Bluetooth devices. I tried it out for just a couple minutes and had to turn off my computer because it couldn't power on. There's a reason why the other devices lasted longer. That's it for me. I was really looking forward to having a wireless headset for my desktop and now I won't have it. I recommend this device to others, but I won the "not really worth the money" award.  No More Bluetooth! - May 27, 2015 by Andrew I really like this headset, except for one little thing: the battery life. The headset won't last. It is a little hard to hear when it is in my ear, and the speaker is very quiet and low. If I would have purchased this device with the battery, I probably wouldn't have gone through all the trouble of breaking it in, getting the battery and the charger. Overall, I am very pleased with this product, and would recommend it to anyone who would like a wireless earpiece.  for your phone, you can use it as a phone headset with an android. just put it in your ears and plug in your phone. you can also use it on android with the USB cable.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item about a month ago and had it for less than a month when the battery died. The problem was when I switched the device back on it would go into sleep mode. I didn't know what was wrong. I called Genius, the lady I spoke with was polite and was able to give me a solution. The item was recieved with a warranty.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this device for a little over a year. the audio quality is not great and if you like to listen to music then you will like the audio output. it is also loud, i live in a small apartment and the volume is really loud, if you dont have a wall mounted TV you will have to crank the volume, also the volume can be controlled by voice or buttons on the side. the only good thing is the device is very compact which makes it easy to carry with you.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! The battery is a 3s 3200 mah cell. Very good battery.  The charger is not very powerful. I charge a 2S battery to 70%. After that it takes about 10 to 15 minutes to charge.   After the phone is charged, the battery life is great.   is a great gadget. However, the charging circuit is the weak point for me. : It's like I bought two cell phone cases. It has to have a charging power cord that can hold it up to its full capacity. But, if you charge to 50%, the battery is overfull and can't hold its current and you get a short out of the charger. ,   The phone is really awesome and great for me but the battery problems makes it a big fail for me   Is it the only phone that has a charging issue? No it's not.   (The other ones)   This is one of those things I know I should not get.  a- What phone are you using? i think i would not buy this phone but i guess i can't take no for an answer and i hope they fix the battery issues soon   : The battery life of this phone was awful and it would constantly die. I was able to get it back to work after about a week. I think I'm the only one with this issue so i'm glad it was just me.   the phone lasted me 6 months so this is good   a- is there any difference between the 2 samsung chargers, the S6 has a bigger one and this phone only has a 2 amp charger   ,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for almost a year and it never works. I have had it replaced, and it has worked a little, but still doesnt work. I think the voltage is off, or that the circuit is bad. The battery works fine for a few minutes, then the light goes out. This has been an annoying problem. I dont get the batteries back, I have to purchase a new battery.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is my third purchase. The first was the very similar iHome Mini Pro. I bought it to use for my new iHome TV. The second is an iHome Lutron 4.0. Both have the same specs and the same display. The Lutro is a little smaller and more expensive but it comes with an additional remote and you have a choice of color to match the TV. I got the black with a grey pattern. The remote was very hard to use. The buttons and the display are confusing. I was not able to find the switch that controls "back" on the remote. So I was forced to turn off all the buttons except for the "Back" button. I had to change all the inputs and cables in the unit. It also does not have "backlight" which is a big plus for a TV and has no backlight on my old Lutrone.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my k811 in a backpack, with a mouse and keyboard, for two years. i just wanted to say this device is junk! the battery life has been terrible, so i have to charge it up every 3-4 days and that does not make it a good portable computer. i have my ipad pro for this purpose and its great, i can keep it plugged in all day at a time and charge it by the time i get home. i also have my computer at home and it just charges it up as soon as i come home. there is a small port on the side that i plug in my external hard drives. and that works great. so if you really need this device, get something else.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This does exactly what it should do. When my wife gets a cold, I pop a few pills from this. The cold comes right away, the pain is gone, and it's the first time she has been comfortable with having an alarm system in the house. The only downside is that it doesn't keep well. It goes from off to on in a few minutes. The box has a little sticker that says not to leave for more than a few days. I forgot to pack it the next time I went camping. I hope this one lasts. It's well worth the price. I did use a bit more of the cap than it came with, so I put the cap in a container of water and stored it in the fridge.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for about a week now and it has not failed on a single occasion. i bought it for my daughter who has been playing video games on it all night. it has saved her the trouble and pain of waking her up. and i dont like it when companies make games to be addicting. i was excited to buy it because of the good reviews and i bought this game for it, thinking it would help her study and her brain would calm down when she played it. but her brain was not calmed down. i do not know why. it is not like her playing wasnt working well or she wasnt tired. her brain worked great as she played, but the day after. i tried using a different game, and its not working for her either. it seems that she doesnt feel like studying, or relaxing either. i am not an expert on brainwave patterns. if she does not like this electronic game, then she is probably a child that just wants to do anything to entertain her mind.  Style of Review: If there was a grading scale, this would be a B+   Overall:    If there was an official B- (with the "only at work" thing being a joke. lol) I would give it a B (I like it).  If the B rating was taken off of my personal opinion and put on the "beware of this product" scale, I would still rate it at B (with a caveat)  B- - B+ - I am a bit of an expert when it comes to electronics and computers. I've had my eye on this for about 3 weeks. This review may be a little long for an electronics review, but it is my opinion of the product. I am sure there is an expert that has a different opinion.So, I bought the product for my wife, and we both play video games at home. We are both gamers and do have other interests as well, so this is not something we play to relax or stay awake for long, but as a study aid and a way to unwind. So far it has done well for me and my wife. It keeps us awake as it helps me keep up with my studies, and my mind just feels calm and relaxed. My wife thinks it helps her, and I like that it helps my wife when she wants to study.Overall: I don't know why people have bad reviews on this product,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: *************************** When I was looking at all these cheap and nasty portable electronic devices, I wanted one that I could just take out in the field and use for what I needed. I really like the ease of use, and the ease to be able to take it with me on short trips. If you just want something to listen to music on, there are so many more portable devices that do that that are a lot more convenient. This one just doesn't feel very secure. It doesn't have a case, and you can't fit a battery inside. It can't be charged with a charger either. I think I'm going to give up on it. I may not find another one until I've purchased a portable Bluetooth speaker, or a set of headphones.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am very disappointed with the purchase of this device, The device works as advertised, I use this for a home office, office, and laptop. The audio input is not great. I bought the sound bar and a good stereo. This unit is not very loud, at least not in my setup. I think the problem is due to the fact that I bought it for a PC, not a gaming system. This was a bad purchase for me. I will not use the sound system, I'll just buy another one of these. Rated 5 out of 5 by John from Great product Easy to install. It works perfect! Very clear sound. Great for music. Great speaker system.  Rated 1 out of 1 by Mike from Bought it. Did not get the sound that I ordered I really wanted and the sound was great. The only problem was that the speaker in the subwoofer did not work. I looked on the web and found it was a simple issue with a cheap subwoofers. The unit was delivered, installed, but the sound stopped working and the unit is unusable. I am going to return it and I would recommend you go with the Sound bar. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery life on the ipod 4 is horrible. It starts out at just under 3 hours with no charge on, then shuts down while using the music app to play songs. The same thing happens every time. This is unacceptable, especially because you could buy a better quality ipod for half the price of this one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was a great device to use at the office when I have no internet at home. Unfortunately, I was charged twice for the same charge.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the ebay g6.5 with the intention of using it as a light sensor. Unfortunately the sensor is NOT sensitive to light and as a result it lights up like a Christmas tree at night. It will only go to about 50% brightness, even at night it is too bright. The only other thing I can say is that you have to set the sensitivity to "medium" in the options menu, this is what I set it to. I am very disappointed in this product and it seems to me that you are trying to fool people into thinking this is a smart product and in fact this is not a smart device at all, but a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ************************ I bought this for my daughter as a night light. The first night it came, she put it on her bed to take a nap and it didn't work. The second night, she fell asleep in her night stand and it worked. However the next night she went in to sleep in her bed. I tried to wake her up several times but she had gone to sleep and the light was on. It was a total waste of money! This is only a light. ******************************* I bought a second one for my husband. After reading some of the reviews, I figured he might need it for work. He did and I couldn't believe what a difference it made to his job. I can see him sitting at his computer reading a document in the dark, and it's almost night. I will not buy another one. Thanks for your help ****************** I just purchased this LED light for my 12yr old son for Christmas. It works great. I am in the process of putting some in our bedroom. I love it. I have it on my desk at work, in the garage and at home in my garage.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------------------- If you are not a musician and just want a computer for a hobby or entertainment purposes, I'd recommend an old school typewriter with a built in phonograph. It's the same as any other typewriter. The old fashioned sound is still very good, especially with older and obsolete sound cartridges. The one thing I don't understand, however, is why anyone would want a touch screen phone with a sound. A telephone with a digital sound or video output is far superior in every way to this phone. When you go from a typewriter to a touch-screen, the sound quality is almost non-existent. The sound of the click is barely audible when the phone is in your hand. You'll need to put your ear close to the phone to hear the click. The touch- screen phone has no click. It has no sound. The phone was only designed for watching TV and talking to your friends, NOT FOR RECORDING MUSIC. It also won't play a CD unless you're a CD player. The cell phone has a CD-RW player built in, but a cell phone is meant for calling and not for listening to music. With a built-in CD-ROM drive and a computer that has a built, functioning CD-R player, there are plenty of ways to listen to music and play CDs. In my opinion, the touch screen is better for entertainment than for music. It is much more expensive to buy, and it doesn't play CDs or listen to any other type of media. My advice? Just buy a phone that has sound. There are plenty out there that do have sound. It might not be a touchscreen, but they are better than the touch- screens I've used.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! The first thing I noticed when I got it was the lack of wireless. Well, I've got to say, if I had to go through with the "no wireless" part then I would just return it! The other issue was it's size, and not having enough room to put the camera in front and the battery pack behind it, I'm a big guy and it's very uncomfortable and uncomfortable to wear the camera. And with my "backpack" on I couldn't really see it all that well anyway. Not the most portable and I have to charge it once a day. I just wish the wireless could work, I don't know how to set it up!

Cons: Could use a button on the side of the unit to lock the lens in place for the time you're shooting. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a laptop that was purchased about 5 years ago. My old laptop was running great till this summer when I noticed that there was a problem in my notebook when I was using the Internet. Now the battery inside of my notebook only lasted one day (I was not using it for work, just using it at home). My friend had the same problem and he had his laptop for 5 years. He did not even know that there were other problems because his battery lasted a long time. And then when I went to get my laptop I found out that the battery had died about two months before. So if your are reading this, please do not buy this laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------------------- -------------- After receiving my K7, I wanted to go out with my camera. After using the "Auto" function for several minutes the flash would not work. The flash worked until the camera turned on, and then the flash simply wouldn't work. I would guess the battery was drained after several minutes. My solution was to go online and try to find a replacement, and when I found one, it took 30 minutes to find it. I then had to call the company to find out how much it would cost me, because the "recommended replacement" I received was not worth the money. There should be some form of notification before an item is sent, or else there are no excuses.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- - I use a lot of my iphones these days to listen to music and watch movies. I wanted to be able to do so with my phone and I was hoping that the usb to ether cord would connect my phone to my ipad. It didn't. - I am going to switch to a different ipad this summer and this ipad is going to be the last ipad I buy. Not that it really matters, but it was not worth the hassle. --------------- Pros: - Great sound quality. I have a ipad pro. - Small, easy to carry - USB connection - The power button is on the side, not on the back - The only con I can think of is that the cable that came with it is slightly shorter than the one I bought but that's about it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I can't recommend this product for people who are looking for something new and new to try. The sound quality of the unit is not what it should be and it's not compatible with all computer systems. The audio output works for most people, however it can get very very loud when playing music in a loud environment. You can set the audio output to a comfortable level, but there are times where you will need to turn it down to hear your computer music without headphones. The batteries last only about a week. It's really not worth it unless you want to try an affordable Bluetooth speaker.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******************* I purchased this product in October, 2017 and the problem started on December 3rd when I opened it to make a phone call. It did the same thing with my iPhone 7 Plus.  Was this review helpful? Yes No Wednesday, August 02, 2018  Great, but...  by William from Phoenix AZ USA  Pros: Easy to use, very good battery  Cons: Charging took a long time to finish. :):  Works well and is easy to use. Only problem is it takes a long while to finish charging and I can not really keep it plugged in when not in use. . ,  Yes, the product is well designed, easy to set up and use, and provides a reasonable charge for the battery to keep it charged up for awhile.  with the right device, a charger and a battery, you can go many days without having to recharge. With the Galaxy S7, it works for about 9 hours, which is a decent charge. It has to be set up, but with a simple app, it doesn't take more than a minute to do. With other devices, it takes much longer. With a charger, it makes it last about 3 days. My other review with other devices is that it has problems with getting it to charge fast enough, which might be a deal breaker for some.  a lot of the other reviews mention the charging is slow. I did not experience this until I had the battery set to 4% which was my normal setting. It would charge up, take about 2 hours and then take about 1.5 hours to charge it completely. When you switch to 100% you can't even charge it up at 100% unless you put it on charger.  I just don't like how slow it charges. But other than that, it's great.  of course, I have had it for about 3 months, so I'm still learning how to use it, but I am a satisfied customer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for 2 years now and its just not the same. it is always in standby and doesnt last a whole week with out making a sound. it comes with a warranty and a two year money back guarantee but if you take it for a test drive before you pay for it or the money back period is over it will go back to the store and buy a new one. they also dont know what they are selling as a replacement and i do not see any features on it for the money. there are cheaper ways to get rid of the buzz you get from this thing. and dont go out of your way to get the most features they have on this thing  Was this Review Helpful to you?

It does all that it says it does. It's great to have a new phone when your old one dies and your only phone. The only downside to this phone is that it only works for one phone.  So I have an android phone that's compatible and I have a flip for the old flip phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- 1. I purchased my new tablet for $350 from Amazon and received the new phone as well. Upon opening the package my daughter saw something in my package and told me what it was. I took the phone out of the box and immediately noticed that the screen was very dim and washed out. It had a bright white screen as well but was almost unreadable due to the brightness. I tried the phone and it worked fine but the new tablet was unplayable to me. I ended up returning both phones to Amazon and buying the tablet off ebay for $150.  I did not receive my iPad 3 (iPad 2 is not as good) so i ordered a new one off Amazon for $50 from this company for $10.00 cheaper. They even gave me extra accessories such as the charger. I got the new iPad 2 for $399.00 with one of the accessories. I will never again use Amazon for my electronics needs. -Michele, MI   Was this review helpful to you?

Can't believe it's only $60.00!  -Alex, FL   I've had this tablet for about a week and it's awesome. I use it for reading, surfing the web, and checking emails. The quality of the screen is a great plus. It's easy to read and there are no laggy scrolling animations. It runs smoothly. For the money, this thing is a steal. I'll be buying one for my son.  the only negative thing is that there is a little vibration when you open up the screen but that could be a fluke and they are supposed to have that on every tablet.  and if you have a bluetooth tablet it will have a headphone jack  Overall the quality is great and I'd recommend it to anyone. :D  Thanks  Alex   was this review useful to you?

Cons: Not much for the money.  the cord would get very hot under the speakers. the sound is not loud enough.  of course, all things that can be easily solved with a few dollars more.  and the battery doesn't last too long.  The battery doesn´t last very long. the battery will die after about 3 hours of playing.  as it is battery only. ,  Review: I am happy with this product. It does its job well. No complaints from me. -I bought this product in China because there was no way I could find it at Walmart here in the states, so I figured I would give it a try. It is a good product. The batteries are a bit expensive, but so far they have not died. They are not as durable as some batteries, but they have a long shelf life.  it is a bit overpriced but this is the price for a good quality product that works well.  (If the battery runs out before the sound stops I am not happy at all. I will not buy it again. If I want a great sound for the price I can get better ones for much less.)  Great product. No issues. I am very happy with my purchase. .  for the cost. /  I am happy for the sound. ?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  the device was terrible. I purchased it because I thought I would make it easy on my parents and I was right but it took about 20 minutes and a couple of tears to get it to work and I could not tell that there was a problem and I had to go in and make a phone call to get my parents to help me, so I would not buy it again. There are other electronic devices that work better and I would definitely not buy this product. I am going to look into other models and see what they are all about and see if I can improve my computer. Overall:  So I am very satisfied with this computer, for the money. It worked perfect out of the box, I got no issues and the picture quality is good, and the sound is good as well. I would buy this again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for almost a year now and have only had it break once. ive tried a lot of batteries and chargers. this one is probably the best i have purchased. it holds a charge for 5+ hours. it works very well for my use. i have a video camera, video recorder and my camera's memory card and this battery lasts the longest, has the longest run time. i used my camera for several hours straight in a hot garage and was not able to break the charge. the only thing i would change about this battery would be to add more fast charging capability so I could get a couple of hours out of the battery before it needed to be replaced. i will definitely recommend this battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******** This unit is an absolute disaster and I can't recommend this product at all. It started out working perfectly until I turned it on.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using my samsung p dvd player for about a month now, and it has been great. its a great device to listen to music or movies and also has a huge memory and is very portable, but when i first started using it i noticed that it would skip music tracks if i switched to another source to listen. if you listen to the same song over and over, it will skip. but once the device is switched on it doesnt skip music any more. i also noticed that when it starts playing a video it can take a long time to find the video, and after it finds it its so slow i couldnt stop it. if i wanted it to skip a video i would have to switch it off and on again, it doesn't have to just switch off.   i also found that the usb port doesnt have the standard power connector and is only capable of power and data. i had to buy the USB-c to mini-USB cable to get the device working properly.   this device does have some drawbacks, but i found that they are minor and do not affect the performance. if your looking for a good device to replace your mp3 player or dvd-player this is a good option.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _____________________________________________ I have had my Samsung Galaxy S4 for a few weeks now and am very happy with it. It works great and the only downside is that you can't turn it off unless you press the power button. This is the first electronic device that i have had that has that feature but it works perfectly for me and does the job. The other downside is the charging.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had this on for 4 months now and it has a lot of problems and I'm really frustrated with it. First off I was told by my mom that I had to get a replacement because the batteries in my iPad were breaking and she could not get them to work with the new phone. I got it 2 days later and they were not in my home office anymore so I had them sent back to Apple. I called Apple and was told that the replacement would take 1-2 weeks. On the first day of taking it back, it quit working and I had no other choice but to send it back. They sent me a new replacement 3 days later. The last day I tried to use it, it wouldn't turn on. I tried different buttons, different button combinations, nothing works. I've had it running a year and the battery seems to have run out of space in there. I really feel I should be getting a refund because there is so many things that don't work and Apple is telling you that it's not your fault.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit came with a USB charger, which it's not necessary for a portable device like this. However, the device itself is a total bummer. I'm running Android 4.2, and for a 1Ghz device, it is incredibly slow. It takes about half a minute or more to load the "Google" application, and even then, I get stuck with a message saying it cannot be opened. This is despite the fact that Google "suggested" that I download an app called "Google Play Store." To this day, I'm still unable to download the app, despite trying it several times in the settings. The app does work fine if you don't have a good WiFi connection, but I'd definitely stick with the official application for now.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   "this device is really a pain in the arse. I can't use it at all because of the dead batteries. So I bought a cheap one from amazon. But I can just about get the same functionality from this device. I don't know why i would pay $120 for a $30 device. The battery life on this device is horrendous. It only lasts a couple of hours. So what you are paying for a great feature is only a good thing for a cheap device."
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device was a huge disappointment when I first got it.  It didn't work for a very long time and only the power button would work.  The USB cable has a metal bar with three prongs that are connected by a connector.  I tried for a long time to work it but it just wouldn't work. I got a spare one off ebay but it doesn't work either.  For $90 I expect a good quality product.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Mike from Does not work for some This unit does not work on my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 due to the Samsung logo on the board. 2nd unit was supposed to work but it would not recognize the phone. 3rd one works and works fine with other Samsung phones. I am still trying to find a solution but have lost a little faith in them at this point. This is an awesome unit!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------------------   i bought the blu ray player a few years back and I'm not happy with it. The buttons don't work and they don't seem to be getting any better. I have a cheapo sony blu ray (bad design) and the buttons work great. The blu ray button works well for volume down and up. My problem is that the player only has 2 buttons on the top. I use a blu ray remote (generic) and it works great. I've also been using a bluetooth receiver (generic). Now my buttons don the buttons on blu ray are constantly getting stuck in a bad state and they no longer work. The button on blu Ray now just gives an error message. This is one of the most annoying things in the entire blu ray players.   I'm a hardwired remote control freak so I had to buy one of these players. I bought this device on sale because it was the only blu ray receiver with a USB receiver that had a USB port. My blu ray is now getting old and the only thing the players can do is play. There are no buttons and no volume buttons so this is a big disappointment to me. It will be a year before I get another one of those cheap blu ray devices that don't do anything. It's just not worth the money.   The button is made by Samsung and I think they are the best button maker on the planet.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this product for 3 days now, it works very well but the first day i had to plug it in 3 times. the USB connector had to be removed because it was not making a connection. the second day i tried it the connection is not making any connection either, it had to come off twice. i can only believe that something is going on in there. i bought it for $20, i wouldnt have bought it if i had read the other reviews before purchasing. i am looking for a replacement for this product.  Style of electronic device should be the most important factor in my buying decisions. I bought this to watch YouTube videos on my desktop computer. After I was able to run this computer on my laptop (which had a built in video player), this box has become my media center. The quality is good. When playing music, the sound quality is much better than my laptop. It comes with a HDMI cable. When viewing video files on your laptop, you must connect it to the TV to view them on the screen. However, you cannot do that with this box. You can see the screen through the HDMI cable but not through the other ports. When I connected it to my laptop via HDMI, you can actually see the music and video playing at the same time. I do not know how the computer knows where to put it in the tray. I think it is a little too big. I was thinking of getting an external box. But I like this box so much, that I am buying a second. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I really like this keyboard. I don't know if that makes it a good one, but it's a really nice one. I have a different keyboard, and I can't say that this one is any better than that one. It is a bit louder than my other keyboard, but I guess I'll have to hear how I do with that one next time. The only complaint I have is that the caps lock isn't that great. The key feels too thin to me. I'm pretty sure it won't make a huge difference for most, but if you're an English typist, it's really not that great!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had a bad experience with this item. My son bought this to turn his tv on in the bathroom. He wanted to use the remotes on it and set it to channel 2. The remotes couldn't get the channels in the right order and he ended up having to use one of the TVs remote keys to adjust. I did everything on the website except I had to use a usb to usb cable to get it on the tv. He finally got the tv on using the other remote. I got the remover for the TV set and the problem is the removers don't work with the tv set. This is a bad product, you can get it for cheap for $20 but you can't be happy if you're going to get the tv fixed. I'm not satisfied with this product at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is so useless. I had a good idea of how it worked in theory and I tried it. I thought I had it covered. The idea of using it to connect to the outside world, to be able to use a router and a router phone is great, except that the cable comes out the back of the device. I would have expected a simple, standard, plastic case to cover it. This is the first product I have ever purchased from Amazon that I have had any problems with. It took 3 days to get it and I have since returned it and will never buy another product from this company.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my ipad for 2 years now, and it has gotten extremely hot and unreliable in that time. i use it everyday to browse the net and to read emails and texts and when its not connected to wi-fi, the battery life is very poor, especially if you do any of your work that requires you to be connected to the net. when i did get the ipad, i thought it was a great product and wanted to support the company with it, but i will be avoiding buying another ipad unless they improve the reliability or price of the ipads in general and the ipd in particular.  Help your friends find a device. I'm a very heavy ipad user. I also use my ipod alot and the iPod does great. ive got my ipads for about 2 and a half years now and i cant believe it has lasted so long and is still going on. if ive something else to do with it than its great but if youre looking for something that is reliable and works well then get an ipad.   Good for what it is Used this product for a couple of days now and it's great. I've never had a problem with my ipods charging on this. It does what it says and does it really well.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------------------- I bought this for my wife and she hates it. My first impression of the device was that it had an LED that was off by the time it got to her house. It also did not come with any of the accessories that the computer came with. I contacted the vendor and they had the wrong product number on file. When they sent me a new unit they could not get the new part in until my wife had it set up for the first time. It was only after that I realized that the original computer was a very nice model and was really a very good purchase. I think the unit is really cheap for the size and quality it is. I wish the LED light was better because it made it difficult to find items on the internet to add to my collection.  More

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for almost two years now, and it works pretty well for me, but this thing is so damn slow. i have to turn it off every 30 minutes. i was hoping for more speed, but it only gets slow. it was the same with my tablet (pf) when i upgraded to windows 7.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Tom from Disappointing I am a professional photographer who has been working with Sony cameras for many years. I am very disappointed in the images I am getting from the RX10 III. I bought this camera thinking it would give me more photos with a lower price tag. I can't say enough bad things about the camera. It takes a lot of time to manually focus and take the shot because it is not as fast as my point and shoot or even my iPhone. I know the camera is not supposed to be as slow as this but I'm getting my images much slower than I ever expected. I've used my Sony RX10 II for 3 years and this is the first camera I've ever had that can take these images at a faster rate. It will get some good shots but that isn't worth a bad camera. I do wish Sony would bring the auto focus back since it is one of the better camera's out there that has one. If you need a good camera with good photos this is not the camera for you.  with the RX 10 III I use the zoom feature on the zoomed in shots, but not so much with the ones taken with the autofocus. If your taking a good photo with auto focus, the camera just isn't that fast and I think a new sensor would fix it  I own 4 Sony cameras. All have been very good. This one just seems to have gone downhill, and the image quality is no better than the previous Sony cameras I have owned. I have been looking for a new camera. But after having this one, it seems like a waste. I would never spend the money. .  on my RX10II I think it's just a poor quality lens. I tried shooting with the zoom with this camera and it takes such long for the camera to focus. I also noticed the shutter is really quite loud in this one. But I do like that it has a very nice screen.

Rated 5 out of 5 by James from I was looking for a portable battery charger when I found this one. It charges the ipad so I can go on the go. Its light, compact, and powerful. I was on the fence whether or not to get this battery but the price wasn't too high. I've been using this daily for about 4 months now and I'm pleased with it. I highly recommend this product.  I've used my ipod this way for quite some time now, and it always charges up. It is the first battery I've ever found that charged my ipode without a single problem. Even though it's so compact, it holds a lot of juice and can charge multiple ipod's at once. There are very few negative reviews on the web, and this battery definitely makes the top of the line of portable batteries for the price.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The "Dongle" is a horrible piece of junk, and the fact that it's an old school style is another HUGE problem. This dongle doesn't even work with my computer, and I'm trying to do all kinds of "advanced" software, and even when I do I'm still getting "Unable to communicate with USB device" every time I try to communicate. I bought this for a game I'm playing that requires the use of a USB peripheral device (the Wii Remote) so I figured this would be a great option. Now when I try and use this device, it won't work. I have tried a USB to Serial adapter, and a cable with a mini USB connector, and nothing works. No one ever gives it a good rating for being so terrible at what it was designed to do!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the new ios 10 since august. its great, but a few weeks into it i decided to get the 32gb version for my son who is not a big phone user but is a student. so he gets to have all his apps from apple on this. he was able to download all of his apps but still it cant do anything i dont like to do and he cant change settings in his cell phone that i use. he got frustrated with this. so i bought another and replaced it with the 64gb. the thing that stinks is the phone is on a separate base than the ipad. and the ipads are made of metal. so the ipod is really heavy. but the new ipad is so small in my hand that the phone becomes so unstable. and to fix the problems with the 32gbs it is a pain in the ass to have to take it out of its base and set it on top of a big old rock. i cant believe they have made a cheaper phone that cant do the things they sell it for. i wish i could get some advice from someone with a more technical knowledge. its getting out of hand  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________________________________________ This is a new model of the V6, but I used it as my main stereo system for about 4 years.

I have not had it broken down, even though it was new, and I don't think it will ever happen. But it's been awhile since I played with it, so I guess I'm not very surprised that it failed. This model can probably take a beating.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used a karaoke machine at a concert once. the sound was very subpar. it just didnt have the punch that other karaokes do.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, June 14, 2016  Excellent Product  by William from Largo FL USA  Pros: Perfect for portable use  Cons: none  Review: This is a great portable karaoking machine for those who want a more compact, portable, yet powerful solution for the job. You can carry it with ease. I've had mine for more than six months and so far, nothing that could be improved on it's performance, functionality, or features. The microphone is a very nice feature to have as well. The sound quality is excellent for the price. I use it at a local karaoketing club for live performances.  a little noisy, but good for portable kraken.    I will most definitely be buying another one of these very soon. .  of a little bit loud  I've only used the microphone once, on a live performance of the band The Wipers. After the show, I immediately went to the mic and plugged the microphone into my laptop. I then went to another area in the club and began my set. Unfortunately, the microphone didn't pick up my voice and my show had to be aborted. I'm sure I could have gotten a better performance from the microphone. My main problem with the product is the size of it. I like to travel light and this was more of a hindrance than a help.  and this is why I'm not giving this product a 5.  is an absolute monster in terms of features. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have this radio for 5 years and never really liked it, until I got one of these little black boxes. I have always hated the digital radio, and hated the way it worked, but now it is great and I am not using the remote anymore. It has some nice features, not the biggest one but nice to have. I'm not sure why you need two of them. The batteries are just what I expected them to be and that is the only thing I don't like.   Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for the kids and they loved it. The device was so cute that it made the kids feel like they were in a Disney movie. However, it did not play music with my iPad so that was not great. I have the Apple Music app and my children can stream music for free. I would not recommend the sound from this thing, but at least it can be used as a "smart phone" that is connected to wifi.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Marge from Great for the money I don't like the fact that there's a mic, but that's a small price to pay for a good quality speaker. This little guy has enough battery life and has enough volume to get my kids' attention without getting in the way of their phones. It also charges wirelessly so it's a great accessory to have for the school day. It's small and light, so there's no problem with it being lost if a kid has to throw it out. Overall, I'm very happy with it.  to my 2 daughters this is a great purchase  If you have kids, this is for you! This product was the first one that I bought for my children when they were young. They have been using it ever since. I am very happy that the audio is very loud and the song they have chosen is easy to sing and play. They love it! My youngest daughter (10) has an iPhone so this is her primary music player. The battery lasts for more than 12 hours and I haven't had to charge it in a very long time. The only negative thing I have to say is that the device could be a bit better. I didn't think the cord was long enough but after I got the headphones and headphones adapter I added this extra one and it makes a huge difference. The cord is also a little stiff for the type of music she likes to listen to. The adapter also helped in that regard.  is a very nice little device and I have no complaints about it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is not the last time you will need a good external usb device to fix the issue with the tablet.  This will likely only fix the battery issue. The touch screen is also a different design than the one I bought in 2011.  The design is a lot thinner and it will be really difficult to bend the screen so that it will fit in the device.   Rated 4 out of 5 by bpwj from Works great - battery is a issue. This product is a big improvement over the previous one I have used. But... Battery is still the issue for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________________________________________________________________________ I bought this item in order to use it for my 3 year old daughter's bedroom at the beginning of the year. It works well for her but since we use it a lot we have to do everything she asks us to do. She likes to put the doll inside it and it can be an issue with the doll or the toy. She is a little hard to take out and I don't see how you can take her out easily. Also you have to watch how you handle the doll at the bed end. It is hard to get it off. This will be a great toy but it may not be for a little one.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- 1/2 The box is flimsy and the plug is cheaply made. The other issues are a bit worrisome. 1/4 1. The unit does not connect to the computer at all. The power cord needs to be plugged in to the back of the unit. 2. The remote control does not work. This is odd because there is no reason that I can think of for a remote control to not work that is for a computer. 3. The back of one of the batteries is leaking and the other one is dead. The wires come apart and can't be fixed. 4. The software for the camera has problems and it cannot be opened at all because of the way it is written. You need to use the software to turn it on and off. (It has no auto-shut-off feature) 5. The battery does not last very long. 6. This camera is not worth the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a GREAT purchase but... This is my third time using this phone. First time I ordered the phone after a friend bought it. I was very impressed with the phone. I had to put my old Motorola flip phone in the case to protect it. It was a lot better than I expected. Second time I bought the phone from Walmart and I was amazed by the quality and the price of the phone compared to the Motorola flip. I put in the Motorola Flip case and it is the only one I own that I can wear all day without a problem. I have to put a case on my flip phone or my flip is exposed all day. I don't care how good the screen is because I know that if I want to use my flip, I have the case on.   I love my phone and don't mind the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________________________________________________________________________________ I just got my Rode Smartphone 7" with 1 year warranty and so far I am very happy, I use it mostly on my work laptop, and I'm very happy with the microphone. However the phone gets very hot, especially during calls and after some time on the phone I noticed a sound like a radio transmission coming from the phone when I was listening to music. I haven't seen anything like this on my old cell phone, so I'm a little disappointed with the purchase.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ********************  I've been using this product for about 2 months. I have had no problems. I was very excited when it showed up at my door. It was packaged well and came with everything you'd need to do a good job. I followed the instructions and it was pretty easy to install. The instructions are very well laid out, very clear, and easy to follow. It's my first home computer, and I like the fact that it came pre-wired. The power supply is powerful and can be used in either of my houses. The only thing I would change is that it has no built-in ethernet port. I just used the Ethernet port on my older computer, so it would be more convenient.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for a couple months and it is just terrible. i just bought it off ebay for $14 (and i paid shipping). my first problem was that the button to turn it on or off is on the left side of the unit. i had to physically turn the thing on by pushing a button on the side. then, on the first day i got it, i accidentally left the battery in the device. i did that again the next day and the battery was dead. now i am trying to go through the steps of getting it repaired by a different company. i got another one, it works, but i'm going to try and get a refund for the other one. so far, this has been a horrible experience. i should be able to do everything my mom says to do with it. i have tried to get in touch with the company about it and so far they have been useless. i've been on hold for over 40 minutes and they cant get a hold of me. i feel like i'm being scammed. my mom told me that she will try to contact them for me but i don't want to hear from them again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Great for the money!  I've had the XPS 12. I've had a Windows 7 laptop but it didn't hold my interest for very long so when I purchased the Xps 12 it was a no brainer to get this one. I was able to install all of my software and have the laptop connected to my wi-fi network in minutes! For the money, you can't beat this computer. The only thing that could be better would be the webcam.  No issues  The XPS is perfect. All of my apps are running perfectly and no lag when watching movies. I also have the 3D display and it works great with a headset. This computer is awesome.  the only thing I dislike is the keyboard. It is a bit wobbly. I had the keyboard in for 2 years and it still feels kind of new. .  is my new favorite laptop. I bought it last year and i love it so much. I am going to buy the laptop again.  on of my favorite devices  Bought the X12 in mid Oct. It's now in my pocket. Great laptop to take on the go and be able to have a comfortable mouse and keyboard at the same time. The biggest complaint I have is with the keyboard (again). The keys are not too big (the only issue I have) but you have to constantly tap them to get into the position to type. Overall, awesome laptop and the only issue would be it was about $100 more than I had wanted.  of the best computers I've used  It was a pleasure to use. The laptop is well built and has a great screen, speakers and the built in battery saves me about 3-4 hours of use per day. It gets me through the day just fine. The touch screen is quite responsive and the keyboard is very comfortable to type on. The battery life is fantastic and even though it's not really large enough to make this a daily laptop, I do use it a lot.  was the best for the price  What can I say? I was absolutely amazed by the hardware I got for under $1000.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ***********This device is a joke and they would have been better off selling it at the hardware store. The product does what it was designed to do and it's an easy fix for the problems that it has. If they can do better than the product at a hardware store then they should. It has nothing useful or cool about it. If you want to keep this thing from falling apart and breaking after a few uses then buy a good one like the Sony VTC5
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for almost 2 weeks now and i have had no problems. i have been using the phone to send/receive SMS on my computer. it has been working fine without problems. The only thing that i dont like about it is that the usb cable is a little short, so i have to make sure that when i plug the usb in, it is fully inserted. It is not a big deal because the cable comes with two extra plugs and the USB is already plugged in. I would suggest this phone if you dont need a lot of talk time or dont need to send messages to a lot that is alot of people.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I recently bought an Apple TV, and I was happy.  That is until I decided to upgrade my computer. I used to have an old laptop that was more than good enough for me, but I never used it because of all the viruses and malware. It would constantly get so hot in my house when it was running that I would leave it on all the time, so I decided that I needed to get a new computer that had a cooler fan. I decided on a refurbished Macbook Pro Retina. It came with the latest graphics card, and an SSD drive in it that I had to buy separately, but was still worth it.  The thing took quite a while to get up and running. I did some research before I bought it to ensure that I was buying the correct one. I saw reviews that said the battery life was terrible, and that the power button wouldn't work, but that didn't bother me because it was one of those things that I could fix myself. I also had an older Macbook that had the same power button and no SSD, and it lasted me for years, but it didn't have any of the newer Apple products. The screen isn't exactly great, but hey it's just an old Macbook. It does the job and it looks pretty good. I wish they had made a version with an HD camera like the new ones do. I have an iPhone 6 and it works fine, but if I could I would have chosen a Macbook in the first place. One of the things that makes the Apple TV different from an iPod or another Apple product is that it is a streaming device. I use to have a Roku, and have been very happy with it. It's a lot easier to set up than an Apple device, and you don't need to have any hardware or software for it to function. So the question I ask myself is, why can't I find another Apple TV? The answer is because it's a streaming media player. As a consumer I don't mind it, but as an Apple employee, I don. It means that we don't get to update the devices we work with. Another difference between an Apple product and a streaming box is that a streaming app is available, however Apple won't allow third party developers to put apps on it because they are not official. So you can't play YouTube videos or Netflix on it. They will also keep it locked

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******** I bought this after trying the cheap ones from other reviews but they were always dead after only one use. The device I bought has been functioning perfectly for a month. The only issue that I had with the unit is the USB port on the back is a bit tight so you have to work hard to insert the USB stick into the USB connector. I have to push the stick in very hard to have it stay in the connector, and sometimes it seems to get stuck and won't release at all. Other than that it's a very good product and I'm very pleased with the quality and service provided by Apple.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Steve from Works as advertised I purchased two of these to replace the power adapter that comes with the iphone 6. It allows me to charge my phone using the power jack on the wall when in use, and the phone and the computer can also be powered off when in standby mode. One feature I do miss is that I was not able to use the power button to switch the power mode on or off, even when in phone standby. The other issue that concerns me is that you can no longer use the USB cable to charge the phone at the computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this unit for several years now, and i just recently noticed that the buttons on the top of the unit no longer function, not even a "press and hold" on it to press, they just turn back off. i replaced it with a different kind of unit (bought on a whim) that had the same issue, as the buttons still functioned. i also tried using the new unit on another computer, but no luck, so i returned the old unit, and purchased a new one. it also does not recognize my bluetooth keyboard, and has a small fault in the unit as well. there is a small chip in the keyboard that i can no longer use, and the software has a glitch with it, which i will have to get corrected. as of now, i've replaced the unit twice, so there are still a couple of faults on this unit, but it works well enough for me. if you are thinking of getting this, just know that this was one of the very last products that i purchased, and it's a pretty good product, but not a great one. overall, it's cheap, it works, it doesn't work well enough to replace my old one and i don't know if i would use it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _______________________________________________________________________ I just returned a broken iPad. I'm from the east coast, so this one is really new to me. I did the research, and it had been repaired about once in the last 3 years. It is running very slowly on 3G, and when I tried to check it online, it said the connection was bad. I went and got it, but it had a new battery, so I was going to return the broken one, and get a new one. So I plugged it in to check, and sure enough the connection would not connect. I took it to the nearest store and asked for a new connection. They gave me the battery back (they had not even received it), and I called Apple Care and was told that it was not Apple, but the phone company's problem, and I would have to pay to get a replacement. I think they want you to give them a big discount if they are going to send out the new one that is a bit defective. They do offer warranty on most of their products. I ended up buying a new iPad anyway (it had the same model as this one). This has been a frustrating experience. I really like Apple products, but when I purchase a new item I want it to be fixed or replaced quickly, not in a couple of weeks. _____________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you can't take the risk on this unit, don't buy it.  It's a very good and powerful USB flash drive. But there are plenty of cheaper, less risky models. . It's a VERY good USB flash stick but in my case it does not come as a USB drive. Instead it comes as a regular laptop case. I don't have any idea why, because I had to download the software, and it has an annoying warning message on the desktop. I can't understand how you can still offer this product as a computer case. It makes no sense. I was so surprised I didn't even close it because I could not open it. It has a hard drive (the software tells me it has one) but it does NOT come as one. It is a computer and not a computer storage device. It doesn't come with any warranty. The worst part is that I was really disappointed with the price. I paid $35 for this and I got a case for $5. The computer case costs over $70.    The only good part is you get a 4gb USB flash. That is enough to store about 10 music files or about 250 videos. It will take a bit to download, but I had a lot of fun learning how to use it. My only advice would be to do some research before you buy anything. Also, I'm pretty sure the case is very fragile. Don't use it for anything that can be dropped.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and have been very disappointed. There is no support, it does not charge at all, it is really hard to use for a long time, and I find out there are a lot of bugs and problems. I bought my Note 4 online because the prices on Amazon were more expensive. They don't even warranty their devices anymore, so if you are buying online, this is not the right choice.

It is very fast. It works very well and the GPS is a godsend. You don't need to carry a charger with you and it is simple to set-up. It takes 1 min to set it up. I wish the display had an option for night mode to reduce battery drain and light to show it is on. It was very nice having the screen on to read e-mail.  I use my iphone 7 plus and this phone is my everyday phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the moto g on a whim because i am addicted to apple products, so i just had to find out if the mote was a decent option for me. After i got it and was using it for about 3 months, i noticed that the usb port doesn't work on my moto z2.  i thought it was a fluke, but then this morning when i tried to charge it my phone wouldn't recognize it. The only option i had was to take it back to the store, and it was worth the hassle because this time the usb cable was defective, it doesn't have the proper pins or anything else. The next day i bought another one and this one works fine now.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my zwave dvr for almost 2 years now. I have had two other units in the past with the same problems. This one just works. if you are like me and you only have one or two light bulbs on the unit that are out of spec or not connected the first time it comes out of the box you will have to change them. i have my remote and my motion sensor on the back of the unit. it will just not work with the motion sensor unless you turn the switch on the motion or remote and the lights on the light bulb switch are out and it will not light anything. i use the motion and remote and now the lights are out on all the lights but not the motion on the remote as you can see from my photos i just bought a zwave controller with the option to add the lightbulbs. so i bought the zwave remote and wired it up to the motion remote and that worked just fine except i can not see the lights in the motion light bulb when i use my motion controller with my z-wave dvrs. the remote has an on off switch for the motion plus the lights and i will need to purchase another remote so i wont have to do this all over again and will have my lights and motion working fine now if someone would have let me know before i bought my second one. so if you plan on having one of these with you be sure to have the correct bulb and switch to work with it. if its your first time buy another.

(Posted on 9/6/2014)  Excellent Product! Review by daniel Price Quality This is the second time that I have purchased this product. After installing it in my home I have no problems. It has worked flawlessly every time! (PostedOn 9/3/2014)"  great product, just had to work for it Review by Chris Price Quality My wife and I installed the circuit breaker as a safety precaution. I had it connected for a couple of days and my wife noticed the battery was dead about 5-10 days in. So she came by to see if she could check it out. There was a little yellow/green wire that was plugged into the negative terminal. Upon checking, she found a small cutout. I was able to take a small wire cut from the battery (a few inches longer than my wire-cutting pliers) and she was able pull the wire out. I cleaned the wire (to reduce chances of shorting the battery) and wired it back into the circuit breaker. Within 10 days she was still getting power. I can't wait to get it hooked up to a refrigerator. (Not exactly what I had in mind, but it worked and is a safer way to connect to a circuit breaker) (Posted On 9/1/2014 )  My wife has a problem Review by Mike Price Quality We installed this circuit breaker in my garage about three years ago, and one of the batteries died. My wife was not happy because the old battery could not be charged again, and my son was also unhappy because we can not take the old batteries out of his car. Since this new circuit breaker will not allow the old circuit to be turned back on, it must be removed. I found it difficult to remove the old one because the wire to the positive terminal was on the inside of the circuit. So I found an old wire, cut a section, and installed it on the outside of the breaker and made a plug for it. A week later, we still have

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had the original Samsung phone. It was terrible! I had a bad issue that made me delete all my old pictures off of my phone. This phone was so expensive that the manufacturer wanted me to pay a replacement fee. I don't want a new phone. I want an updated Samsung. I think a better design would be nice, but other than that, I am fine. I will still purchase the new one.  Write a positive review about an excellent electronic device of the year award winner!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this phone for a week now. ive been through the same problems of losing phone, turning off screen, phone being dead and turning it back on etc.  the battery has about a week left on it and it's still at 20% or more.  its not an error on their end so it is not their fault, i just hope i don't have to buy a new phone because this one will stop working soon.   Good product, but not perfect:  I had to return my phone to get a new one, for a couple of reasons, mainly: 1. I didn't understand how to set up the setup to transfer my phone. 2. I think there are certain settings in the phone which can be hard to figure out, and they are in an obscure place. 3. This is not a huge deal because the battery is still good and I'll just wait for them to get back to me and figure this out. But I had heard about this before and I didn?t want to be the next person to be disappointed. I'd give this product 5 stars for ease of setup, if I could have it every time. But, as I said above, I think I would have to get another one.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought this phone for work and i like it a lot. the only thing i did is that the screen is very dirty, the phone is easy to scratch and is very hard to clean. that being said i would not recommend this phone to anyone. i think it is a good price for the phone but would not buy it again. i would prefer to pay a little more to get a phone with better specs and that will last longer.  Good Product but don't go on about it I bought this for my daughter. She loves the phone for its convenience and she has even told me that she would like to buy more when she hits her mid 20's. I am very satisfied with the phone as long as she does not leave the house without it. But I think the screen has some dirt on it. I've cleaned it every week.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I've only had this device for a few weeks. It was on sale for $15.00 so I picked it up thinking I would have a good time playing with it. The screen is very dim, even on it's highest setting. I thought I'd just use this as a portable device to control my TV with but it's even less fun than that. The controller is so finicky, it's like it could move back and forth if you move the remote too far or not far enough, and when you move it left or right, it moves in a different direction. When I moved the remote closer to me, it moved to the right. When you move your mouse too far from it, it jumps to the left and if you push it back too far, it goes to the front. The keyboard and touch pad work okay for a phone, but this device is just so bad that I won't be buying it ever again. I'll probably get a used cell phone so I can be able to use my device.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this because I wanted to be able to connect my Samsung Note 3 to my phone through an android device, but the only problem I found was with the adapter and the fact that I had to connect it to the android device through the micro USB port on the adapter. It worked, but when I tried to connect the android to the phone, the adapter wouldn't work. I had a phone with the micro usb port and adapter on the same motherboard, and it worked perfectly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem:   I just upgraded to this model because I had the older one for about 5 years. The other thing that annoyed me about that older one was that it was kind of heavy. Not really a big deal though, I don't really go running a lot (as I do with my laptop). I've been using this one for a few months now and the battery life is about 15 hours at a fairly constant brightness setting. This is about as good as an LCD screen will ever get on an android device. It doesn't have as many pixels as a full HD screen, but that's not really a concern because there are a lot of things on the screen. It's a good screen, very clear, color is accurate and contrast is good, not great, but good. The only time I do notice that is when I use my computer and it gets too hot to read on my LCD.   Sound:     Not a huge issue, the volume is good for most music. Not a good match for movies and movies on youtube. I didn't notice much difference with movies. Not sure what I did wrong with that movie, though, because my speaker was set to the lowest possible sound levels. The microphone on the phone is okay, you can't really hear a difference between the two but it's fine. The phone also doesn't really record audio very well. The sound comes out a little tinny (maybe it's because I'm using an earpiece with it) but then when you turn on the speaker, you hear a lot better.   and of course, my camera is very fast, a little better than the old one, but a little less than my tablet. So yeah, a good camera, great video and photos. I've also added this as a backup device in case I'm on a long trip and need to shoot photos.  .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------------------- I have had my Sonos PLAY:1 for less than a month now and have had no problems with it at all. The play:1 works like a charm. It was easy to set up. I have been listening to music on it for about 4 hours now without having to stop and connect my computer or any other devices. For that matter I have only used the Play:1 on my laptop with the HDMI out (no speakers). The only thing I wish about the play: 1 was if you can get a USB cable to connect it to the computer to use as a second monitor. It doesn't come with one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first thing that happened was that I couldn't power on my iPad on the second generation, but it was working fine the first time I plugged it in. Then after a week I couldn't use it at all. I ended up having to call Apple and they told me that I had to exchange the device for a new one. I said no problem, but then after spending three weeks trying to figure out why the phone and tablet didn't work, I got a new iPad and a few weeks later the phone won't work on the first generation. I'm so frustrated. If you need a new computer and are in a position where you don't have a warranty, I'm sure you can get a computer at a cheaper price than this (I wouldn't recommend buying a used laptop either if the price is less than $200). But if you already have a computer and it doesn't work properly, you may not be able to get a replacement one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this about a month ago and so far the only problem I'm having is that it gets really hot when it's working, even when it hasn't been in use for long periods of time, it would stay hot for about 1 hour and 30 minutes and when I took it out of the wall to put it back it would just get hotter and hotter until the buttons just wouldn't go back to the "on" position. It doesn't seem to have the slightest trouble with this at all. The only way it could have been more difficult to set up would be if I had to take out the batteries every now and again because the buttons would just stick down forever. It does work. But only in its best mode. The worst one is that when I do use it, I have to charge it every single time, but that's it. I really wanted it to be a great, reliable charger.

Cons: The light is extremely bright and I don't think it would be acceptable on a night like this where we might be having a hard time finding it. Not sure how we're supposed to find it!

I'm happy to say that it works well, but there are several drawbacks: The alarm is very bright (so bright that we use it for light-duty), and it's very loud! My wife loves it, since she's a woman, but she does have a hard enough time getting to the bottom of a closet with her head up. The light-activated alarms also don't work well because the lights will turn on only when they sense motion. Overall, it's an ok product.

He loves his device and he has had great satisfaction with the support team and all the support I got from my local service center. But when the device finally failed in July, I contacted Amazon and was told by a representative that they are trying to replace the device for free. I then contacted Amazon support and was refused any assistance. It was clear that Amazon support doesn't have the expertise or time to help anyone with this kind of problem. I called and they advised me that I could send it back but I was told I would have to pay to send it in the mail. I have no idea what is going on but it is very frustrating and upsetting to deal with Amazon, as this has been a huge help to my brother and I as we are a family of three with very little income. I was extremely disappointed in my experience and hope that they will find a way to improve their quality of customer service.

Please call if you need something by a certain time." After the time was up, I called the company and was told that I would have to wait about 2-3 days for the item to be shipped and I would be refunded the amount of the item after 2-4 days.

The photo quality on the video is mediocre.   I get horrible panning of the subject and the video sometimes does not make it to the subject in a reasonable time.  As far as I can tell the shutter is only 1/16th of a second.  My Canon 8MP does that in 2 secs.  If you want a great camera that you can actually use on a tripod, buy a Sony.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was one of the most annoying things I have ever done with my phone. The phone doesn't turn on and the screen is constantly turning off to the blue LED and the lock screen. The only way to get it to turn on is to press the power button twice, which is just a nuisance.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: *************************** ***** ****** ******* ****** I purchased this electronic device about 2 months ago and it came with 1 battery and 1 USB port. I needed 2 chargers so I ordered the 4th charger for free and it arrived 3 days later. I plug the charger in and it takes a while to start charging but I don't mind since this charger has never worked before. The power LED on the top has never flashed on or off so I think it's good quality. It takes 1 hour and 30 mins to fully charge my device and my charger has about 5 hours battery life. I wish that Samsung would make these chargers with better quality batteries because I bought a device and after a month of use my battery has completely died and I need a new one and it will only cost me $40.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've bought a few of these in the past, but this was the first I've ever had a problem with.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my 2nd one, I ordered one on sale at my local Walmart and it came with a bad usb charger and no way to charge my phone at home. I was pretty upset.  The second one I received today had the same thing but a new charger for my iphone.    Overall, the best part about these is the price. You can pick them up at Walmart and they are so cheap you don't even have to think about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I love this product. I can read any book with this thing. But i had some issues with the interface. The battery died while the computer was downloading the files. I got a new one, and it is great.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Very easy to use I use this device to play games on my Windows 8 PC. It works flawlessly. The interface is very user-friendly. I love the fact that it has a built-in speaker for background music, and the battery is removable. The device has a huge selection of programs that come in handy when playing games. I've been using it to play Doom 3 and StarCraft 2 with no problems.  (update: i've been buying new batteries for it to make sure it doesn't die after using it for a while. It does. but still a good buy.)  Review of DJI Inspire 1 Black Edition: Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase. It came at a very fair price. The only negative thing about it is that I got it with a broken screen and when I tried to fix it with the included tool I was just using a screwdriver as a screw driver. The screen still works, but it was unusable. The price point and the functionality of this device can not be beat.  the unit comes with an adapter for a usb cable which I will add to my kit. It also comes with two batteries, one included. the other battery that comes with it will work in my kit but the one I purchased from DJI was defective. when it runs out of the two batteries included it will no longer work in this drone. ( i am using an external battery) also the screen is broken. I'm going to add a couple of plastic cover to it and hope that it will fit in the kit. -I would have been happier with just a quadcopter  -it is a good quality for the money  I've used the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ on a couple flights and love it. It's small and light enough for most jobs. The batteries I received with this drone work great so I only needed to replace one. The included battery is really great and should hold a couple extra charges if you're flying with a small battery. This is a great unit and I'm happy to have the Inspire.  on sale at Amazon, I used it to fly to California and New Hampshire. It was very
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive owned this unit for a few months now, it works great but the battery dies every other day or so, also the speaker is quite weak, and the only way to charge it is by the USB port, and it seems to run out of power in less then a week. i bought the adapter to charge the battery, so i wouldnt have to use the usb, but it would still only charge when i connect it to my computer. other then that its a great unit for the price. i have had 2 other chargers from other makers, and i would rather have this one than anything else out there.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ********* **************************** *********** This product is a big disappointment. This is a very old generation product, which was supposed to come out in the early 90's. They should of bought a newer model, and maybe even one made with better material. I have had my unit for two years. The first time I plugged it in I was very happy with its performance, and it worked well. The second time I ran it, I got a big black smoke signal. I ran this unit off a 12v battery and the first time was no problem. This time I tried to use the computer and a serial port and the power was off every time. After an hour of trying to fix this problem I gave up. I guess if the unit wasnt so old, they could have been smarter with it, but I cant trust my $5 product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This item worked great for my first time using it, it has to be very strong for the strain placed on it, however I am a novice with computers and computers can be fragile, not much more than my laptop. it would be great if there was a way to adjust the intensity, I think there should be. Also, if it is not broken by being dropped and dropped again it should be fine. Overall good product, but not worth the price.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Product, Works as Expected I was looking for an easy to use portable unit to read a computer's battery in the field or in a small apartment/office. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I wish it could have had an extra channel to run cable to a monitor or some kind of charger so I didn't have to carry all of this. I've found out the hard way that when you run the cable all the way to the monitor you can't plug the battery back in. When I tried to plug it back in, it said the voltage was 0, so it was no good. I think I just bought a cheap one, so I will be looking for another for my laptop as well. 's performance was fantastic. This thing could be used in a lot of situations. It is heavy, so you have to be careful about it. I recommend it to anyone who has to do field work.  is really good. Its easy to set up. - - - -

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _______________________________________________________________ I wanted to use my iRig with a Macbook Pro which had a Thunderbolt interface, but my iMac had a PCI Express port. I wanted the iRIG because I wanted a Thunderbolt device to go with it. I was able to use the iMac, but it was slow and the speed was so slow that I had to set the iLite Pro to 32-bit. When I tried to connect with the iKey, I get the message "No device connected, please check your driver software" After some troubleshooting, it was possible to connect the Thunderbolt to my MacBook Pro and run it under OSX Yosemite. I got a MacBook Air as a gift. I used it for a couple of months, and it was awesome, but in the last 2 months, it has become very slow. The first time I used my iKey in the Air, I noticed the display brightness turned down. I figured that maybe a light sensor in the iKeys was getting messed up or something, so I removed it. However, it is not turning it down anymore. It is just sitting at the lowest setting. I checked my MacBook Air's settings. I removed the brightness setting from the MacBook Air, and the brightness of the iKU turned down at the same speed. The other thing is that the iA-B which I used on my computer to play some songs now doesn't play at all. I had a hard time getting it to even boot on my MacBook. I would recommend people to get it and use it, but get the Thunderbolt interface if possible, because it does play nice with your computer.  by Daniel on July 19, 2013  Product: iKeyDuino 3.1 This is a great key. I purchased this key in my quest to have an USB flash drive that was compatible with both my Macbook and a Windows PC. I like that I can take my Apple/Windows flash drives out and put my ikey on it so I can quickly plug in a USB flashdrive and have it automatically detect and show me my key, then just leave it in my computer and have a connection to my flashdrive (via iKeyduino 3, which works great). If you want a USB key with both USB ports, this is not it. For USB flash drives, this key is very much overpriced. I paid $25 for it and a key fob, which I will use for flash drives.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPhone 4's touch screen and its buttons were a total hassle to use and the screen was too small for my hands. They made it worse by moving the power button from the top of the iPhone 5 to the bottom and adding a second row of buttons. The speaker system on the iPhone 4 is poor. I used a wireless speaker to replace my old analog one and it was worse. I'm still trying to find a replacement to make it decent. The display on the phone is horrible, not the best, but better than nothing. They've improved in software since then, but still not as good as my old one. The battery life is also terrible, usually around 30-40% before needing a charge. For the price I paid for it, I would have paid more.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was my first and only electronics purchase from ThinkGeek. I bought this to replace my old, expensive, clunky electronic keyboard, and I love it. I would have gotten the blue/purple one if they had it in stock, but I got the black/grey instead. I do not think that this is a good design or a good price for it. When I first plugged it in, it started beeping and buzzing at random times, as if it was doing the "auto reset" on the keyboard. It would do it after every 5 or so minutes, but it was definitely an annoying noise. The blue/black one does NOT do the auto reset. My old keyboard would never have done this, and it would have been better if it did. The new keyboard is perfect in every way. The only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the volume is not great. I didn't even notice that the auto-reset is not working for me until I saw the beeping every time I did the "autorun" command. I'm a newbie and didn't think of that.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------------------- I bought this product for my daughter, and she has had zero problems with it. I know some people have complained of the light flashing. It is not a big deal to me. I just get used to it. The only thing I would not recommend is that they should have made it in different colors (I really really want this to work with my pinky and ring finger) and added buttons. It would have been so much easier to use if it came with buttons, and I could use my pinkie and ring fingers to navigate the menu. Other than that, great product!  Rated 1 out of 5 by Mary from Awful I bought a pair of the "Energizer" pinkies two weeks ago for my granddaughter. I love pinkies and wanted her to be able to play with them. The first week I used her pinkie she refused to use them. She would scratch them and spit them out. Now she is very fond of them. They are very small for her and I had to cut the little wires off the battery to fit in her pinky finger. Not much of a toy.  Review of DJ0268-00 Submitted by: J. B. from Colorado My son has an iPhone which is very responsive. We bought these to get him into the DJ-I world and they are awesome. He plays his music and records his videos very nicely. It's hard to find buttons on most of these toys and he can use his fingers to change modes and use it with his thumbs. The battery lasts for about 10 hours and there are so many possibilities.  and they can be used with one hand and the other hand can do other things.  a real plus is the built in speakers  I wish they came in different colours and I wanted to have a "sneaky" pair of pinkies  But, this is the best toy that i have ever bought. -A  DJ-i -  Submitted by:-  My son has been using his iPhone and his new DJ-i's for two weeks and he LOVES them. He even plays the game on the phone while his DJ-s are playing. He can switch modes on the fly and he even uses the buttons on them. It really makes his DJ games much more fun. The batteries last a long time. They're small enough that they don't take up much room in his car. He doesn

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using this for a few months now, and it works fine, except it won't turn on, and then won't power on at all until you push the button... i guess its the battery i think, but if you are a big fan of mechanical keyboards then i would probably pass on this. but it is fun if you don't mind not being able to use it to play games. i bought this to use while i work at my desk and this is a huge help. its more stable than a regular keyboard.  Style of keyboard: This keyboard is pretty much a regular mechanical keyboard, but it has the best quality I've seen in an electronic keyboard so far. It comes with an LED backlit keyboard that comes with 5 pre-programmed keys, which you can program yourself (but it is not as easy as on a keyboard, as this keyboard doesn't have a backlight). There is a USB hub, as well as a usb and micro usb power adapter for this keyboard. One of the biggest downfalls of this keyboard is the quality of the aluminum, and the fact that it has to be used with an adapter, which is a pain to take out of the box. The only down side to this keyboard, is the fact the it can be kind of heavy to carry around. But if you can get past this, and use it for gaming, it will be well worth the investment.  of course there is the issue of what games can work well with it. However there are lots of PC games available for PC that work with this keyboard for sure. And also the fact it has programmable keys (which I find cool) is a plus. It is not perfect though, in that it requires the keyboard to be attached to a desktop or laptop which is not ideal, but this does not make it a bad product. We have to give it a 10/10 for having a better than average quality of this electronic keyboard. It was purchased to replace an old keyboard that had been on the computer for over a year. And this is not one of those "You can take it to the shop, you can buy it new for $50" keyboards. This is a keyboard for serious gamers. It has 5 pre programmed keys that are nice to use, it has a usb hub for those times when you need to recharge it. The key caps are fantastic, and I have to say I'm impressed, the color and finish on these

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device itself is just ok. I really like it but there are a few things that I don't like about it. I wish there was a way to mute the speakers on the unit if I needed to use the phone with another device, there is no button for that, you can also adjust the volume in the app, but there is only one setting, it's very inconvenient. Also, there are two different battery type, some have a built-in battery while others have to be charged manually by plugging it into the wall. And the camera does not work when the phone is charging or when the screen is off. This device is ok for general use but I would not buy again, I really do not need another camera on my phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In the box it came in. No batteries. No charger. No instructions. It just came with a tiny USB cable with a male plug and a female jack. It doesn't come with anything that could be used for a computer. It only has a standard micro USB connector, so you're either using an older version of USB or it's a crappy device.   It was hard to connect to my computer using the USB cable. The connector is too long and it just sits right against the USB port like it's going to fall out. I'm sure the connector is fine for another USB device, but not for a small computer. I ended up using a screwdriver to make it fit. It still wouldn't work. It's too long to be plugged in, which is a shame since there is a little tab at the bottom of the connector. I can't see the tab on my monitor because of the black line in the picture, but it's not on my screen.  , it didn't fit very well and it's the only thing that's made me lose hope in this device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is not an upgrade from an old phone. It can not be and the features that it offers are much more difficult to use and will not benefit you. The "back" button on this phone is just so small and difficult to press it does not work on any phone that has a back button that large. I also have an old cell phone and it has a very similar feature and the buttons work fine for that phone. The software updates are useless as they just show the latest version of the app. The phone has no screen on it and does not have the ability to make phone calls. I would say this phone costs $150 and it does very little. I am only using this phone as a phone as I can not use it as a camera. I can use it to send/receive text messages and I can make calls.

But it is the most accurate mouse i've had in a long time, and that is saying a lot for my mouse. But theres another thing that really bugs me, and it may sound weird but i feel like the button for my mic isnt even on my mouse (on my mouse i have the mic on the side, on this one it is on the top of the mouse) If it were on my right side it wouldnt feel like a mic button, if it were for my left hand it would probably not be necessary either, because the thing that takes up most of my space is on my left so it is annoying that i have to turn it around to my left for my right hand.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iknow what a big waste of money and time that this thing is! the batteries were not at all good and had to be replaced twice! The speakers were extremely weak and not very loud at all, and the mic did not work at all. The only way to use the thing is to use a special dongle that is made for the headset. The audio quality is terrible! If you use it on a TV or computer it sounds great because the speakers work but if you want to use it to listen to music this thing just is not very good at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, July 15, 2015  Does its job  by David from SLC ARIZONA USA  Pros: I use the sound device when I am watching TV or a movie in stereo. It makes the sound clearer and I also have it set as my primary headset.  Cons: None  Review: It is a decent headset but the quality of sound is terrible.  The sound is not too bad, but if I don't pay attention to what I am listening to the sound quality can be very poor. I am used to high quality audio so I was not surprised by this. It is not great, but it is passable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was a bad idea for a beginner, and I had the same experience.

By Michael L. on 05/01/2016 Michael L on 05-01-2016 I have several units in various brands and am fairly satisfied with them. I like the fact that I can adjust the volume with a knob on the back of the unit and it also has a microphone that is used in my car, making it a great value for your money. It is easy to turn on, works well, and comes with a CD that contains music and programs I use for working. If you are looking for an affordable, good quality remote that you can control your TV or stereo with the volume turned all the way up, then this is the unit for you.  and, it does not cost you anything.  a couple of suggestions and a note By Bill on 02/17/2016 Bill on 01-17-2016 This remote works very well. It can be used on the TV in my home with a receiver with the same brand. It has several features that make it nice. 1. It takes an on/off key on the remote. 2. It's a 2 port usb device. 3. It will take up to 4 ports in a networked computer. 4. It comes with the software that has all the program that you need. 5. It doesn't need an internet connection to work. 6. It does NOT run the risk of hacking. 7. It seems very solid. I wouldn't consider it a cheap remote, but I don't consider a $5 one either.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought these 3 times and they never work. I have an iphone and i dont have any problems with this,but when i put them in my iphono i get a lot of noise when im not using them at the moment. they make the music sound like it was recorded in a big room at a low volume. i cant explain why, i just have a feeling it is defective. i really wish the engineers and makers of the device would make some kind of a device that doesnt make noise like this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This device is a failure   It is unreliable   I am not sure why I wasted money on it   The screen cannot see any signal from the phone to the laptop   There is no wireless connection   When it says "No network available" it means it never connected the laptop to the network   Don't think I will buy another    Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, February 04, 2013  good product, bad packaging  by Richard from St. Charles MO USA  Pros: Works with my Apple computer, easy to use.  Cons: No power adapter, the included one was not compatible with my Macbook. .  "The device is an excellent device, with lots of features, great battery life, and a large memory.  The only problem I had with it is the packaging. It is a terrible design. The device came in two pieces, which is a great idea, but it is so poor quality that the plastic pieces of it separated after several days, and it is hard to put back together again. The two pieces that came out of the box were so cheap that I could break them with my fingernails. The box was really difficult to use, and took forever to ship, and the shipping label was not very clear about the return policy. I am going to have to return it and try to find a better one. Overall, it's a good device, very flexible, and simple to use."  Review: Bought this item in the first week of the purchase. After a week, it still had not worked. I contacted customer service and was advised to send it to apple. I sent it back. The next day the return confirmation email arrived in my inbox. I called to ask if I had won the $500 Apple Store credit, to which I was told the refund had been cancelled. It would be shipped out in 30 days. It wasn't until May 11 that I received the item in another package. The packaging was slightly different from the first one, but all in all a good product. -Richard  The following review is from: HEXUS 3G USB Adapter Works With iPhone 5  https://static.cargurus.com/images/forsale/2018/05/05  1875 Review of D-Link DFE-445N Mini Wireless Router with Bluetooth, 867 Mbps by Mike
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In January I bought the Zyxel DS-818, I had to buy the manual too as they are very hard to find.   I got the device on the 3rd of February and my first impression was that it was very heavy. It comes with a usb cable but when I plugged it into my laptop and connected it to my TV it was too noisy and had no sound output to the TV so I decided to get the 4 port usb hub.  , it was ok at first and it is a bit loud but its not loud enough that I cant watch movies or TV shows in HD.  .     My second impression was the size. It was so large that I had my phone in my bag to avoid it getting crushed and my daughter couldn't use it.   the power button was on the front so I had it on the ground, I tried to use it and it wouldn't work, I didn't think I was going to use that feature for my main computer and I'm not going to because the power buttons are on the sides.  -   Overall the device works ok as long as the USB port is plugged in and the power switch is on, if your not sure what you are doing don't plug it in, and for the size, it is great.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this tablet for about a year now and i love it. one of the only things that makes this device worth buying is the fact that you can plug this thing into your pc, computer, tv, and listen to music or use it as a media player. i did not like that they had to have an internet connection for this because it does not have an internal cd rom drive. you can only listen to your own cd and use it to play mp3 files. if you were to download a full mp3 of your favorite artist and were to buy it at full price this thing would be awesome because you could burn the cd to a cd that could be burned to the tablet and have a cd burner. also this thing is pretty good for the money. it does run pretty hot and requires the use of a fan. if i ever wanted to play a game i would put it in sleep mode and use my tablet as a monitor. i dont know about you but i am a lot more productive using this than my macbook pro. if that was my only reason to buy this i would have.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive owned a samsung usb drive for about 3 years now but after 3 years of heavy use it has begun to fail. the usb drive itself is very good and i had nothing but great things to say about it but i know its time for me to buy a better drive. ive been reading all the negative reviews here and i think i might have to get a new one. i love my new samsung drive and i will definitely keep it on but ive never liked samsungs products that much.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------  After installing this device I couldn't use it as my computer is too old and needs to be replaced but I'm having fun with it!  The unit has no backlight which is pretty much useless for the night so if you like to see where you are on your screen you better keep it turned off to prevent eye strain from the bright screen.  I'm glad it was a freebie from Amazon, a lot of us can't afford to spend $300 on a smart phone.  is very loud and you will be covered in sweat after a few minutes, and if you have any problems with the device you can't help but to blame the phone. I'll keep using it and try to fix any problems I may have but for now I'm disappointed and will not be buying another one.  of 0 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst smart TV I have ever owned. The sound quality is horrible. When you turn the TV on it makes very high pitched noises, and the tv does not have very good picture quality. I have seen worse in the stores. I love watching movies with my wife and my son, but the picture quality is awful, you can not see very clearly, the sound is terrible, and my wife refuses to watch with me because she feels the picture is poor. The only good thing is that we have the remote control that we can use, and it is very handy when you need to change channels. So if you want to watch movies in HD or for children, this is not the TV for you.  Rated 4 out of 5 by ljb from Great product, but not quite up to expectations I bought this TV in December 2015. I was not disappointed. The first thing I noticed was the low input lag. It is so low that it feels as if it's skipping frames. I also found the picture on a few channels a little darker than other TVs. The picture quality on some channels is better than on other TVs I've owned, but for those channels where it doesn't matter, it's not bad. Other than the picture, I am satisfied with the TV. I watched most of the NFL playoffs this past season with no issues. I wish they had a lower input lag and better picture quality in some of the TV's lower end models. It seems like a small price to pay to be able to watch TV without waiting for a commercial break to load.  with all of that said, I found that I can't use the input control that comes with the remote because it's hard to locate. I've looked online and don't see many options. I don't think there is a simple way to add that. It could be easy to add to the remote, but I am not sure if there's anything easy about that. I'm just not sure how to add it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for a week, and it does not work, i cant turn it off, its a little hard to get off, and the battery is not re chargeable, i got it off my wife, she used to use one when she was younger, but it was a little small to work with the way it works in the car, so i got one from online, and now when i do plug it into the battery it doesnt work. i called Apple and told them how the battery was and they dont help me, they said its not a problem and im just a dumb dumb consumer. i had to give it away because it wasnt working any more.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was hesitant to purchase this item but once I did, I was not disappointed. The first couple of times I used the unit, I got a little annoyed with the vibration function which is very much like a vibrator. However, after a few times, I learned to enjoy it. The only issue I had with this product was that when I used it to record my girlfriend having sex with another man, the unit stopped recording. However there is an easy fix to this problem. The unit should have a power switch to turn it off. I also noticed that it would work better if there was a removable attachment that would hold it on and it would not leak all over. I recommend this unit if you're looking for something that works well and works for you.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I am a college student. This thing is useless. The bluetooth is a nightmare. I would say it's like the old iPhone 3G. The app is buggy and takes forever to load. Even when you get to it, the screen is black. The speakers are horrible. They suck. They give off horrible sound. The controls are weird and hard to find, especially for my young son who is not very tech savvy. This is not for me. I tried to get the phone number for a phone expert who was helpful. I ended up getting a free app and the website. Then I bought a new bluetooth device for $20 because it's supposed to work with the older model. I got the new bluethom, which is supposed to be a new model that I could get rid of. Then after using it for a few weeks, I decided to buy a different bluetooth unit, which would work with my old phone. It took me a week to find the new unit. I'm hoping it works. Maybe I just got bad bluetooth devices from another source.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- I purchased this product to monitor my baby's temperature. After just one day, the device began to malfunction. The thermometer went completely out of calibration, and had to be taken out of service. The unit is an older model with a more expensive display, but was purchased for its capacity and ease of use. The display is very easy to read, but the temperature indicator doesn't seem to always be accurate. After using it one day and returning it for a refund, I've found another product with the exact same functionality, and better display.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ____________ I have a new LG Smart TV, and it doesn't look good at all. The bottom of the tv has no speaker, the side of the TV is cracked and scratched. I have all of the cables and have yet to find the cord that is coming from the side to the tv. The tv is also very bright, but if it gets really bright at times I will have to turn off the brightness so the colors are not so bright. I am really disappointed with this product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------------------- I purchased this phone to replace my old Samsung Galaxy S2 which I no longer use, and while the phone itself is a good phone (good screen, fast, and good battery life), it just does not work right with the "Galaxy Note 5" which came with the phone. Everything I wanted (battery life, multitasking) does not appear on this phone and the "Notes" app is just unusable (there is no way to look up a person's name, a place to write a review about an event, or anything). I will no longer purchase the phone, since the only good thing I got out of it was a "Galaxie" case, which is great. --------------------------
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "I have been using a Tascam DR-80 for some time now. I have owned a couple of them. I was expecting this unit to be better than the others, but this unit does not have any of the features the others had. I also can not get the software to work. It will not play anything, and no one has tried to fix it. I think this is due to the fact that it is made in China and probably not designed to be plugged into an electrical outlet."   I got this for a Christmas gift. I bought the DR-70 and DR-200 on ebay and received the DR80 about a week later.   Here is my complaint about the Tascams:   -They do not have stereo out on the front of the unit. You can connect to the output on the back of the DR20 and still get stereo out out on it.   The same problem applies to the DR60 but I am not sure how to fix that problem, since I only have one output.  'so, I really like the interface and how they work. I'm not sure I would get another one just for the stereo out. You get what you pay for.   the interface is just ok. It is not bad for its price. The software for the interface was terrible. The only thing that works is the recording of your voice into your PC which is pretty much useless.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is great if you only use it to listen to music on a Bluetooth device, or to connect to a computer to run a music program. But if you have the chance, I would like to get it for a real desktop computer so I can use it as a monitor. I wish it had an HDMI input, but it does. You can't plug the monitor into the computer either! I also wish it was able to change modes. I can't have both stereo and surround at the same time.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was a bit sceptical at first, as the reviews said the device worked but was just a paperweight - but after a day or two of use I am glad I got it - it is very good, simple and efficient.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  this device is broken.  It does not work.    I have ordered two of these.  The first one was supposed to work but never did.  It did not even work when the battery was low, the indicator light didn't flash.  I will no longer be buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product will not work properly or reliably. The device does not come with batteries and will not charge if the batteries are removed. Also the buttons are so small that you cannot use the device as intended without being able to read the small print. It will be very annoying to be forced to use the battery as a tool. I purchased this product for my father who is a retired mechanic, and I'm glad I did. His old tools did not work as well as they should have done. I will not recommend this product. I love my new e-stick and its great for travel!  I use it while traveling for work, and i will definitely use it for more.  Its a very easy to use device, and has very good battery life for when you are traveling.    I recently bought a new estick.  The device is well made and easy to handle.  It works very well as an external power source for my laptop.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants an external USB source for their computer.  The estick is a perfect portable e-reader. It is small and light, it has a good read and charge time.  If you need to read ebooks on the go, this is the one to get.      This is a good portable ereader, with excellent reading and charge times.  For a little over $40, the estick was worth every penny.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------------------- You need to buy another item to get a proper warranty, this is a great product if you don't want to wait and just use it for music but i just got mine and i think it's a pretty bad design. You need the battery to be in the bottom of the device. You can't get the battery out unless you open it all the way, and that's really annoying. You also have to take out the battery on the sides, and this sucks. I also have a pair of headphones and the battery is not in the headphones but rather in the battery holder. The headphones are great but they can't handle that kind of a heavy battery. The sound is not as good as other headphones and that sucks. You don't need a charger for it either. I would rather have a better battery holder than that.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    1. Bad screen: This thing is bad. I've had to replace the screen twice. It won't work with the HDMI connection. The picture is completely washed out, and the colors are awful. I had to pay for a new monitor and spend $100 on an adapter. I was told that the screen should be replaced due to the voltage problem. I'm not convinced that it's the monitor, so I don't trust it.   2. Bad sound: This isn't good, either. I tried switching the sound to speaker, and it still sounds terrible. It has the same bad sound as the first unit. There's nothing good about it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________   I got my Zumo 5 years ago and it's still running after years of heavy use. The battery doesn't hold a charge, but that can't be helped. It just needs to be charged. So far, it works fine. I've had two batteries and they are still going strong. The only con I have about this phone is that you can't buy the charging cords for it in Australia so I was going to have to buy them in Australia too. The case does feel great. It's a little bit small on me but it's nothing I couldn't handle.   You can tell the quality of this phone from the picture on the website. It looks good. It doesn't look cheap at all. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for an iPhone but is concerned about the size.  .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have this wireless headset for my PS4, and it is super handy.   When I go into a multiplayer game, it is almost impossible to get a signal. The headset has a very nice frequency, and when I am on the phone, and trying to make calls, it gets very annoying because my headset is far away.   is there a way to tell when you are actually getting a call?   It is not a major problem for me, but it is very annoying.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am not sure if I need this new device or not as there are so many similar devices in the market, but after using it for about a week, I can tell the difference. I love how the device can be used to control my car and not to worry about my car key. When I open it, I don't get this annoying sound, it just comes out of the device. I will be sure to order another one of these in the near future. Thanks  My new daily driver:    I had my first car alarm installed a few months ago and was very disappointed that it did not work all the time. I had to open my car to use my phone because my car alarm didn't work when I left the car on. I also didn't like that I had a key on my key chain and so had to be concerned about my keys if I left them in the car. When this happened I knew that I would have to purchase a new key chain/car alarm. I researched and read all the reviews and decided to go with this alarm. It came with the necessary tools to install and it was easy to install. It works great, it is very loud and gives you enough warning to unlock your car. I'm very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend this product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this to replace a old computer and it has worked great.  But, I just cannot live with it anymore. The power adapter that comes with it is not a USB and you need to order a new one that does work as a USB.  I got a new power adapter, but it is almost impossible to change out the old power adapter for the new one because it has a hard connection and it seems to keep popping out.  It also doesn't charge at all.  The battery is very old, I have owned it for about 2 years, but I bought the latest computer to use it on and it takes a lot of power.  Not only that, but even after a hard reset it still won't charge. I also replaced it with the new version and still no charge.  This has just gotten to be a headache to me. If you can not live with this one, at least get a power adapter with USB and not the old one that doesn't work with your computer.  5/5 I can't live without it. I have been using the original MacBook Pro power brick since it came out in 2007, I've had no issues. The battery life was always good, it still lasts until now, I'm still using it on my iPhone 5. The only thing I did to it was to use a USB2 cable for my computer. Now when I plug the power adapter into the computer to charge the battery it still doesn't last a long time. The cable does not allow me to plug and unplug my charger as I would like. The laptop would run out of juice even though I didn't use my keyboard or mouse. I bought this to take with me when traveling. I travel all over the US for work and school. I've never seen anything that matches the power and durability of this adapter. -Brett S., Sacramento, CA  My laptop and iMac use the same charger. I haven't been able to get a second one, it always shuts off with no warning. I'll just have to buy another one!  I don't like how this power brick was discontinued. I paid quite a bit to get it so it was unfortunate that it would not be offered anymore. I can only hope that the new ones come in a USB port as well.  the original one is like a baby, and the new USB is like having a whole computer in my bag. , San Diego,

Then the next time I was working and the TV started working but did not look like the last time. I was trying to make the picture brighter by going to another channel and the picture was the same.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for about a year and i used it with my iphone. ive now moved to an iphones and i cant find a way to get this back to it's factory settings. it's dead in there. i will never buy another from the manufacturer again!  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from A very good value for the money Good value for money. I would have liked to see it have more battery life (1 year of constant use on 3G network), but it works fine. Would be nice to see a little more LED on the back - I think it would have been better to see the charging icon.  Great product at a great price. Great service. Great quality. I love my iPhone 6s and I have never had an issue with a device so I cannot give a negative one to this iPhone. Great product for the price. I have used it for a couple of weeks and have had no problems. Would have given 5 stars if it worked for a little longer.  the only problem i see is the charging. the charging cable is a little too short. the charger does not seem to work on all chargers. the iPhone does not charge on the charger. it takes around 4 hours of constant charging. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My old computer has a terrible sound. I put this in a rack with my iMac and it worked flawlessly, until the iMac turned on one day and the computer became completely frozen. The computer would not turn on! The only thing it did was show an error message saying that I could not connect it.   A week later I found that the battery had died. I had no way to change the battery. So, I got a battery replacement. But it only lasted 5 days, so it would not be worth the money. I tried to call Dell and they didn't answer. I couldn't find an Internet store that had the replacement for the same price. I called and spoke to a customer service person, she told me that the replacement did not work because the computer was not certified. And when I told her I did not know that it was not certifed, she had a big giggle and said that the computer would be replaced anyway. So I gave up and got a different computer.  , May 7, 2015  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, June 30, 2015
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just got this phone. When I got the phone, it came with a 3 month warranty. I was impressed that it came to me with a warranty. The phone is beautiful and looks beautiful with the gold, the display is nice, it has a built in speaker, the front and back cameras are amazing, the phone has a fingerprint sensor, the speaker is great and so is the battery. The battery last 2 days, it charges really quick and the software that comes with it is good, but the phone is a little hard to set up. There is no voice mail function, there is no call waiting feature, so you have to make the calls yourself, there are no messages on the display. The 3G feature is useless because the phone does not go over 3G. The only thing that I would change is to give the display a black color so you can see the screen, because it's just so beautiful! I also didn't like that it didn't come with the phone and a charger. It would have saved me a lot of time. I didn't know that it also came with the extra case.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Mark from I'm an Android User and this phone is awesome I love the phone. I have an iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c is just sooooo slow. This phone is super fast. I love that it has more functions than the iPhone, like it has the ability to play videos, music, photo's, and more. The camera is great. The screen is amazing.  (update) The phone works better now that it doesn't use the 2x2 antenna. It doesn't get a lot louder when you make calls, but it is a whole lot clearer. I also added a 4.0 screen to mine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: **********************   A bit expensive for the quality. I was able to play 4K with the camera, but not with the bluetooth adapter. This is my third computer I own from this company, and it is definitely the last.   The best thing was, after I returned it, the manufacturer refunded the money. The software was crap.   a bad computer: *********   I got this computer when I was a student in the US and used it for a few months. After I got a new one, it's horrible. Every program is corrupted and the screen is so small. I hate how you can't get it to turn off and on when the computer is plugged into a computer. The keyboard is also extremely bad. Not good for typing.   in short: ************   So I don't recommend this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used my gsm for a while but recently decided to switch to an apple and my gs didn't really like apple products at all. i switched to an android and the gs worked great for about 10 years and then the last time i purchased one it had an error on the screen that the gsm was unable to work with. i replaced the phone and was very happy, the screen was still there and the phone worked flawlessly. then i upgraded to apple's mobile site and a few days later the phone would not turn on. my old phone had a great camera that was working fine. my new phone was not. my gsl didn't have a problem with it. I decided to purchase another gsl because i had been using mine for 6 years and it worked fine. I bought it and when i put it on my computer it wouldn't power on. after doing some research i found that the computer must have the power adaptor in the wrong place, and that there is a defect in the power adapter. i called apple and they told me to return it, and i did. i contacted apple and the gentleman that helped me with the phone said they had made a mistake in the assembly of the device. so, i am waiting for a new one to arrive to find out what the problem is with my phone. I'm glad i did not get the old phone.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my phone, I didn't know it was a phone. It's a small device, not much space for a keyboard and no battery. It came with a very small battery and the battery does not charge very fast. I'm sure it was meant for mobile phones, which require less charging than the tablet. The keyboard feels cheap. The tablet is a different story, and works great. It has a large screen and is more stable to move around. I really like the keyboard.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the 3 year warranty on my iphone 4 and iphones 2, and the iPhone 4 battery died within a month.   I bought another one and it worked like a charm.  The only thing is when I first put it in my car it took forever to start.  I have no idea why it didn't start the first time.  After the initial start up it wouldn't turn on again.  My dad and I were doing a drive by and it kept shutting off and wouldn't start, so I took it to a car dealership and they got it fixed for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone 4 with a bad screen and camera: poor camera, poor screen quality, screen is very tiny, iphones keyboard is hard to use (not to mention that the "e" button is very hard to press) the only good thing about this iphon is the battery life it has lasted me about 9 days of constant heavy use, but after that the screen went from good to bad. This is my second iphona but I do not recommend to anyone who does not know what they are doing as they are very expensive and don't work.  I do not care much for these phones. I have had three and I have not found a reason to use them. They are just too small to be able to use the standard features (i.e. camera, email, voice mail, maps, social media, etc.) They have a screen, but the resolution is too low to be used for a large screen. Their keyboards are awful and the "swipe up/down" to navigate is a nightmare. I don't know where these phones are, but I don,t think they are made anymore. I have tried the iphons on three different phones and all three had issues. One had a dead battery and the screen was so bad I had to return it. Then there was the other two that had been opened and refurbished by the same company (they all came from the same box). On the other hand, I found a new replacement for my other iphoned. I was shocked when I found out that the same thing happened to my iphoner. I had purchased it online from another source for less than $100 and now it was being returned. This was a major mistake.   Overall, I think these devices are just not designed well for mobile use, and I am surprised that the manufacturers would think that there is a demand for such a device. If you want a small device that can be used with a keyboard, you may want to look elsewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _______________________________________________________________________________  "I got this for a birthday gift and I am so very unhappy with this purchase. First of all, this isn't an android. This is a BlackBerry which makes this thing feel completely out of touch. My first phone was a Motorola Razr and I loved it. I tried a BlackBerry for a while. My girlfriend also loves her phone. But this one is garbage. It is too expensive, has terrible battery life and not nearly as good as a real Android phone. My second issue was the camera was terrible. It took photos that looked like they were taken with a cheap flash. There was no quality difference from my phone. It was blurry. And I'm sure I will have to send it back because it wasn't worth the money spent. All in all, it is a great price for a good Android but if you want a real BlackBerry feel free to buy the real Android. Buy the BlackBerry Curve too.

I haven't seen any other computer this small that has had as many problems as this one. I'm now using my older (older) mac mini, so I just replaced the motherboard in my new one, as the motherboard is still the same. I replaced the RAM in my old computer with the new RAM from this computer, just as well as this computer did with my old system. I recommend this product.  and the people that have used it before me, say, "that thing runs just like a mac!"  (I'm not sure what a mac mini is.)  Good luck.  was this review helpful to you?

I've tried different cables and no luck either. it works fine if you turn it on but it's really slow. this thing is just for watching videos but really Ive gotten through my whole house with a single power outlet but this thing doesn't even turn that on. i hope someone can tell me how to get it to work since its such a pain to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a Dell Inspiron 5550-5200, a very nice computer with a lot of memory, good screen, and a lot less of a lag than a laptop. However, it was very slow when I started up, even after using the included CD with windows to try to fix my Internet connection. This was my first computer. The computer worked fine for the first few months I had it. It was not the best performing, but its not the worst either. After about a year of not using the computer much, I decided to do some research on what the problem was and I found out the computer had to be turned off to reset. So I did some research and found there was a cheap computer that worked for me but it was a little hard to configure. Then I found another website that claimed the Dell 5550 was not being recognized on their website so I was able to buy it from a third party for $60. This computer has been working perfectly since then, but I really need something better if I am going to be using this computer for much longer.  Rated 5 out of 5 by dz from The best product and best price in my shop! The only problem I have with it is when the memory is low (and it will be a lot) I have to keep it on a low, low setting just to keep a computer running. This one is a life saver because if it keeps your computer running you have no worries. . ,,,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using my dl for over a year now and i can see no difference. i've been looking at other products, but i cant seem to get past this one. i guess im just really bad at reading what it does. it would be really great if i could have all the features of an expensive digital camera, but have to pay more for a cheaper digital camera.  Other Thoughts on the Canon DLS: its a pretty good camera. Its not quite as good as my D50, but it does what i need. ive also used it a lot with other cameras. It is very easy to use. its not the highest end camera, it does not have the best lens or anything, but that's because there is nothing better.  i do like it a little bit, but not as much as i liked my d50  Would buy again, but...  This is a great camera for what it is. I use it for weddings, portrait sessions, landscape photography, landscape video, video and stills photography for my own web page and I love the features. But I am going to recommend this to someone that really needs a great compact camera that can do it all. I do not own this camera but would buy it again. I would love to see some extra features added that would make this camera a great value for everyone  Great for travel This is my go to camera for travel and for wedding video. I've used it for the past year and have been very happy with it. Great for travel, the camera has a solid metal body with a rubberized grip that is comfortable to hold. The only downside is that the battery gets hot when shooting long bursts of video but it can easily be replaced with a standard AAA battery. The camera has nice built in flash. It doesn't have an LCD screen or a built in speaker, but I use a boom mic that I got at the local camera store. The battery lasts me about 2 hours for a long day of shooting, and it's charged through a USB port. It charges from a 2.5-6V DC power source in about 30 minutes and takes about 3.5 hours of continuous video at a full zoom with auto focus. The size of the camera is perfect, and is compact enough to fit into any backpack or purse. It has the right sized grip and the built in pop up flash is great for lighting up my environment. My only complaints is the
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------------------- I was very excited to get this device. It looks great, and the screen is very nice and bright. However, the sound of the speaker is horrible. It makes a low tone, even at high volume, and also it makes a weird buzzing noise while the device is on. This is probably my least favorite thing about this device, but it will not get in the way of my watching my movies, or playing games. I recommend this to only watch movies with a DTS sound track. It is not worth the money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------This product was a waste of money, it has so many things that could be easily done with cheaper products.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! You buy a bad device, you are going to have to buy a new one. If you want the best you're going to buy one that is better.  I am a fan of all my Sony products. I purchased the X930D and was looking forward to having a waterproof camera on my camera backpack or purse. I have never had a problem with it or it's performance, the camera even has a USB port so it can be used with any computer. However the X940D did not work in my computer. It froze and started to record when I attempted to copy video from my computer to the camera. There were several times when the camera froze before going back to work. I was unable to find any information on the internet and then found this website. I am disappointed with my purchase. I wish I would have looked for a better deal at the time of purchase but if I was to buy it again I would look for a computer that does not freeze.  the Sony X940d!!!  Pros - Easy to use and great image quality.  in a small package - very compact and portable. / Mike  Cons - Camera froze before it worked properly - Sony does not always support old models - not very waterproof - the USB port is useless -

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had this for about 4 months and finally broke it.

I think this is going to do the same thing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!  I bought my new laptop in January, so it was too late for it to be shipped, but it arrived in very good shape.   However, the warranty on the laptop lasted only 3 months. I was told that they sent me a new one but I did not receive it before it was due to expire. I called the store and was told they would try and send me another one but they did not know what day the new laptop would be coming in. I also called the company to see how they could do that as they had to send the one that I had bought. The representative who answered the phone said it would cost me around $40.00, to replace the faulty laptop and send it back to them. But if I did that and it did not work, then they would give me a refund. I explained to them that I was only in the office for about 2 hours that morning and that I did NOT want a refund and that the computer was faulty.  Then the rep said that she had had a similar situation where a new laptop had not been sent out and that she could not do anything for me as they did NOT have a new computer coming in within a short time. So I hung up.  .    I went to the store today and was informed that it was just a bad phone call and they would do their best to get me a replacement computer. This was not good, as the first thing I asked her was how long it would take to ship the replacement to me.   and they are just out of time.   the new one should be here in 3 to 4 days.   The last part is my main concern. I've been using my laptop all day every day, and in the last two weeks it's been really making me really sick. The computer is getting a little hot to the touch. It will not idle and is constantly on.  :  So what can I do to avoid having to go through all of this trouble again? Is there any way they can send a replacement by courier? I've seen the computer for sale on ebay for around $200.00 so it would be cheaper for me to just buy a new, but then it would not work out at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had an iphone 4s since oct 2011. it was so bad it was a pain in the ass to use. ive tried everything from a new iphones to iphontact phones to macbook pro and iphonedos devices and its horrible. there is a major battery charge and a major charge time and ive seen as much as a month of use on a full charge of an ipleak. the screen and the internals all dont work together at all. the ipod and ipod nano both have very poor battery life and ipleaks both are terrible. i couldnt get a single working day on the iphon from day one. there was a lot of software updates but none of them solved the problem. ive had it 2 1/2 years but ive been told that ipleks get so bad ive have to buy a new ipod every 1-2 months because of the problems i get. i wish i had just bought an iptheme. i just cant justify the price at $800 if iplek hasnt fixed this problem yet. i hope i never have to replace it again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have two iphones, both purchased at the same time from the same company, in order to make the most out of my unlimited plan.  I only use one of the phones, the other I use mostly to send messages, read emails, and play games.  In the past two weeks, both my iphone and my tablet have suffered a severe battery failure.  On my android I haven't been able to use it at all.  My tablet will power on and run, but the battery has completely died.  The screen goes blank every few seconds and then dies again.  It was only two weeks ago that I used my ips at the bar to check the time.   The iphonest has also died twice, one in the same place and once with no warning.  Neither phone lasted more than a few minutes before shutting down.  If I had known, I would have bought the iphona instead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________ A total waste of time and money. When I was using the phone to connect to the internet I had the phone vibrate a few times. I then switched off the phone for a minute then switched it back on. That was the first and only time it worked. When it came back on, it connected the first time but not the second time. ___________ I bought this phone about 1 year ago and I am still not happy with the device. I cannot get the GPS to work and it was not designed to be used in any sort of car environment. I have to carry it around in a case that is way too big for it and the charger. I am going to get rid of it when my money runs out. I got this phone as a birthday present from my parents and I love it. But, I was extremely disappointed in it because of its poor performance.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******** My son has the Galaxy S4, and I can't wait to get a new one! The first two times I put it together, it was a bit of a pain (he is 5.5ft tall), but I ended up getting him a really awesome case. Unfortunately the second time I put together, he started having problems. He put it into his car and it wouldn't work. He looked at it for a bit, then put it back in the car (this time it worked), but then started acting like his car broke! He went looking for a new car and when it wouldn"t start up, I finally had to take it apart. I couldn"t figure out why it wouldn.t work, so I put the battery in and it started working. Since then, it"s been working fine, but I have noticed that the screen is getting pretty cold, and the screen has gotten more blue when I put in the battery. The screen also looks a bit bent. I am going to give up on getting it working and just buy another phone to use with my boy, and hopefully it doesn't come back to life when we take the car apart.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "This thing is a joke! I've replaced one in my computer for the last 15 years! I bought the first version, then the second version was less than half the price and the third was a complete fail! This thing is so bad I had to go and get another one for the same computer in the same house! I got the USB port and the power plug for it, but I got one of the parts for it that was a mistake, the adapter, it is just for the back up, you need to use the USB connector. Then the power adapter, which is the biggest waste of money you could ever think of!   When I bought this, I thought this was a good deal, now that I've had to deal with it, I'm not so sure I want to go through the effort of buying another. You could have just bought the power converter and have saved yourself money. I am still going to get the adapter to get more usb ports, but it will just have to do."

It has many flaws and it is no doubt a poor quality product.   and it still will not show the battery level in time.  This is very disappointing. You will pay a lot more and spend time and money to fix it up. No I don't care how much they try to do it is a problem in and of itself.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________________________________________________ The unit came without the batteries which you need to charge the phone, I called customer service the next day they sent me the batteries in a few days. After the warranty has expired I will get another unit from them and they are all the same but at least they send you the batteries! I would not buy another phone this phone is the worst!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, July 03, 2013  Good phone but not enough  by James from Tukwila WA USA  Pros: Light weight and good battery life  Cons: Some features are buggy  Review: I had a couple of phones on my list and decided to try this one due to the small size and weight. It is not a bad phone, but I have to say that the battery life isn't what I expected. It runs about the same as the Droid, but does not seem to last nearly as long. The camera works great and you can download more apps to it than your phone, if you pay attention to what you are doing with it. The only problem I had was the "back button" on the side of the device which sometimes did not work. But other than that, I've had nothing bad to say about it so far! ,  What was your experience? Like it? Dislike it? Please share your thoughts in the comments!  the best smartphone I have ever used  By R. from St. Joseph MI USA .  The best smartphone  I've used several different smartphones, and this one is the best in almost every way. If you are looking for a phone, you can't go wrong with this one. The design is great, and it has amazing battery life (3-4 weeks) which I have never experienced before. I love how the software works, and how it syncs with your computer/tablet.  on top of that it comes with a nice camera and a decent audio jack, all for a very reasonable price.  for all the good, there is something wrong with the other phones. the battery is not as good as the Galaxy s3. also it has a bad "light-saver" feature. I have a Galaxy s4, and that is a much better phone. .   I am a new owner of the Xperia Z Ultra. I bought this phone after my Z1. The first few days it had

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my iphone for 3 years now. I've got a couple of things that come out of the box in terrible condition. i got a broken camera and a scratched iPhone case. ive sent both back and paid to have them repaired. it cost $30 and it was done at the same time as the repairs. i can't believe how poorly designed these things are. iphones and tablets have been better designed for over a decade. they should not have to use adhesive to keep the case and screen on the phone. i could have sent the phone to my cell phone store for repairs.   Pros: good battery life for a long period of time (4 or more years), works very well, easy to install iphon app, works with all the different models of ipho. Cons: no camera or speakers or even earpiece, not waterproof, cannot use with iphono or iphink.  Review of 5 Zephyr: I was searching the net for a battery for a new phone. I stumbled upon this website and saw that the battery for the Zephyrus iphona was good for about 5 years with average use. The price and features made me pick it up quickly.   The Zephyrs battery lasted me 4 years without changing a charge (with a 3.3v lipoly). I've had this phone for 3 months and used the battery every day.  : I have a very large pho I had the battery replaced 2 times with the same results. They don't replace the battery unless you get a bad one. The phone also doesn't last as long with that bad battery.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!The remote control on this unit is terrible. I tried it twice on different times, with different sets of batteries. I had to put on a new battery every time. They could have done a better job on the battery selection. The remote does not allow you to change the setting. It's very simple to adjust the volume, brightness and other settings on this remote, which is why I would not recommend it. I bought this for the kids and the batteries lasted a full week. I have 2 small children, and the battery will not last that long. If it lasted 2-3 months, I would give it a 5 star rating. Other than the remote not being convenient, I can't say that I am completely disappointed in this unit. I do wish the batteries would last a longer period of time.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from I love my TV! I had a TV for almost 25 years and just recently moved to a new house. After reading all the bad reviews and having trouble finding a good one, I decided to give this one a try. It is awesome! No sound problems. Works great. Not too hot (no heating or cooling). No color problems (no bleed). Works great with DVR!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product came without a charger, so you have to use a usb cable. The cable is terrible, and the plug itself is just the right size. I use my iPhone and iPod and can plug them directly into the device and have no problem. However, for a $50 product, that isn't good enough.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this monitor for an outdoor wedding and the first time I used it I was so disappointed in it's performance that I returned it. I had a small problem, my picture would sometimes change color as I moved it around the screen. I tried to send it back and get the warranty serviced, but they said I needed to call the company and get a service tech that could do it for me, because this was my first one, which was a shame because I was looking forward to using this for my wedding. I ended up having to pay for the service to have someone take my monitor apart for me. I've heard good things about this company in the past but I'm not about to take a chance on having to call them. I'm glad I got the chance to go to my first wedding.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As far as this little device goes, I really enjoyed it. It took a few tries to figure out the most convenient way to get through the small door to the side of the toilet. When you get to the door, you turn it on, and it activates the water jets in the shower area, so the water comes out pretty quick. Unfortunately, it took me 3 tries to find it. Now, I'm not really into doing any kind of fancy water trickery. I just like a strong running shower. The water jets made the shower a little hotter than I prefer, but I don't know if that's my fault. I can always just turn off the water when I'm done showering, or turn it up a bit when I get in the car. The shower is okay, just a little on the hot side. It's definitely a bit more comfortable than a normal shower.   Now, since I have this in my room, I can do all my hair stuff and stuff and the shower doesn't even bother me anymore. I don the shower after I finish my meal or before bedtime. If I'm in the middle of a task, I just turn it off and put my things away. It takes about 5-10 minutes for it to warm up.  I like how it works.  : I had a problem with this shower being a little too hot. It was only a little and it wasn't too uncomfortable but it wasn  As for the rest of it - the device works great! I've done a couple different things and all has gone well.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There is no headphone jack and it only has 2 USB-C ports. I bought this for a small laptop with my iPad Air and my iPhone 6. I have been very happy with my purchase, the only issue I had with it is that I have had my iPhone on it now for over a month and it will not charge from it but it would still connect to the laptop. I also purchased a wired headset and the only time it worked was when I was using my laptop which is why I took this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!!!! This thing was so cheap, and they had no clue how to use it. It wouldnt power on. And then after a week, the screen would go black and the charger would quit working. Now after 2-3 days of trying to fix it and it just keeps going and it wont charge. This thing is not worth the price. I will NEVER buy another product from them. If you don't know how to operate the thing, then stay away.  No More Purchasing From The Factory This is the first time I've ever given a store my business. Their service is very poor and it's hard to get things delivered to the store. But for their price and quantity of products that they have, they have my business for a very long time.  the screen goes white, the charger goes down. This was the first one I purchased. They sent the device in, I had to use the 2nd charger (3rd) to make it work. I had bought a 2nd one and then the screen went out. I called them, I told them it would take 2-10 minutes for them to get my second unit. I was told by a customer service person, "Don't worry about it, I will make it right" After 10 minutes, I called, said the charger is failing, and gave a few more details. The customer service was helpful and told me I could get a replacement for a much cheaper price. The replacements came, I just had to go pick it up. If the second unit had not worked, I would have been able to get the replacement for less money than what they gave me. I wouldn't recommend them, they don't deserve your business. .  that screen went black, the top of the charger was all burned off. this was my first purchase with them. I contacted their customer service and they responded with 2 days. When I called back, they only had 2 days left. I then called, told them I would be there in 30 min, and that I would also need to have the phone in case the phone charger wasn't working. I explained all of this to the person I spoke to, he told me to just keep calling back. i called back and explained all the above, he said it was not my problem, that i should call the store the next day, when they open. He then advised me that if I did not call the next morning, it would not
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was a pretty cool toy. But I was using it in the shower and it was just a mess, no fun for me. My wife found a very similar model and loved it, so we bought it. I was having to put it on her breasts to see if it would feel good, but no. It didn't even turn on. Maybe it was defective, maybe it was my fault for not using it right. But it ruined it for me!!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! My last electronic device, an iMac, failed on me a few years ago. It worked for months, and then after some time, the iMac just shut down. The problem is the Apple remote was faulty in one of the buttons. If you're looking for an i-pod or any of these things, you won't find it in Apple's stores. I hope this helps.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Robert P. from Easy to set up but requires calibration Very simple to set this up. Just connect to your computer and the computer will ask you to calibrate the device. The device only functions when it receives the correct calibration signal. In the past, I've used a simple $5 calibration device, but this one works much better. I wish the calibration feature was available in the app. Otherwise, I like the app very much and would definitely recommend it to others.  and if that wasn't enough, after one month I've still got the remote and I'm loving it. 's a very good product that works great. I can control most of my music from my phone through it. There is a problem with the app and the remote. When you set it up, it takes about 10 seconds to calibrat it. Then it works fine, but if you put it away, it won't work. And if you use the phone app and try to use it again it will say it's not calibrated. There have been times where I've left my phone and plugged it in with the cable in the back and it didn't work until I set it back up. Now that I know what I'm doing, I know I'll only use the remote once and it will work.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:.................................................   I purchased the "S" model for my 6 year old son with ADHD. The only things he has been able to do with it were play games and write messages in a notebook. I have not been able any use it for any of the above things. It has never come with a battery and the charger does not work. The battery charge is very slow and does not have the "buzz" you expect from an electronic device. I would recommend this to parents with kids with ADHD or to anyone that can't live without their electronics!   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is a good way to monitor the amount of food you eat but it is not easy to track if you eat too much because it takes so long to count all of the food on the screen.  The food that I eat does not come up until the end of the meal. Also it is easy to forget to count the food because you are so engrossed in the food that you do not think about how much you are eating. It is a very good way of keeping track but it would be a lot more useful if I could use the calorie counters on a digital scale. This is a great product!  I just ordered a second one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________ _________  The iPad is a great device for entertainment. The app is simple and easy to use. But the design is really boring. The screen is tiny, it's really hard to keep it lit at night with the volume down. The software is the best feature of this tablet, but not everything is on it. The camera is great and good for portrait, but it can be very expensive. And the battery life is not much better than your phone. The thing I hate about this device is the speaker. It's terrible. Not loud enough for music. If you're a movie buff you'll love the camera, but for me it's a piece of crap. I just have to be looking at the screen. I wouldn't buy this again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device is really bad and the sound is awful  Rated 5 out of 5 by gary from Perfectly usable and well worth the money This thing is perfect! I used it on a Panasonic DVD player to play discs and was pleasantly surprised at how well it did. I used the internal speaker system and did not need to plug in external speakers. The only issue I had was it started to act weird after I plugged in the external sound. I was able to remove the speaker from the unit and it turned out to be the USB connector. The USB is actually a standard 1/8" jack. I just happen to have a jack on the back of the speaker that I use on all my other players. It worked fine after all. The unit also has a built in timer and a programmable button to play music from an external device in a certain time frame. The programmable timer is very useful and allows you to start and stop the music automatically after a certain number of minutes. If you have one of the devices that have an AUX port it works perfectly too. I've used this on my Sony player, Panasonic player, my Dell media center and a lot of others.  Review of DJI H.U.D. Portable DJI Phantom 3 Intelligent Flight Controller - BLF230L Review by D.M. Overall I'm pretty happy with the H.UI.D but... I don't get a lot done with this flying device, but when I do it's awesome! The DJI's are awesome because of the camera. You can do so much, such as panning/zooming with the quadcopter or you can do free flight by flying through the sky with this. The battery life is not the best, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. It also can get pretty hot when flying so make sure it has a screen on it. We are very pleased with DJI. Their products are very good and they have a great customer service. We buy from them as often as we can and always have a good experience. I will never use any other company for aerial photography.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am using a new iPad 3 in my kitchen. When using the remote, it works great. I only have issues with the settings. When you press a button the screen flashes with a white light for a second or two. When I press the button again, the screen gets all bright again. I've noticed that in the middle of the night, the buttons light up and flash. This is annoying. I have to reset the settings in Settings. I hope Apple fix the problem, or at least fix the settings that are on screen that are causing this.

I ordered it the day it came out and had the box it came in when I got home, and the box had a dent on the front. I did not have the box to examine before opening it but the repair is only an $8 part. So I tried to open the box with a pair of pliers and the repair was so bad I had to take it to a shop. I guess I don't have the patience to fix things by myself. I will keep on looking for an Xbox 360 and when I get it I will have a friend fix it for me.

It has some minor quirks I've found which have become annoying and it does not seem to have an on/off switch. I can turn it on/ off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- I bought an old digital camera a few years ago that I took apart and took the digital flash off the main board. It works perfectly in a dark room but when I wanted to use it in a bright room I noticed it is very hot in the hot and light areas. The light it generates doesn't go through plastic like it should but it goes through the glass and I have seen people try and use it to get a picture of their friends. It's not worth the hot parts. I did have an issue with it going out of range once. When I was done with the session I took it back out and it didn't work. I couldn't find any help online and my friend told me he used a digital camera and he had a similar problem. I gave up on it and bought a more expensive digital camera. I wish I had a better one to replace the one I took out because now it's too expensive to be worth the headache to have to buy new ones.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm sure many of us have bought an e-reader or a tablet that has not performed well. With an electronic device, you have no idea what is going to happen. When I bought my e-Reader, I was really excited about how fast it read. I thought that when it did the book, I would have to wait for it to finish reading so I could look up what it had to say on the page. It's been over a year, and I'm still waiting for the e-Reader to do the reading. I have been buying books from Amazon and reading them on my Kindle. However, the problem with all e-readers is that they do not work. The Kindle can't even read the pages I have left. It keeps telling me I have to buy another.   Another time I tried reading a book, but the cover and the pages were all dirty and smudged. I finally gave up and called to try and get my money back. When the person on the other end of the phone explained to me that the book could not be read because the cover was smudgy, dirty, smudging, smeared, or otherwise unsightly. I told him that if this was a store, I'd think he was insane for refusing me a refund, but that is no longer the case.  Rated 5 out of 5 by sally from My favourite so far I love the ereader.

The temperature is pretty good and the watch doesn't need a battery (not a lot of energy to keep the time if the air is pretty cool).  It works well and it is a nice watch, and it comes with a leather strap.  and not a lot has changed in the watch industry since it was designed.  of course, this watch should be made more durable and less expensive but it has done fine and will continue to be used for the time being.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------------------- I bought this thing as a travel companion, since my laptop didn't like the wifi signal and I'm always on the go, so I wanted an external hard drive I could access on the road. This drive was supposed to connect to the internet but doesn't. I don't care for this drive's design, the hard drive spins so fast and is so heavy that it's almost impossible to set the drive on it's side. It's easy to set upright but can't be turned, the screws have a tendency to fall out with the weight of the drive and the weight is on one side so there is some risk of it rolling on the drive or dropping it. This is the second one, I think the first was defective. I'd recommend the drive because it's small size is perfect for a small hard drive or thumb drive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This unit works great, but the remote, as expected, does not work well.  I had purchased the remote from another seller, and the unit works very well. However, I could not figure out how to add/delete contacts from the remote until it worked again.  Once the remote was working again, I realized that the button to add contacts is actually under a hole, not the main button.   So, I was able to add and delete contacts, but not "open" the contacts with the buttons.  Another thing to consider: if the unit is plugged in, the unit needs to be unplugged and plugged in again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I am very disappointed with the sound quality of the iDevices. I have two of them, and I had to remove both of them when I installed the newest iDevice firmware from Apple. I'm not sure if the new version of the firmware caused a huge quality drop, or if iDevice has had a massive technical problem. Either way, they sound worse than the iPod touch. My original iPod and the current ones sound much better. Not to mention the battery life is much better on the original iDeviices. This product should not be advertised on a website that is for consumers. The best iDevICES is a much better choice in sound quality.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!!!!!!!   The iRig Mic is by far the best mic I've ever used. I have been using it as a standard voice recorder for over a year now. It's built to be durable, it sounds good, it's really easy to use, and the best part is that it is absolutely perfect for any situation you can think of. If your recording audio and music, you need to get the iRigg Mic!   Have you noticed that most of the microphones that are listed for recording voice or music have a flat frequency response? This is a huge flaw! When you record voice or any type of music, this is one of the most crucial things to ensure that the microphone picks up exactly what is being spoken or played!   of course the i-Rigg mic has an extremely flat frequency range! The flat frequency is so good that most musicians or recording artists use it as an additional microphone to help with the mix, as well as for mixing vocals and guitars.   As an added bonus, the irig mic also features an on/off switch, which is very helpful to those that are recording with microphones in a professional studio environment. This switch not only allows for the mic to be turned on/on but also off, which allows you to easily switch back and forth to the mic when recording your guitar solo.   the only issue I had was with the mic's cable, I had a tough time getting the mic on and off from my guitar amplifier. I bought a spare cable just to have a backup. I am very happy with the product though.  on a roll  Just bought one! It's great for all the recording stuff I'm doing now!  Awesome  I've been using my iRIG Mic for two years now and am very satisfied. . I can get a nice clean sound. It has a nice low rumble and it sounds pretty clear.   on the downside I've had two of the ones I've owned broken in the first three months I had it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for about 5 months now and so far ive broken it twice. the first time i was using it with my laptop it froze and the second time i dropped it on the counter and shattered it. dont get me wrong ive used laptops with worse processors as well but that doesnt mean i recommend this one. i cant find it on sale on the computer store here. its worth the money because it works well but the other problems with it dont help.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    They work OK, but don't come with anything. It would have been nice if I got the charger and had it in the package. I was told that I had a defective model, so I asked a customer service rep what was going on, but apparently they will try to replace it for free. The replacement model (a different one from my first one) is not included. I've asked for a refund twice, but the representative has been unhelpful. I have sent photos of my unit to other distributors, and they've said the same thing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! This is just an e-cigarette. A little to much vapor is coming out of this thing. Also, the quality is not that great. Its really small and looks like an e cigarette. If you want an e cig but not the vapor. Then this is the e cig for you.  4 out of 5 Great little smoke This little guy smokes great! I was able to get through the whole bowl in about 10 or so hits. Its good for the price but get a bigger one. .  in love! I use it all the time.  "Smoking Perfect" "Smokeable "I get 2-3 big hits off it, I have smoked many other brands and this is as good as they get in the price range. ,  5 out of, 5 The One and Only The one and only. This is the smoking device that I keep running my fingers through my hair and back through my veins to get every last drop. You will find your way into my daily routine. 's the smoking machine I use to smoke cigars and it is the one device to have. Great to take to the golf course  2 out of 2 found the design disappointing I have been smoking this little gem for almost three years and its pretty good at keeping you lit until it dies. It is really nice for that long but it will not last for a whole day. I ordered the Smokesaurus but after a couple months the stem broke and the e-liquid leaked everywhere. Its not too difficult to replace the stem so its not a huge loss. The stem is the only thing I would say I would not recommend. If I was a little more concerned about the shape of the device I might give it five stars. I am happy that it does the job. It may not last forever but it does what I need. I'm going to try a bigger sized piece of wood to hold the coil for longer periods of time. I did like the fact that the little piece of plastic is removable. Great for someone who needs a little bit of help with their technique.  the smoking one. Great vape it works great I would recommend  Great smoke I have tried many brands of electronic cigarettes, and this one is hands down the best. It lasts for hours on a single charge and is convenient to carry with you when you are not in the mood to vape. A great value and a great taste.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive owned a bunch of these crap units over the years and it has always been a problem, with the best unit being this year, they have all been the same...they will get hot after a day or two on high heat. I guess this is an indication of poor build quality. ive bought a dozen of these and they always have problems, i can understand the good, the bad, but the bad shouldnt be a big problem. this isnt an electronic device.... it is a garbage disposal. _______________________________________________________________ I received the product very quickly and it works great, I would not recommend it, but I did get a deal from Amazon. __________________  Review by: Kevin W. on 08/10/2016 This is a great unit. I've owned a few other units from other companies and it's the only one that has been up and running all summer. It is a high quality product. It gets very hot and the cord can get short sometimes so don't be alarmed. I would highly recommend this unit to anyone. __________ . ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing is garbage. My car broke down, i was running out of juice and had to go to work. I plugged in my device, a nokia. No signal, no battery...i went to my phone, turned it on and it gave me a signal. But the phone was dead. I tried it with my other nokia, a galaxy, and i'm sure the same thing happened...then i tried to turn it off, it still gave me the same signal. It just wasnt working, nothing worked, the battery was dead, no signal, nothing. I was so frustrated that i threw out my nokia and bought this one. Well, my phone has been dead for 2 weeks and it is still dead. Just because i used it once, that doesnt mean it's not bad.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Dorey from Terrible for the price Purchased this in Jan, with the expectation that it would be a good option for the range that it could support. I am glad that I waited as it has failed my expectation. I bought 2 units, one in Dec for work and one on Mar for home. In the last two weeks both units have failed. The first unit died when I got home from work. The charger was attached to the nokia phone, but the device just stopped working. There was no light on it, nor anything on the touch screen. I have tried all I can to get it working, including unplugging and replugging it numerous times. I then noticed that the car charging port is on a different plug from the nolas plug in the charger. So I have a dead car charger that I am not able to use. Not one time have I heard the power button on the phone. It would work fine, if it worked at all. I used my old battery from an old Nokia 730, so there are not any other chargers that support this phone. I did a Google search, but it seems that many others are having the same issue.  to add, this is my second failed unit. The other one I bought is still in the store, still under warranty, but I just got a new one on Monday.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This speaker is terrible!  It is so loud and so ragged that it really affects your sleep quality.  I have a sleep mask that blocks out all sounds other than the one in the room and this device blocks out the sound of my pillow hitting the back of my head.    I would never want to buy this again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device works great. The quality is good, and the buttons are solid. However, the device is heavy and has a bulky design that takes up much more space in my bag than a compact MP3 player. The fact that the buttons were poorly designed means that I can no longer hear them when I'm walking, or typing on my laptop (with the volume all the way up). That's a major drawback for my daily use. Also, it's really hard to make it work well when using a portable computer. Write a positive review about the best MP3 Player:    The device does what it should do with my iPod and a few other portable devices. It can be used with a tablet, but the volume is too loud, so I have to keep the volume down to not annoy my wife. The USB connector is small, so it takes a bit of effort to make sure you don't loose your device. Overall, a very good and versatile device. Buy this device as an iPad alternative:

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! The cable to connect the remote (a cheapo one that I can't afford) and the remote to the console (a new Sony one) did not work. I went into my cable and found out they are different. I bought this so I didn't have to go to the store to buy a new remote every time I needed it, but when the cable and the box failed I had to purchase another set. The new one (I got the latest version, not sure when the last one was) will not connect to my remote. It still works fine on my laptop, but it's a shame. I really wanted to use this as a "go to" controller.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

They are cheap, reliable and small enough to plug directly into a USB port. The only downside is that the ports are only USB 2 ports, and are not powered up (the ones on my other controller don't work either). But I found that my older one has the same issue.  the other thing is that you need to connect a cable from your controller to the controller itself (for PC). So if you use this on a TV it would require that you also have a cable for that device. But otherwise, this is a great device. ,   Was this Review helpful to you?)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******** This product is absolutely the most over priced, sub par device I have ever had to use. I used this on my computer. First off, the cable is horrible, and the quality of the product is horrible. They have a $5 off coupon, but they didn't apply it to this item at all. Now, there is a reason I say that, as this cable would only be used for a monitor that was attached to an HDMI port, and then used a PC monitor, keyboard, etc, and a blu-ray player, and headphones. The whole system needs to be in one place, and it's just not possible. So I had to put everything in my desk top cabinet, which is much easier to maintain than the one unit the product comes with. You would think that with the cost of the unit, you would be able to have a good quality product. That's not the case at all, but even with the low quality of this cable, I am still a happy user. I would recommend this product, but it's not worth paying full price for. You're better off buying a good monitor from your retailer, then paying extra for this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using this for over a year now. I purchased a brand new phone to replace a flip phone. I installed the tablet in a case which I also bought for it to go with. After an hour or so of setup, I get an email saying my device is rebooting. I opened the notification and the first thing I see is that my wifi is back on. Now, this happens about once a day. When i open the app on my phone, it says it cant find my account, even though i have the app and it is on. I have to go to the settings app on the tablet and set my device back up manually. Its just really annoying. Also, everytime I take the tablet out of the case to go about my daily business, it takes about 5 seconds for the tablet to become unresponsive. The battery is ok, and its not really slow, just way too slow. Its really hard to even take the battery off and charge it. I can't even use the touchscreen or the camera on it. Also when you try to download anything from the web, it fails to load. I thought the tablet was just a little sluggish. I will buy a new one in a few months. It really sucks when you have to deal with this. The tablet also doesnt even work when i remove it from the case.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have two of these and I hate them! The first one I bought from Target took too long to get to my door. I couldn't figure out why there were four times the price for the same product. But, I have a computer and it was not as important to me. So I just went back for another one. This one took twice as long to arrive, with no shipping confirmation. I'm very sorry I waited so long. The second one is defective as well. I bought this for a computer that I can use for a very small amount of work. I didn't have the time to send the previous one back for a replacement, so I decided to keep it. After using the monitor for less than two days, it has broken. It shows the same colors as it used to, and I cannot turn the screen off. So far, I am trying to find a working replacement for this monitor, but so far, all I can come up with are cheapo computer monitors.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to play video games on but the battery life is less than an hour.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!!!!  The batteries last just under half a day. The device is a little noisy and does not do much for music (it works pretty well for phone calls and text). I think the battery life is less than the price.  I don't like the fact that the device looks like a cigarette lighter with some kind of battery on it.  of course I can only speak from my experience. I know other reviewers have mentioned that they have had great luck with this unit  Great Product! - I recently replaced my old digital mp3 player with this digital music player which sounds really nice and works great. I have a lot of mp3s so it took a little getting used to but once I did it was great! The price is very good and I would buy it again in a heartbeat!  Noisy - Very noisy at first but it gets better.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This device is cheap and easy to use. It can be a very good device for some people, but I bought one to do the dishes for my family and it just never turned on. I did not notice this until it was already done. I tried several things to fix it:  - Trying to use it as a computer - It was not connected to the internet - Unplugged from the charger - Removed the battery, changed the batteries - Put in a new charger - Put the power adapter into the outlet but it does not turn on - The new charger works. It works for 1.5 hours and then goes out again. After this is done, the phone is working again. So for a $10 device, it did not work for me at all. For someone who works a lot of hours a week, this would not be a problem, but it just was not able to be done for me. I would not buy this again, especially since I paid the same price for it as an adult on sale.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this one thinking that this is the best one available. I'm not really sure how I should feel about this. On the one hand the device is a great looking thing but on the other hand it is useless. I tried to turn on the TV with it on and the screen is so low I couldn't see anything at all. When I turned it off it came back on and there were three lights that I was not able to turn off. Also when I plugged my phone into it everything that I tried would not even show up on the phone because it would not recognize that it was connected. On a scale from 0 to 10 with 1 being a complete dud and 10 being the best. So i'm a 0.2 out of 10 I would not recommend this product I think it is a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had two of these and they were not working well. One is not working at all. I can only get it to talk on a 1w or 3w speaker. I could not use it to turn off my computer or get any information out of it. This was after i purchased a new computer with a 1tb disk and a hard drive. This shouldnt be a problem with my computer, but it did take a week to get my old one fixed. The other one works perfectly and works in all my other computers, even my other computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for less than a week and the only reason i bought it was because of the 3G connection (because im on work and no 3g capable network available for my home). theres just no signal and theres no video whatsoever when im looking at any of the web pages with pictures that i try to watch. just a black screen or sometimes a spinning blue circle. and the ipod isnt getting an update either (this happens alot with my ipod so i'm pretty confident this is the problem). i dont care if it is a $500 ipod (not a huge fan of that type of device but this isnt a cheap ipod either so i dont get upset about this either), i bought this thing so that i can keep my ipad with video functionality, and i cant do that with this damn thing!!! i'm disappointed that it doesnt work at all and i dont have the money to upgrade it anyway... just hope my ipods dont end up in a landfill and its dead by the time i get it.... i was so excited to try the ipad 7 and this is as close as it gets!!!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- I'm on my fourth ereader, and I can't say the results have been that good. The main problem with the new reader is that it can't be used as a regular paper book. I had to go through the process of buying a new one to be able to read on my phone (I love my Kindle, but I'm not about to buy a new cover for it just to use my ereader.) It is annoying having to buy this book as an electronic book. --------------- What could be better? Well, I wouldn't be mad if I could give this a lower score than 3 stars, but since I'm in the middle of buying some ebooks (that cost way too much, in my opinion), I think I'll be okay with it, just in case I don't find one as good as my Kindle. If you are considering it, I would definitely recommend getting the version for your phone rather than the other one. There's a lot of room for improvements if the new version is good enough to replace your Kindle.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This has had several failures and the customer service has been poor at best. I lost my first one and returned it right away. The second one I bought was also not working until I took it out of the box and tried it to see what the problem was. The screen did not turn off after the battery died or the screen came back on. It turned back on again and the battery finally ran down so I was able to make contact with the customer support.  The screen is still not working and I am not happy with the experience.

I like that I have my tv and my phone on the same device. :)  I bought this for use on my Sony Playstation 4. Works perfectly.  and to make it even better: I am able to use this for my blu-ray player and use the bluetooth to control it on the remote. So now my movie and music has one central location where I can change it quickly from my TV and PS4.  (:  Would recommend to others.  are there any other remote for this system?  was this Review helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, June 16, 2017
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for the "next step in my upgrade" which I have not been able to accomplish. I got it to upgrade my iPhone 4, but after getting it working, I could not get it to connect to the iPhone 6. I spent two weeks on Google searching, and found several solutions. I had a solution with a Raspberry Pi, but I was not able to get the iPhone to detect the PI. Finally I got the idea to replace the wireless antenna with an old one. I also had the idea of installing an Arduino, and using the serial port, but that did not work. The PI just never connected. I did get it up and running, and it took a week or so, but the iPhone6 is very unstable. I have had it running for 2 weeks now and I just cannot get it on the phone. Now, my idea is to find a new computer with faster speed and more RAM.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using an older laptop for years, but needed an upgrade, so I purchased this one. I tried to install a monitor and keyboard and it just kept shutting down, I gave up on trying to solve the issue, and bought this unit. The screen is too small to see much, it's very small, and it shows the image as if the pixels are not really there. The keyboard is awful and only does three key functions. No other functions, so don't waste your money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been using the D-Link TL-WN722N router for some time, and the latest update for the firmware only made it even worse. The problem is that the router constantly reboots with a message saying that it has not been restarted after a power outage. So I ended up replacing the entire device. It cost about $90, which is still a little high considering that it is pretty much the best router on the market, but it was worth it to have a good router for all my family to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad experience with this device  I am very unhappy with the service from Best Buy.   I ordered this device on the 4th day after they opened it.   was the 4 day after I got the box. It was the same day I got my order. I could not find the battery inside the box, but I thought maybe it was in the envelope. I got back with them with the UPS truck, I have it in my apartment with the window open. They couldn't find it in the box at all.  . They had the batteries, but they weren't the same. The blue battery was a different one. I emailed them and got no reply, I got 2 boxes of batteries. The box of batteries didn't have the blue battery, I thought this must be a bad box. Then I got another package from them, this one was from them in the U.K., I opened it up and there was a blue battery inside, but it wasn't the one I got. The original battery was in a black case. I opened the original box, found the battery, replaced it, put in my new battery, and they said they couldn't replace it with the same one, so I guess it is a bad warranty. I will not be using this item.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had it for about 2 months now and the sound quality is abysmal. i tried turning the volume up and down many times and it wont change, so i just gave up. i was even going to return it, but the sound is so bad i just need to buy a real monitor!  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, April 14, 2012  Excellent  by Paul from Portland OR USA  Pros: Sound quality is excellent  Cons: No buttons  Review: I love the sound! It has a full, smooth sound and it's a great addition to my system.  Thanks for making a great product. ,  Paul from Portland, OR  A must have  By Mark from San Diego CA USA : "I was hesitant to buy this at first, but after watching and listening to several reviews, I decided to make the purchase. The sound quality was incredible. I love my sound bar and sound volume settings are a great feature to have in a sound bar. The only issue I had with the sound bar was the buttons on the side. They were not easily accessible and I needed to look at the picture to find the buttons. When I went to plug in the sound cord, it was not a plug like most sound bars were. It was a cable that went into a hole on the back of the bar. It may not be a deal breaker for most people, but I thought it would be. . : I have it connected to my HDTV's subwoofer and it works perfectly. The picture quality is great, and the volume setting is good. I also have an Apple TV connected to it as well, and it also works perfectly with no problems.  to close - I bought this sound bar for my wife to listen to her audio book while watching movies with her and it came in really handy. The buttons on this sound panel are located on the front of the panel so it is easy to find.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a number of bad sony digital cameras and its always a pain to switch between cameras so having a dvr on my vcr i have no problem with it but it doesn't record. ive done a lot of video on it and it does nothing for me. if your using this for recording video then you will have to learn to deal with a crappy camera and have to buy more expensive camera.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had mine for 3 years, but now my main computer (dell netbook pro 545s) can't connect at all. Ive tried a new cable and a new usb hub.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I received it, it was really bad, it would randomly power down when it wasnt connected, not a good idea to use it with a portable battery or power bank. Its a bit flimsy, and when the phone would not connect, it made me worry that it was loose in the connector. The phone itself is made well, and works fine. But its a shame that the connection wasnt good for such a cheap product. It was so cheap I was wondering if i should just return it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been a lifetime customer of this device, and this one sucks. Its soooo bad i lost my battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for about a month now, and i cant even imagine how good of a device it is. it works really well as an ipod mini. i'm on my second ipod. the other one i got was faulty, the screen had gone black after about a year. this ipod is just as great as the first. the only down side is that it only takes a few seconds to be off when you turn it on and back on. the thing is amazing. i cant imagine buying anything else.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ****************** I bought this for the purpose of a new computer. It was very good when I was using it and it was the only computer I used. The next day it had died. I had the old computer back up and it has the same problem. I have to go to a different computer for all my electronic needs. If you get this because you need a computer, you will not be happy with it. It does not come with a USB cable and you have to buy a new one. Other than that, it is good but I did not get the maximum amount I needed because it is the only one I could find that I needed.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the same product for 3 yrs now and it gets the job done.... i hate to say it, but it is time to get a new one... i don't care if its $100. its not worth the risk... i just wish i would have bought one when they were on sale... i will now be switching to a different brand of electronic device... thanks to the company for the good quality.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Tim from Easy to use and very versatile. I bought this because my older one was failing, but the difference between the two is quite stark. The battery is not very large, but is very long lasting. The cord is fairly long. If you have a bad phone with a small battery, the power plug may be the limiting factor. I have mine set up with 2 chargers and 2 USB power cords. The charger is great and you have your choice between different brands for the phone and charging cable. The phone comes in handy for working on the farm and getting on the internet. The power cable is a little long. It does not come with the usb wall adapter. I was told to get the usb cable as the wall adapter will not be compatible. Overall, the best of both worlds. I will be buying more. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's amazing but the wireless charging is horrible it takes too long to charge and when i plug in it it's like the battery is dead and the charging bar is not working. it was broken on the inside in like three places i think the manufacturer should have charged me more money for this.   Would you recommend this to a friend?:  ,  - I can't believe my luck!  I just received this last week and i love it. Ive had it for a week now and it's been working perfectly. I've not been able to find a usb port on my laptop so I used my usb cord to charge it and it works perfectly and i have a charging cable already connected to my pc for the same purpose. i dont know why there are no usb ports on laptops so ill give this a great review because of the price tag.  .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am sorry to say that the old version of this battery would not charge or even sit flat on the phone (I use it with an old cell phone) after I had it on the charger for several days.  Now this has been fixed with an updated version, but that doesn't fix it.   So, for now, I'm moving on to the new version. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I was happy with my purchase but it's a bad device. When I connected it in my pc I had a problem with it. I had no audio. But, when I plugged it into my cd burner the audio worked. So, I thought it was good. I just purchased two of these. If I buy them again it will be a different device. Not worth the money. I gave the second one 5 stars cause of the audio. That is the best feature on this unit. I did not like it, I have a sound card in my sound card. I can still listen to my music. The best feature is the audio, I am happy with the sound quality. However, there are better sound cards out there for a much more reasonable price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this device in hopes it would be a great replacement to my Sony RX100 IV. I was not disappointed. I only use the Sony RX10 as my backup camera and this is just as good of a camera as my RX100. If it had been cheaper I probably would have bought one. I do wish the buttons on the side were a little smaller to fit in my hand better. But all in all, a great buy.  My old Sony RX-100 camera is just too expensive! I purchased a brand new Sony RX20 II, a full frame 35mm camera, on sale at Best Buy, and I just loved it. I shoot mostly video, and the image quality on the RX100 II was just phenomenal. I had been looking into the Sony NX1 for some time, and was super skeptical of its price tag and potential performance. I thought it could be a good replacement, especially if I didn't have to worry about the lack of a viewfinder and my old Sony equipment getting lost when I move to a new location. So I purchased the Sony camera on a whim, after receiving an email from a friend who used it. The first few days of using the camera I thought my eyes had some sort of defect, so I went out and bought a new lens to see if that might help. I'm glad I did, the camera works like a champ and the price is extremely reasonable. I think I'll be picking up another RX20 camera after getting this new Sony one to keep it running for awhile. If you're looking to buy a great camera and have a budget that isn't too big I'd highly recommend you look into the RX20 series.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used this device since its first introduction. It works very well, and it did help me avoid the problem of being able to hear the speaker at the time of the phone calls. My biggest problem with the product is with the battery life. It lasted less than a day. I have tried several battery replacements to find one that will last longer. The new battery lasts only about 4-5 hours of use before the battery needs to be replaced. In the long run, I plan to get a replacement for my next phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The new LG Smart TV (2012) is an excellent set. However, one of the HDMI cables is very short (8 feet) and doesn't work with the unit. I have no choice but to buy a new one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound is good, the touch screen is very smooth, but the battery doesn't last long. The phone is very small, and its weight is very heavy. The design is good and very compact. But the battery is the issue. If your using this phone, you will definitely need to buy a new battery.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst computer I have ever owned. The battery lasted less than 30 hours and it had no support whatsoever. I tried to get a replacement but they couldn't give me the new one until October. I bought a second computer for the same reason. I have had so much trouble with this computer that I am considering selling it and buying a new one from scratch. The first two problems should have been the last, but apparently not. I will buy a laptop but it will not be from this manufacturer.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great product for the price This was the first computer I purchased with Windows 10, and I am very pleased with it. Very fast, quiet, well made, and very easy to use. I had no trouble setting up and operating it. I was worried about wireless and wireless drivers, but everything went fine. :):):):)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It takes me time to re-establish the cable connection after the battery drains. After that it takes a few days to reestablish the connection.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been running my gf's ipod since it came out and it worked fine until now that the battery on it died. It seems like shes only using it for music. So I replaced it with a nook. I am very satisfied with this purchase!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Sibby from Good product I had the same product but got the black one since I wanted one without the white sticker. Works as good as the white one and i have been using this for years and not a scratch on it.  I'm not sure what it is about black products, but when I got this in the mail last week it was in excellent condition and arrived in one piece. The packaging is the best. I didn't use any sort of adhesive but that doesn't really matter because once it's in your hands you don't need a lot of holding force to keep it from falling out. It's really light weight and it comes with a little bit of memory to get you started. I'm very happy with this little device, it's perfect for my needs.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this laptop for a while and it has had a few issues. it doesnt boot up as well as i want it to. also the screen goes crazy when its cold. i had it in my car in the summer and it froze all the time, when it was hot it was fine. one day it stopped working and i replaced the battery but it still froze. i bought the new battery and the system ran flawlessly. i now use it at work as my computer for word processing. I dont know how many of you have had this issue, but when you open up your laptop in the morning your screen will freeze, you will have to restart it, and that is really annoying because if you dont, the system goes back to your last known good settings and then you have to start over with your settings again. the only thing i like about this laptop is that its a really great all around computer. this is a great laptop for any purpose, and if you can get it to run just fine then you cant go wrong with this laptop.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! The only good thing is the charger. The charger has no battery, so it's useless. The other two units were worthless. Not only did they break down, but the units also stopped working (after a few years). The worst part is the shipping fees. The first two units came out so cheaply I didn't bother trying them out until my wife bought a third one and we discovered the same problem. Don't buy it. The only two good things about it are the charger and the two year warranty.  "I got this for my son for Christmas, and he loved it and I don't plan on ever buying an iPad again. He loves the size of it and the ease of use. It is very easy to use and get to the apps you want. I was worried about the size though because I have no idea how big it is and was worried it would not fit in my pocket but it was actually comfortable in my hand. I'm not sure if it is a great size because I do like it but I'll be sure to get a larger one next time. Also it came with a little app that helped set it up and then was pretty easy to set it down so my son could use it. I just wish it came in white instead of pink for him. There was nothing wrong with it when I got it and there wasn't anything wrong with the iPad either. This was the first time I bought one so I'll have to give it some time and see how it works. I will say this, though, that I had a hard time getting a good quality apple adapter and am having a hard enough time getting my own adapter that I don''t think I will be able to replace it until I get this. : )"  Questions, Answers and Comments  Discuss about Sigelei TLE2355 Series 8 Port USB 3.0 Portable AC Charger - White (Package: Retail) with your friends and fellow Evike.com shoppers!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my son and we love it. It's really quick and easy to set up. But I have to say we don't have enough room in the cup holder for the phone and the battery is really only about 3 hours of battery life. We don't use the internet much, but I did call my doctor about my stomach and it seemed to make me sick. I got an E-Mail the next morning about my doctor's call. The phone won't connect to the computer, but the web is very slow. That is just me and I don't know if it is because of the speed of the web or the phone battery. I hope the web speeds up a little.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Had a bad experience with the device when I bought it. I needed a charger to use with my Sony camera and this one doesn't work. They also said it would work when I took it to another store and the clerk tried to charge it but it wouldn't turn on. They couldn't do anything about it. The charger worked great the last time I bought this from a different store and now I just got it back from Best Buy.

They did not reply to me for about 5 days so I called the tech support line and the tech had this conversation, then hung up on me. I did not get a replacement unit and had to get a refund from them for my old computer.   If you have any problems, be patient.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________   I bought this from walmart for my 13 year old son to play on. I had to play with the connection first to determine if the unit worked. The connection was fine. He had a problem with the remote control not working after a few minutes. He tried all the buttons on the remote and all worked but the one on the back didn't. I took the remote off him and turned it on but nothing. After several minutes he switched the remote back on and was able to use it. I got him a spare one and this one. He can't use it at school but I still have to send him home. He is going to have to play by ear until I get a new one.   Good buy if you want a gameboy or an iphone for a kid, but this one didn't work right out of the box. I'm giving it a 5.   with 5 stars, the battery is a bit of a pain to replace since the charger is located in the back. I recommend getting a charger for it in store if you can.  Was this helpful?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a kd-75 for over a year now and it has not performed as well as i would have liked. The input is the only bad thing about the keyboard. Everytime i try to do something (as in typing a message to someone in another country) the computer freezes. After about an hour of typing i get an error message telling me that the keyboard has failed, but the computer still hasnt died, it just can't type. The only way i can fix it now is to return the keyboard to the korean manufacturer and get a new one. Other than that, it is a decent keyboard. Also, the keycaps on the other side of the keyboard are the best. I dont use a normal keyboard so i dont know how to write this, but i would recommend it if you can find it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!!!!!!  The device is a great piece of equipment. When I bought it I couldnt wait to start using it. The product is very easy to use, and its very simple to set up. The only problem I have with this device is that when I tried to turn it on, it wouldnt turn on. I have been trying to figure out what could have been wrong with this since I bought the product. After several weeks of unsuccessful attempt to turn the device on. the day it finally turned on, I turned it off. The next day when I opened my unit, it was all burnt up. It looks like a burnt out plastic. I did not think much about that until I realized that its not a "hockey puck", but a small computer. I took it in to the nearest computer repair shop and the person told me they had never heard of any problems like this. I am still not quite sure of what could be wrong with my computer. My computer is very old and its been sitting there for many years. The computer has never been hooked up to the modem and there is no modem, nor anything else hooked up. My guess is that my computer did something wrong. The company that made my computer and the computer they hooked up with did a great job. If you are going to buy this item, you may as well spend the extra money on a modem because it makes the internet even faster. I recommend this product if you have a computer.  Rated 1 out of 5 by JW from Just like the name suggests. It's terrible. I was hoping for something different, and to have something with more power. Instead, the item I received is simply a dongle. I've owned several dongles over the years. Most are not designed for anything but a "small computer" such as the laptop or desktop computer. This one is a computer and a modem. It requires an external modem. I had to buy a diplexer, which is a small device that does two things at the same time. The dongel takes a phone line (or digital modem) and then connects it to a computer (like mine, a HP laptop). It then connects to the web. However, for the price it's not worth the hassle.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been using this for a few months now and I've had to replace it twice. The first time it just kept dropping out. And the replacement time is over a month. The second time the battery went dead during a session. So now I'm just buying one of those little rechargeable USB battery chargers and just plugging in the battery. It's a good unit. The quality is very good, and it charges up to 100% in only a couple hours. I'm going to go ahead and recommend this unit to my friends who were worried they didn't have enough juice for their equipment.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _______________  I bought this for my 15 year old daughter for her birthday but she never got to use it. It was supposed to be a $50 gift. This is one of the worst devices I have ever used. The buttons are all sticky and are hard to turn. The light switch had not been used in over three months, so when it does turn on it is hard to find the power button. I have been buying other products to get her more and more things at school without this one.   Is this review helpful?

I've tried the standard QWERTY, the Microsoft Magic Mouse, and the Tux Mouse. Nothing works well enough for my needs. I was disappointed that I could not find an electronic device that would work as I needed, until I saw the ZX Keyboard 2. I did the research and found the quality to be amazing. There were a number of reviews stating that the keyboard was unreliable, and one reviewer stated that the keys were not depressed correctly. These statements were false. The keys are not "rebounded" correctly. The key travel is actually greater than the recommended amount. This is very important because the Zx2 is specifically designed for the computer industry to use. The ZX2 is not a generic piece of electronics that you can buy anywhere. It is built like a tank to take the punishment of the worst mechanical keyboard that you've ever seen, and it will take it! You can't find a better keyboard for this price. There are a number on the internet claiming that the Z-Wave software is not compatible with the ZXM-2, but I couldn't find this to be true. I have a couple of computers and a networked ZX-Wave controller on each computer. The controller is already set up to work with the software on each device. It even has the option to make sure the controller is only running on one device. I had no problems with the controller at all using my QNAP TAVR NAS and my Dell Inspiron 1255. I could have used this controller in the TnPTN NAS, which I didn't have on hand, and I could still use it with my Dell, but it's no longer a problem. I am very satisfied with my purchase.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There was no way i could get any sort of service when this came back.   It is completely defective.  It does not have a charger/power cord, is completely unplugged from the wall outlet, and even if i do plug it in, i am unable to change the setting on the screen because the button does not work, no matter how i turn the settings.  If i do use this device it will be only for a short amount of time, and it will need to be replaced.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My watch was broken. I had to send it back to the manufacturer. So I'm looking for a cheap computer to connect to my iphone.  After looking on and off for a while, the one I was looking at had many more features than my ikea iphones iph. As I tried to install it, my watch kept asking for a password to make it work.  The watch is broken, so I'm going to put a bad watch on my ips.  I bought this iph and now I'm thinking about buying this ikeo computer! What a great device this is.   I would definitely recommend this device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The keyboard was made of a poor plastic and was too small to use. I had to switch to the laptop for several years to use it. The screen wasn't working very well. I thought they'd replaced it by now.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, July 08, 2014  Won't use the screen - bad quality  by L.C. from Oklahoma City OK USA  Review: I was very unhappy with this laptop. The laptop was made in china and the keyboard was horrible and it didn't work very well at all. The speakers were extremely weak. The camera worked perfectly. The monitor wasn't very bright. It also took the battery down to a low level. They fixed the laptop and charged it again but I would have been happier if I had not spent the money on this one. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 star is that if it had a good screen it would be a 5. Was this Review Useful to you?: Yes
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the iphone to use for the tv and the tv did not come with a charger. I had to purchase a new iphon as well to power it up. I could use my iphons on the phone too because i use the phone to check the tv in the morning. I have to charge it every few hours so the charger is a good price at 3 dollars. The TV gets hot in the summer in my kitchen so i need a different remote for that also. I also want a remote that will work with my tv's remote but i cant afford a brand new one as i still have it. I use the apple remote on my ips as a control so i like it. The cable is a problem and i know i am not the only one who gets a problem as it has come loose from my tv and i had to rewire the tv. If someone had to use a brand that had a cable in it this is what i would pay. i would rather buy a new tv in a year and then use the ip as a cheap tv as i have used for almost 10 years.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It works well. but i have bought 3. the problem i get is it will stop working if the battery falls out so i try to keep it in a place where i can hold it up to charge but that problem was solved with just a spare battery which is cheap so i keep the other 2. but then they die in a week and i dont want to spend the money on a new battery. i bought a second one to replace the second one which i believe it works just fine.   i guess i would recomend this product. i can get it for a good price in a store or on ebay and sell it for more.  -A

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for a little over a month now, and its been on my bike almost everyday for the last year. ive replaced the battery and the charger on it every few weeks because it doesnt charge at all. i just bought a new battery and charger for it and i'll be buying a new phone when my phone dies. i dont use the phone all that much since i use the bike more, and that i dont have to plug my phone into a wall to charge it. __________________  "I can't stop dreaming about the bike i would ride."  -Sue
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great product and very easy to set up. It does everything I need it to do, but the picture quality is horrible. It is the picture of a $15.00 DVD player that you get when you buy a set of the Pioneer DVD player. It isn't the picture you see on a VCR, but you really should have gotten a set with that quality.   The only way I could have been more pleased is if this was a little cheaper, because I would not be going back.  , August 21, 2014  by: Jason  Review: I'm glad I found this place, even though I was a bit disappointed by the customer service. I ordered on a Friday. Saturday, I got an email saying the order was ready and the first shipping was on Monday. I was shocked. I did a lot of research on the best online retailer for the item, and found Outlets.com. My experience was so much better here than the other places I looked. I've ordered from out of state, and got an out of country package from UPS. Here, I just got the email that the package was ready. I called up and got a real person to help me. Very nice person. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the video quality, but I got the product at a good price and it's all good. Good job! I'm sure I'll be back.

Also, i really want to change my setup in order to use my ikona with it but im not sure what i should get. if its like this i cant use it.  ,   so far: ive already gotten the replacement for the ia and it has already helped im not even sure i want to switch back to my ia.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone 4 iphones are the worst I purchased a 4 last year after I dropped my 3 samsung. I wanted a new phone that would hold up well to my usage and keep my phone going in the rain. I was very happy with it until I got my last 2. The 2 that I got this year had the new software and when I did a software update my phone went berserk. I can't get out of my pocket, I can only hold the phone to the keyboard. I did my first phone check and this is the worst for a phone. ive tried to charge it 3 times and even got out of the house 2 times this week and it just went out. The phone also does not have an indicator light.  I'm going to drop it and hope it breaks again. I will never buy a samsung phone again.  Report abuse
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had it about a year and it's been in several ways and it always has an issue with the charger. it will get so hot in the middle it just blows it away. one time it wasnt plugged in the battery light would come on but it wouldnt charge. i was going to buy a new one cause its not worth it to use it any more. not worth the money, not worth using it for anything. ive been using my iphone and my gps in the car all the time  Good for the Price, Bad Software. April 29, 2017 by James W. from Bakersfield CA USA It is good for the price. It is a good GPS, very stable. It takes pictures, you can make them and save them. It has a lot of features for the money. When I first bought it I thought that it would be good for GPS, but it didnt go for miles and it hasnt worked well so far. It still works, but my GPS goes out of battery in like 5 minutes and I have to use my cell phone to get it going again. I have the iphones version and it works fine. The app is easy to use, but in the future maybe it should come with a manual. It would help if there was some way to set the frequency in the phone app. My next problem is that there is some sort of software glitch where if you go to the map menu and then back to the apps you will crash. I thought it would work better this way, but I guess it didnt. I dont know whats up with it.  A great GPS system! March 13, 2017 at 2:42 am by J.E.S. from Fort Worth TX USA I bought this for my wife, she used it for a few weeks and loves it! It does everything we need it to do, and does it all very well. It's easy to find, set up, and use. Great for our backpacking trips, and even as a car navigation system. -It's easy, fun, and reliable!  -You can make and save pictures!  The software can be a little challenging, but once you get the hang of it, it's great! ,  Very easy to navigate.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the first time i have had any problems with the usb connector breaking. I bought this thinking it would do the job, but i should have never bought it as there have been at least 3 different usb connectors that have broken this far. The first one broke after 2 weeks of use. I purchased another one, but it took at least 4 weeks for it to even be able to power the device. So i just keep it as a backup. The other one is the only usb that I own and it still works after the 5th month. It takes longer to charge but it has 2 usb ports on the back. The only thing i will say is, i would have rather paid the $15 for a usb stick that is smaller.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used a t3s since about 2005 and have had it for over a year. its pretty bad quality. it has never worked well. this is not a phone but an iphone, and the iphones iphons are made in china. this iphon has no display and no usb port. its basically a black box. i bought this ikea for an extension to my desk because its pretty cheap and i figured i would replace this ive lost track of all of my iphonic devices. it works on my ipod touch but not the ikeas.  This review is from: ikeal.com - ikeahdts.com The ikeb is amazing. For the price, it is a must have. I use the phone as my main phone for work. Ive bought it for 4 years, and it still works well. This device is very durable and very comfortable to hold. You cant beat the price. I recommend it to anyone who needs a phone that is great quality, but will hold up over time and can be replaced easily.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for about 2 years. it still looks like new, but has had a lot of problems. it has a hard drive problem. it gets a boot disc in, but if you press any buttons you get a garbled mess. the controller is the same problem. after the second time i tried to turn it on, it was unable to. the buttons are also stuck. i couldnt even type in the serial number. i guess this thing is not built as well as some of the other ipads. i would recommend this to others.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ************************* I have the Samsung smart tv for years but it has gotten slower and less reliable the more I have it. I used the tv to watch movies as well as videos and this was not a problem at all. I was watching a tv show and a song and then the music stopped and it wouldn't play until I unplugged the tv. Not a big problem. I thought the tv would last longer but now the quality is really poor. I get the impression it would work better with a computer but with a tv like this it works well. I will be getting an apple tv for Christmas. (Posted on 8/22/2012)  Works as advertised Review by mike Quality Price Value I like the ease of use and the fact that you do not have to look at a screen for a couple seconds to view a movie/music. The only negative point I have is that the sound gets a little thin after a while but the sound is still ok. The one positive point is the quality of the image is better than my old plasma and I haven't had any issues with it. ( Posted on 8th October 2012)  and it works like a charm. and with the apple tv, i just had to use it. i bought it yesterday and i haven't even opened it yet. it works great. i'm a little disappointed with the box it came in. there was a little hole in it and it's not so easy to put it back together with a little effort. but as far as the tv, that i have not had any problems with, as far has i'm concerned. (i bought it online on sale and it arrived in less than 3 days) (Posted by John D. (2 days ago) , and it doesn't have the issue with audio dropping out that the Samsung has had.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ikp: I have only been using this device for about a month now. My older model had issues with the mic dropping out occasionally so when I got my new one the first thing I did was replace the mic. Then a month later I found out the device had died because of the internal battery. I had bought two batteries for the device so it was a total loss. I replaced the unit with another that is a much cheaper model. The first time I used the new one I used it like it was new but then the first time the same thing happened again. It was a real pain in the butt to do this as you need to disassemble the old one. The second time I had my new unit a different brand of batteries arrived so it seemed that the problem was with the new batteries as I replaced them with the same brand of product and it worked like a charm. This is a bad thing because it cost me a lot of money to fix it. However I guess in the end it was worth the hassle. I hope the unit is working out fine for the rest of my life.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an absolutely horrible little toy. I bought this because I wanted to have a real vibrator with some power and some power that would last. It doesn't have a remote at all. I have to set it up and program it myself. It is very expensive. It also has horrible vibrations that you can feel when the switch is on. Also, the batteries last for less time than expected. It was a great toy when it was new. It just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. If you are looking for a vibrator that does not require batteries and does not cost over a thousand dollars I would suggest other vibrators that are better quality and more powerful.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Perfectly Elegant I'm new to the world of vibrators, and my wife and I purchased this to add to our collection. It's a great size. We've tried most, so it is just right for us. I'm used to a smaller size, and I don't like the fact that the small end is too long. The vibrations are great, and it's not too heavy or too squishy, so I can keep it on for hours without any stimulation. I also found it comfortable, even though I'm a very large woman. I was surprised by the battery life (I was expecting it to have like a year or so, but this one has lasted like 6 months now). I've not gotten it wet yet, but the last time I did, it didn't last very long. So, if you're looking for the highest quality, but don't have too much money and can only use it for a couple of hours, go for it. I've read a lot of reviews that say this is not the best quality, and some that say it's the worst, so be forewarned. However, I don.t mind the small issues, it's just a little short and too long on me. I like the way it looks and the feel. ,  ,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my husband to use when he is taking his medication. It was very easy to install and the screen does not flicker at all. The only drawback is that there is no back up battery, so the batteries are not replaceable. The device is not heavy duty and does not have any kind of built-in speakers to make it feel like it is making any sound. The other problem is that the Bluetooth does not work at all, there is absolutely no connection to it when the device is charging. So in conclusion this is an ok unit for the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive tried this on a couple of android tablets with very good results but had to go back to my iPad because it stopped working well and had to return it. The screen is very reflective. I got the 8.4 and it had the most reflective screen I've ever seen. And the speakers were just not good. I couldn't understand what was being said when I had them on. The speakers on the iPad are excellent. And they are loud enough. The only way I could get them to work was to put them in the laptop case they came in and try to turn them on and it wouldn't work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First of all, this monitor is the most awful thing to have ever been invented and I don't even like it in its normal state of use.   The monitor works by detecting the light shining on the screen and calculating the time it took the light to reach the screen. Then it estimates the amount of brightness the screen is supposed to have, as measured by the light emitted. It then outputs that number into the VGA connector on the front of the monitor.  -VGA to USB- A plug is required to interface this monitor to a USB port.  .  ,   I've owned one other monitor that was just as bad. The second one worked much better.   the monitor worked fine when plugged into my computer with a serial port on the back of the computer.   (yes, it's kind of cool that it has a serial link and not a VGA link but I had to connect it to a computer with an RS232 port. It would have been so much easier if I'd just bought a USB hub for the monitor instead of a serial converter.   The USB port was kind of crappy. It wasn't the most powerful, but it was still more than adequate for what I needed.  I finally got the monitor up and running with my computer. It is extremely slow in operation. I couldn't even use it with the keyboard and mouse connected because the monitor couldn't keep up. My computer kept getting disconnected. Eventually, I tried to connect the monitor to the computer via a USB cable. My laptop kept getting hot and dying every time it connected to the monitor because the USB cable didn't have the right voltage level. This is a huge deal because I am only using this monitor as an image display device for my laptop. That means it will take up a lot of power and will be very hot on it.     This whole thing was a complete disaster. I had the monitor a week or so and the screen was still not good. I still have trouble adjusting the brightness settings on the monitor for various different viewing environments. It does not have a VESA mount but it does have a 2-pin mini DIN plug which is pretty much all I have to work with.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this phone for a year and hasnt worked, it is like my baby phone that hasnt taken off.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, November 05, 2011  Good value  by Paul from St. Louis MO USA  Pros: Small size  Cons: Price  Review: The price is reasonable and the phone is easy to use.  The only downer is the battery. It is a 4.7 volt cell that takes an hour to charge if you use a usb powerbank to power it.  the other things the phone has going for it are it has a small size and is cheap to run. I would buy this phone again and it works great as a phone.  and the battery life is great, it takes a day to fully charge.  of course the best part is that its a android phone. I had a couple of complaints and they worked. I can't say enough about the quality of this phone. If you want a very small cell phone, this is the one. "I like the fact that this phone has an internet connection and works in my hotel room. . Bought this to keep my cell phone on me in case I am stranded. If I didn't have it, I would have been stuck without my internet or phone for days. It will give you a good value for the price."

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive just bought the same type of thing and it works fine until the power on and off buttons go dead within a few months. The old one had a little screen that wasnt touch screen or a bluetooth that was hard to turn on, and could only be used to make phone calls andnt be used for anything else. If it could connect to a network it would have been ok but now it just dies after the phone calls are over. I also bought the older one that had bluetooth but didnt have a memory card slot. That was a problem, the old one didnt have the memory card option.

This is the second iiphone i have bought in the past 5 years and it has not fixed any problems for me. I was not expecting it to but you are lucky to get this product when it is as good as it is. - November 18, 2015 good product but the service is sooo low - November 17, 2015 not good product I bought this to use on my computer and it doesnt work at all. I contacted customer service and they told me that I would need to get another one for it to work properly. I have tried it 3 times so far on my new pc and no luck. I would have to get my friend to bring me another one if i cant do it myself. - October 15, 2015

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! This device sucks!! I love it because it is so small. It fits in your hand and it feels so light! But that's where it ends!! I would rather have a larger one and it would be great if it was bigger. I have had the same problem with my old one. The LED flashes, then turns off, and doesn't work. Then I try to restart it and it doesn't turn back on. I tried turning off the main light and even trying the side light but it doesn.t work either. The power cable gets plugged into the same spot as the button and the buttons only light up the first few times they are pressed. So if you like it, you can get it and enjoy it but it's just a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the i2e 2.0 for almost 3 years it worked fine until the other day when i was trying to set up a wireless printer it wouldnt work the first time it worked after that the printer had no signal then it quit working again it was dead i couldnt get it to restart no problem that would have been a problem at first but now its not ive bought and used many different products and all worked fine and the i8 is the worst ive ever had i dont know how to stop this thing ive sent all of my electronics to different stores that have them and its just one more dead piece i know i will have to do the repairs myself or have them done i dont understand how anyone could spend so much money on a product when the customer is never going to get it working good luck with your repair or you are a fool if you bought one just because its cheap, you have better luck with the i5 or i7 if your in the market for an older computer i hope its the i6 because i dont think it will be worth it for this junk ive spent over 10 hours on this now the printer just wont print and it says it is the software problem so i dont see how it would work otherwise this thing will stay as my primary computer until i figure something else out. i guess its my lucky day or maybe i should have bought a better model of printer its been more expensive to repair then it should have been and i cant believe how much a 3d printer costs to repair.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using an mp3 player with out the internet for about 5 months and now it is stuck on "refreshing" and doesnt restart. The unit is about 7 years old and the sound quality is horrible. i can now hear the static/noise in my music. i am really fed up of having to use the internet to play any music. it does however play music on my ipod. this would be a good product for under $200 if the service could be better. i would not buy it for the money.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was in the market to buy a new router because of the poor reviews and the fact I was having issues with our old one. I had a bit of time to kill so I went in and got a Netgear DVR-320. Upon installation, I was very impressed by the ease of setup and use. After it was set up, I noticed I was able to watch all of the movies I wanted to and all of my movies I recorded on the device. However, the first night, I had to wait an hour until all of our neighbors went to bed and then it would not work until the next morning. I've been able to troubleshoot and get it working but I feel like there is a lot more that could be done with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I have had the dnx for a few months now and it has been great and works very well.

I have even set it up to control my dishwasher from my computer. I would recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because I had purchased an inexpensive iPod 2 2 years ago and it failed to record my music for some reason. I called Apple and the tech in charge of tech support said that they could not help me and that the thing is defective. I then got another iPod and the same thing happened. I got so frustrated that I had to write a negative Yelp review. I would not buy another brand.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Very disappointed in the product. I purchased it for the camera in my camera bag. I wanted to use the camera and the wireless remote in a room with low ambient light. However, the wireless range and range of the remote were extremely limited. It was hard to work on a project in the room and even harder to work from the back of my car. I used a lot of batteries. Not that it would have been a problem if I could have had any.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because my daughter needed a little one, she was bored of all the toys we have. We have a bunch of toys and one was this one. She had problems with the buttons not working.  I have also had it pop on and off. Then it would work for a day or two. The only time it did not work was when the battery went dead and had to be replaced. We finally fixed it with a repair tool.  the toy was a little too small and didn't work the way I wanted.   Had my child try out the toy a few times before buying and I have to say it's a great little one for the price but I will not recommend it.  of 3 people found this review helpful Overall 3 Story 1 Animation 1 Sound 3 Character 2 Enjoyment 3   Great price, good quality.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   You should know about the problems and should have checked the specifications before buying.  The sound is very bad (not the microphone). I bought the headset for my girlfriend, she loves it but can't use it because the headset is not very good. :  I was a bit skeptical about this product, but I decided to give it a try. This is my third pair of headphones, and I just can't get used to them. I will be returning them ASAP.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought 5 of these. ive been using them since they were cheap and they have lasted almost 3 years. they only work when plugged in, the screen will flicker and not work.  i dont know how this device can even work in the first place.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I use this for my phone but it has trouble charging, if the phone is charging and is turned off, the battery indicator will flash 1 minute after the phone turns on and back on again. It should have a setting or a button to prevent this from happening.  Noise:   I really like this product but this noise that it makes when it is charging is just a pain in the butt. This is an electronic device that you want to charge with as little noise as possible.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    No power supply/rectifier needed for this unit, and it is the cheapest unit i could find on ebay. I am using it as a battery backup for my phone, and as a remote control for my ipod/iphone. I got mine for $25, and have had no problems with it, except that it takes 2 batteries and 2 usb cables to power it. I don't know what a usb cable is, but it does need a power source to work.   This unit is a bit small, but I think its better than an iPad or anything else that is bigger.  , and i did find a cheap one on e-bay (and even cheaper on craigslist). I am on a budget, and the small size of the device is great. This is what i wanted, and its a great product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my phone for about 2 years now and ive seen some pretty nasty battery fires, i always have to go back to my charger (as soon as it dies)  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, February 06, 2010  Great  by Richard from Santa Monica CA USA  Pros: Simple interface. Battery indicator for the charger.  Cons: Doesn't charge the phone fast enough.  to charge it.  is not easy to use (i had to do two sets of adjustments on the phone.) and i had to spend about half an hour to figure out which plug the charger is connected to.  has some problems with the charger and the plug. the charging current is slow, it will sometimes not even charge to 50%.  Review: The unit worked fine. There is a small indicator light that displays the battery charge. When the phone is at 25%, it shows the charging indicator. Once the phone reaches 50%, the light turns off, which means the battery is dead and needs to be replaced.   I found the charging plug a bit hard to use. I needed to remove the protective covering and pry the connector out of its socket. It was difficult to work with.    The battery indicator works well. Once I started the charging, the charging LED turned red.   the charging light doesn't always indicate the current charge level. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a great computer and very easy to set up. However, if you don't know how to boot up the computer, then you will be in for a world of hurt.   This is the same computer we used to purchase a few years ago and it has been a great product.  It is just too bad we have had this one so long.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really love the quality of the audio and how it is very detailed. It is great for gaming and listening to music. But I am very disappointed in the lack of Bluetooth. The headphone jack is not included on the headphones. I am so disappointed in this product. The price is great, but I had to spend money to get a headphone jack. It's just so hard to find one. Other than that, I am happy with it!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a VERY BAD electronic device. It doesn't work. The only thing I've used on it is a digital clock, and it also freezes. The digital clock works just fine with the other device. I would not recommend this item for any use. You must either have a high end computer that has an external USB port. The phone needs to be able to connect to it through USB. I do not think this device will last long.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Niech from Good Product I have a Samsung S6 and the power adapter is not good enough for my phone. It just won't charge it. I bought this adapter for a Samsung Galaxy S5 which is just as bad. It didn't even charge it because of the faulty charger. I am happy with this adapter because it makes charging my phones easier. It also charges my tablets which I use for movies and shows on. I just put it on my phone when I'm not using it. This is the only way I use this to charge my phone because I don't have another outlet near my bed.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone4g works well on my 2 yr old iphon but my battery is dying quickly and the only good thing i can say about it is that it works for a day then you have to put it back in the charger and the battery won't charge any longer.

Cons: I'm going to be a very big Apple fan, but this product does have one major shortcoming, I'm using an iphoner and its not charging.  of the many times I've needed to recharge my iphoni...  I am the most tech savvy person in my family and this little gadget has saved my life. The device itself looks like a cell phone, but works like an iPod. It's easy to use and allows me to control the media playback, photos, email and all my other electronic devices from my iPhone. There is a small red LED on the back of the device that lights up when you use it. You can also turn the device on and off with the push of a button. This little device has changed my life in several ways. It has a built in flash drive, camera and MP3 player. I can play my music to my  iPod, record my video to my iPhone and email my pictures to my Facebook account. I have my iPod hooked up to it, but it isn't charged up very often because I have it in my purse and I don't want to take it out and charge it. This device is like a second iPod, it's very small, very easy to carry, and I love it. "it works for my family" (no pun intended)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for about a year now and it breaks down very frequently.

The original isnt too hard to fix but it takes about 30 minutes or so to figure out how to do that. It was fun playing with it before this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first phone that I bought my wife was my first (she was 16) I was so proud of my new smart phone and its battery. I was getting tons of texts and i thought she would be happy to see that she had a smart phone that was still as fast as a smart one. She was very disappointed when she got the phone and found out that she can't text on it. She has a smart tv and she has noticed that she needs to sit up all the time. She also cannot watch anything on her TV. I have a tv for her and she is more then happy with it. My wife has been a smart girl for a long time but she is finally leaving me so I will have to find a new girlfriend.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my iphone for a while now and its still not working, the battery keeps dying after a week of usage. i cant find the problem no matter how many times i take it apart. i have no warranty on it and the phone is only a couple of months old. i know it might have been defective but that makes me want to return it to apple, i paid about $600 and i wanted my money back and i am willing to pay extra to get a working iphones. it would be worth trying. i guess i could find a decent one somewhere, im not paying more than a few bucks for a phone.  I don't know much about electronics, but I have spent more time and money trying to fix them than I have watching TV, playing video games, or anything else. The only reason I bought this iPhone 5 is because I wanted a good camera and a great screen, but now I feel like I bought a broken device. I bought the first iPhone in the series, but it was in such poor condition that I couldn't use it for months. So now I have to purchase yet another new phone just to use it. I don't recommend Apple products at all and have no faith in their customer service or the quality of their products. I will continue to wait for their latest models, but until then I would rather wait a month for an update than have to buy the same phone twice. I hate having to return phones. I just want my money and the device is totally worthless. I feel very bad for the people that have this new model.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had one of these for over a year it has been fine until recently when i went on vacation. the phone wouldnt turn off when i was laying it down and had to turn it on. i had to call out to tech support and they took about two weeks to call me back to say they made a mistake and they would have it in 2 days but they said im sure its going to be back in a few days. i got the phone back the next day and now my wife cant use it at all. i called back to ask if it would take longer to fix and they said no its going back in 2 weeks. i am so pissed at this company it almost killed me to get another one. I hope my next one is a better value from now on.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------- I've been using my HP laptop for some time now. I've had it for almost a year and I've never had any problems with it. I thought it was getting old and I finally bought an 870 laptop. I figured I'd just upgrade to the latest and greatest. What I received was the same old laptop, the same screen, the old keyboard, same old trackpad, and the same problems. I had been buying new laptops from Apple since i bought an Apple TV. So I figured the computer would work just fine. The laptop had the same problem I was having with my Apple TV, even when the box was turned off. All I had to do was turn on my TV and i was fine. I just didn't want to keep paying for my new laptop. So i went to Best Buy and bought the new laptop, hoping it would work as well as the old one. I was wrong. I can't get my trackpad to work. Every single time I hit the space bar, the trackpad freezes up. It has been nearly a month since I bought the laptop. The keyboard was fine before I bought it, but it is completely unusable now. The trackpad is horrible, I have to turn it off and on. I will buy a brand new one and use that. I don't want my money wasted on a computer that does everything I thought. I'll just keep my old one and continue using it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Michael from Excellent Product for the Price I was impressed with the performance of this product when I first received it. When I first switched to this computer, I knew that the quality and performance of the HP EliteBook was a step above all other laptops. It works flawlessly on my Macbook Pro 10.5-817LT with a Radeon HD 7770M and NVIDIA 8600M GT. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because I still find that the graphics are slightly laggy. Other than that, the performance is still great and this product is the best laptop I've used. ,  ,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my 3rd ROG mouse. The first one had a serious issue, the motor on this one has problems when moving.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had purchased this as a present for my daughter as she was interested in computers. I figured that with the money I would pay for this and a bunch of other things she would do with her own. But the day she got it, I realized what a mistake I made, she was using it all the time on her tablet and did not have to go to the store to get the correct one. When she did get it she broke it and was angry, so I ended up throwing it away.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After a month of using this I decided to break it in and get use out of it.  When I got it I was pleased with the way it looks and functioned.  It has a few flaws which I will address later on.  Once I had broken in the buttons and buttons were easy to use and easy to navigate.  When using the buttons on this thing I was shocked at how loud it is.  With some headphones you don't need to press anything.  This thing is loud.  I use this with my Sony stereo headphones and there is no way to have these headphones be louder then the button.  The button volume controls are very good and easy.  On the flip side I have a very expensive pair of headphones.  They are made of a high quality leather.  Even if this thing was $100 I wouldn't buy it.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If I had to rate this item based on the quality, design, and functionality, it would be 1 star. However, the build quality was awful, and it was not hard to repair. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because of the fact that it doesn't work with the iPad or iPod Touch. The built in charger only lasts for about 2 hours, and the device is only usable after charging.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you are not the type of person that likes your new toy immediately, there is nothing to do but to put it back into it's box and throw away the rest.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was the first device I ever bought, and its one of the worst gadgets I ever used. I thought it would be great for games, but I found it to be very slow and cumbersome. The only time it worked was when I went to take pictures of my home, but not when I was doing any other functions like watching a movie or playing a game. I am hoping that someone will offer me a refund or a replacement, because I don't feel like I wasted my money on this. I have used it for 3 years now, and will never be going back to it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________________  I got one for my first computer but it died before I could use it. I was really disappointed. I then got another one for use on my PC. Then one of the batteries went flat and the phone stopped working! The warranty did not cover this. I had it returned to Amazon for the replacement. The replacement is not even close to the original one. The screen is terrible. It's hard to read on the phone and if you want to use the screen, you have to go through the pain of unplugging it and turning it on again. So it's not worth my money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to play games on, but I have had issues with my controller not working well. Once I put it in my computer I noticed a very noticeable difference in sound, the controller vibrated and had a slight echo in the sound. I tried unplugging it from the wall, but that only made the echo louder. It worked when I turned on my computer to play the game, but then the sound wouldn't work properly again. I have tried the original controller as well and that worked just fine.   Very disappointing product, I'll be returning it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this with the idea that I would get the maximum performance out of it. It has been a while since I have used one, so I was very happy when I realized I could only listen to music on the earbuds, which I do on a daily basis. I did have the thought that the plastic case would eventually crack and I would have to return it. The case cracked before I even had the earphones in my hand. I was not able to buy another pair.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, October 24, 2011  Works great for listening to music with earphones  by Jack from Houston TX USA  Pros: Works well for listening with the ear buds and works with a variety of mp3's.  a little to light  Cons: none  Review: I love these things, and they are very comfortable. I don't use the built in mic that comes with them (my ears hurt after about an hour of listening to some tunes with the microphone and these work very well) but they do a great job of blending with the music.  in addition I find that they work well with a wide variety of portable mp3 player, but I find them to be slightly muffled to the point of not hearing much of the music if they are not positioned close to your ear. .  the only cons that I found are the little ones that come with them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! You have to get this to work right!!! First I had it all wrong and got it too short when I pulled out my old one (that was an old model with a small motor and a built in clock) and then it wouldn't hold my batteries (the batteries I had had to be disconnected and I had to change the battery pack because the one it was using was a bad one). After changing the battery and the clock and getting it working right I put it back on a night stand with the battery removed and it took the battery out of the clock. I couldn't find a better place to store the batteries in the clock but I didn't think it was worth it, not worth it when I can get it working RIGHT and the price is great.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "I ordered the manta ray for my dog. The only problem is the magnetic power supply unit (I don't know where else to refer to it). It was easy to set up but after about an hour I discovered that the magnetic unit had been damaged in shipping. I sent the unit back for a replacement and the replacement unit failed immediately. The new unit came with a dead chip and had no power at all. I don't like dealing with Amazon because of this and I'm not happy with this purchase.   I was hoping for a super easy set up and this was not it. Not even a "quick" set up, the magnetic was working fine but the chip in the new unit was just dead. I am going to be writing a review to complain to Amazon about this failure. I tried to contact the customer support team via email and they have no idea where to go.   and the magnetic worked great when I first bought it but after this failure it just doesn't work for me.   of course the magnetic works great when you're not going to charge it!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad electronic product that was replaced on a cheap price and the batteries were low in capacity. So much so that when you turn the phone off, you can feel the plastic on the right edge of the phone start to bend and tear at the edges. Not the end of the world, but I feel this product is defective.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I was looking for a battery charger for my phone and came across the Nitecore. I was disappointed because it was missing the charge indicator. So I left it home and after waiting a few days it finally charged my phone up! This is the only negative thing that I will say about the charger. Other than that I would buy this product again!!!  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works Great For me, this charger has worked fine, and has given me all the power I need to get back to work after a long day at work. I only wish it had a more convenient place to put the USB cable in it. I wish it was more convenient to charge my phone from this thing than a wall charger (which is less of a hassle).

But, one day it went wrong and I got an error message that my device is frozen and will not be reactivated.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      As others have stated, the only thing that I don't like about the GSM mod is the battery life. The GSM batteries are designed for low-power tasks so they don't last long. I have used it in the dark, in a dim office setting, and at about 2 am when I'm not paying attention to my smartphone. I got it about 2 years ago and I still have the original battery. It has never failed me. But I just got an older one that lasted me 6 months. I bought a battery charger so I can recharge it, but that makes it even worse.   In conclusion, if you're looking for a good quality and simple mod, this is a good choice. If you're on a budget and you want something you can use on a daily basis, this won't satisfy you.   the only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is because it's not user friendly.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a hdmi dongle for a year or two. ive replaced the dongles the same time every year and ive always had an issue. the dongs didnt last long, i didnt like the size of them. and now the newer usb dongels are not any better.  to me, they are just a cheap dongel for a cheap iphone or ipod.  they are very noisy.  i just have to put my iphones and ipods in the bag, i will get the ipod in the end but thats always the only thing i will do. and dont get me wrong, i love my ipod and iphony, but i love the cheap usb dongs.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------  This is the only electronic device i have ever owned that i have had to take apart and take apart again. I have had other brands of electronic devices that i've owned but i bought this product because i liked the looks, ease of use and overall functionality of it. Unfortunately, the only problem i have experienced so far is that the unit started vibrating continuously while the power was off. I was not able to figure out what was causing the buzzing and once i went into the "advanced options" and turned off the "vibrating function" the unit stopped. I would suggest to all of you who are thinking about buying this device to try it out first before buying because it's so easy to take it apart and re-assemble but if you don't have a little patience and don't know what you are doing, you are going to have a bad time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The    battery life of my   Galaxy S4   was very poor.   My   phone would die very often on me.  The charger   only   takes about a day to charge my  phone so the   need for   a battery recharger.  I have to charge it once a day or it will die on me and not charge.  It would be great if   Apple could work with   Samsung and add a more powerful   usb charger to the     Galaxy phone   instead of the    limited one they provide.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have two of these products, and I have a feeling that these things are just going to break. If I had to bet my life on it, I would bet it that there is going to be an eventual "release" of a new, more "feature-rich" version of this product. If you have any concerns about your new electronic device and want to keep it running, please consider getting a cheapo brand like this one. The unit that came with my PC is now useless.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    1. It takes me 30 minutes to figure out how to change settings on it.  2. The software is too slow to operate on large media files.  the video quality was ok.  on the sound it works fine.   If it had been an external USB flash drive or something that it could connect to its own port i would be good with it.   the only problem i have is that the internal battery is a weak one, it dies in less than a month and after that, there is no way i can get a replacement battery.  . .  is this a bad review? this is my 2nd USB thumb drive, one that i bought for my laptop (that i can connect to my computer) and that works like a dream. i think its a great idea.  and for my son it is perfect for recording some of his videos at school and making them to watch later with his friends.   I hope this helps some people understand that the idea behind the concept is good.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________ I got the E3200, 2 months ago, and I've been using it for about a month now. First of all, I did the "easy" install and it worked fine. I got a problem after I upgraded the BIOS to the latest and it got so slow that I had to do it again with the upgrade. After that, the device would not come on when I turned on the computer. I then got the cable that came with it. It worked again and all of the settings worked. So I figured out that the problem with the old cable was that the USB port is not in the right place. The new cable works and is just like the old one. Also, it's way harder to install that the original cable than the new one. I had no problems after it was installed. So, no big deal. I hope this helps.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the new wireless earphones to replace the ones I got in 2008 and these have not done a good job. I used to get great sound and I can't get that sound anymore. It's hard to tell if I'm on a quiet flight or not. They sound muffled, like you have a tin foil hat on your head. They make me nauseous. They don't play music. They are great if you are on the go and just want the good sound but you can't tell you are listening to music.   Noise complaints:  The only thing that I can really complain about is the sound. It does a good impression of being a headphone in a headset. The problem I have is that the sound is not clear. I don't know if it is the noise cancelling feature of the headphones, or if they are just not really designed for people with a high volume level. It sounds like it is being miked by a very very small speaker and not a subwoofer or something.  Best to go with good headphones  My new favorite!  I had to buy these after being disappointed with the last ones I bought. These are great. You are able to listen to music, podcasts and so much more with the built in noise canceling feature. I really like them and they are a great value. I can feel a difference in the sound when I use them.  I got my own pair to try out but I will be getting them for all of my friends and family to use. I will say that it is nice to have a device that doesn't have that annoying plastic case and you can wash and store them in a laundry bag instead of a box.  have been using the bluetooth since it was released. When I went to get the old ones, they were pretty noisy. I found a way to make them work but was only able to use one at a time. Now I'm using the new bluetooth version and they're amazing. You can hear the music while you go about your day and they don't cause you to lose focus when you are in your car. I love them
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using this unit for 2.5 years and i hate that i had to buy a new battery to replace it as it died twice in a year (first time with the charger and second time with 2nd battery - the first time i called it and the second time it was sent out to me to recive, but they didnt have it for two weeks and got back to me in three and a half weeks, i called them and they said its not for customers and to call back in a month or two and when i did i was told i had 5 days to recieve the replacement and so i waited and waited... ive recieved the replacement 3 days ago and it doesnt even work and has a dead battery. ive tried all the things from my parts box to check the connections but still nothing has worked - this is one of the worst gadgets i have ever seen.  I don't think the battery is replaceable - if anyone has any ideas what to do i would appreciate it!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is my first ever computer, and I was very excited to get one, until I found out it could not be powered on by the AC adapter which came with it! It was completely dead. The problem was solved with the advice of one of the other users here, and after a day of trying to fix it I am so grateful that I did. I was so afraid that I was going to be stuck with this, because I have been trying for so many years to get my laptop to run on AC power, but my local hardware store said that it was too late for it to be fixed. I'm not going to give it away, because there is no way in hell I am ever going to use it, but it was such a great idea to have an AC adapter for my laptop, which usually has a 10W power source, but I guess I will need an external one anyway, because this is now my only computer. I highly recommend this product for people like me who don't want to pay so much money for the latest laptop, but still need AC power for it. I bought this one on sale and it's worth every penny.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------ After I bought the unit I was excited to try it out. After about 3 days of running my car it started randomly shutting off. I thought it was the fan so I looked at the fan settings and it was set at the maximum RPM on the fan. I did some research and found that the fan speed controls would need to be changed or replaced. The device is an absolute nightmare to start. It will shut off and reset itself with no warning. This is a big issue. The product is not cheap and there are plenty of other people with a much better experience.

I also got a different radio about the same time. Not worth the money to me, not worth the hassle. --------------  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, February 12, 2012  Great radio  by B from Wausau WI USA  Pros: compact & easy to use  Cons: none  Review: I was searching for a portable radio that could work on 3G cellular networks. I'm a cell phone user and found the RCA R-5000 to be a very good fit. It's compact and has a lot of controls. It has the ability to work on various 3G mobile networks such as A-GSM, 3G, GSM, CDMA2000, CDME, LTE, HSDPA, HSUPA, WCDMA, and LTE. It also works with many landline phones (WCS, Fax, Digital Telephone, etc). I have been using this radio with a Garmin GPS unit for a long time and it works well. I really like the ability of this radio to record/play back mp3 music. A few things that could be better: *I wish the screen was a bit brighter but it's perfect for me. *There is not enough power for a high-powered radio (like the R-5500) and it runs on batteries that are fairly weak. *It takes about 10 minutes to fully charge the batteries. *The screen could be a bit bigger. *I haven't used it for very long since I started using it but I believe the battery life to be about an hour.  So far I love it!!!  What I like:  • Great for the price. I love having all the control. It can listen to audio as well as the cell phones with the audio.

I tried a new one and it worked, but then I noticed that the original connector was still there. I made a new Dremeling bit, but it's not very sturdy because it does not have a big enough tip.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a hb6 for over a year now, and the keyboard is not as nice as the hd5.the keys on the hb 6 are smaller than the ht5 and the spacebar isnt nearly as good.the ht6 keys are also made of plastic and feel very cheap.the case on the bm5 is much nicer to use.i couldnt find an upgrade board for the hbs and they all look the same.i tried other keyboard brands and they are all as good as the bf5.i am very happy with my hb5 and never had an issue.  I bought this product with high expectations but after using this keyboard for over 2 months the first things I notice is the keycap design is too tall and the buttons are stiff so the keyboard feels and looks cheap. The layout is easy to learn. I would never recommend this product to anyone.  The first thing I noticed is the keys are too tall. This keyboard is the same keyboard on the top and the bottom. I am sure the top of the keyboard has the same height as the bottom but the bottom keyboard is only 1/4 the size of the top one. I cant even find one key that works. The spacebar seems to be plastic and looks too cheap. It feels cheap. I bought this keyboard expecting to use it everyday but after 2 months I'm not so sure. I don't feel like it's worth the money. The only thing it does has a light that can be a pain in the neck especially with all the typing.  for the money you can't beat this one. It is one of the best keyboard on this market. It's lightweight, easy to type on, and even looks cheap at first. But it's all worth it. It takes alot of work to get this keyboard to work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "I purchased the XR400 (the only one on the market at the time) with a couple of other high end features including a dual screen monitor. The device worked fine.   However when I tried to record a TV show that was recorded on a high definition TV set (720p) the picture quality was so bad that the picture could not be seen from the TV set.  .   he sound was garbled, and the volume was turned way down and all the channels had a different volume.     I then purchased the Zoom H7000 that came with the X400, and also worked fine until it came out of warranty...the Zoom did NOT make it through its warranty!   The warranty on the Zoom was only 5 years...I bought it 5 years ago and did NOT receive a replacement.  - I am a small business owner and I could never afford the Zoom...the warranty is so low it is ridiculous!"   This is one of my biggest gripes with this set. I used a Zoom H6200, which was a much better device. Now I'm forced to buy a new HDTV set and I can't make it work. I know this is not the device's fault, but I'm just so frustrated I just can't get over it.   for the price of this HDTV, it was a great set. Not many TVs I have purchased can do what the Xr is capable of, however the quality difference is dramatic.

I'm using it to use the AirPlay streaming feature of my AppleTV.  the iPad adapter is not available.  of the 3.0 it has, the second is the best. the other two are good, but the first one is great. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using this thing for about a year now and it has been nothing but trouble. the sound is horrible, there is NO bass, the volume is very weak and the speaker is the same. there is no way to turn it on or off. theres also NO WAY to change the settings without destroying the phone. i have had this thing about a month and am having a hard time finding it a place to send it back or get it repaired. it should not be used, in fact it should be illegal to sell like this. ive even had the owner of the store that I bought it from tell me that he will return it to me as he doesnt want to work on it anymore. i feel like if this had been a phone I had for 5 years instead of a $50 one, i would have been much happier.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When i got this i had a 3 yr old old Dell tower, so i was a bit skeptical about the whole thing.   After about 30 minutes of setup, i plugged it in to my router and got the dreaded error:   Error: Failed to initialize: EAGAIN   I looked at the serial and found that it was on the Dell.  , but that does not explain what caused the failure, as i have a Dell tower in my basement.   for now i have to make do with the original Dell (which is still running well), and hope that they put some kind of fix on it that the new one will also work as well.   a   So yeah, i will not buy anything from them again. They messed up the whole system.  The best i can say is that i will be buying my new tower from another ebay seller as soon as possible!  I ordered it from amazon. I got it the next day and just like i said, it was faulty. So i tried to contact the other seller and this is the response I got from them:     Thank you for your email and we are sorry to hear you are experiencing issues with this product.  as i said above, the unit is not working properly.  . The unit is faulty so we do not have any further information or support to offer.  (3-22-15)  Click to expand...
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ***************** The first thing I noticed was the loud clicking of the batteries in my new iHome i5 refrigerator. It seemed to be a common issue with all of the other reviews and other users have mentioned it on Facebook. It was only after many days of not using the device that I found that my refrigerator has some sort of problem where it won't turn on. Even after putting in the batteries twice and changing the batteries, it would still not turn on (or would just turn off randomly). In the middle of the night, my refrigerator would still be off. After a trip to the Apple store, I found out that there is a problem with the batteries where it has a defect in the bottom which prevents the fridge from being opened by the manual latch. I will never be buying another iHome again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had this about 2 months ago and it is still working fine but there is no way to lock or turn off the phone using the usb port. You have to use a small coin and plug it into the phone to turn it on and off.   It is hard to get rid of batteries on this device.  You need to use the charger and battery to plug them in and then you need to put the battery and charger back in to charge.  It's not easy.  If your going to go this route you should probably buy a cheap phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased a K-Y SE that I had to replace a couple of years back because the buttons were getting stuck. This thing still works, and the buttons work fine but the keypad is just as dead as when I first got it. It doesn't do what I want it to. Aesthetics/Build Quality:    The thing doesn't look like a phone, and it feels like it too. The keys are big but don't have enough travel. The power button and volume buttons are easy to press but you need to squeeze and push to get the proper function. There is a big piece of foam in the way of the power button so you can't turn it on/off. It also is too easy to turn on when sitting in your car, the cover on the back is flimsy.   The screen is clear, not a lot of contrast but it does the job. I have a Nexus S and I don't get a lot from the screen. The K-K SE has a little more contrast and it is nice to look at and use for the money. Price:  The K series has come down a lot in price over the last couple of seasons. You get the phone for around $300-$400 depending on the color of the model you get.  Consistency:  I can't speak to the reliability of this device and how it works.  If it is a deal breaker for you it is $60 for the case with a free phone case. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!!! This piece of crap does not have any sort of software on it and cannot be used as a digital recorder. After reading the reviews on here I'm appalled at the quality and the fact that this piece of junk will not record. I purchased this item about 2 years ago, and I was sooooo pleased with it that I was planning on buying a second unit. After one day of use the battery was dead. I called the manufacturer, and they sent me a replacement. This is the second piece of garbage I have received from this manufacturer. They are also trying to rip people off with their shipping charges!! I will never buy a product from them again and will not be recommending them to anyone. The poor quality and low price of this product is unbelievable. I was expecting the absolute best out of a digital device that has all the features you would expect from a good quality audio recorder but sadly this one has failed me. I am now looking for a different digital recorder and will keep this one as a backup.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was purchased to replace a cell phone and I am not happy with it.  I purchased this for my iPhone.  The phone works fine on the surface but when I attempt to dial it and the "cannot dial" message comes up, it hangs up. I have not tested if it will not work with other cell phones that I have owned.   The screen on this phone is quite bad, it does not appear to be made of glass or something that would resist scratches like an iPhone does.  If I wanted to change the screen on my iPhone I could have easily purchased the glass screen protector. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I first got my X1, I thought it was a great little box. It was a good size, light weight and had a nice feel to it. I would say the buttons were easy to press and the design was pretty good. But after a couple months it has become quite difficult to use. Now the first time you use it you need to turn it to off, then back on. Then you have to press the power button and a few times, it says that it is on. The next time you try to use it, it will only let you power it on to save energy. After that you need the "Power" button in order to turn off the device. I have tried different cables, USB ports, different microswitches, different batteries, different switches and I can't get it to turn back on again. I've tried resetting the power switch several times and it did nothing. When I finally did find a reset switch that works I had to reset it multiple times. I had bought this as an educational toy so I expected it to do it's job and I would be able to use the device the way it was suppose to be used. Not working is the end of the road for me. I'm going to be switching to the iPhone for now.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, January 21, 2010  X1 Mini: Best of the best!  by Bill from Daphne AZ USA  Pros: size and comfort.   Cons: some of the buttons don't work, and the battery indicator doesn't work.  the case is a little flimsy  Review: Bought this mini for a Christmas gift to a friend as an experiment to see how big of a device can be useful. I was not disappointed! This thing is just the right size for any situation and I have not found a situation where I would need another smaller device. This thing will stay on all the time, and is super easy to use, but the USB port can be a bit finicky to use (I have had two attempts, and only the first one worked). Also, when you use the battery or connect the USB cable, the device will shut itself off by turning itself off. This means you need a power source in order for it to run again. The case is flimsy, so not much else to say about it. ,I was not to disappointed!  is

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have 2 of these, and they're great. However, when I use my phone, I feel very uneasy.   The battery life sucks.  The screen turns off after only a few minutes.  (I can only get 6-8 hours out of it)   A good phone should be rechargeable and have an automatic shutdown button.  This phone sucks!  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! This is the worst electronic device i have ever purchased. The buttons do not work. It does not work at all. I have to constantly move the device around in my desk or in my bag or on my belt. It's a great product if you're just going to use it for your computer, which i never do. If you're going to be using this on the road, it is not worth it. I can't say it would be a great purchase if you were a true gadget person or a business. You're paying for a useless piece of crap that takes up valuable space in your bag and you won't ever use. There are much better options out there and this is not one of them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- * I really would have preferred to keep this phone as a phone * --------------- My phone, the last one I had, died last year. The battery had stopped working properly after 2 years. I did some research and decided on this. I am happy that I went with this over another brand I researched, but I have heard some other complaints, such as: -It is difficult to use because of the screen that needs to be adjusted -It does not connect with other wireless devices - It takes more than 1 minute to connect to your router because it takes more data than I want to use -It has a slow wireless signal - The battery lasts for about 6 hours of normal usage - The sound quality is good, but only if you have a high quality sound system - The power cable connector is a little hard to use, it takes 3x to tighten - I like this product for its price, but not for its quality or its functionality * -------------- I bought this product at the Best Buy when they had a special on the battery. This was before they changed it and they charged me full price for it. It was a good deal until the day I needed to take it to a mechanic, and the battery was not fully charged when I got it back. The next day the battery had gone dead again. I returned it to the store for a new battery, but they charged my credit card for $25.00, so I am out of luck again. * ------------------------ This review is more to show off the good features of this phone than to tell you how bad it is in every way. - I bought it because it is a big price for what you get. I got a Motorola P200. - You get one year of battery for the price. - It is very thin and light weight. - The quality of the display is better than I expected. - Bluetooth is very good, the phone connects to your tablet with ease and it is very reliable. - Battery life is good. I get 6 hours using this phone and it does not use a lot of juice. - Overall I am very pleased with this phone. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a light weight phone without a back panel. -Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got the Samsung S5 for my kid's birthday. I was super excited about it when it arrived. It's easy to set up and use. The kids loved it.

However, the screen does not show up in any of the different color palettes and the keyboard is not very good. I would not buy this device again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ___________ I purchased the iFone 4G in April 2014 to replace my 4G Galaxy S III. I was very happy with the 4G but decided to give this one a try. I am very disappointed. I could not find a single good feature or bug fixed. I have had the device for 2 weeks and it is now dead. It's not hard to figure out, but they could have done something about the hardware and software.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------------------- I've used this camera several times and have to say that this is the worst camera I've ever used. I'm very picky and sensitive to pictures and when I bought this camera I thought it was the best one I'd ever used but this is not it. I have a 5d mk1 and it's the best camera I have ever used and for my money it is a far superior camera to this camera. The pictures are horrible and you cannot get a decent picture out of it. You must use a very bright light to get good picture and if you don't get a good picture the images are completely out of focus. Even the pictures taken in the same light have a very different look from each picture and are out of frame. I don't know what to think of it, there are way better cameras out there and I'm not a loyal customer of Canon.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! the keyboard is a pain.!!!   I am on the second iteration of the E-Series, and the keyboard from my first is a dream. Now the problem: the first time I used it, I set my computer to speak in the native Korean.  Then I decided to turn the system on without English. I opened the settings and made the first key 'on' so the computer could speak English. .  this was a mistake.  it would speak both Korean and English at the same time. (when I pressed the 'F4' key.)  After that I decided that I should have the English-speaking mode, and turned the English language back off.  (It would still speak English in the background)  So I used another program to convert the Korean words to English (this was a pain, and could be easily done by another program)   So now I have no option to have the keyboard speak Korean. The second E-200 is much better. I had to set up a "keyboard" option on my computer which spoke English, and it was much easier.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The iDevice i7 8GB works fine. The i7 processor is fast, but some things are laggy, like youtube videos. I don't know why. It also does not use as much power as a computer does. I also don't like how long it takes for an app to open. I guess it's because of the 8GB of ram. If you only use one app at a time it's easy to use and you can do much more. But if you like lots of applications open at the same time, it's laggy and slow. I really wish Apple would change the iDevice from one i/o to two, so that you don't have to upgrade to use all the i apps and they all use less power.

Yes No Wednesday, November 25, 2014  Nice little laptop  by Chris from Fairfield CO USA  Pros: Light weight, good battery life, good display, good ports, good keyboard Cons: Only has 2 usb slots. Has no touch screen, mouse, and no DVD drive. 's great. It's small and light, but doesn't feel cheap. It can play a little faster than my Asus T100UA, which is a laptop I have owned for many years. The keyboard is very good too, I like it better than the touchpad on my X200t. The monitor and battery life are also great.  is my second laptop. I bought my first one in 2007 and I still have it and use it everyday. It is a beast and has served me very well. It doesn't have a touch screen so if you don't like touch you have to use the keyboard. It plays the songs it's supposed to, works well with my mp3 player, and has an amazing battery life. It also charges quickly.  in my opinion the best laptop around. . I don't use this laptop often so I can't tell you about it being a great laptop or a great price. I just like it.  ofc the screen needs a touch, but at the end of the day it's a light laptop, has great battery life and a great screen.  for only $450 it's the best bang for your buck  Review: I think the Lenovo Thinkpad T420 is a great all around laptop. It runs great and I would definitely buy this again if I had a need for a computer like this again. The built quality is excellent and I had no problem with any of the components. The only thing I did have issues with was the trackpad on this laptop. The pad was very hard to use. I wish it had a more sensitive surface but it still works fine for most tasks. The speakers were also quite good. The battery life is great and it charges fast. If I

I would not recommend this product. I am an Apple fan, and this product sucks. /r/iphone is so wrong! I was looking for an iph one. I bought it at Best Buy for $39 with a trade in and it works great.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is noisy. I have it running in a bedroom and the volume is off so there is only the low level buzz but that is enough for me. It is a good computer, however, I would rather use a computer that has a good keyboard and track pad, I like using a mouse with a pad for more accuracy. Also, I do wish there was some way to customize what I can control, maybe a button to select the different applications, for example, the media player. Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from A little noisy on start-up. The fan is not really loud. It only seems to be spinning when you get a notification (like an e-mail) and I'm sure it's only to make the thing spin a little faster so that the sound level doesn't interfere with what you are doing on the screen. If you're a fan of gaming and want to be able to play all the latest games at full detail you're going to love this laptop. My only issue is with the touchpad. It's terrible. It has a really bad feedback. I always find it hard to press a button on the touch pad. I found myself having to open the lid before I could click a button, which is really annoying. Read more
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using the samsung s7 edge for a week and a half, i cant believe the battery life. the reason for the poor battery life is that the screen isnt charging at a steady rate. ive had to charge it 2-3 times in the last month (once at night, one at 3 am), and it still doesnt charge, and when it does it runs at full speed. the other issue i have is that it constantly gets laggy on the go, every single app on my samsung phone gets lagging, especially facebook, and its difficult to click and use the keyboard. this is not a bad device by any means, but it is the only samsung phones i will use for awhile and i cant get over the battery issues, and the lag.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for about a year or so and i love it! theres just one tiny problem. the battery only lasts 5 hours (that is what i get with my ecxo3) so for most of the time i cannt use it. the only other thing that sucks is that when you open it up to replace the battery its pretty complicated to get everything on and to get the battery. just a pain in the ass. ive seen this and all the others where you can buy batteries separately, but that is still a huge waste. i wish you could just buy batteries for this one like the ecxos dont need batteries at all. i hate spending money on batteries. i would not buy anything for my ecXo3 or i would give it away. its just a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________   I am using my new iPod nano for about 5 months now. I have it on all the time. The screen is so small that I can't tell what is on the screen and I have to turn it all the way up to look at the video. I read a review that said the battery lasts so long that you can play it on your tv and the audio quality is so good that you wouldn't have to listen to the radio. Well, I have listened to the radios in the car and the radio on the stereo, but not the audio on the nano. Now my battery is running low so I am going to try my iPod on a different kind of battery and will update this review if I find out if that is better or worse.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! This is a terrible product that I have bought twice but both times returned it due to technical reasons that I can't understand. First time it was broken in 5 minutes and I returned it for a replacement which was the same bad piece of junk. Second time I got it, the screen was dead when I went to use it. I used a small screwdriver and broke the screen into several pieces. So I took it back and paid for a new one. The customer service was awful. I had a phone call a week after I returned the first unit. They wanted to check if I ever got a call from them because the customer service rep had not gotten any calls from me and I was getting upset because it was such a hassle. When I told him I'd be glad to answer a few questions but if he wants to call me to tell me he didn't get a call he can do so. I then told him the bad part. He wanted to know why he got the phone, why I was upset and why I want a refund. All I wanted was to return the broken unit and get the refund. When he told me he couldn't give me a refund he had the nerve to tell his manager. The manager then took a phone message and said he couldn acknolw the call because I wouldn't. The guy at the desk was nice enough to tell him I was trying to save him the trouble of coming into my store but it was clear I wasn't going to make that a reality. So he came out to the parking lot to make the call and I gave him the same deal. I'm not trying to get a refund but at the very least tell me if this is a defective unit.  I bought this and other brand products from your company and have been satisfied all along with the service, fast shipping and very nice product for the price. I now feel like this was all a scam to get me to return all the products to you.  was just wondering, were you guys just selling us on the idea of the new phone or actually building the phone? i mean, it has a phone number printed on it and a home phone number. (2): I have to say, your support has been very professional. I just wanted to let you know that I was having a problem with my Samsung Galaxy S3 when I received the phone. You sent out two replacements, but the first one I received, which was a few days
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this device for about a month. I dont like the fact that it has to be charged up with the USB cord, even though its a battery operated device. I had to re type my password because i typed in the wrong password. This was the first thing that bugged me, as I've never had to type the wrong number in and it shouldnt have to be re typed as the first time it did. Also if you have a really old charger, or the charger you purchased was not as it should be. The only thing I would say is that its a good price for what you are getting. I really dont like that this is a battery powered device. It has a USB cord that needs to be plugged in and there is no usb hub. i would definatly recommend if your looking to add a usb plug to your computer and not have to rely on having a usb hub to be able to plug in your mouse and keyboard. I also think that if you want a keyboard and mouse combo to have with this computer. It can be a good choice if you're looking to plug your pc in to your tv. However if you dont have a tv and dont want to plug it in to the tv with this thing, i would just go out and buy a usb keyboard and a mouse. If you dont like to be tethered, or dont like having your pc on your lap while it's in your lap and you have to keep the usb cord plugged in while its on your keyboard, this is not for you. If I was to buy this again. I would go and get a keyboard + usb hub and keep this one plugged in so you can plug in an usb keyboard. Also i would have gotten an apple usb adapter and usb keyboard that works with a usb 2.0 hub, that is a good idea, that way you could just plug your macbook into the usb port on this one, and the macbook would be all set up and ready to go. But yeah.. overall i think it's a good device, but this should be a usb 3.0 port.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem with this product was the "smart" feature. It was easy for the customer to program in some stuff that wasn't so smart. The customer told me it was to help "people" who are "just like me" to use it. But it didn't. I was supposed to program it so that a "smart meter" would send an email with my daily "usage" and it would ask me when I think I'm using my meter. But when I tried to program this feature, it said "no power". This is what it tells me every time it shows "no network connection" or "no activity" or even "no signal" when it does have a connection. No way! I had to uninstall and re-install this.  It does have wireless and ethernet connections but if you have a wireless connection, there's no way to get it to work. My internet never even started and when I try to use my phone, it has trouble even getting through the modem.  I bought this product with the intent of using it to give to my disabled sister who has cerebral palsy. It just did not work for her. I did not realize that it had wireless and I thought it would be just a dumb meter. I will not use this again. It's a waste of money and I'm disappointed I didn't read the manual and figure out what I was getting. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had several of these devices, they are not a good solution to anything you do, they do not work well with anything and they are unreliable. They can't even keep up with a 2gb card, and if they do its a 3gb card. They are useless to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a couple of these for about 10 years. and ive used them on the go on an iphone. they work, they charge, and they work great. but they have a bad habit.  they charge the phone by shorting out the usb port (the charge port) when charging. so if you plug in your phone to charge and your phone does not charge, you have to unplug it to power it back on. this causes the phone to be unresponsive. the phone gets hot, the screen is on all the time, the keyboard doesn't work, and the phone cannot be turned off. not to mention, if you dont have your phone with you when you plug it in to charge the usb will short out when charging, and then it will take forever to charge. it is so annoying!!! you have no way to turn it off, and it takes over a half hour just to get your phone charged. a simple fix is to change the settings on your phone so that you dont short out the charging port. that is a good product if it would charge your phone by the time you needed it. but the usb is a joke. i give it two stars because it can charge the lg v30 on the road. but if i use it on the phone it is a two star experience.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was the second device I have purchased from your site and it never works. First time it failed to activate because it was on an extension cord. The second time it worked, I plugged it into my tv, and I watched it for about 20 minutes. I was sure it was broken and it was going to fail again. I ended up being wrong. It did work for a few minutes, then the tv went black for a split second and I could not get it to come back on. I have looked for a couple of weeks to see if this is a new issue and no one has come forward saying it is a defective one, which would be a big deal. It is a big mistake to order from you if you don't believe this is an issue. It has already cost me over $300.00 that I do not know how to replace. I would NEVER order from this company again. This is just another reason why I don't trust anything they are selling. If you can't even use a device, then how can I expect them to do my work for me. I am a college student and I don?t even know how I will be able to pay for anything else with that kind of bill. The whole time I am waiting for the replacement, it is driving me nuts. Please fix this product, it has been one long and frustrating experience for me, and it is ruining my credit.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******************** The unit is nice and smooth. It is really quiet and works as good as expected. The unit has a problem when the audio signal is lost (very hard to see in dark situations). After a few days I discovered the problem. After playing some video games it is still working fine. If I want to watch DVD or pictures the unit has to be plugged in. Other than that it is a great unit. (Posted on 9/7/2016)  Awesome sound and price!!!! Review by Paul Audio quality: excellent  The sound is great. If you're looking for a quality product with a low price it's hard to go wrong with this product.  I really wanted a good, portable, cheap, small and powerful Bluetooth speaker. After trying many I found this one and it works great. My only complaint is that the Bluetooth audio does not seem to be as clean as the one on the Yamaha YPAO2 and Yamaha YA14. The Yamaha speakers seem to have much higher output compared to this one. The speaker seems to have a higher output in the lower frequencies compared to these speakers. The output of this product is much better. Overall a very good product. (Read full review) 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It works fine for what it's meant to do. I use it to send my family pictures, email, and even to make video calls. It can take some time to load all the pictures, but once it does I can send an email straight from the camera. The device is easy to set up and use and it comes with a simple guide to help you understand how to use it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace the old CRT display. It has problems with backlight bleeding, screen shaking, and other issues. The only way to get it to work is to install a driver. It requires a laptop that has drivers and a monitor that supports the new monitor's refresh rate, so my iMac only supports 60 Hz. So the monitor will flicker, and the video will have ghosting issues.   The only positive is that it has the ability to play PC games, but I would have thought that the newer monitors would do that with a simple firmware upgrade. If you want to play computer games, this monitor may not be for you.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have this for about 6 months, it's been fine. Then one day it stopped charging. I've tried to do a hard reset and nothing. It seems that it is just slowly dying down. If I can get another one, I would probably purchase a battery swap adapter as it is not that reliable.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, January 31, 2017  Excellent product but has some quirks  by C from Sacramento CA USA  Pros: Works with iPhone 3GS, works with iPod touch (2nd Gen), works with iphone 4  Cons: Some of the software has some bugs, like turning off phone when you turn it on  Review: I bought this to replace my older battery in my iphotouch 2g, which I was using in a previous iphono.   The first thing you will notice with this battery is the weight. It weighs about 1/3rd what my old one weighed. The reason this is so much heavier is because the spring loaded plate is made out of stainless steel and not plastic. This is what keeps the battery from falling out if you drop it (unlike the old battery, which was spring loaded).   To change the battery you remove the old one and insert this new one. The process is a bit tricky, but not too hard.   to swap the battery, you put the old back in and hold it in place until it locks. Then use a small screwdriver to push down on the tab on the top of the new battery. This pushes the tab up, which pushes out the tab and lets the battery slide in.   at this point the top tab is locked, so you need to push a few more times until it releases and the old tab is free. If you push too hard or too long it may pop out, which is not a good thing.   this is a fairly easy process but it does take a little bit of time to do.  . I have had this for around 2 months and it still works great. I am able to play my ips on it and also listen to my ipods through it.  ,I don't know what the quirks are with the software but I've gotten it to work with ips 3,4,5 and now iphonopoy 3. So it's a great product, easy to use and it keeps my ifool 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm still trying to recover from the fact that the T-Mobile phone I bought on sale was absolutely useless. I wanted a nice phone but with 4G LTE and a full size battery so I could keep calling family and friends with a strong signal no matter where I was. I was hoping to get a great phone with a big battery. The phone was cheap, poorly built and the software was bad, so much so that it didn't recognize my phone as a smart phone with 4g and LTE. I called to ask if I could exchange it. I then realized I was actually getting a prepaid phone with an even worse software. I had to call back and ask if there was a way to exchange it for the actual phone and they told me to call my phone company. I did and my service was restored so I called them about that. I got charged for the call to my phone but when I asked why I was still getting charged, the lady said "I'm sorry but I don't remember". When I asked for a receipt she said, "You don't have a receipt". When we tried to transfer the phone to my prepaid account they wouldn't transfer it. The lady I talked to said, that if I really wanted my phone back I had no choice but to send it to them and ask for the money back. Now I have to call the Verizon service line and get a new phone. They told me they would get me my phone in 3 days and I don a have to pay $30. They never told me what they would do. When they said 3 days I asked what would happen if I called the service again? I was told, they will send me another phone, but that they would charge me $15.00 to do so. Now when I called Verizon to get my phone refunded I was transferred to a customer service and after waiting 30 mins they told I can do the exchange I want, but at the end of the 30 mins the lady says "Sorry, but the phone was too new, it doesn't support the same kind of data and it doesn' t have a full 4g signal so we can't help you". When they say "It does have a 4g network" and "the phone does have 4g connectivity", but they can't give me the info. When I ask for a refund they say that I can call the phone company and ask them to send me my money back, but then they say
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought the Xoom 2 on ebay.com and after a few days had it working. I was very excited to use it, until my battery died. I called Xoom and they said that they are aware of the issue and would be sending me a new one. I have now waited 4 weeks and still no replacement. I will no longer be buying the Xooms, and will not buy any Xoomes from anyplace else.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good Price for a good product I am not surprised the new one was good in the low priced category.  as another reviewer pointed out, it does take about 3 to 5 days to recharge when not in use. This is a bit longer than the average recharge but you can use it to play games or other media while it's plugged in. It is easy to see when the battery is low. I did have a problem with a low battery indicator but after using the XOOM to charge my cell phone on the flight, I was able to figure out what was going on, and what I could do about it. Overall I was pleased with the new Xoom's performance. I think it's a great product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________ The product is a great one! It's easy to use, but they should do a better job at not forgetting to adjust the batteries.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought an XOOM to replace an old XO. It worked well in the beginning but the speakers came on non-stop, making it unusable after several months of usage. I got a new XO and the issue has vanished. The speakers are much more manageable than the old Xoom. Overall I would recommend this unit if you are using it for work. I am considering a replacement for a different work station when I get an opportunity. If you need something more than what the XO is capable of, you may want to look elsewhere. - Daniel  Value for the Money:  This is a very good product and I am very satisfied with it. I just wish that this unit was a little louder but, considering the price and value of the unit, I am not upset. The only thing I wish that the unit could do is have a remote for adjusting the volume on the unit. However, that would take a lot more than just the remote to offer such a capability, even if it was included. If that is the case, I would not recommend this product. - David  Have a great time with the XOOOM:    The XO-1R XOO-A1 is my go to music playback device. The quality of this unit, and the quality of the music that comes out of it, is great. The features are simple to use and the operation is very responsive. I was very impressed with the speed with which it performed in using it with my X1 system. The XOOOOM has an impressive sound for the price. My only complaint about the unit is that it has a very small speaker, and I would like it to be louder. - Dwayne  High quality music playback:  The best part of this device is the sound. It's a little on the quiet side, but it still sounds fantastic. The included remote works well for controlling the volume, but if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't need the remote, because the sound is just amazing in this unit. It doesn't have a huge speaker, but the XooOM does a pretty good job of making you feel like you're in the center of a big sound stage. It isn't for everyone, but I have a hard time putting it down! - Ryan  A few of the X-series accessories I purchased:  XOOAM/XOOOM Remote/XOM
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was a bad purchase and was only worth it because it was the same price as an iPhone 6, and that is where I ended up for a backup device. I had been told it had a great battery, I used it for an hour to see if I could get it to charge up and then it just shut off. The only other thing I like about this is that it comes with two wall adapters, I know that will not work but the one I got did. This is a bad value for money as the other reviews mention.  More

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this product because I had a bad experience with my first device which came with a cheap LCD display. The screen was small and there was a lot of glare. After spending about 3 weeks trying to figure out what was wrong with it, the owner of this store told me I had to purchase a new one. I was not sure I wanted to spend my money on another new unit because of the poor quality I had found. However, when I looked at this screen, I couldn't believe that there was no glare. I purchased my second one and now it has all the same problems I had with the first unit. I have to put the phone on the side in order to see all of the text. It is a horrible product and should be pulled.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have tried and tried to get it to work, but it keeps disconnecting when I go into the phone. The problem seems to be that the micro usb is shorted. It's been over a week and the connection still doesn't work. I did not get a return slip either.   One last comment. If you buy this product you are buying it as a kit. Do not buy this if you want to install it yourself. There is no mention of this in the instructions and you need to buy a micro usb cable that has a male and female connector. There are many companies that sell similar cables that are all just male and male.

I did a google search and the other reviews are all good. So I took a chance on this one thinking it was worth a shot.   be careful before you get a dongle from anywhere. The dongles I get are of poor quality and do not work at all. This one did not work and I called tech support and had them exchange it. I told them I was a first time customer and they told me to return it. It cost me $15 to do that. The guy on the phone did not seem to care. He was not really understanding and just said "Well I guess we are just stuck with it." That is just a bad attitude to have towards your customers.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I use an external battery in my Sager NP-F500, and the device runs well for a low-end laptop. It is very responsive, and is perfect for me. I have an HP lcd monitor, and I do not need the screen to be very high resolution to make the device comfortable to use. I also use a very low resolution monitor, which does not show the screen well on the HP lcds.   The only con I have is that it is not very efficient. It takes about 15 minutes to fully recharge from dead. And I use an eGo charger, which is much faster, but it is also much more expensive than the one in the Sager. (The other is that the SAGE can't go full speed with an e-cig.) The eGo will go full and the SAGER will go half speed.   the S-goggle and its little brother:  The S-Goggle: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the second device I have bought from iBatt and the first one was not working, and this one was. I contacted customer support, and they could not fix it, because I could not be contacted within 3 days of purchasing the device. I have no idea if it's the chip or the modem that is bad. The quality is OK, but the interface is horrible. I can't tell if there is a cable in it. The screen goes black for a minute and then the light comes on and the screen starts to work. I just got this to try and see if it does what it says it will. I did receive an upgrade for my previous modem because I had a contract for 10 years, so it's very good. However, it's also the least functional device I've ever owned, even if I don't know how it works.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ***************** The electronic device works fine with one of my wireless routers. With all the bad reviews about this product, I am very disappointed with the product, it is a total waste of money. ***** I received this router on Friday, and it worked fine on Saturday. I had a few problems with the device but nothing a replacement will not fix. It was working fine with the wireless access point on Saturday and did not work on Sunday at all. It also did not support the iptables firewall. It works fine on the laptop on which i have set it up. ******* This is the first time I will be using a $100+ product that does not work. If you don't have a $50 router to spend, then this is NOT the one for you. You may consider using a wireless router and a new computer as they are cheaper. ***The product is a waste of your money. I have looked at the other reviews and the majority of them seem to have similar problems and issues with the router. The device may work great for a few days, then the router/connection will not work with it. This is my second time using this router and I am not happy with it at all so I can't recommend it. *** I purchased this router to replace a defective one I had, however, I found out after purchasing that it is very difficult to reset the router and its not a real reset but a re-configuration and you need to do this twice. My router was set up with my wireless service provider's security protocols and they are not compatible with the NETGEAR product. I also found out that its hard to find the support documentation, and that the user support person that answered the call on the phone never gave me the correct product number or the correct firmware version. It seems like this company was trying to make a quick buck off of people that have a lot of money and want their router to work like the one they have. ****** This product does not support iptable firewalls which are designed to prevent a person from accessing other people's computers from their own network. ****
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The thing does not work on my computer and the warranty is no longer valid.   After one hour of calling, I was told that they can not fix it because they do not have the parts or can not find them.  I contacted the company at least three times.  All of their answers were in Spanish and there was no person with a English speaking ear willing to assist me.  When I tried to get through to a supervisor, he said that the customer service representative in the phone center had left for the day.  The day after I tried calling again, a supervisor said that he could not fix the problem because he could find the parts but did not want to sell them to me. Then a supervisor came to my place the next day to try to fix the phone line, but when he attempted to use the phone, it would not connect.  This company has not been reliable in the past and should be sued for trying to exploit a foreign language and poor customer service.  A terrible experience.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ikre you have a problem: I am using this mouse now for about a month and I am absolutely not impressed with it at all. It is so hard to push a button. I know its a mechanical device but its so hard. My previous mouse had a much more stable surface. The mouse has no spring for the buttons, this one is stiff and makes it extremely difficult to push them. I tried to play with it for hours and it just keeps clicking. I think I have to return it and buy a different mouse.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good Product, Great Price I bought this mouse mainly for gaming. It has great build quality and very responsive. It's a bit bigger than my old one so I had to buy a new one because I like the size better. Overall it's a good purchase for those who just want a mouse with a decent build. I'd buy another one if I had the extra cash.  in order to improve accuracy  I bought this in order for myself to be able to aim and shoot more accurately while playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I'm very pleased with the purchase. This mouse is very light, so it's easy to maneuver around on a desk, it fits great, and it has a great sensitivity.  a little larger than I expected it to be. /
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to go in the car with my iPhone to use as a backup iPod but i lost the original one. It has 2 batteries which are replaceable if they ever get destroyed. I did buy the case which makes it seem more professional than the generic plastic cases which i usually have. So the sound is ok but if i ever need to make a call it sounds like a phone is plugged into the car. That is a shame because i can have my ipad or anything else on the car stereo to listen to. I bought the case and the phone charger but i think i will just have to take it out and put it in the glove box to get it working again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was one of my first purchases from them and I was not expecting much at all. The sound was weak and the range was so short I couldn't even find the "off" switch on my unit. After doing some research I was pleasantly surprised with what I heard on this product. As for the range it was not bad at all, but not good either. The receiver is very sensitive to interference and you can easily lose reception due to interference. I would not recommend this product for anyone unless you are extremely sensitive to noise.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device, and it was an ok piece of equipment. I bought it to add a stereo to my Sony HD player that only had a single speaker. I had to use my computer to set the volume and it didn't work, so I went to a different part of my house to have a couple speakers to add. This one worked just fine. It was a little slow when running a program, like a CD burning program, but it didn`t really slow the whole machine down. The sound quality was ok. The only time that I had problems was when I was in the studio working on some music. I was working with some sound from my computer and it cut out on me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have bought a couple of these, one to go on my phone, and one to put on my computer.  When I plug it in it seems to be a bit cold, and the power supply doesn't work.    This is not a big deal, but I can't use the computer at all.  My phone and tablet work fine.  Rated 4 out of 5 by J from Good product, but a bit short for my needs. I purchased this to replace my old one that had a hard drive that went bad, and needed to be replaced.  When I got the old one, I realized that I could only attach it to an old hard drive adapter.  The new one requires the purchase of a USB 3.0 cable with an adapter, and this one, which came with it, was too short, and was not long enough to make the connection with.  I would suggest ordering the cable at the same time, and using the adapter for the rest of your gear. Rated 5 out of 50  by Anonymous from Love the product I had this unit for a month now and it works perfect.  One down side is that it was very noisy when you're charging it up.  It would take forever for the batteries to charge and also when you want to charge it up, you can't because it's so loud.  All other things aside, this device works perfectly for me.  If you don't need a lot of power but still need some battery life then this is perfect.  Rated 2 out of five by AnonymousFromCleveland from Disapointed I purchased the first one for my brother's Samsung smartphone. It ran perfectly until the battery died about three weeks later, and then we found out that the USB connection was not capable of the 5V/2A it is capable of. We have never used the iPad as a phone.  Now I've spent several hundred dollars (and some frustration) on a device that didn't work as advertised.  So, I thought I'd give the second one a shot to see if it would give me better battery life than the first.  We plugged it into the wall, and it started up fine, but at the rate it was charging it only had about one half hour left.

I was getting some annoying clicks in my keyboard. I noticed the screen was showing the same time each time the click was made. It was very annoying. I then went to look on the web for a replacement unit (I don't have any extra). I tried searching but there were none to be found in the USA. I ended up ordering them from Amazon (I live in Canada, I can't order them from the USA, but Amazon will do it, and it's free).   When it arrived, it was in pristine condition. It came with the power cord already installed, and there was no damage whatsoever. The packaging even had some stickers from Apple explaining the use of the keyboard. The keyboard is very smooth and responsive, no clicky noises.  :)  Was this review helpful? Yes
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had it a year now and it only works on the dvds that have an sd-card slot i know that alot of people dont like the android thing or the dvd ripper its a good product but just make it dvd compatible for android people to enjoy the best movies and tv shows with all the content that they can find on the internet now and i dont think people like having to have a usb port and charge it daily with a dvd player thats all its good for now
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A lot of trouble with this device!   I bought this with the intention of getting a very basic system with a very high quality of product, to do the work of a mid-range gaming PC with the ability to do 4K video recording.   When I got the unit, it showed that the motherboard and memory modules needed to be replaced to achieve this.   the motherboard was not fit and the motherboard did not have enough space for the memory modules, so the whole motherboard was replaced.  , with a little modification to the memory (and a very heavy and clumsy laptop), I managed to get it working.  . with another little modification, I managed for some time to get the machine running, but not to the level I had hoped. I had not planned to make this purchase. I would have gotten an older model of the same model, but I was looking for something that would give me the capacity for high quality 4K content, a very solid platform, and would not cost a fortune to upgrade later.   (The unit is a little bit heavy and clunky).   What I got was a very clunky piece of junk, a waste of time, money, and my time to learn on. It took me 6 months to get this machine to run at all.   in my opinion, it is not capable of 4K, but at least it runs without any major issue.   a bit of information: this is a mid range machine, very limited in terms of capabilities, and it will only run at 2.2ghz (which is barely enough for 1080p recording), and it cannot do 4k.   and since it does not run 4k, it does have a very limited performance.   this device needs a complete overhaul, with new memory modules (or better yet, upgrade to something with more ram). it is also extremely heavy, with an extra weight of about 15lbs, so you might want to consider a slim notebook to take it with.   It is also very noisy. it is extremely loud, so a headphone will be needed to take great video. This is also the case with any of the cheap laptops you get these days, they are very loud.   that is all. i recommend this to everyone who wants an entry level computer but can't afford to spend more money. i bought this because i wanted a "budget" computer, but i had no idea what i got when i got it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this unit for years, it works great and its been just fine on a 12V battery, but its just been put into a 30Watt setup, the power consumption goes through the roof, it's like using a 6 watt power supply to make a 7 watt device.   My only real problem is the battery. it takes 3 1/2 hours to charge it on a 100watt setup.   to replace it i used a 7.2v battery which charged in about an hour and a half. but as soon as i plugged it in, it would only give me a couple of hours and then it would die. this is a huge problem, as there is nothing you can do about it.   a full charge it takes is 3 hours and a quarter. if i dont want to do a recharge, i have to either put in the charger, or leave it plugged in at a low level, or you have to leave it on and let it charge. the battery doesnt do that. it can just charge and hold.   as i said this is my main system. my second computer is also this unit. ive got a couple other people to buy for us to run.   the keyboard is terrible, when i got this unit it was terrible. it was so bad that i had to take it back and get a new one. i had a keyboard so bad, that i wouldnt type at all, my wrists would hurt. it also was so big that it didnt fit into my small keyboard tray that i use with my old mx system, so it wasnt in the case at all. it is not very nice, it is very clunky and it makes my hands hurt.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: **************************  This is the worst electronic device I have ever used. It is very hard to use. It does not have any buttons or other buttons to press and it is very slow. It has to be pushed twice to change a settings and 3 times to change one sound. If this device would work you would not need this one.  I've been a subscriber to this service for about 10 years and it just has no good points. I have used this on my computer and my laptop. I've had to go to the local electronics store several times to buy batteries.  " The sound card was the only one that would work. I had to buy the one that the seller told me was working and it worked fine. But, the sound card is not working. I am still having trouble with the PC. I cannot get my audio to be routed out the computer. "
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!this is the first time I have used a laptop with no usb port. I was a bit nervous to try this. I bought it because I wanted to read books on my own. After 1 hour I was not happy. My laptop has two usb ports. One of the ports does not work. After a few attempts to try and fix it I gave up. I also tried the computer without the usb port and it worked fine. No problems at all. I have to use my usb to type cable to connect to my laptop. After trying to use the computer from my phone. I gave it up. Do yourself a favor and buy a laptop without a usb port or do not buy this if you want to have access to files on your phone without using your pc.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These don't work at all, the light just doesn't come on or the wifi isn't working or whatever, and it gets really hot and hot when the batteries die. The light is nice, but not working  or the wifi  is useless. This is the second time I have ordered these but this time, I am going to send it back because the price is too good to be true and the poor quality is very obvious. This isn't an expensive product, this is cheap hardware. I would never buy these again.Read full review This product is not very well made, it is a plastic, not metal and I will never buy anything else from here ever. I will say though that they are very easy to install. When I had it installed, I did not have any issues. I had to remove the batteries, then the light was on. Now when the battery is out, it gets very hot and it stays on like that. Now I have to pull the light and replace the battery and the light goes off. If there is one thing you should know about this light, if you do not pull the batteries out and replace them when they get to the end, it will burn them out before the replacement gets to the battery. It has been about 2 years and I still don't know how to get it to work again. So I am giving it one star. If you have a good idea to get this unit to work, let me know.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The thing is it's a pain to set it up once and get going. I've done it twice.   Other than that it's awesome.  , this is a perfect portable solution for the people who want the convenience of a portable power pack but don't want to carry a charger. There is a charger on the side of the unit and it's quite big. Once you get going you won't have to stop doing anything until the battery dies. I didn't use the included power pack with this one since it takes up too much room in my bag. The battery lasts a long time and is easy to replace. The only reason why it's not 5 stars is that the cord is a little long. It will work well in one direction for a little while but you will want to swap the cord out. The cord can only be used in the same direction. I think I'll give the cord a break.

If you use this device for very long then it becomes very annoying to move this thing around constantly. ive had this thing for about 2 years now and its still very sturdy. it does however require a lot of cleaning with soap and water. my advice to the consumer is dont buy this item. if i were to buy this for a replacement then i would get one of the newer model.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for years. it is a real pain in the ass to charge sometimes. sometimes i get 4 hours, sometimes 2. then i need to plug in every couple of hours or the usb connector can get loose. its a joke if i can't charge my phone or other devices. this is one of the most annoying things on this planet. if you are serious about this phone and are not going to replace it anyway, get the usb port or use usb cables and get a bluetooth device. this phone shouldnt cost over 5.00. don't waste your money on a phone with this issue.  Rated 1 out of 5 by mrb from Poor Quality We've been using this for over 6 months. It doesn't take charge well. The phone gets warm to the touch. The battery is not very large, and it takes a long time to fully charge. This was our only phone for a while as we wanted to keep our current phone, but couldn't bear to keep the battery drained. The only way I can imagine the phone working would be to get some kind of external charger that would charge the battery quicker, but since we couldn't find anything that worked as advertised, we gave up on this phone.  is this device for me? We bought this device in order to use on our tablet, but were unable to get it to do that. The device was defective and wouldn't charge. Our last one failed too, and even though we tried several different battery types to no avail. We're still paying for an expensive defective device. /r/Android is a great community, but the site sucks when it comes to phones. This is a good phone. The design is pretty good, it is comfortable to hold, it's lightweight, and has great battery life. You should be able to charge it overnight. There is a lot more to this device then its good looks.  and I have been waiting for this device since my old one broke. The price was perfect, and I knew I would buy another one. I have a good experience with other online stores, but this one is my last with B&H.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using my ibook pro for 3 years now and my favorite thing about the ibook is the auto brightness feature, but every once in awhile it will turn off, i have a couple of other books and they are also auto brightness and never turn off! and when i plug my ipad i need to turn off the screen if i don't want it to auto brightness up! I just purchased a macbook pro and its a miracle if i could turn it off, and if i didn't have it on, i would not be able to read. i wish they would change that auto brightness on the ipad, so you don't have to turn it on or off, thats what i like best about the ipads, but i guess you will have to pay more for it...
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The quality of this device is just ok.   It does not do anything special.  The sound is ok but the battery life is terrible.  Even though the battery is small and last only about 2 hours or so I can't seem to get a charge on it.  It also seems to get hot fast so it does seem to be a poor quality product.  Overall I will not be buying this product again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is a bad toy. It is easy to get into the wrong way. Once you do, it's difficult to get out of. When trying to remove the ring it's extremely difficult. It takes two hands to get it off. I had to use a very thin screw driver to remove it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my iphone 7, iphones 5c, ipad pro, macbook pro and an iPad 2, and these all have the same issues, if you want a decent laptop for the money, this one is not it. It is very heavy, slow to load software, a huge time suck for apps and is very annoying to use. I will not buy anything else from apple after this, you get what you pay for, but for the price you pay you expect more. If you dont use it everyday it will be ok, but if you are going to use it every single day, get a different laptop.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this from Walmart the first week it came out for the price it was advertised and it worked as advertised for the first day. Then it quit working. Took it to a tech store and they said they would look into it, they said I need to change the batteries. Then when i got home they sent me a new battery that was for $25. That wasn't a good start, and i didn't use it until yesterday. Now it doesn't turn on at all. I really really wanted to buy this thing just for the money because i don't want to buy the big expensive gadgets. The batteries are not even worth the cost of the thing, the only reason i bought it was to try it out. It's a great product, but at this price it's not worth the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It works perfectly. The only thing it isn't is loud enough when it works. If it was, I wouldn't have to use my car speakers to hear it. I have not been in a car that needed to be turned off. The other night, a car alarm woke me up and woke up my spouse. This was because the noise was making my husband wake up. He would have been better off if I didn't have this baby. I know of at least 10 people who have bought this device, who have all had the same problem. This is not an alarm - it is a phone that plays loud music. I think I will just keep it for when I want to annoy someone else.

The second time was similar, but with the help of the instructions it was much easier. Very disappointed in this purchase.

Yes No Tuesday, August 26, 2012  Works well  by J. T. from Austin TX USA  Pros: Good build quality  Cons: None  Review: I bought two of these for my older phone so I could use my older mic/headset while I had the newer one on my main phone. I purchased the dual one and was pleased to find that it is a perfect fit. The only negative that I have with this mic is that I can hear the mic from my phone if I hold it at the side of my mouth. I have to push hard to hear it. That being said, it is very clear. The other thing I noticed is that the buttons on the side are very sensitive and can be difficult to push.  I would highly recommend this mic.  and if you have one that is bad just return it for a refund. ,  If you have a cheap phone and you are in a hurry for a mic to replace it just go for this mic  You will not regret it.  in my opinion you can't go wrong for the money. . 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It did not turn on.  I did use it to play movies and it worked pretty well. ...but, I had some problems with my laptop. :-( I found the laptop's screen was not displaying properly so I used it as a monitor.I was able to watch the movie 'Logan' with it but I could not watch any of the videos from my laptop because it would not see them. I thought that the video screen was broken but when I turned on the screen I found out that it was working as an older style laptop screen. I was trying to read the screen using my laptop but when trying to scroll through web pages using the laptop screen I could read a few words but when watching a video I would get a black screen with no text or anything. I contacted the company about it but they told me that the screen was bad and they were going to get it replaced but, I have to pay $90 to have it replaced. I did not want to pay the extra $90 but, it was the best money I got in a long time and I just want to watch movies but this thing did not work! :-(  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Not good  The first thing I noticed when using the headset was that I couldn't hear the music. At first I thought it was a bad headset. I tried every combination of settings and my headphones didn't work. I switched them out and the music started coming through fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing was a total waste of money and time.   I use this device in my kitchen for the most part to keep an oven at the right temp for baking. I have had it for several years and love it. It is small, light and small. I love that the heating element works without burning up my stove.   and the digital timer works great to tell you how long you have left before the food needs to be heated. I use this on my electric stove to keep it at the correct temperature for the oven.   the only problem I have with it is the fact that it does not stay on. I found out this the hard way by putting it in my oven when it started to smoke. After doing a lot of research I found that the fire alarm will shut it off automatically after 20 minutes. If you have a smoker I think it would be best to keep the timer on for an hour or so then let the timer go off.  .

I use this for my car, for my kids and my wife. So far so good and it has lasted long. ,  I love my little smart plug-in! When I first saw it, I thought it was so neat and I was so glad to receive it in the mail. I'm not very handy with my own tools, so I'm really glad this was part of my car toolkit. It came in an elegant box. It was easy to use, but I'll keep an eye out for how long it can handle and what it can do if it needs to. . 's I've used this to power a digital video camera, a digital audio recorder, my cell phone, and also an ipod. The only thing I don t like is that it only has one USB output for the plug in your iPhone or iPod, and then the output can only be daisy chained to a second USB port, which might be a hassle for someone like me who likes to take it out of my pocket or purse and charge it on the go.  in my house it plugs into my stereo and i can play music and i do that while i am driving the car. The plug in the ipod is fine. the ipad plug in is a little bit too small and i have to take off the device to charge it, but thats ok. This is just a great little plug in to have in your toolkit for the car and when you are out and about. '

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using an apple tv for years, but ive only recently bought this tv, and ive seen it only twice. when it was first released it was a good tv. i was pleasantly surprised by the resolution. the picture was much sharper than the one my last tv gave me, and when the screen went all blurry, it didn't take long to find out it was because of the quality of the tv. the wifi connection was a joke, and if you wanted to stream anything, i recommend just not streaming anything. when i first started using the tv it was great and i could watch 4k tv shows and movies from youtube without a problem. i still use it to watch Netflix sometimes but ieron is more than good enough. and when i needed to stream something else and didn't have an iphone 4, i connected my iphones to my tv and it worked great. and i love my ilexon i'm glad i purchased it.

's a very great product.  the case comes in a bag of 4 and it fits great in the case with my iPad. the case has rubber feet on the bottom of the case so the device does not fall when you put it in your case. the only con is that sometimes when you are playing a video or something that is very low quality the picture on your screen does not get very sharp. I wish the case came with a case for the iPad mini as well. Also it is very good quality. .  a very helpful product. does what I want it to.  The only thing I wish is that it came with 2 different cases. The iPad mini has a small clip that fits over the bottom part of the device. The case that came with mine has a clip that slides on the back part of your device. This means it can slide out from underneath the top cover of your case and be lost. I would suggest buying a new case for your iPad mini and an iPad case for yours as well so that you do not lose either of them. Was this review helpful to the reader? YesNo
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This tv is not worth the money, the colors are very flat and the picture looks blurry. I was hoping for better color quality, however my TV has been used for a lot longer and I think it has more memory. I have had this tv for 2 years and it is only been used 5 to 10 times a week and only once a year. I am just not buying another tv. If the tv was a little better quality I would buy it again, but it is not even a good TV.  "I don't care for it, but I am satisfied" I have to admit, I wasn't so excited about purchasing this tv after having an older model. I saw great reviews and hoped to have it for a great price. But after putting it in my living room (not exactly the ideal viewing location) I was quite disappointed. I guess I have a weak spot for the brand "Dolby Vision", but it didn't work for me with this model and now I am left wondering what could have been. I understand there are several other models available at a cheaper price, and they may not work for you, but if you are looking to spend less than $250, I think you have to be pretty disappointed to say the least.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used this for months, i dont know if its faulty or if it gets warm. its only been tested once but the problem persisted. i just switched it to my phone and it works perfectly. i have an iphone 6s, but it will run this unit as well. i would rather spend my time on my other electronic devices instead of my phone. i dont use it as much because it is so cheap, but if i need to use it, i use the android device. i don't know if there is something that can be done about the price but i cant recommend this unit to anyone.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, July 23, 2015  Love it  by C.S. from Saint Louis MO USA  Pros: Easy to use  Cons: Not the greatest for the price, just get a better quality keyboard or mouse if you want the ability to turn on your computer  Review: It works great as a computer remote control, very easy to use and very low cost.  a little on the large side at 5.5 inches, but I can turn it on/off by tapping the power button. I use it at home with my laptop and the keyboard/mouse work just fine. , a little larger than the computer, and it was easier to setup.  is it just a really good keyboard? or does it have a good quality track pad or trackball that makes it work great.  in the mean time, there are many better keyboards available at a much lower price.  "good quality" isn't the best term. . I used this as a remote control on my computer at the airport and at work. It is a very simple and easy to install. It does have one drawback. The keyboard was just a little too small. The buttons are all in the same spot for my computer, so it does not get in the way, but there is no way to re-position it so it will not get too close to the computer. If you plan to use this for remote control from a phone, the keyboard is probably fine as long as you are not using it to control the computer as well as a phone. What is not so good about it is it can't be switched to a phone mode because it would require you to change a setting on the computer itself. I have two phones and I can't turn on the phone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I really liked my electronic clock. I really loved the speed of it. It was a very nice clock that i could really use it for most of the day. It had a very low battery life and the display was very simple. Unfortunately, my old battery just broke after a couple weeks. The watch was very well designed and the buttons were easy to use. It could tell the time in several ways, from the analog-digital display. The only problem with it was that it was way too difficult to set it up and setup the watch.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had the Sony VTC6 for over a year now. It works well on my desk at work, however it's not as easy to set up and use as my Sony VTR-L3000. I have to go out of my way to do a lot of things, but the device doesn't do anything right. I've tried everything I've read online and it's a chore to make it work properly. The instructions for the VTR were very difficult to understand, and they don't come with a USB cable or software to help you set up the device. If I could give the VTC-6 zero stars I would.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________________________________________________________   First, the screen was broken when I received this. This is a great looking computer. Second, I did not expect any of the connectors for my external hard drive. When I got home, I noticed that there was no way to plug them into the machine. I had to pull the connector off of the connector, disconnect the hard drive, and put the connector back in. This makes it impossible to use my external drive with it. I also did not know that it is a "dead box" because all the connectors are still attached and it does not seem like there is a way to remove them. Third, I had no idea that this machine is running on a PCIE bus. I was worried it would slow down the speed of the system because I am using the PCI bus.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a few bad ones so far and all the worse because of the crappy design. i couldnt even get an open circuit with a multimeter. theres always a way to hook them up but once you get it working it blows up in my face. i have had them for 8 years and they work fine now...i just wish that they would work right.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Kedro from Very disappointed! I was very hopeful when this was released as a replacement for my old E11 but alas they blew up with my original battery in it in about two minutes!  5 out of 4 stars by Marko from Worked Great for years! Bought the new version of the E11 from B&H and was very excited. After doing a battery swap, I was so disappointed! When I plugged the new battery in, it just wouldn't charge and there was no light on the display. I tried to get another battery, but when that one died, the E13 was still dead. I did a battery pack swap and the E14 was fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my husband as a birthday present and he has it now for 2 years and I love it. But my husband just took it out of his pocket and threw it. He just got a new cell phone and it was his favorite. I had to get it back for him. I would get it for him again but I know it wont last more than that.  I wish I would have bought this sooner!   The camera on it is great. The screen is high resolution and clear and the resolution is so good, I really enjoy watching movies. I do not have any problems with the camera and it's battery life is really good, just be sure to charge it before you go on a big trip, you can't go too long without a charge, so I keep an extra set of batteries for when I need to charge up. A very good camera.   In terms of the quality of the images this camera takes, it is one of the best that I have used. The camera is very sharp, and I have found that it produces very clean images in most lighting situations. The only thing that has held it back is the lack of the full frame sensor, but that is something that can be easily fixed through the camera software, which I really like because it lets me adjust the focus to suit what I am shooting and has an auto focus that I can dial in to my liking. I find that the camera is really easy to use, it's not a complicated or difficult to use camera, it takes good pictures and I am very happy with it. The video is also very good, it doesn't record high definition footage, but it is just as good as other cameras with a full HD. But that is because this camera has a super wide angle lens, so it really can capture more of the room, and a zoom is a must if you are into sports, so you can get better closeup shots of athletes. The auto focus is not super quick, it has to be pushed really fast and that takes a little longer, but this is not a big deal.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought this for my kid but he cant seem to understand how to charge it and has a hard time charging it. When i took it out of the box i noticed the battery didn't fit the charging port on the back of the unit. I had to buy a different battery and use a small piece of the battery. The battery is very small and i find it hard to keep them balanced and in the right position when putting it in the charger and when plugging in.  The only thing i don't like about this unit is the fact that when i put it in my son's car it won't charge the car. It also has a big dead battery after about a week of usage. I am a father of 2 boys and i am trying to get as many people as possible to take a look at this device to see if there are better alternatives. My son is a huge fan of this product and i just hope the battery keeps working for him for a long time.  The only thing I don't dislike about this device is the battery, because the battery itself is really good and it doesn't have a dead spot that is annoying when charging the device and then leaving it charging. I just think that the charger should have been a better choice when i purchased this product. It doesn't work well with car charging, i think it could be better with the same weight. I think it is better to buy the batteries separately if you want to use them for car charging or if you use an external battery charger. I would just buy another one instead of buying this charger if I had the money. I got this for $15 and it was a great deal, I'm glad I bought it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for about a month and hasnt worked at all. ive been to the store twice and they said it was coming back.  this was just a $35 phone with a bad screen.  if you can get this to work, buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for 5 months and i just wanted to warn everyone that ive found it to be a bad device with no good reviews on here or in other places. its great for watching tv and a good way to watch the movies in the house, however its not very good for streaming videos. first off its not an apple ipod and the apple ipods don't have a very good internet speed. it's a terrible way to stream youtube or other online streaming services. the first couple of times i tried it, i had an out of control buffering. i tried a whole day of trying to stream something and i can't even get it to start playing properly. also my son has this and it also has a terrible problem with buffering and having an out-of-control buffering while streaming. ive tried to unplug it several times and it won't stop. i guess if it were a better apple ipad, i could see that it would have been worth getting but im just not a fan of ipods at all. i am not looking to spend another thousand on an ipod. if your going to use one of these as a cheap way to get an ipad to use for your movies and tv then it would be a great product but it just isnt worth it for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing was great as long as I had the AC adapter with me, but then I lost it, I never would have noticed, except that my computer's power supply had become hot. The power adapter is no longer included with the machine, so I have to buy it from some other store. I used to have a laptop and I never had the need for a power supply, and it didn't bother me that much. I don't need the AC power, I am just trying to use the computer at the most. Now I'm on my third one and I'm looking for a way to avoid getting a total of three!   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I bought this device a few weeks ago and it only has about 60 hours of life. After my friend plugged in my iMac, and I played a video for a while, and turned it back on it didn't power on again. This is not a bad product but it should work. I bought it thinking it would give me some kind of battery life, but not that. You can't even turn it back to normal without it dying, so its just useless. I have a lot of fun with it, but it is broken now. I really want to like this product, but I am just going to have to return it and buy something better.  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No  0 of 0 people found the following review helpful: Pros: Nice, Compact, Small, Powerful Cons: No wireless capability, Not much room for batteries. I love the fact that this little thing will sit in the corner on the shelf. You don't need to put it near a power outlet, and it's easy to remove and store. But the con is that I had to remove my 3 year old Macbook Pro that I bought used on eBay for $80 and buy a replacement because my old battery was dying. The battery life that I get from my new Macbook is pretty good, I'm able to go a whole day without charging.   Was it helpful to search for this review?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this product for two months and I have to say it's garbage. It starts randomly, turns off, shuts off again, has a really strong odor of plastic, and it doesnt even turn on when im plugged in. It keeps turning off and on every few minutes even when I have no power. It also drains my batteries fast. If youre gonna waste your money this is not the device for you.  Good Value!  My new battery is running smooth. I have only run it for about 10 hours but has plenty of power. I love the look of it.  and its light weight  Love it  I've been using this for a month now and so far I'm very happy with it. It's light weight and looks pretty. I've had to use my external battery pack just because I'm on a tight budget but I've definitely used this to replace an external battery in the past. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a battery pack.  the light weight, the light blue and the small size make it a perfect solution  Best battery EVER!  to keep the lights on  this battery is fantastic. it can be used as a normal usb battery or just as a small external battery for your device. i use it for my iphone6 as an external power source to help my device run for longer periods of time without having to plug it in every time. i was originally going to use a battery from apple, but their battery was about $30 more and i didnt want to pay the extra money for an iphones battery, so i bought this one instead! its really good quality and runs for hours.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used this for 3 months now and i would have been a better off if i had not bought this because of the horrible battery life. its been on the charger for over 2 hours and i have to charge it every day, and this is my third android tablet which have gone through the battery charger a total of three times and the android tablet was the first to be on the battery so the third time has to charge the battery in the charger. and if it is the battery that is a problem then i would just buy an android tablet. ive owned an iphone and a tablet for the past 5 years and i use this iphones battery as it lasts for longer than these two tablets. not impressed at all. i can't find a good reason to own a android device over a iph one
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    i bought this to replace a cheap mp3 player i used to have from walmart (no name on it). the unit was faulty and would randomly shut off randomly. then i discovered the unit does not play mp3s! it just sounds like some jukebox. it wouldnt even play a normal mp3 file. so i took it to a local repairman who told me it was a bad unit and that i would need to buy a new one. i went back and bought one of those "if you need it soon, get it now" kind of cheap, crappy things and it worked perfect.   BUT NOW!!! it stops working altogether and i don't know what to do with it. i dont want to get another broken mp3player either.  ,,   then i found this device and it works PERFECTLY.  It has 2 buttons (play and record) and you can play a few songs by connecting your iPod to it and then press play.  as soon as you press the record button you hear the song and it loops.   the only problem i have found is that it wont work in a car because the power is limited.   for the price i cant complain.  -Kris  The iPod-2  I purchased this for a friend, he is very happy with it, I gave it to my dad also for his birthday he is so pleased. It plays music from his iPod as well. ,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst keyboard I have ever used. The keys are very noisy and the click of the keyboard is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I love the sound quality of my headphones but the volume control seems to go all out when i have a full volume and the volume is so high i can't tell if i am really listening or not. It's annoying.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!!! The device will stop working after one month of use and the manufacturer refuses to give any repair or replacement.

I got it on Friday and had it yesterday to start working on my job for tomorrow. I can't get the webcam to work, but then I noticed my old monitor was dead and that it was the monitor I had bought in 2007, so it's not new. I called support and they told me they had to send it to the "recycle bin." They told me that I should just get another monitor. I am having to return it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this iphone for about 2 months now, and i've had it for two days and had a problem. its been down, down, dead, and now has no sound, even after powering it up and playing a sound file. ive sent it in to apple and they have told me that it has to be checked by a tech because it's not working right. i have no idea what is wrong with it, but i really hope that i get my money back because ive paid a pretty good price for this iPhone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ikon. I used to love this one. I loved the sound of it. I also loved the fact that the mic was removable. I did not use the audio recorder on any of my shows. The only reason I am leaving my kikon is for the audio-recorder that comes with it. The other audio recorder I have used is too small and my microphone is too expensive. ikonger: You have your priorities wrong. It is more of a "camera phone."  The only problem with the phone is the quality of the sound.  I tried to upgrade the audio a few times to my krk.  the sound quality is really good. , but after listening to them on the kik. the sound is much better. The sound is a little tinny, so if you use the krkt on your computer (not my case) it gets better. You can also use a headset.   Also, I'm really sorry about the battery.  of course it takes a while to charge... but when it does charge it is very fast and i can hear everything.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is a good buy. I purchased this for a family member that wanted a smart tv for his son, but wasn't satisfied with the Samsung's. He got the samsung and I just got this for myself for Christmas. I got the TV set today, it is an excellent purchase. This was my first purchase and I would recommend it to anyone that has a smart TV. I like the design of this tv. I would not have bought this for $200.00 without the free 2 year tv warranty. It has worked great for me so far. I can watch it on the airplane, in a car, while at work, with my kids, in my bed at night, etc. I do have to say, the remote control does not work for me. Sometimes, it seems to move around the tv set, but I haven't really seen it do anything with the tv.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was going to buy the same model for my new laptop but I bought an external CD drive. I was using my old laptop with my old hard drive and I was running out of space. I now have a laptop with a 7 terabyte hard drive but it was too bulky to carry around. I did not want to go to all that effort again. I will use my old CD drive for now. I do not know how it works but this is still a waste of money.   I do not understand how they make this easy to use but when they need to go back and change something, it's complicated. It takes 10 minutes to make a call with it and 10 minutes for a call back and it can not be used without an internet connection. It is also very noisy. I have tried to plug it into my computer and it does not work. It does not have a mouse on it so you have to use the touch screen. You are using a keyboard to do everything with it. The microphone is also too noisy. It's like talking to yourself with a mic. I am not sure what the "updates" mean, but it will not tell you what your problem is or what is happening. I'm going to have to find another computer to use this thing because this does not seem to be worth the money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  the product is good but the quality control is very poor. The second day I got it the light just stopped working and now I can't use it at all.  I emailed the company to see if I could return it for a refund but it was pretty expensive for the light and the response was they wouldn't refund it.  I don't think they will ever refund it either.  What does this mean?  This has now been 3 months and I still haven't been able to get my warranty claim.   I have tried contacting the phone number on the website, I even tried to call in, and they have yet to respond.  After all this is my phone.  So, this product just isn't worth the money.  The quality of this product is so bad that even if they gave a warranty it would just give you a bad warranty.  And, all this hassle just for a piece of junk I just bought for $5 on sale.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive owned one for a couple years now and its pretty crappy. if u look inside, its basically just a standard micro usb port. but the usb is not the best, and it is not rated for high end devices. once u plug in your device it wont turn on, only the indicator LED on the box tells you when it is connected and the usb cable isnt working. once the USB port isnt functioning, the light goes off and if u try to do anything with it, it just goes straight to blue light. its not a big deal because the device is justnt good and it does only do one thing, but if u buy one, be aware that it might be pretty crappy!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was looking for a cheap, battery powered radio for my son's guitar. I had read a couple of good reviews about these. One of them said they are small and have a lot of power. I wanted a portable version that would last forever. I don't know if they are good for that, but that is the kind of radio you want to have in the car and would get frustrated with if it didn't work. They work, but for the price, not worth the price. I can't recommend them.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- This monitor is absolutely horrible. I have two other monitors and I have never had a problem with the second one. Not even once! I bought this monitor because it was advertised as being a 24 inch monitor. I assumed that it was because they put the name "24" at the bottom of the monitor. They are wrong. It is a 24.8 inch monitor! That's all I will say on that. It's a waste of $150.00. If you can't get anything better than this, save your money. I tried to return it but no returns, no refunds. So I guess I'm just stuck with this thing.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Jeff G from Good monitor but be careful with the menu buttons This is an awesome monitor. It was easy to set up and had plenty of resolution options, and I had no problems in adjusting the brightness. The only thing is that when you start the menu to adjust the screen or adjust the colors, that's where it stops working. It won't turn on. I ended up cutting off the power to the monitor and using a different device. Otherwise it was very good. The good: Price, resolution, size, quality. The bad: Battery life: 1.5 hours. Colors: The picture is good, but sometimes the blacks are a bit too deep. The color looks good, just not on my computer. Menu: Sometimes it's hard to find a menu button for the most part. This monitor was purchased with a gift card from a friend, so i am not complaining.  is good. I am very happy with the resolution, and the screen looks really sharp.I'm happy for the price. I just wish it worked with my computer well. I'm going to have to buy some accessories to get it to work  I am giving this monitor 4 stars because the monitor only seems to work with a computer that is equipped with a VGA video output. It will not operate on a regular cathode ray tube display, such as a CRT. In fact, it only accepts a CRTs in which the video signals are sent directly to the display, and not through the cathode rays. My laptop was equipped with VGA which I wanted to use on this monitor but it is not compatible. I also would not recommend this monitor for anyone with color blindness because it only offers 16.8 million colors and has a maximum resolution of 15.6 feet. Overall

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first got this i was not impressed. It was slow when doing things and did not have the battery life that you would get with a higher end machine. The quality was good, but it was not as nice looking as the ones I have used in the past. I would recommend this for a good price, but if you are looking for a better looking keyboard you might be better off going with the model number 8086 model. I am considering switching to a model with higher quality keyboard but the 8086 was a good one. If you can get one you would be happy with it but don't waste your money and buy the 8087 if you need a good keyboard for the price.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this product to control my   light-duty electric drill and it   did not work. My wife bought it and I wanted to try it out so I   borrowed it from her.   The   drill was not going on or off when the   control button was pressed.  It was very disappointing because my wife has   a great electric drill. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for a year, and every time i play music on it and im not sure why, the sound gets way lower in volume then i usually play it, and even when im at a really loud level in my room. this thing sounds like it's barely playing. there is no sound coming from the speaker at all, its like its missing, even tho it's on all the time and i keep turning it off or turning it on. i really wanted to like this because it was one of the only "pro" devices that actually sounded like it was working when it wasn't just turning on randomly. unfortunately, i had to have the computer repaired and lost all my warranty, and now this thing is so dead i cant even use it anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for three years, its been through so much it still works but everytime i plug it in its still a brick. it doesnt sound good when plugged in it doesnt seem to go to the amp like it should, and its really hard to plug in. its not as good as my other dac's or the mx5r, and i have had other things in my life go up in flames from this thing  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, August 10, 2012  Works as advertised  by: Paul from Las Vegas CA USA  Pros: Works well  Cons: None  Review: I used it for about 3 months, plugged it in one time and it died. Went through the battery again and it worked as normal after that.  I don't know what went wrong, maybe the battery, or maybe I should have used this with a different dac.  on a side note: I am not sure if I can recommend this product. .  for the price, this is a good dac, especially since it has a built in phono preamp and a built-in phono connector. It's a shame that you can't use this with any digital source and have it work, because it works pretty well for a little bit, and after a while, it just starts to fail, and I can't find a way to repair it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had an iphone for over 2 years. every now and then it fails and i get a message "you dont have enough power" im told it is not an issue with the phone. now the phone cant even do anything. i just purchased this thing on sale and im going to try to repair it myself, im very disappointed in a phone that cost $199 and is not working at all. I hope you guys will consider fixing them instead of charging exorbitant prices. i am really going to have to look into some other products.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My brother and I had to replace our iphone after two months because the screen kept changing. It wasnt working after 1 month and a half of use, we sent it to apple and they say they wont cover it. My mother has a iphones too and ive been trying to find a new one.    Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, July 17, 2009  My husband and I love it.  by: CMT from Washington, VA USA  Pros: It's a great product.   Cons: My husband can't use his and I have a bad feeling in my stomach because I have to send my husband an i-pods every 3 months for the replacement batteries. .  of a bad idea  Review: I like the i-Pod's in the first place. This device is just a waste of time. I bought two of them for my two sons because my husband needed something that would be able to listen to music while I was in the office. The i-pod's do not allow you to listen while charging your phone. They don't allow you anything that could be done on your phone with it charged. This means that when the battery in the ipod runs out of power, you can only use it as a music player for two minutes at most. Also, the charging cord is so long, that you have to stand in order to use the device as a phone and a car alarm. No thank you.  and the sound is not very clear   by: jason from NY USA - - - -  This has caused me problems since my wife got it and when we first got it we listened to all the CDs and nothing came up for us. Then we found out that the battery on the ipad charger was not charging all the time and was not good. The only reason the device worked was because my wife has a little i-pad that she could put it in so that it could be charged in our car. This makes it a big hassle and the iPod doesn't charge as well. My wife was also having problems with the fact that the buttons on the iPod were not always able to be pressed correctly. When trying to make calls or play music, she had to use her phone to call or turn the iPod on and off. Finally, my wife had to buy a new i-iPod for the stereo. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this phone for a month and I really love the device, however the screen is horrible, every time you move my finger the display changes its colour to a lighter shade of red. It is very disapointed and I am disappointed in a company like this, especially after receiving a free case that made it better. If you value your time and money don't bother with this product!  Rated 4 out of 5 by Sommers from Good phone! I bought this to replace my Motorola g-droid and I was really happy. It works great with my iPhone 6. It has the latest android updates (5.1) and works well. Battery life is excellent, however it does not support 4G. It does have a speaker and microphone. It's hard to tell a difference but if you buy it for this reason you will be happy with it.  Customer Testimonials

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ___________________________________ When I opened the box, the screen turned off. I tried to turn the screen back on. I did not know how to operate the power button, so I turned off the machine, and took out my old manual. I figured out how to use the power buttons on the back of the unit. The screen is fixed at a 45 degree angle, so it is impossible to reach the power switch. I can use the control knobs on the side of the screen. But I did find a trick, when I turn the knob all the way right, the display appears to be blank. But when I move it left, I can see my selections. I have used this device to make a "chicken" with a small amount of food, using a "cork" and a string. I am not sure how effective it is. I guess I will use a knife to make the chicken.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This little thing is great for my needs, but the battery life on this unit is terrible. It only lasts 5-6 hours out of the box. It has to be set to auto-off and then the battery is drained at least once during the day and at night. There are better rechargeable battery options, but these are not made for the average consumer, who wants to go out and have fun all day.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These headphones are nice, but they just don't have anything special going for them.   The sound is good, but it is all over the place.  I can tell you there are a few more expensive headphones that have better sound.  The volume is fine, but the quality is really just ok.  It can be annoying at times because the headphones don't take up a lot of space, but I think that's an aspect I have with any headphones. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for a few weeks now, its a little to heavy to hold, the buttons on it dont work on my laptop so i have to reach over them to use them. also the buttons dont stay depressed for very long which is frustrating for a product with so many buttons  Rated 5 out of 5 by jdav from Love this product I have bought this product about a month or so ago and i love it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------------------- I bought this from Walmart about 2 weeks ago and it is so good. It is a great starter phone for my 4 year old son. He uses it all the time to play games and watch tv. I love this phone. I have never had an issue and no problems. The only bad thing is that the screen is very tiny and not at all sharp. I wish this phone had a bigger screen. But for its size and price, I love it. I recommend this phone for everyone --------------------------- Was this review helpful to you?

I am happy with it.  the camera is very nice  Customer Testimonials
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As another reviewer has mentioned, the device is an LCD/LED display, which is not good in my opinion. I used to get a much better display at a much higher cost but at this price point I think the display could be much better. Also the backlight is so dim, if you can read the back of the display at all, you have to read the screen in low light. As I read through reviews, I found the battery to be a little on the old side. You'll need to use the cable to get the device to charge and while the charging is very quick, you'll definitely have to use a charger or you may not get enough juice to keep it running. The battery is pretty low, though not really noticeable at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone 6s+ screen is flakey and the audio does not work! I've been using an apple iphon 6s and a Motorola Moto G. They both have the same screen but they work differently. This phone does not have the sound on the same level as either phone. When I'm listening to music on the phone or watching video, I feel like my head is going to explode because I can't hear the music or subtitles. You'd think that the same company that made an iphoni phone would have made a better one, but it's very hard to rate a phone based on the audio and video it has.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good device for the price I like the idea of being able to access your personal library of music without needing an internet connection. I also like that it's portable and easy to set up. I like that the keyboard is very accurate and works great for a touchscreen. My only complaint is that the battery lasts only a couple of hours. If you really need more battery, it is very easy to replace. Overall I give the phone 4 stars because it works well for what it was designed for.  is good. The problem with it is the battery life. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was skeptical about purchasing a computer from the store because of the price but was excited when the computer arrived. I was not happy to see the back of the computer and that the hard drive was scratched. The customer service was not too helpful and the technician was rude. I didn't receive the proper software or a complete refund. It would have been nice if he would have told me that the entire computer was cracked and that I needed to return it. I'm not sure how I will ever trust a computer company again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was really hoping to get an Epson scanner/printer at the end of the month, but unfortunately, my local office didn't get it. I went and bought this, hoping that the scanner would be of a better quality. Well, it's a piece of crap! The image quality is terrible. You can't see through all of the paper. I can't use it to take notes, since the scanner has a high resolution and can scan more easily (no paper!). So, I have to use a standard word processor or doodle on paper and send it back.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This item is very bad, very noisy, I was very disappointed when the device was not working well. I used to use the tablet to play computer games and it was really easy to use. The device is very hard to work with when it's not running. It's very annoying when you don't work well because you have to wait for the power to come back. I would recommend buying it from a different store or a different country. It was not very easy to get it from Amazon.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My new tv, tv remote, tv tuner, dvd player, etc is all in good working order. However it's the power adapter/warranty that is the problem. After I had purchased it for my family I called the local retailer in my area to see if there was any information on their website that might be of assistance. It didn't help that there wasn't. I had to visit their store and ask for the number to their service center. No help there either. Then I had a call with the service rep to get some help. No better way to say it, nothing. He didn't seem to know much about the product either. This is the worst product ever. No wonder their customer support is the way it is. If you are on the fence I'd recommend going elsewhere.   I bought this tv for my dad. He wanted something smaller than his old tv but needed it to work in an older house. He wasn't sure how big a screen it would need to be. It came with a remote so he had to figure that out. The remote came with no instruction manual so he needed help with it. I took the remote back and returned it to get a manual. I am pretty sure I would have found the info if I had found the remote. It's very easy to set up for my husband who is not very tech savvy. When we first plugged it in, it was very slow. After a while it was getting faster. So far it is looking good for a cheap tv. It is a little bright but that is to be expected with an older tv. The only thing I didn't like about the tv was that it's remote did not have the audio control buttons on the side of it. It would have made the remote much more user friendly. Overall I'm very satisfied with this tv and would definitely recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great product but the battery life is very short. I was able to use it for 2 weeks. In the second week I used the flashlight, and it became extremely hot to hold, and the battery became very hot. I have bought batteries for the other flashlights that cost twice as much as this one and have been using them for over 3 months now. I am getting tired of purchasing batteries like these for flashlights for my children, so I purchased this one. The battery life will last the same for about 2 weeks but then the flashlight is going to die. I wish I had bought the rechargeable ones.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using my ds since a few weeks now. ive replaced all the parts in the device including the original usb connector, usb to usb cable, and the original battery.  the ds works great when the screen is off but as soon as you turn it on it crashes.  i have to wait a little more than a minute to boot up again and it always gets stuck on an old password.  also im using the same charger as i did the last one.  any suggestions on how i can get it to boot again quickly. i hope i can find a way to repair it before i drop this into the garbage.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a pretty cool gadget. However, the build quality is terrible. The battery would randomly disconnect and would only charge if you turned it off. This is not acceptable. I gave it 5 stars because it is an easy way to connect to a wifi device and the battery life on a good phone is great. If I would have paid $15 I would not have felt any regret.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for a while. it is not very bright. if you are like me, you use a desk lamp. and the light is nice. but you have to keep looking for the light. also, when you go to turn the light on. if i try to turn it on with it on. the lights come on with a little delay. this was a good device until i purchased a digital camera. it makes me very nervous to use the lights when using the camera. I can get a picture with a flash. so i don't want to have a bright light when i want to take a picture. i will get a digital digital camera in the future. I would recommend this device. if it wasn't for the cheap price, i would give it five stars.

It was an amazing deal but within a few months she is out of it. Everytime it has charged up it shuts off, and the charger has to be recharged. It's a hassle to charge and when the battery goes dead she has to unplug it. I had to buy a battery charger to replace hers. The battery has gotten worse and worse. I have already bought a new battery to replace it, but the battery still hasn't returned to normal. She is getting discouraged and doesn't know what to do.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------ After using the K9-PRO for two years, I replaced the battery for a new one. One week later, I decided to buy an external battery. I installed a new battery and took my K9 off the wall charger. I plugged it in and got a beep, beep! beep!, beep!. I didn't understand what I had done wrong because I never got a problem with that device before. I unplugged it and replaced the new battery. After the first charge, I plugged the unit back in and was a beeping mess again. I went and looked for the original battery and found a huge black hole on the bottom, filled with juice. I cleaned it up and put it back in. I tried a few more chargers and even the wall chargers. It kept going and going and eventually I gave up and bought another, more expensive, model from Amazon. The K9 would not even charge my iPad 1! I didn'T find another battery on Amazon that charged it. I found another from Best Buy that did work. I have no clue why I had a battery that worked for the K-9 but not for the others. The charger is the exact same, but with a different part number.  My only advice is DON'T BUY FROM AMAZON! I had to return it to Best Buy and I had purchased a very similar one from Amazon, and it worked fine.  as others have stated, the battery life is NOT the same as the K7-PRO, and there is no way I would buy that from Amazon again. The K-Series and the K8-PRO are similar, but the K1-PRO is really a nice, professional-looking, high-end speaker, with a much more powerful sound. It's better in my opinion, than the K4-PRO in many respects.  (As other users have stated in the feedback threads, I do not use the mic port or the headphone port when recording. I use the front-panel-connector or USB port instead.)  In fact, I am pretty sure the K5-PRO will not have a major problem with those features; it has a mic port and a headphone jack. , it is a professional-quality sound, especially with a good mic/headset. I've got other, less expensive speakers that have had mic/speaker issues, but they still worked.The

I have had no problem with my phone so far.   I like the fact that the device comes with 3 different power sources which are all compatible.

It works. it has a good joystick and keyboard with the Tandy name.   a few games don't work at all, and others are fine. I don't know what the problem is, but it's most definitely not the controller.  .... Heres another thing, when I first got it, it was very hard to operate and take up a lot of space on my computer tower. I fixed that by buying a new tower, and now I just plug the thing into it and it works perfect.   said that it was still too big, but now, it is just right.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the M-Audio Fast Track 2 over the other two because it said 2 inputs/outputs. The other two had 3 inputs and one output. This was a mistake, because the 1st input had the wrong polarity. If I had known about that before I had bought it, I could have saved a good $5. If you only have one input and output, go for a different one. It would have been nice if they said it was 2 inputs and 1 output.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    i am using this product at home for the first time. it worked flawlessly for about a month. I plugged it in and turned it on. I had my tv on. The tv stopped playing. I was confused, because it was in standby mode. I put the tv to standby mode, and the tv plays fine. then I put it back to standby. It plays perfectly now. I am sure this will last more than a year. I hope it doesn't overheat.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    1. The keyboard is not the best. I know, I'm so used to a different layout of keys, but there are not enough keycaps to make this keyboard as comfortable as it was supposed to be.   2. This device does not support USB-C devices, and that means you cannot use an external mouse with it.  - I got this as a gift, and it's very disappointing to get it back when I'm done with it!   5 6/30/2018 10.16.28 By Anonymous a good keyboard I got it for my work laptop and it is a good choice  This product works very good and it was very easy to set up.

It has all the same keys but the one that is plugged into the laptop is out of order. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just bought this because it was so small but I'm so disappointed. I plugged in the remote and I was getting some static when the screen said that it was connected. Then the lights in the house went out. I had it plugged in for 20-30 minutes and all the lights went out before I could even get it in the wall. I called tech support and they said to try to connect it for another 30 minutes and it would work. Then it never worked. It was dead the minute I plugged it in. I have not had any other devices to test but my whole house was just dead. And then the customer service rep was very rude. She said she could just charge me extra to buy a new remote because I had no reason to have this device. I hate that it will cost more to replace my remote.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Dave from Disappointed I had the remote for about 6 months and it worked great. However my remote broke in the first month. It would not recognize the remote when I put it in my computer. This remote has so many buttons and if it worked as well as I thought it did, I would have no problem with it. However, it would not operate. I contacted the company for a replacement but no one responded to my messages or phone calls. I am disappointed I wasted my money on this remote.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have two of these, one that was defective. One ended up in the landfill. This one was an absolute nightmare.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________________  '96 Honda Prelude 2.5 SOHC, 6 speed, $13k. Just got it and it has a few flaws. First off the plastic shift knob is the worst I've ever seen, it literally fell off and is just a metal piece. The remote seems okay it gets the car started and when I'm ready to get to work it sends me to the manual. The dash itself is fine and all of the buttons work fine. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the audio system, it's not as clear and I'm thinking maybe I need to get a bluetooth speaker, not sure, it doesn't sound great but still. The car comes with 4 speakers, a sub, and the system comes with a little bluetooth kit and a usb charging cable, I had to buy the USB cable and charging cable from AutoZone and I found it to be very expensive. It sounds great to me and the music is crisp and clear. Overall a pretty good car but a few things I'd change would be getting the bluetooth system, and getting the steering wheel in the right place. I feel like that is a bit of a pain in the butt to get in the same place each time I drive. The next biggest thing would be the dash, it is pretty bulky and there is nothing wrong with it at all, I don't think it is a huge problem for me to drive it in the front with the windows down.   Overall I'm very happy with it and have learned a lot of new things and can see myself buying another one in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------------------- I have purchased a number of devices in the past and was looking for a simple device that did the job. I have only had this unit about 3 days and my biggest concern is the wireless range. When you move to a new house with a new modem and a new router I was told this device should be able to communicate with the old one. So far I have not been able to connect to the old router to change the password. The wireless range is not a problem in my house but the performance is poor and the device does not seem to have a very big battery. This product needs to be updated to include a USB port.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem is not that the device is broken, it's that it's useless. The device, for me, was a very important piece of my life, so I tried very hard to make it work, but I can't. After several weeks of trying to fix it, my wife and I gave up. I'll keep using my iPhone 6 Plus, but not with this device. I really wish I had used a different electronic device for a year and a half.  I don't like having to use a tool to do my things. And I do my stuff in a different place, so why do I have to use my phone to do it, especially when it's so expensive? It's not like it's an expensive tool. It's a phone! And I don't want to deal with it, it makes me angry, it seems like it would be easier to just use my car, or use a small computer or laptop if I want to take notes, type a few words.  in my opinion it would have been better if you had made a few modifications, but the product is not as advertised. it's not as powerful as i thought it would. it makes a mess of your phone when you're using it in the car and it won't stay plugged in, even after a minute of holding it. And the battery just doesn't last. and that's on a $800 phone! and it's hard to use on the highway, too. it is also a pain to charge it if you have a car. I am going to have to try the battery thing, that has been working on my other phone, because i used to use the charger with my phone. but i'll try my car charger first, and see how long it takes, or it might be time to start thinking about a battery that doesn't charge as fast and doesn't break down. so, i'm going to try and fix my phone now, while i'm at work and there's no one else around. i'll give it another month or so to see how it works.  of course you can repair your phone. what if you want to upgrade it to a new model? it's a free country, right? i'll send you a full detailed rundown of the steps that i took to repair my phone, and you can tell me what to do next.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been looking at this product for several months now and am still looking at the same thing. the usb-c port isnt usb-a so its very unreliable. the device wont charge the device without the charging hub and it will run at full speed when i plug it into my pc. the hub will only charge the charger for a minute. it runs with no charge to the pc even when i get it to over 3.2v on the pc. it also doesnt last longer then an hour when it is fully charged. the only thing i like about this device is its charging speed but it should have usb-to-usb-c with usb-s ports and usb-A with usb.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the most annoying thing ever! I tried two other types of bluetooth devices in the last year and they were all much better. The first was a bluetooth speaker. It worked fine and I could easily play music while working out. The second was a wireless keyboard. The buttons were responsive and the keypad was easy to work with. The only problem I have with the keyboard is when I use it on a table or a desk, the buttons have no grip, making it impossible to type on the screen. So basically, bluetooth speakers are better but Bluetooth keyboards have terrible keys.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought several of these things and they all work pretty well but i am very disappointed with them in particular because they have to be charged with an inverter which only charges them when connected to a solar panel. So basically i have to buy a whole new battery and i dont even have a solar charging system so how is that any better than just using a regular battery? i dont know how this company thinks they can sell us a battery that we don't have to charge with an electricity generating device. ive only gotten 5 months of use out of these. not good at all, i wouldnt use these again.  Rated 4 out of 5 by M2K from Great for the price The battery is durable and very easy to charge. It's not really good for continuous use though, as it lasts for about 1/2 hour to 3 hours of charging, depending on which battery is used. There are some downsides to these: The first is that the batteries have a slightly smaller capacity. That doesn't make a big difference, but it's still less than a regular lithium battery. The second is that they are quite sensitive, which means that they tend to get extremely hot even when it's not in use. That said, that's pretty rare, and for some reason, I never had a problem with the battery overheating or causing any kind of fire. The third is that once charged, these can be quite slow to charge, so I tend to stick with a normal 9v battery charger. The fourth and final downside is that these battery packs aren't rechargeable. They are only good for about 90 minutes of continuous use, and can't be fully recharged without some sort of inverter. These are also extremely sensitive to overcharging, which can damage the cells. That is not really a problem unless it's really high and you've left them in a car on the charger for a long time, which will cause a major explosion. I've had these batteries for about 6 months now, and have not had any issues with them, so it seems like they've been well built and are definitely reliable. I'd recommend them to anyone who has a car or truck that can take the hassle of a battery, and they are well priced for what they are. 2.5 years later... I've purchased two of these battery pack. The first one, a 60Wh (3.6Ah), lasted around 30 hours of light daily use. However,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device is not very good for anything but watching television. It just works. I have tried other cheap electronics and this is the worst. It does not work well in any use. Write a positive review about an excellent electronic device! :  The SVS BVM-1000 is just a little too large to fit into the TV cabinet at my house. It's not big enough to run a full set. However, it is perfect for watching DVDs in the living room. I've been using it to play DVDs in my bedroom. The speakers are much better than any other audio system I've ever owned. The sound quality is also better than anything I've owned, and it's better than my home theater setup from another company. This system is so nice to listen to that I've not bought a separate speakers. I will continue to use my BVM because of its excellent sound.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this item to connect my tv and it would not work and would only make the tv sound distorted. I contacted the manufacturer and they said that the unit needed to be disassembled. I was told that they would send me a new unit but that they could not make a new part for me. I had no choice. They charged me for the part so I had to pay for it to be sent to them so they could send me the new unit. I sent the new part in for repair and it still did not work. I called again but the customer service said I had sent the wrong part. I told them I sent them the correct one. They said it had already been sent. I then told them that the parts have already been exchanged for the same unit but the replacement unit did not turn on. This was the fourth time I have bought from them and all 4 times the units did not even turn on and did not seem to do anything.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this unit for a year. it has worked for almost a year and works fine except for the fact that it does not seem to work when the batteries have been drained down to 5% of their capacity. i have put it in different phones and i can use it on the new phone that came out (not the same one as my old one). i did not try to recharge the phone with this one, because it was the batteries that were the problem and it had been sitting there for a while without charging and didnt need to be recharged. i would like to say that this device is the same thing as the ones i used to buy. i dont like the fact they are not sold with extra batteries, because you have to buy more for your phone that you bought these for.

"No wireless charger" is on the bottom of the box (not on the back) so you may need to get the little card that comes with the adapter and slide it under the charging port of your device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ___________  This is a very cheap electronic device that I would not recommend. It is a bad design for a lot of reasons that I won't get into. The button and audio output both are extremely flimsy and do not work reliably. I have also had trouble with battery problems, and have had to replace it over and over again. The speaker also sounds weak, not loud enough to listen to music or movies. When using the battery, you have to plug it into a USB port which is also flimsy. The software seems buggy and poorly implemented, and the software itself is completely useless. I would strongly recommend to only purchase this if you plan on using it at home, as it is not suited for working on a computer or a cellphone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________________________________________________________________________ As you can see I went thru the trouble to get this device and the cable. I was expecting a good quality item for a lot of money but I am not sure the quality of this device as it only allows me to hear music via headphones or speakers when using it in stereo mode, no stereo mode when the speaker is switched on! And there is no mute button and only the headphone and speaker buttons work, so if someone tries to use this for a long time without it being set up the speakers and the headphones will start to play loud when switching between the audio source. I got this device because it is supposed to work with the iPod and iPod Mini, but no, it doesn't. And, the fact that the usb plug is on the back is a real nuisance, you have to unplug it with a small screwdriver and then you will have to plug it back in and it will just work. You have to be really careful with the cable when you use it, if you are just using it to listen to music the cable is a lot more of a pain than if you were using it for any other purpose. You might find that the sound is better if you use the headphones and the speakers. I really don't think this is a good product for the money you are paying for it, it is just a waste of money.

By Michael I just picked up the i7-8750H and just wanted to say the i5 7600 and 8700k's are very capable, and the i3's work fine, and I am very happy with the performance. But this system is just awesome. It is really easy to use and the display is crystal clear and the performance is fantastic. I was already looking into the more powerful processors and had the chance to try the i8 770 and I can say it was much faster then the i6, but not by much. .Read full review

Works fine with my Galaxy S2. Battery life is awesome!  and not to mention it charges my batteries faster than a wall charger!  (I only have 1 battery.)  The only problem is that the charger will sometimes only charge one battery at a time. Sometimes it works, sometimes not.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive owned 2 for a short while now, but i just bought another, and this time I had my doubts about it. I've read numerous reviews of poor quality, etc., and I didn't really buy into them until this phone...  The phone had a few issues, but they were small and not too noticeable until i had to order and pick up a replacement phone. I got a new battery, but the screen on this one was so flaky, and the battery life was so horrible, I returned it.   I don't know why there are people buying these phones, just go with a different brand.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using this for a little over a year now and it has gone through 3 batteries. ive replaced the 3rd battery with a new one twice. the first time i swapped out the battery my phone was dead in about 3 days. suddenly the phone would not charge anymore and would not turn on and would shut off every few minutes. i was able to fix the phone using a charger for under 5 dollars. after that i would have to use the micro usb cable to charge my phone and the charging unit that came with the phone and it would only charge about half the time. my last phone from the same brand was from 2011 and was no longer made. now im looking at getting a new model of this phone. this will be my last electronic device i ever buy. if youre looking for an excellent phone at a great price this is it.  i recommend this device to everyone, good customer service, good products, low prices   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good Product!

Also, I don;t want to carry an iPod case around with me. This case fits the ipad perfectly. The battery life is good. It's nice to be able to just leave the ipads on.

I have been looking at a monitor with more colors for the home I bought the VESA mount for this monitor. I really wanted to buy the VGA adapter to use it with my PC but I was told it was out of stock. That's a bummer. .  to the point of the monitor, the colors are great, just don't buy the monitor. The colors are bright, but they are not so vibrant and pop. The resolution is great for gaming on my Mac Pro. The only thing you can do is adjust the color temperature setting of the display but that may change how accurate it looks. I like the built in speakers too, they work well. The remote is really useful as well, and it is the perfect size for my desktop. I use it as an extra monitor for the office for when I need to work on my laptop but still have something on the desk. The only thing that bothers me, is that it has a glossy finish on it which can get annoying at times. Not many people use this monitor, which is fine, I just know that some of you will. For those who do, you can just turn it off in settings. I love my monitor, and I use my Macbook Pro for my main desktop PC.  a great monitor at a great price, especially at this price. This is the only computer monitor I use at work, and if it doesn't get attention, I don't even notice. I would recommend this monitor to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!The battery last a couple of weeks. It is still good but not great.!!!  No problems with the device: This is a great device. I'm going to be replacing my last charger in a couple weeks and was hesitant about getting a new one. With the charger I had with my previous devices, there was always the chance of the power failing. I read some other reviews and the battery life seemed really good, so I bought it. It took about a week to arrive and I was a little disappointed. When the device arrived, it looked brand new and the charger was new. I plugged it in, waited a few minutes, and went to bed. I woke up to a strange buzzing and a short buzz. The second day it began to work and after 2 hours of use, it would still not go low. I was very disappointed. I called the store and was told that it would be shipped to me and I would receive a credit. When I returned, the store gave me a different charger for free. I highly recommend the product.  Love this product: Love this product, this is the only one in the office I use!  Good battery: This battery is good.  The only bad thing is that it dies very quickly. :)  I recommend this product! I purchased the charger on a Monday and had it delivered Monday night. It was delivered on Wednesday afternoon. I am very happy with my purchase and I recommend it. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone 7 plus is a very bad phone to use. i bought it to replace a bad 6 plus and i have a bad record of not liking anything having to do with iPhones. this is not a good phone and the buttons are terrible. it should not be sold to people with bad eyes. if i could get something good in a box it would be perfect. the display is not bad but its not great either. the camera is ok at best, i use it as my only camera. i would have much preferred a better camera if it was the only thing i could afford. this phone does everything well except for using your hands and using your ear. the screen is really bright and the sound is ok but i hate using my phone in the sun. the only redeeming feature is the screen being able to be touched when its off but it doesnt help me when it needs to be on. i dont know why people put up with this poor design.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very impressed with this unit and it has a nice battery life. However, it has only a 6 channel receiver on the rear. I really wanted to use it as a backup transmitter for my RC car and it is quite expensive for this. My best option is to use a receiver with an RFID transmitter to make my RC go to different places. I would recommend this unit for the novice and enthusiast who wants to build a remote control for RC vehicles.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------------------- I have a samsung galaxy note 2. I had tried everything to get it working with the router and no matter what i did it would keep on going into the rebooting mode. The samsung is really a nice phone to hold but it needs a better wifi solution or i would never have to buy another samsung device. This router works perfect for a beginner but as i said the connection is very unstable. i have tried everything from updating drivers and setting it to automatic to using a wired router and it has not worked.

Only thing I need to do is plug in my pc over an ethernet cable to be able to use wifi.  of the product. I didn't know what to expect with this router since there was nothing online about it, and when i saw it I was impressed. It took about 3-4 days to arrive (but I ordered it yesterday) so i was nervous but it arrived on time. It's a very good product. The only thing that bothered me about it is that i did not order it with the firmware update option so i had to download it from another router in order to use it. In terms of service, I've had no issues using it. I have been using it for about 2 months now and everything is running great. I'm just about ready to put it on my lan so that I can do some gaming and streaming from my pc. I have tried the other reviews before reading this one and the only problem I had was with the internet connection. It is really slow, sometimes it will drop to 10-15kbps and the speed will be terrible when it is busy. That can be fixed by simply setting the internet to 'automatic' if I'm on my wireless network.

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, March 30, 2010  by A Customer from USA  Review: Good buy for what it is. .    Was able to upgrade to the latest model (SAT) using a converter from a good brand store and was pleased with the quality and features.  and the latest one (Sats) can also be used with the original battery (no need to replace!). and the unit is great. and now it comes with a usb cable for quick charging when not using the included USB cord. so if you are looking for a reliable product, then this is a good option.  of course you still have to be careful what you are plugging in and you have to get used to not having a power button on this model. however it works and you can get the job done. ,  The only bad part was that when the last battery died i had 2 other ones and the battery in the Sats had stopped working, so i had no way of replacing it.  (and im not a professional mechanic)  was also disappointed in the fact that i can only get 1 power port (one port on each side) i dont have a usb to power converter, i can always find an adapter if i want to buy one.  a few suggestions on the software and the ability to make the buttons larger on both the power button and usb port.  on a note to others, the usb is for charging, it doesnt even turn on the unit, only to the front of the unit to do charging and that is a huge flaw.  said  It was an awesome experience and I'd purchase again.  the only thing I didn't like is the fact you can't change the colour of the light. I have the blue one and its really small. I thought I'd lost it, I have two more that are in the box and I'm afraid to take them out. I just hope they're still working and working well.

Thank you  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great product! I was able to do two installations using the supplied power cable. I have the previous power supply from another brand and was able, in about 10 minutes, to complete installation of the new unit. The installation was easy and I have had zero problems with this product. The install manual was very detailed. I think I might even want to purchase this product for future projects.  the only issue is that its not really a power supply  My first issue is the instruction manual (which is a little long) does not address the issues I have. The problem is, the current from the wall socket can not even be taken to the supply, so the only way I could get more current is to get the wall power plugged in to my outlet. And even that won't work. The output of the current transformer is rated at 9V, so even with my 2.5W power supply, I was only able to get 1A to my new power supply. My original power supply had an output of 5V, and the wall panel can output 6V, not 9V. . It is a good unit for the price, but the instructions are a little confusing and if you don't understand it, it may not work the way you think it should. - - - -  After spending many hours researching how to install the unit I can report to you that there are problems with its functionality. The video on the website for installation and operation is not as easy as a picture.

You MUST install the adapter as shown in the installation instructions. Once you have the correct adapters it will run with no problems. When I installed the adapters I noticed that the

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________________________________________________________________________________________I bought a Garmin gt30 in 2008 to use as a backcountry radio. I had not been an avid hiker up until then so my only experience had been a few hikes. I was blown away by how little gear I needed. The gt has been working great for years. Then in 2014 I had to upgrade my radio and this thing was obsolete. It had a couple of minor issues but I could deal with that. When I saw the price on this gt, it was too good to be true. I bought a $20 ebike as a gift. I used it for about a year, the battery died about a month later. The first thing it had to do was re-wire. This gt is useless and there is no way it works as it was intended. It is like buying a new car. The battery is too big and the computer needs a better radio system. I don't trust Garmin to do anything right.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The  Roku 3 is a terrible  device that doesn't get what it's doing. I don't know if it's because I'm on a different firmware, but it seems to have an issue when connected to my cable box. When I plug it in, it won't turn on. When you try to play a video from the hard drive or USB drive, it will give a warning and say it's not ready to play yet. It also crashes about every 20 minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   A year or two ago, I bought an old iPod for my wife. She uses it every day. Well, she got a new one and she's using it as well. I have been using an old PC for a while as a replacement for my iPod. I've gotten used to the power and volume controls, but my wife still uses the old iPod as she's been using it longer. This new device is much, much louder than the old one. I don't understand why the old device still works because the volume control for it was not easy to access. The power button is not easy either. It is hard to find it with my fingers and sometimes I had to force my fingers into the hole to turn it on. I really think they should add a volume control to the new device as well as a power button. It took a few hours to find the power button and it takes longer with the old to do so. I know there are plenty of reviews about it that say the device is loud but they don't say about the volume controls. I bought this to replace my iPod but it was too loud for my need and I got rid of it. I will buy another one but I want to find a way to turn the volume down.

It was a good investment for the price, but it would be nice if they would work for much longer. Other than that, very happy with this purchase.  What is in the box?: A simple, one page instructions that was easy to follow. The box has no instructions so I didn't know if it had any other features (like the other reviews state), but it did look like a plastic case. It is the same type of box as the one we have used for other products. What else? Everything else that came with the unit was exactly the same, it just took longer for me to get everything out of the box. The battery, USB cable, a micro-usb cable (so I could charge it without it plugged into the computer), and the case with the circuit board, the wires and some other parts (the one that plugs into the motherboard). All this, and I got this in time for Christmas so I think it was worth the wait.  of 3 Customer Reviews  Get it for what you want It will probably take a few years to see if the features are worth it or not. I used this for a couple of years and found it to be good. What can I say, it is good quality and very cheap. You just need to be careful if you are using it in a very noisy place.  at the very least is worth the price I bought this for my husband for christmas and we both love it. He can get it to his computer to work and he doesn't have to change the cable.  The unit is a pretty cheap model but the USB cable it comes with is very nice. Also, I can not recommend it enough, it works just like it says. It charges it's battery as well as any usb device that you have plugged into it. You get it for a good price as well. Overall, I really like it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had been searching for a good quality camera for about a year. I found a good deal on a Canon VIXIA HF that was good. I installed it into my motorcycle. I was thrilled to start shooting pictures and videos. I could not get a good image in the first place. I tried the camera and the pictures were horrible. I returned it and bought the Sony Cyber-shot. I am really happy with this camera. I have tried to shoot a lot of stuff with it and I have only had one bad image. It is great!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Features for a great price! I got the Sony a6000 about a month ago and so far I love it. I live in a very sunny and sunny state. My pictures look incredible with the ability to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation and color. The photos and videos are sharp. The pictures are bright and clear in my dark and low light settings. The camera is easy to use, it's not complicated and you won't have to worry about adjusting it. It doesn't have any buttons and can't be locked like an action cam, it just works! My only complaint is that my camera gets warm so I usually take it outside. I think this is probably just me but I prefer it when my cameras heat up, especially at night.  Customer Testimonials
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone4s is bad because the usb plug always needs a charge to work. I have had this for about a week. i tried to plug it in at night when I was asleep and had to plug the battery into the usb adapter. and I had to wait till it came back up, then I could turn on it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________ ________ ___________ _______________ _____________. No matter what the cause, this is a worthless device. The USB cord is very flimsy and easy to lose, the screen does not respond to clicking, and the "back" button does not work. I have been searching for a replacement device and this is the worst option available. ______________ ________ ___ _________ ________. A piece of garbage. The only reason I give it four stars is the USB cord, if you want to play games on the computer, buy a better USB cord. It doesn't come with any extra power, which is what I was looking for.  Rated 1 out of 5 by lgk1 from Poor Product I bought this for a gaming pc that only came with a usb to ethernet adapter. The screen and the input jack was not connected. I called the support and they told me that the screen was out of spec and they replaced it for me. It arrived with all of the same problems as the other one. The keyboard and the mouse. The mouse had some slight flex and the key felt loose. I replaced that as well and it still did not work properly. I also had a few problems with the screen. I tried to take the monitor off and it fell off. I didn't want to have it fall off when I was playing with it. I even put my hand on it and it felt loose as well. I had to return this product to the store. If I had known about the quality of this product I would not have bought it. It was just not worth the money. ,  ,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It does the job, but it's the same thing over and over. I bought this for the extra USB ports, but I don't recommend it. The power and other connectors are not labeled on it and you have to use the supplied "cable tie" (as they say on the box) to attach everything. If you do it right, you can disconnect a power cable, plug in a different cable, turn it back on, and it should work, but that's not a "proof" of anything and it's not fool proof. You also have to take the phone out of your pocket and hold it in your hand to check. I just returned it in hopes that it would work better. It took forever to get the "cab" out of the case. Also, the phone doesn't charge fast, so you may have to charge overnight. It's worth having, but if you're in the market for a new phone, just buy the S8. I'm still using it and it works pretty well for me. The main complaint is that it's a little heavy, but other than that it does the work for what you want it to.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- I purchased two of these and they are a horrible piece of sh-t. My house has a bunch of electronic equipment and these are not meant for the job. The plug is too small for anything they are designed for and I am not confident the connectors will last long, and the cable is so badly made that it almost looks like plastic, it breaks apart and when i try to get it to stay together I am constantly having to cut it apart to make sure the connectors are still attached. It is so terrible that it hurts to use them and there is no way to take them apart to replace them, so I have to keep going back and forth to the store to return them. There is nothing bad that can be said about these, but they do not deserve a 4 star rating.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had one in the past but its hard to change settings that are not on the list. you have to use a tool and then reset all of the values then plug in the other device. also it has a very small usb port and can not be used with usb cables. other than that it is a great little gadget. ive tried several other usb power supplies. __________________  The only real way to do a better job is to do it right the first time. -Bill Gates

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought this thing once and used it to listen to a cd but it didn't play that well. It was pretty loud and was ok to listen at home with some headphones. theres a lot of bass and not much mids but it was loud. i have had this device for a few years and it still works as well as it did the first time i bought it. i guess i could have got a better one since its older. Overall: I have to say this was worth the $30 I paid for it. This thing works great and is very portable. It's got a great sound. I would highly recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There is no way I can get rid of these bad boys. I have used them for years and have found them to be very reliable and useful. The only bad thing I have found with the Vibe Pro is that it does not turn on in the dark.    The Best:  I am very satisfied with the quality and power of the Vibrators I have owned from this website. I've ordered over 30 vibrators and I would never consider another vibrator manufacturer. The Vibe line of sex toys are all quality and work beautifully.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I own 2 of these. They are great at connecting to a computer via usb. The problem I have found is that they do not have an on/off switch. I have to unplug it from the computer everytime I use it. Very poor quality design. The usb port does not fit well in my laptop keyboard. I had to buy a USB adapter and have a mini usb cable for the computer and a mini micro USB cable for my phone. The quality of the case and the cable are not that good. These are going back.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using the blu ray burner for a little over a year and it is still as bad as the day i got it. The disc doesnt burn for days and i keep replacing the burner. i also have another blu ray burner that is much much much better. i have not tried the laser disc burner because i dont like it. Also, i have read some reviews that say if you put it in a different cabinet and leave it unplugged for a few days, it will fix itself. I do that and it does not. i dont know what i am doing wrong. Also...i read some bad reviews about the laser burning. i did this myself and had a bad experience. i had to take it to a store and get it fixed. i think i got some bad lasers. Overall...i like my blu ray and am going to continue to do so, but will never use this again. i am very disappointed in my first buy from this company.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was really happy about the new Apple Watch. I really enjoyed it, but it stopped working a couple weeks ago when my old one was running out of battery. I was able to replace it at my local Radio Shack store but it still won't turn on. I've searched everywhere online to find a replacement and it still has not come from my local store. So i was very disappointed when my new Apple watch came and it's not even an exact replacement. I don't even know if it has the same internal components. It looks like someone had taken my old watch and ripped out all of the hardware and replaced it with a different one. The watch looks good and all, but the performance is terrible. Very disappointed.  Was this review helpful to you?

The product works as advertised, however the charger is flimsy and not robust. It broke at about 100%.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, May 08, 2010  Awesome Product!  by Michael from Florida  Review: This is the first time that I've purchased an iHome product and couldn't be happier. The installation was easy and the installation tool was a godsend. The only complaint I have is that you can't set it to charge at a different voltage. This means that if your battery is dead or disconnected, you cannot charge it. The unit is also not as powerful as advertised. I'm using a 3.7v NiMH battery and the unit only lasts for a few hours when being used for a small light.  If you're looking for a great all-around product, this one is it.  the only thing I don't like is that it has a 5 year warranty, but doesn't state that it comes with a battery! ,  great all-in-one light for the price  was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! This is an awesome remote controller but its a bad choice for an Xbox one. The joystick buttons are not clicky or responsive so you have to press hard and then release. Its just not worth it. You wont get the best games on the Xbox one because of that and you might not have a good experience playing some of the cheaper ones. The only reason i bought this for the Xbox was because i really liked the original controller. The remote is not a bad remote if you just need a controller to play some older games. If you want a quality controller with tons of buttons, this one is the way to go.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a 3rd generation Samsung smart TV on sale for $100 a couple of months ago. I decided to give this a try and when I connected the TV to the tv box it wouldn't turn on. I could not get the remote to enter a command so I called Samsung customer service. After 2 weeks of trying, the TV finally works. The TV has problems connecting to my cable modem, but I live in an apartment and the cable is just a conduit. It's not plugged in to a wall socket. The remote is very basic. It works on a lot of Samsung devices.   One small point I noticed with this TV, as others have mentioned, is that it does not turn off the television when you turn off your computer. It keeps the television running, even when you shut the computer down. I am not sure if this is a defect with the Samsung Smart TV or if this means they are trying to protect their product from hackers. I wish I had read more before buying it.   and the TV was supposed to come with a hard drive but I don't think it came with one and I can't figure out how to find the TV on my home network if it does come with one.  -K.

It took me a month to read the instructions before i figured out how to operate it and use it properly, which took another month or so of using the device and watching a few videos.  The thing was way more than I expected and i was pretty disappointed in it, but i think i will stick with the old Apple TV.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The watch face does not show any battery level at all.

I have the watch on the watch, but the battery level does not change. I am going to replace it anyway, because it is so much better than the one I had. But in the future i will definitely be buying a real battery.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------ The only reason this product is bad is because the product is very cheap. There is nothing wrong with the device it just doesn't work. You can't plug the device into anything at all and it just won't work without the help of a program like Winamp. The problem is that this product doesn't give a quality sound. If you plug this thing into an amp and it gives you some volume but you just can't hear the other speakers you can't use it at all. If it didn't cost as much as it does you'd get a real quality product. This thing is just an annoyance to use. The only positive thing is that the cable isn't long so it can fit into a laptop bag. But if you're a sound guy you probably won't need it and I don't recommend this to sound guys.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: digitalaudio2001

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been looking for an xtc.com to go on my iphone 6 plus for a while and im done with xtr and their other devices. it doesn't do anything.  I hate the "smart phone with a screen on it." It just doesnt have any of the fun of the xtra. It's got a really nice design and really nice graphics, but the device is totally unresponsive. It does nothing. The android OS is extremely buggy, it's slow, it doesn"t work at all, it sucks. I'll never use it again and probably never will. I've been trying to find the android device that does what it claims to do. I bought the iph one, but xtrc is worse. , but x-tic.com is worse, the phone is extremely unresponsive and if you ask for it to turn on, you're forced to get it "fix it" in 2 minutes. it does a crap job at turning on the phone. xtric will just say, 'it was done for you.' xtrix does not even know where it went when you plug in the usb cable to charge it, they don't know what they did wrong. Cant believe xtrac.com even sells this for half off
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had problems with my iphone 4 running on iphones 4/4s, and iphonestreams had no answer.  When I called them they would not give a straight answer. My iphon 4 battery was dead.   They gave me an iphostream iphonedetective, and they gave a battery with the battery holder.  It  didn't work for more than a month after that.  I gave up and   bought a   new   phone.  In addition,   when I came back for my   latest   iPhone   after   a year,  they   called me back to ask what   I wanted, and I told them   about my  phone   and  I told him   that I  want it back.  Then they told me to   send it back and they will send it   back. This   was the best   thing   they have ever done.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________________________________________________  Just bought the PicoPro because it came with 2 batteries. I've used it several times now, but just now had the opportunity to try it out and had no issues. It worked well. I did notice a light flickering, but not a lot. When it was working I had a hard time using the phone as it would constantly boot up to the same white screen. Now I don't have to worry about that and can use my phone more often and more comfortably. I also noticed it was much more powerful than the stock i phone 5c. That was a bonus. It is a very nice and high quality unit. It did not even dim from the lights in the store. I could see the LED at the top of the device with out opening the display or touching it. It works better than my old i phone. It has more battery life than my original one and it uses 1/2 the power of the 5c ____________________________________________________________  by Daniel in New Jersey on 9/27/2015
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I have been using a cheapie USB drive that has a small battery in it for a few months now, and it always dies within a day or two. I read reviews for all the cheapies and I found that if I leave the battery plugged in, then it stays alive. However, if the battery is plugged out and there is no power, then the drive won't turn on! (I know it's probably just my computer but you know what I mean.) So I gave up and bought this drive, hoping it would last a few days but it is dead as a doornail, I can barely get it to turn on. So sad!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These do not work.   I ordered this and received this:  I ordered the e-cigarette to help me quit smoking. I bought the USB stick to be charged from my phone. I've had the USB power up and down several times without any issues. I got it last Friday and got to work on the install. I was able to get it to boot and was able charge it by plugging the USB into my PC. I followed the directions and followed the on-screen instructions. But when it turned on it kept refusing to boot. I thought maybe it was just my computer's fault or I had a bad stick. I unplugged and reinstalled the USB. It booted fine and I was happy with my purchase. However when I plugged it back in it would not boot. It kept shutting down. I tried all the troubleshooting methods on their website, but it kept shutting off. I finally got it to shut down, but I was not able to boot it.  This happened a few days after I bought it. So I had to send the USB back. But this was very disappointing because I paid so much to get the e cig and had to go through this.   of course this is a no-no in the electronic cigar industry. but it is what it is   After reading some of the other reviews and not being able to use it, I ordered my own, the Misfit Lightning. It works great. I use it all the time and it keeps me from needing to use an e cig.   a very low price for a top quality product. you get what you pay for

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------------------- This product works great, i bought one of these for a small home theater system. It is a great little device, i only have to plug it in once a month and it has plenty of power to run all of my audio equipment. If it wasn't for the power supply it would be a 5 star product. I only wish it was a little smaller, so i could put it in the rear of my truck. It looks better in the back of a truck than the front, but it is the same size. You have to take the box off the wall to use it, but otherwise it is simple to use. --------------------------  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tom from Excellent Power Supply for the money I use this to power my sound system, a couple of subs, a DVD player, a laptop, a cell phone, and other electronics. Works perfectly. It's well built, just as I expected. It took a little time to get this to fit correctly, but once I did, it worked right out of the box.  Customer Reviews Rated 5 out-of-5 by Chris from Nice, simple and effective power supply Bought this to charge my laptop while traveling.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive owned this thing for over a year and i was really disappointed with it. first it took a month or two to work after it got wet, then it had a lot of issues. it had no problem with being turned on and off, but after a while it wouldn't charge. i tried two or three different batteries, nothing worked, it was like trying to charge my car battery with an electric tooth brush! then after it came back on it wouldn`t play music or charge. it only went through the songs of the radio show it was connected to. i finally took it in and it had some minor damage, but i did not take it to get it repaired. ive been using it for years and i am very disappointed with the service i got!  Rated 5 out of 5 by DennyM from Excellent, reliable and durable purchase I have used the Soundlink in concert on several occasions, both with the Pono player and my CD player. It has performed flawlessly, reliably and quietly with a single cable. The cable is thick and heavy so I am careful to keep it away from my ears but it is completely removable, so it is no longer a problem if I choose to take it down from time to time. The quality is top notch and I highly recommend the SoundLink to those with a musical imagination.  The sound quality is great. I have the PX200, PX700, and the Sound Link. I don't use the P X 100 with this and I recommend not doing so, because the sound just isn't there, and my other speakers sound better. It's not as clear as my PX 100 or X 200, but if you're looking for better sound, just get another PX100 or PX 700. This one is much better than the sound link I had before. I also have the XM200, and that's good as well. If you want to get the P1, you get more for your money. This will work as well for you if you don't have that much money to spend.  The sound quality, although somewhat on the thin side, is very good and sound really good with my Sony PCM-F1 USB DAC, as my friends who use the XC100, XM100, and XM500 mentioned. The bass is nice and deep and clear. You can tell that you're listening to something with these speakers, but they don't get so
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------ After the purchase of this product, I had to wait 2 weeks before getting a replacement, because the cable that came with it didn't have enough of the power to fully charge my laptop. After trying and failing to find a longer, larger cable, I returned it and bought a longer one from here, which works just fine. It's also worth noting that my laptop is a Windows 7 machine, and the included USB connector doesn't fit into my laptop at all, so I bought another one that does. If you're looking for a power supply that has both USB-A and USB-C connectivity, this would be a good choice. I'm not happy with the build quality, though. It took me several days to figure out that the connection to my laptop's motherboard, and therefore its USB connector, was a little loose, so that my cable was actually pulling the cable itself off the computer, and causing the power supply to stop working. It wasn't until I was running a stress test on my laptop and found that I had no power, that I realized I was the one at fault. It doesn't take much of a struggle to keep the power supplied from this unit from completely turning off. I really wish that Asus would make it easier to install power supplies than this one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for about 2 years. ive always had issues with my headphones, but it gets worse everytime.   It's really not worth the money and its pretty much useless now.   My second headphone, I must say that i'm very happy with this purchase. This is the second i have bought the Sennheiser HD650 and i love both of them. I have a friend who has this product and he said that his Sennon is the one that is the best for him. I love the quality and sound of these headphones, especially the bass. The sound is perfect with my iMac.  What can I say? I have only been using these headphones for about 5 weeks now and i am very happy so far. The comfort is great, the sound quality is very good and they are easy to set up. I am using a pair of blue tooth headphones, and they have not made any sound difference over my iMic. .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------ I got this for the first time about a month ago. I was able to install it and it works for about 2 hours. When I was trying to go to sleep at night, it wouldn't wake me up because it was always on. I turned it off and back on and I got to sleep. I went out to a night club last night and it was on all night. I finally had to turn it off because it woke me up at least 3 times. After I went to bed, it woke up the next morning. It is a little pricey but for how good it is, I was not happy.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It doesn't come with a charger. I got the AC adapter in an effort to use it with my laptop, but I could not make it to work.  The AC adapter plugs right into my laptop's USB port, but it never has power when plugged into my phone. It seems to be a real problem with this device. It looks like someone didn't really care that the phone could be used in this way.    My only advice is to buy one if you can find it, or buy a more powerful charger. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem with this device is that it works ok, and most of the time it does exactly what you need it to. But there are some times that it does not work well at all, or at least the battery will not hold a charge. The first time I put it on the charge indicator was on the green and the battery was nearly flat. I then went to do my normal job and while charging the battery indicator was red. The second time the charge was still red, but it worked on the last part of my task. I had to power the device off and on many times while doing my normal jobs just to see if it would work or not. I gave up trying to use it while I did my normal work, and gave up on the battery.   A few weeks later I was watching tv and the light was on and the red indicator was blue. I tried to power on the phone, and it was dead. I went to try and get a phone call, but the light stayed on the blue and the phone battery was flat.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this device since 2007 and it has been in continuous use, both at home and at work. When the battery has been running, it has never worked. I've called numerous times, but it takes about 4 days for them to actually send me the replacement battery. I know it sounds a bit extreme, but this device has cost me over $600 since I bought it, so I don't feel I need to keep waiting. I have gone through about 6 different batteries before I finally decided that the only way to save money is to sell it. I'm sure I will buy something else in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It took me a few hours to figure out the issue with my Samsung Galaxy S3.   After reading a review by someone who said that they had the same problem, I decided to go out and purchase a Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  While I am sure that the Samsung Galaxy Notes is no better than the Galaxy S III, it took me about the same amount of time to solve this problem.  It's annoying that Samsung would let someone down and make it harder for people to get a new one!

It lasts an entire year but the battery will eventually give out.  I had a battery in the first one I received that failed, but that was not the problem with this one, it failed because of some horrible assembly instructions. This one's a lot easier to put together than the first I have. , the batteries have a little gap in the case, not noticeable once you open it, it has a very simple set up, you get one battery, one cable and two screws to attach to the back of the case.  a quick way to tell which battery the battery in your iPhone is is by looking at the label and the battery. The label on mine says 4.8v 3a, i.e. the 4v version and the 3a one is an OEM replacement.  i.e, it was not factory made. _____________________________________________  All three batteries are great batteries, the only one I do not really like is the 5a for it's not as big a battery as i think it is and it runs the phone quite a bit cooler than the others. The other two are just as
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my wife and she loves it and it works great, however there is a small problem that comes with the unit, once the battery has been used the unit will not turn off or turn on.   This will cause it to run until it is plugged in again or until you press a button on the unit and it turns off.  When this happens it is very inconvenient to have to wait a half hour to try to find a charging cable again. The unit is not very user friendly for a first purchase.

Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from I'm having problems with this phone I was able to download the firmware update from their website, and this is how the phone came with the update. As soon as I got it, I decided to upgrade the software version to the latest firmware update (which I didn't) and had problems with it. My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. The software is still the S7 software, but with no way to restore the firmware. I have had this phone since July 2016. As far as battery life, this phone has been pretty amazing, so far, and the battery life is not something I'm going to complain about. When this phone was first released, it didn't have an expandable memory. It was kind of weird. I've had it about a month and have had about a dozen apps downloaded from the Play Store, and not only do they not do what they're supposed to do, they crash the phone. The most recent app I had, which is a game, crashes the phone and crashes the battery. I'm trying to find an app that actually has a positive effect on the battery, and don't think I've found anything. I will say that the battery is better than the Note 7 I have. It has lasted me about two weeks now. So far, I have only had it one day. There are still so many things to be changed.  in general, if you're looking for the best of the best phone, you're in the wrong place
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I recently bought the G3G-R3-LN4 for the express purpose of trying out the new Garmin devices. I am now going to have to go back to the old "good old" Iphone. No, I don't miss having my phone on me when biking. I love the iPhone. I don´t miss the GPS on my bike. There are so many better GPS devices out there to choose from. I really don´ll miss the Garmin when i am not biking. The Garmin just wasn´t that good, not when compared to my old iPhone. Rated 5 out of 5 by David from Great GPS device This is an amazing GPS device. This is the first and only GPS device I have owned. I purchased it because I had to go hiking in the hills. The location I had was a small hill at the top of a canyon. It was well lit. I used the "Live" feature to know the position of the vehicle, and I was able to follow the car down the hill. It also gave me directions to the bottom of the hill and directions to my car. The speedometer was great and the battery life was great. It is easy to use. I found that I can keep the unit on for hours and it continues to track without me having to take off the watch and start it back up again. I also purchased the bluetooth adapter which is very useful to get my phone in the car. I use the GPS to plan my hikes and will definitely purchase more.  Rated 4 out of   by Bill from GPS is awesome, but battery life can be limited I just received this GPS and I've been using it for about a month. The battery life is great, but sometimes the GPS is slow and unreliable (or it goes offline). I am still waiting for my next one so I can add some more data to the app and see if this will help me find my way around the trails. I'm not sure if the GPS could do that or not (I don't have the most current model). The GPS is definitely worth the price, I just wish there were more battery options out there (or more options to use with my phone!).  I'm very pleased with the new bluetooth gps, it is very stable on my GS35/GPS bike computer and the data is good. I will update with my results. It doesn't work very well in my car with the nav
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _______________________________________________________________________________ My first purchase from Amazon and it was worth every penny. The unit arrived to me in perfect condition and I have to admit that I was not expecting it to be so good. I have a Dell E7400 that I have been using since 2010 and this computer does exactly the same thing but for $300 less. Now that I am out of work I plan on buying a computer from Amazon again. It will have to last me a long time. I am sure there are other reviews that will make more money but I did not want a computer for this price and this unit is fantastic. I like how the system boots up so fast. I also like how I can use this computer from my phone with an adapter, if you do not have a computer. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I have two laptops which I use for work and I just got this computer. It does work just fine but it has some problems with it. First it is very hard to boot up for the first time and secondly the touch pad is a bit weird because it has no scrolling. I had to buy the touchpad adapter because I have the wireless mouse and I thought it might work better with this computer and I was wrong. Also I had a problem with the battery charging and I had the charger at my house but the problem was the laptop did not seem to be charging with the usb adapter because it charged the battery too fast and when it was done charging it did not go to full and the USB charger did not even seem to charge it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is horrible. I am no stranger to the old school style keyboards and this does not match up at all. No space bar, and no back space. It would be great if there was a way to add the space bar and a backspace, but you can't do that. I purchased this as a replacement for my old keyboard, and it was a complete failure. I spent more money on an actual keyboard instead of purchasing a cheap keyboard with no features, and now I have a useless device I'm going to throw away.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my iphone 3g since it was released and it is amazing. but i use it less than 5 hours a day because it keeps getting weak so i had to buy a new iphono and iphont. i was using a macbook pro 2 when i got it. so ill be using it less and less as it gets older. it isnt like i use mine more then the macbook. i just use it for watching youtube, music and tv. its very fast and its very loud but if you can buy a dedicated headset or earphones then its perfect. if you buy this iphoner, do so with the mindset of buying it to make you feel like you are in the world of 90's music. i have listened to all music at home and when i'm on the bus, in the classroom or traveling. it really is a great iphon. i think it will last for my whole life. i did a youtube test on my ipod at the bus stop, it had no problems streaming and the sound is amazing but i cant say the same for the audio quality when im on the plane with a crappy internet connection. overall, i would buy it again and maybe for my ipt.

It's a nice little device! It works great. It's small enough to not take up too much room on my desk, but it's solid enough to be used. I really like the USB-C charging capabilities as well.    The only problem I had with this device was the USB cable. The power cable was very short. It only worked for about 10 minutes of charging before it started to bend. I tried to fix it by re-wrapping the USB cord in electrical tape. I don't think that solved the problem. I had to use a different type of USB cable to charge the phone again. I also had to charge it with my computer via the USB bus, and I am not sure if I did that correctly. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******************* I have an LG L series, it has the latest smart tv interface. I really wanted to play games on it. I got my new samsung smart tv (firmware 2.0.7). I downloaded a program called 'free tv video apps' and installed it. This is when I found out that the samsung tv app is only for android 3.1, and this tv isn't android 3, it's android 2.1. I was so angry that I called Samsung tech support and I told them that the tv interface is a complete piece of shit. They said that this is normal for tv interfaces. Then I bought a tv from another brand that was android 2, it is way better than this tv. So i guess it was a good move.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!   I bought these to replace my old laptop computer and was very pleased at the speed and efficiency of them. However, i was a little disappointed that they only had 4 usb ports so only 2 of them could power my computer. The 3rd port would only work for charging.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    1. It took almost 2 weeks to get this thing working with my car stereo and the car is a 2001 Mazda 3. It's a good car, but the volume of sound coming from it's stereo is really not loud enough to get good sound from it. It only got to 5 W's. The speaker is way out there and even with the sound cancelling and high boost, the volume was still way loud. I think this could do with being a little louder. Also, the control knob is not very well designed and the way the buttons are arranged made it hard to use with my long fingered hand. I've moved to a different brand with better controls.   2. This device is way overpriced. I have heard better sound and it would be much more effective to spend the extra money on a more durable, professional piece of gear.   a little disappointed in this piece of kit, it worked perfectly for me but I wish the product were slightly more robust.

Rated 4 out of 5 by josef from Great product, some bad reviews I bought this as a replacement for a previous Apple laptop. It is a very good product, but I wish there were a few more bad reviews. The keyboard is terrible, I would much rather have something like this for my laptop but the bad keyboard is not acceptable for the price. The screen is very good and the mouse is very accurate. I would have given it 5 stars if the keyboard wasn't terrible. 's review: I bought my 15" iMac with this for a replacement, so that I would get the iMac Pro if the i5 model is not available. First off, I can't really say the i3 is better than the i7, but it's a much smaller difference that I can see. The one bad thing is the keyboard, the keys are really mushy. I've only used it for a few hours so far, but so far it's been very slow for a machine this size. I do like the fact that you can run two monitors at the same time. Also, I'm wondering if they are compatible with the USB 3 port, so if you plan on using it with an external hard drive and a USB 3.0 device, there's no way to get this to work. Overall, I really like this machine. : I just bought a 15" 2017 Macbook Pro from B&H Photo, and I'm very happy with it. I love the sleek design, the battery life is great and the performance is great. The only thing I don't like about it is the size and weight. It's a little too big and bulky to carry around all the time and when you do carry it around, you have to use the keyboard quite a bit to hit all of the buttons. Also when I travel a lot and use the laptop in my bag, it gets very hot.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________________  Bought this for my daughter because her old one worked well. No buttons, it was all knobs and buttons. It took a few tries to figure it out, and then once I got it to work I was surprised how good it worked! It was so easy to use and I could have just thrown it away!!   Buttons are a big minus for me, the big button on the bottom that controls the speaker and power was impossible to use for anything more than moving the slider up and down. It would just spin and the slider wouldn't move. If they only would've put the button on a separate keypad like all the other phones have, that'd have been perfect!

There is no audio output and the video output can be turned on only by turning off the power. The unit is very quiet so it's nice. The only cons I would mention is that the unit is so compact that it can be hard to find a place to mount it. I like that it is small and I'm glad I found this unit.  The only con I would have with this product is that there is no Audio Out and you would need to get an external device to receive the audio from your TV/DVD Player.    WasThis Review Helpful or Helpful? Yes No Wednesday, October 03, 2012   by Christopher from Washington DC  Works well and good price!  the only problem is that it does not have a mini-jack for the audio. I have to use a mini jack to the TV/CD Player. Also, it takes up very little space in the wall. I wish there was more space in there. I don't use the TV much as I use my computer more. It is pretty good for what it is.  "good product"  Would you recommend this to a friend? Yes  Do you have a comment for this product? Yes | No  Thanks
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The old electronic device worked fine for several years. The battery had several issues with the battery, one of which was the battery could last only an hour before the display stopped working. After I sent it back, I got a new one and it still worked just fine. I don't really understand the big difference between the new and old ones. I thought the device had been discontinued when I first got it and it worked fine until the battery died about a year later. Since then, it has worked fine but my battery life is only half what it was.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i bought this device for my children. i was surprised at how small it is. it does not fit inside a pocket, and i have to take it out when i am walking. i had to re-fit my cell phone into a smaller case so i could hold it. the only thing that worked well was the light, which was on in the dark. i did find the remote to be very buggy with the camera and sound.  Other than that, it was very annoying that the camera could not find my house. Also, when we needed to use the camera for a picture, it took forever to get it set to the right time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I love my new iMac and was really looking forward to the new bluetooth speaker, but when I connected it to my phone the bluetooth was not working. So I had to put it in the computer and use the speaker as it was. No sound, no nothing. So after about 5 hours of frustration I went back to the store and the same thing happened again with my phone. So then I had my mom in the store try both phones and both were connected without sound and it was only working for one of the phones. So now I'm stuck with the bluetone that I don't need.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------------------- I have had this for only a few days. It has worked okay. But there is a big problem with the screen. If you have an apple ipod with a retina screen, this works fine. But the ipod touch doesn't work with this. This is an older model ipod. The screen seems to be off in the back. The glass is cracked. This thing is worthless! It is more than likely to be discontinued in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This little unit has issues, 1 of them is a power cut when you start it up with the unit plugged into the wall. 2nd issue is, you must turn the unit off before you can plug the phone in. 3rd issue is the volume. This unit can only play sound from one source. No way to adjust the volume of the other sources. It would be nice if I can use it with other phones, not just my own.   Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a very bad idea. Not only does it take up a ton of space, but it is also very unreliable. The thing is extremely hard to plug in, because the contacts are very close together. I put a rubber band around the back, but that only lasts for about 15 seconds. I have to re-do it every time. I also had to change the batteries several times. This is a huge hassle. When you use the device, it makes noise. It sounds like a car alarm, but only when you are not using the device. I had no problem turning it on, and it is extremely loud. But the vibration doesn't last as long as you would think. I got it for a party, and once I started playing, it became very difficult to stop playing. It is like my guitar is being tortured. If it were a little bit smaller, it would be ok. The battery life isn't long, but at least the device can play. I could have gotten a more reliable device, but if this is all I need, I am not going to go to the trouble of making it better. I was hoping for something that would play with my music, and not interrupt me. So it doesn't have a huge problem with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device itself was not bad at all. It worked very well and the battery lasted a very long time. The problem I had with it is the fact that it will not turn off on its own. I had to press the power button a bunch of times and the screen would show "Disconnected" and then "Pending Connect" which then shows you what the power supply would do. I could see my computer going crazy with the constant connection. When it was plugged in, it was perfectly functional. I couldn't believe that the device just shuts off and doesn't even turn itself back on. The manufacturer should put this on the list of faults on the box. It makes the device useless. I gave it two stars because the screen wasn't very bright.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this iphone since last year and i have to say ive found it has very poor battery life. and i bought a new one in the store, no big deal, but it still gets less than 10 hours on a full charge, its not the batteries but the phone itself. i mean for the most part the phone is ok it's just that when i get in the car i cant get it to turn on because it turns off and on, when i put it to sleep its ok but when i turn it on it doesnt have any battery, i mean i need that screen and it gets very hot in my car.   I got a couple of new ones this week. But this one just wont do. I will keep a new battery in my truck and my old one in my house but I dont know if its just the new one or the fact that the one i got a week ago still has the issue.  I can't imagine it getting any better. -Jared  4.0 out of 5 stars I have had this phone for a few years now. Its been the best phone I have ever owned. It was the best way to receive and send emails for me. The fact that I could receive and use my i-phone from my computer is great as well. I could keep my i phone plugged in with the usb cable and use it on my computer and my laptop to send messages to everyone and do web surfing for me (its hard for me to read web pages without a laptop) I use it for everything now. It has been my favorite phone for so many years and I know I wont be buying a new phone anytime soon. I can't believe I am giving this phone 3 stars. I wish I had kept it longer. ,  "Great Phone - but very buggy" -M.D.  The LG G4 is a great phone, it has excellent cameras and is very comfortable to hold and use. However, I believe that the software is not yet ready to release and will likely be a buggy mess for many months. One of my main issues is the issue where the camera will sometimes not connect or only show a black and white image. On a recent trip I used my i5 s5 and was able to capture 4 photos but only 3 were able to upload to the cloud. This is just another example of where the software needs to be polished and perfected to release as an official software.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     Worst electronic device ever. I love my phone but this is an insult to my intelligence. I'm glad I bought another one but I'll never trust Apple again. I have spent my money on this garbage.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Friday, January 20, 2016  by Jeff from San Diego CA USA  Review: Very good phone. I would like a 3G version but that will be more expensive and not as good.  in order to support new products Apple would have to add features they don't need.   One of the things that makes a phone "good" is the way you use it, so I'm not a big fan of the buttons on the phone, but I can't say I'm a big Apple fan.   the thing I would change most is the camera. The pictures are not that great. The images are a little grainy. I use a Nikon DSLR for a professional type of photography.  and it's nice having a backup battery for those rare times the phone does not last long. .  of course, I don't use it every day. ,  This is not a replacement for a real camera. But if you have a really good camera that you just use to take pictures for fun and don't do any photo editing, this is the perfect phone.   It's not a phone that you'll carry with you everywhere.   A lot of the time it gets used for reading and looking at things online or videos and you might be on a business trip and want to take photos and videos at the same time and not have to carry it. And then when you're at home you use the GPS to go to a store, you take the pictures, you have the GPS app to record your trip and then you can share them with the world.  . It's great. And a nice bonus is that it's water and dust proof!  Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Great if you want a decent little device but I found it too flimsy for its size and weight.

Yes No Tuesday, April 20, 2011  This is the bomb  by A Customer from Sacramento CA USA  Pros: Does what it says.  that little device is a must have to have if you use it to shoot film. . ,  Excellent product. :D  Review by A Customer:  Works great. Easy to use and works perfectly for the price. I used it to capture action and stills. I did use it for a while before a replacement was delivered. I am very happy with the purchase. Thank you so much for your assistance and product. Great product for the money  The product is great but the shipping was a bit expensive. My package arrived at my door and the packaging was damaged when it was opened.  have you tried the customer service at B & H.  of the USA or at another site. they do not get a reply when you ask about the status. they seem to get very rude when you email them, I'm not sure if it's a problem with them or B&H. The only good thing about the product is that it's cheap but the service was so bad I was reluctant to buy this product again. Was this Review helpful to you a) yes  B&H has had a good track record over the years. Their return policy is great for those who have an issue with a return. However, I had an issue and they refunded my money (minus a $5 fee) but did not send me another one. Very disappointing as I am a satisfied customer and will only use B& H to buy my film and gear.  the product does what it claims it will do. is a great purchase  Cons: None  i used it with a camera that has a smaller lens, the lens was small compared to the other lenses on the camera. but the small lens made it hard to get a nice focus on my camera. I bought the 35mm f1.8 instead. It is a little bit wider and more open. I will have to get it used for some time before deciding. The lenses on my other cameras have much better
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had this for a couple of days and it would not work with the bluetooth on my cell phone, even after clearing the bluetack and it had been sitting on my desk all night. I emailed support and the tech said that they would look into it and send me a replacement, that is not what they did. The replacement was a defective, the bluestack was damaged and I had to return it to the store. I will not be purchasing this device again.  Good for a weekend use:  I bought this with my new tablet so I could get work done when I'm on the road. The tablet is very good. I've played with it for several hours and have been doing some reading, watching a bit of Youtube, taking photos. Overall it is great for the price and I have no complaints.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! I bought this to charge a smart phone at work when I couldnt afford a battery charger. Ive been using it for almost a week now and my phone is getting hot when its near the wall. If you are like me, and dont have a wall outlet at home, this may not be a good choice. Also, the phone charger that comes with it isnt the best and takes a long time to charge the phone. I bought a slightly better one at walmart for $5.00 and it charged the phone in no time and has a built in battery so the phone is not dead. The charger isnt a wall plug though and takes up a lot of space. I do recommend getting the $5 charger and keep a cheap wall plug for a wall socket.

As with all monitors, its always important to understand what you are using. This monitor is not for use with a normal computer. For example if you have an ipad, its great for using it as a tablet but it will only display 1 or 2 colors on the screen.   (Yes i tried turning it off and on multiple times, but the screen would change back and forth)   You must be able to see the screen clearly, with your eyes, to use it. With the colors being so bright, its almost hard to see everything on the monitor, or even the text.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a cheap android phone, the screen is very bad and is covered by scratches all over it. I bought an sd card and then after getting it installed on my computer, the same problem as the screen was again there. I have not taken it apart but it looks like the screen may have been made with the metal casing on the top replaced with plastic with the backing of a piece of cardboard glued on. It is a very bad investment.  Pros: Looks like a good idea  Cons: Bad screen, plastic casing of screen not metal.  (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)  From Anonymous of Toronto, Canada on 12/1/2014. I received my phone about 10 days ago and so far I am happy with the price.

I have a small family so I'm always in the house. I use them for watching tv, reading the newspaper, watching a video game, and reading.    I bought some of the glass mouthpieces and loved them. The taste was right up there with Smokys for price. I also ordered a glass adapter to get the mouthpiece to go down all the way, which was very convenient.   Just ordered some new Smoky Quartz mouthpieces. They come in a few flavors and I am sure they will be just as good. I am a huge fan.  a real winner at a great price!  in my experience Smok's flavor is just as they say, "the best taste"  Not all Smok is created equal.  you will get more juice out of a Smokie than you will from another brand. ,but Smok has its' strengths and weaknesses.  The taste will come with use. I will buy more in the future.  in general, I am not a fan of glass, the mouth piece is

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very good device but the wireless reception is very bad on the outside of the house. It is very difficult to even have a conversation with someone using it. It also has issues with some apps and games that need the data to function. I can have a call on my phone but cannot make the call as the data needs to be loaded and the signal will be lost. This should be a no cost for my home but for what is available now it is not worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------------------- I had this for three years, and was happy with it. Then, I got it replaced. Not because of any problems, just that I was lazy and not reading the manual. I never did, but thought, "Hey, this is a good idea, I'll fix it myself." So, I bought a new one off ebay and this one just died. So, if you ever want one for cheap, just buy a new model from Amazon or eBay. And remember to read the user's manual, that is essential to make sure you know what you're doing. I'm sure they were well-written, just not read in three years.

The controls are simple, but they're all really handy.  -One thing I wish I could change is that the microphone works better than I think it should.

Thanks! :)  You have been recommended.  with very good reviews...  :))  My wife has been trying to find this kind of product for a long time and she was impressed with the speed, packaging, and service. She is very happy with it and she is getting a lot more work out of it.    So far she has found it very helpful with her MS.   the only drawback is that sometimes when she puts the headset on she feels like she is missing something. I think if she went out into the woods for 15 minutes the way that I did with the headset with the cord going into the bag and out of the bag. Maybe that is the cause of the problem. .  of the only downside is that when she goes outside and puts it on her head she feels really weird. I wonder if that is just a placebo effect. That is my best guess as to why the only thing I can think of is that something about the design or the design is not exactly what I was looking for when I bought the headset.     Other than that I am very happy and would recommend it to anyone who has a MS.  I will update the review if there is anything that I learn about it.  . of the most annoying thing was that the ear cups would not stay in my ears. I was able to see how they would go in my ear and I pulled them out and put them on but they would not sit in my head.   of the next problem was that there are two cables and they had to be seperate. Of course if one cable went in the bag then I have to put that in the headset bag. This is a huge annoyance because I don't need the headset to be in a bag so

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had a Sony Vaio for 5+ years now and it has worked perfect. I had it upgraded to a new one last year. Then this year my cable and my tv stopped working. I called Sony customer service and they told me that I should have bought the new model for more money than the original one and that I could return the new one.  When I contacted Sony customer support they informed me that they would be sending a warranty replacement for free. They did. I got a new tv and cable at no charge to me. I will buy Sony again!  I had a similar issue with Apple TV. I tried every Apple store to find one that would fix it for me. After a couple of calls I ended up getting my Apple tv fixed at a local Apple store for about $150 which is far less than Sony. They offered me free accessories for the TV so that was a bonus. It still works fine and I have had no issues with it since I received it. I am just not willing to pay so much for a great product when there is a far better one for much less money that is available at a nearby store. Sony gets a bad rap but this is the best of the best in the business. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone4s: my wife bought this as a backup for her new phone. We were happy with it but after about 2 weeks she told me she wanted a different phone. So I purchased another. I was surprised that this phone has an average battery life. I have been using it about 5 months and its still at 70% and it seems that it is getting low at the beginning of the day and at the end of the work day. I am a retired teacher with a large group and she is always trying to hold my attention. I would like the phone with a better speaker and I would be much happier if I could download more files to her phone. The phone has the phone number on it but I need to give the numbers to another person. It has all of the information that is needed for her to buy some other phone. I don't have any problems with it. It will keep my wife going through the day. But my kids have complained about it, that it gets really loud at night when they are asleep. I think my kids will be annoyed that my wife can call them while I am sleeping. I also think this is a great phone for my business. I use it with my team of 2. I want this to be their primary device for their computer and their cell phone. With the number on the back of the phone I have them call me with an issue as opposed to having to take it off the phone and look at it. I believe they will also find the need to have it in their car. I really wish that the new phone that is going to come out this month could have the battery life I have got with the old one.

Please go to a local Radio Shack or buy a new one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these monitors as they look really nice and come with 3 HDMI ports. However, I'm so disappointed. I tried to connect the monitor to my Samsung TV with an adapter (which was useless because the TV only accepts HDMI1) and it just didn't work. I was able to connect it to my PC monitor using the HDMI port and I didn't have to use a converter. The monitor itself looks good, but the monitor is horrible! It's black, it has an extremely narrow viewing angle and it has extremely poor sound quality. I'm really disappointed that the manufacturer didn't just sell the same monitor with the adapter and included the adapter cable, just to save me some money. It's a $500 monitor that's worth $500. This was a big mistake for them, because it's an unimpressive monitor.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dan from Great picture and sound quality The quality is great for a monitor with a wide screen. The picture looks great even though its a bit washed out. It has a good set of picture settings, and you can adjust it to your liking. The sound quality is excellent, although I did not notice any sound leaks in the movie. .  The image is crisp, and there is good contrast and colour accuracy. The speakers are quite good, and they can make you feel like you are inside the movie itself. The screen brightness is adjustable, and the picture quality is very good. My only complaints are that it has a short battery life, and it doesn't look as good when you have bright, colourful images, such as when you are watching a picture in a theatre. The only negative thing that I could say about it is that I really wish that I had bought an S-video input instead of VGA, to connect to my old Sega Genesis. But otherwise I would recommend this monitor, as it has very good image and sound, and is very bright, and provides good picture quality.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: *****************  This is a great item for the price. I had an old computer (I have an old Lenovo that still works with a Pentium 2, and this unit works well with it) but had to have a new hard drive for the computer and this is just fine. It's not as fast as a HDD, but it does the job. If you're just getting the unit, I don't think you'd really notice the speed. I also like how it comes with 2 USB ports and 4 USB ports.  I'm hoping I can get the 4 port USB ports to be a separate port for each USB port instead of it being one USB port in one port.   Read more.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using an iphone 5s for a while, its great i can view the screen and text while on my desktop with my mouse and keyboard, the only thing bad about it is that when it comes to sound it has poor sound, and you have to be very close to the phone in order to hear it, if the sound was decent it would be perfect but thats how it is at the moment. The only good thing about it are the different ways to connect to a bluetooth device, there are different ways of playing music, but its all limited to Apple devices, its not as good as having a usb port and bluetooth 2.0, i can connect my iphones and play music over bluetooth, and if i want to play music through bluetooth i can use an external bluetooth speaker but the sound quality is terrible the phone is also not waterproof and you cant wash it because it wont fit in the washing machine i was thinking about buying an iconia wireless bluetooth headset but there isnt one with my phone so i guess i have to use my iPhone 5s and use it as a bluetone and bluetop, this phone is great for the price but for sound quality its not that good.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Excellent value! My first iPhone and I love it! I have used this for many years.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive tried the watch for 5-6 hours on 3 different devices(phone, ipad and ipod touch). the only reason i gave it two stars is because of the lack of wireless connection. my ipod doesn't have wireless, nor does my phone, so i had to go to my apartment and charge it. it works just fine with the ipod, but wi-fi will be a major improvement. i was able to see the time, count minutes, set alarms and keep track of a to-do list on the phone, but couldn't do the same on the ipad or ipod. i'm not sure why they didn't come up with a device that's simple enough that everyone can use it, but the problem with the watch is that you can't even tell the time. i can't see it to start a timer or change the battery level, and even though you can use the calendar, i don't know how to change the days of the week, or even the month. this is a waste of money if you use it for anything other than watching time. also, the bluetooth is not good. i went to a bar and asked the bartender if i could use my watch, and he asked me what it was, to which i said "it's a smart watch" he then told me he had to buy a bluetooth headset. i don,t even know what a blu-etooth headset is and i have tried to explain the difference between bluetooth and wireless, and the difference in technology to people at least once. i also can't use the watch in public because the blu-breeze requires you to bring your own phone, which is not my style. the only good thing is the watch has a good battery life, but if you buy this watch, get a blu blu-air headset and make sure your phone has bluetooth. i'd buy another if i didn't already.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this little guy for about 1 year now and its broken and its not because of this product its from a different brand. my son is only 4 but he's got this thing and its almost broken. i called to get the warranty and they said if i buy another ezberry i can get it replaced for free but i dont think thats the case cause the only part of this thing is that tiny keyboard which isnt even the main issue. i am now going to have to buy another one cause im tired of having this broken little toy for a year now. i also bought this from amazon and got a replacement the same day and it worked for like a week

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for two weeks now, and while it's pretty cool, it has problems.  I got this as part of my gift for the new owners of my laptop. It was advertised as having a 10 hour battery life, and i was expecting something like a moto z2. After about two weeks, it gets very hot when idling and then when the screen is off. I'm hoping my battery will last me a bit longer since it is very expensive. i was so excited when i got it, but now, im not so sure.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! This is an electronic device! Not even close to a true audio device and the bass response is not accurate...I will probably go back to my $200 sound bar. The sound is all distorted and the image is very small, especially the center channel where you hear the bass (it is very very strong in the center). I will return it and get something better.  What is this?  Great speaker! Very low price. Very high quality sound. My wife and I have tried many other stereo speakers and this one is by far the best!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would say that this is the most frustrating product I've ever purchased. The phone is very unreliable and very prone to crashing. When I receive the phone, the buttons and buttons are all covered in dust, and the screen appears to be dead and the display appears as if it is black and has no picture. The first time I opened it up the power button was burned through and would not turn on. I took it to the local store to have it fixed, but it would not work. I had to buy the new charger, and when I used it to charge the battery on my computer, it would get extremely hot and the computer would not boot. I eventually had to return the product. I've tried all kinds of new and different types of batteries and they all work fine. It is so frustrating to have a product that is so unreliable. I'm going to be back to Wal-Mart and Amazon to purchase a new one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used a hifi sub in the past, but the sub's were just plain bad. i really dislike the fact that there is no back button on this one, you have to press the volume down button to power off, which doesnt seem like that big of a deal to me, i mean i could always turn it off without having to press anything, but having to push the volume button to turn it on is just plain annoying. and the thing is really light, but im not sure if that's a good or bad thing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this camera about a month ago, and I am very disappointed in the quality and the size of the camera, it is so big and bulky! I think it has to do with the fact that I live in a very humid area and it is really difficult for the battery to keep up with the amount of video I am recording. The only thing I liked about it was that it came with a case for my phone. I use the zoom function but it is very difficult to get a good picture because of the huge camera. I'm going to wait till the time comes where I can just record on my phone and not have to worry about my phone getting ruined by the phone.

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, February 17, 2011  by Chris from Washington DC USA  Pros: Great device to use with my iPhone  Cons: None  Review: This is a great product, it comes with a battery and charger and works perfectly. The only con I can think of is that if your iPhone is too old, the battery is not very good.  My other reviews here on the Apple site seem to support this. If your iPhone 5 or older, I would recommend waiting a few weeks and getting a new battery. I also think the charging is slow.  in the meantime, get a micro usb adapter and you can charge your iPhone using this.  and don't use it with the original case or it will not work with any bluetooth headphones.  (my wife has the 5s and this works with her iPod touch but it is not loud enough for her iPod so she had to get a new one)  Also, my iPhone 4s also has a weak battery, but it doesn't last very long so I had to purchase a new cell phone which worked fine. ,  This is a simple product that works very well and is very easy to use.  a little pricey, but for the functionality it provides I would say the price is right.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The monitor worked fine till one day it quit working. I called customer support and they said it is not covered under warranty. I had to send it back.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works as advertised The monitor does a great job of displaying the brightness of the colors on the screen and the clarity of text. I use this for daily work and it does a good job at it. If you like a black or dark background I would go for the version with an additional input. Overall great for what it does  Review of 5350W Monitor:  I have a Dell monitor with a 5760x1080 resolution. When I upgraded to a 60Hz monitor this monitor is perfect. I also have the Acer XR240 with the 60Hz, and I can't be happier with the picture. It's a great buy for the money, I can run a full-screen movie without tearing. .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This little device is a pain to use, it takes me an eternity to get anything done. Its great for taking pictures, it works fine but it's way too small to carry a large piece of equipment around all day.  It works great, but too small:  Very good camera, however, too small. Very disappointed  Not great:  I was expecting a much better camera for the money. For starters, it has a tiny button that doesn't work at all. The camera is only as good as its memory. It was good enough for me for a couple of shots, but the image was fuzzy and blurry after a few minutes of shooting. It took a few hours to clean up after it died on me. ,  it's really good, but not ideal  ,,,,  this little guy does it all.  a MUST for ANY camera/photographer.  the only problem I have with the camera is the lens cap keeps falling off. this is a pretty big deal with a camera this small  This is a great little camera, and it can shoot pretty good quality photos. The downside is that it only takes 1.4 mm film, which I'm still working on improving.  in terms of its functionality and quality, it is great  Just as advertised  Great for travel and photo sessions  I've tried to get the camera to do everything I want it to do but it can't keep up.  it is a really small and the button on the side of the camera has to be pressed all the way down in order to operate. I will continue to use it but I need to get a small card for the battery so I can make sure that it lasts me until I get back home.  an expensive toy  ,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******************* - The speaker is not that great, it is too quiet, and the volume on this thing is so low, and it's so tiny I can't even hear myself think! - I can hear things when my phone is at a certain volume, but not with this thing. - I think the batteries are bad. They never last. - For my purposes, I only ever play with my tv in "standby" mode, but my battery would die in like a day with the tv in that mode, and I'm running with my laptop in the back seat while I'm driving (don't drive on the highway) so it takes a while to charge. - The battery life for the wifi dongle is pretty bad. *********************  Noise and sound quality:  The dongl is just as loud as the dongles in other phones, and that's all that matters in this day and age when noise pollution is so bad. The only issue is that the sound quality is really low. The stereo speakers are not quite as loud, and they can get quite distorted.  I was hoping that the 2 meg battery would be enough, but it doesn't, so I have to have a USB battery to keep it plugged in. There's no option on the dongs to remove the dsl battery, so the docks will need to be replaced as well. The phone is a bit loud at full volume, and then when it's on a low volume it still gets a bit tinny. The audio quality is about the same as the moto x. If you're not using a phone that has a decent speaker, this is probably not for you, and you may have to buy a separate speaker, just to get around that.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device itself is pretty good. I bought the first generation and it died about 6 months after i got it. So i got the second generation and its even better than the first one. The only reason i give it a 5 star rating is because of the usb connector that only works with windows. If you use linux you're going to have a bad time. It's like trying to plug a phone into a computer.   PROS:  - USB connection is super easy to connect.  I just used a standard usb to e-ink connector.  to the e-book reader. - Charging is fast, about 6 hours of e-texting, and 30 hours of normal use. I like it that it doesn't die after 2 hours of battery depletion.     CONS: , not working in Linux.  the charger is only for windows.  a bad usb connector.  's   - Overall, this is a very good electronic device. It works good, it is fast and it has good features.    Overall, a great product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I don't use my ipod much, but a lot of my friends do and have the same problem. This ipod works great, but the headphones that come with it are terrible. I have to put them on my own ipod and they don't sound good. This is not a technical fault as this is an older ipod. It's a fault of poor customer service. Do not buy them.  Review of DJ0272-0060  by dj0272 on Tuesday, August 10, 2016  I was just informed that I could not return it as I did not buy it at the online store. I was told to call in and get it back. When I called in they gave me a "store policy" and then told me that I am not allowed to return the ipod due to a store policy. I am sure this is something that should be in the company's documentation. I tried to get an email to them regarding this issue. They told me to call them back if i wanted an email. I did call them but they never got back to me. My other ipods still work. I really don't know how this company runs their business. (Review of a product)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this unit for years now and its always dead when the batteries run out and i dont have the replacement batteries i need at home. the units can be replaced by people in the store or by a service center, the problem is that there is no way of getting an estimate if you dont know what you want, so the unit has to be brought back to a store to be repaired. i also dont get a good deal on the unit itself because ive found that the only reason why its so cheap is because the price is right for it. so in a way, you're getting more for your money when you buy a cheap unit at a service house.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, September 17, 2011  great value but do not buy  by John from Los Angeles CA USA  Pros: Easy installation  Cons: None  Review: This is a great little system and it runs for about 4 days after turning it on. We bought one because we are out of batteries and it works great for our needs. The only problem we have is that it is hard to find the battery in the remote control. I have to find it to change it, but then I lose the battery. The remote works well. It is very easy to install and it is light weight. I am a fan of this product. I wish the price was lower.  to be fair i did buy this item online for the same price as store. The product does not perform the same, the unit is heavy, the batteries are not easy to find, the remote is not easy, the instructions are poor and the customer service is not good at all.  with all that being said, it is a good product, I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a backup to their computer or does not want to have to purchase another portable system. .  the remote for the unit that i bought, is just for showing how the remote works, i think it would be better to have the batteries with it. the batteries for the batteries that came with the units was cheap, i just used the batteries from the remote itself instead.  in my opinion, the best thing about this system is the fact that you can plug it into the wall and have a small battery backup system. there is a remote that will allow you to get the batteries back. it is all in the setup manual, i did not need to buy any batteries,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My iPod mini has been with me since 2008 when I purchased it. It has worked fine since then. I've had it in my car, on my desk, in my backpack, at my desk. I even tried to transfer all of my music onto my iPod at the time, but that was unsuccessful because I had already downloaded all of the songs, and that is what they were.   Now, after being out of work for about a year, the battery is starting to have trouble starting. It will occasionally start, but it doesn't last long. I have it in the car constantly, so it's probably doing something to the wiring inside the car that I'm not aware of.   the iPod mini's batteries seem to last a long time, so I've decided to put it to sleep for now. I am very frustrated that I've already had to replace a few devices, including my iPhone 3G, which I've owned for about 2 years now. This is very disappointing to me, because it's a great device that I use and like. I'm currently looking for an alternative to my car stereo, but I think I'm going to have to give it up for the time being, since the battery has been giving me problems.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------- It's the first Apple iPhone I've ever owned. I've owned Mac and PC desktops, and I can't say I've been as happy with the screen, memory, and processor as I am with this one. This is the first computer that works. The problem is, I am a computer engineer and I don't get to use this computer as much as I should. It's still an amazing computer for its size and it is not expensive. I'll probably buy another one for our kids and that will probably give me a reason to upgrade to an iPod. The only thing I hate about this computer is that I can only install a "full version" of Windows on it. That would make it great if I had the time and the knowledge to configure it that way.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Tablet! I have two of these tablets, one on a desk in my bedroom, one as my laptop in my office. I have been using my Surface Pro 3 for a year now, and love it so much. I bought this the same day it came out, and am now running a 64-bit version of Windows 10 on this tablet. It has fast response times and can do so much more! I've also recently purchased the Surface Book 2, and will probably use it as well. It is still quite fast, and is an amazing value for the money.  and I haven't had a single issue with the device. I used it for a month and a half and had no problem at all. It worked great even with heavy loads and with my computer being on 24/7. It can do more than my laptop (even though it is less expensive) I really like it!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:............................................. The phone battery is crap!! I have only had this phone for a week. I always keep my battery charged. The phone was a little cold. So i tried to charge it up but was still at 7%. I thought I would try charging it at a hotel and if i didn't get a warm up I would be using it for a long time. I had the battery in for about 20 minutes. After that i was still on 7%. But i have to admit that I was really happy with the phone. My only complaint is that the battery charge speed is terrible. This phone would get a little warm to touch with a heat pad or some other heat source. I didn't like it. I was not too happy that the phone was warm to the touch. The other problem I have with the device is the lack of apps. I don't use my mobile phone a lot. I do not like the interface that it provides. I use my smart phone and it is more than enough for everything. I love my smart and I want it to work with my phone. I am very disappointed in the phone I bought.............................................  Rated 4 out of 5 by Roxy123 from Good phone I have purchased this phone a few days ago. It is a great phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought this keyboard for a computer a couple of years ago, it's pretty good for an older computer. however, i've just found out today that it's had the hard drive swapped out, its a 3 year old laptop, and i have a 1.6ghz intel i5 laptop with an radeon graphics card, it only took the hard disk to swap the hard disc and it works. i am not sure how the old laptop can still boot up so well and it has the same keyboard. it's still an awesome keyboard though. i don't feel good about it and i hope it is a rare error, so i dont lose it. i do have a keyboard that works and i haven't had a problem with it. it is only 2 years old and i still use it on my computer so i am very disappointed in the keyboard i received, so disappointing to say the least. i will be writing a better review of the product when it is in working order.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great keyboard I use this keyboard daily and can't believe the keyboard lasts this long and still works.  the only reason i gave it a 5 star is because i have had problems with it not being able to boot up. when i try to type in my password the key seems to be stuck. the problem is the power switch is on a metal button and when you unplug the power, it doesn't work.  to fix the problem i have bought a new keyboard and now it boots perfectly.    i would recommend it to anyone who is using it for work  i have only used it once and can not believe the quality and the way it works, it looks so nice. i used it with an oem keyboard and a windows 7 machine and they both work very well and the sound is great.   This is an amazing keyboard, I got it at a good price. I bought it after my old one broke and i thought it was time to upgrade and i was pleasantly surprised that the replacement arrived at the same time. The case is nice and solid. Its hard to get the key to work but you can do it in 2 minutes. I have owned other Cherry keyboards and this one is probably the best.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using this device since it was first released, it works great with my iMac, but i have since bought a new computer and the USB port on that computer is faulty, every time I plug in the device, the usb port becomes completely unplugged, this was very frustrating as i had bought this for my old computer to work with iMac. If you dont want to spend a lot for a computer this is not the one for you, but if you dont mind paying a little extra then the product is awesome.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have purchased two of these as an investment. I thought they were really great, until the last one I bought failed after 3 days of constant use. I contacted the company and they assured me that they would replace the unit and sent me a new one. I called to follow up on that and was told that the defective one would be replaced immediately. However, when I called that day, they confirmed that I would be charged for that repair. I returned the defective unit for a refund.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This item is so bad, it is unusable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This iphone is just a piece of junk, it's a pain to use. I'm always trying to solve problems with it but iphones are so unreliable and it just makes you feel like you're wasting your time with them. The design is awful, the buttons are so small they're almost useless, the battery is so bad I almost had to replace it when it was at 40% charge... I hate this iphon even more than iphons I have.  Product Review:  I've been using an iphoneda iphoner since 2011. I love it so much I was so upset to find out the company went out of business! I thought maybe there was some problem with the product, I was wrong, iphona went out-of-business! They only had one iphonest and one ihop! I'm sooo sad about that! iphonta never made iphoon. I don't have that much time to use my iphonel so it is so hard to deal with these problems. iphono has great customer service, but they need to make a new iphonet. The good:  iphonal has good customer service. I recently had an issue with my ilephant that was sent to them and it took them about 7 days to send me another one. ixiphos is a company that can produce a quality product. iloveit iphoontalk is a great website for customer support. They are very helpful. There are many options for iphoning from iphondom, ikono and ixo.  ixophones has great reviews and has a lot of options in iphonics. ichobooks has the iphosite that I have and iphomobile iphonic and ichontones iphopo. So glad I got this   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive just purchased a new cell phone and this thing isnt working. it cant even send out text message and it's so slow ive been able to call them a few times. it gets soooooooo slow!!!! I'm in CA. it will take too long to receive and there's no help line to go to. ive called a few others and ive been put on hold for more than 5 mins. you're better off buying a cell phone that doesnt have these issues.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, October 21, 2008  Great and works great  by Aaron from Littlerock, CO USA  Pros: Great device at a great price.  the batteries work great and have lasted for a while.  that said there have been a few duds from my experience  Cons: The battery life is only about 6 months. .  to compensate for that I have to set up my cell phone in the morning and let it charge at night, not always so easy to remember which day you put it to charge.  with a good phone like this, the battery life should be even longer.  "  Review of DJT Smartphone by David from West Palm Beach, FL USA  "I purchased this unit in July 2004. It works perfectly. I do not have to change my settings on the cell phone for different phone numbers. The phone connects very easily. I have the GPS for tracking. It also shows me where I am on the map. I can make calls, use e-mail, and send and receive texts. The unit has an alarm function. I did not buy it as an alarm, but as a means of getting more accurate time. I like the ability to see my location on a map, so I can set the alarm if I am in an emergency situation. I use it for work and have used it to call several times to my wife while in the car. I was not able to get through, but I did get her on the phone and told her to tell her husband to call me back. I then called my office to check my mail and received a package in the mail. I received the e-mails. I put the battery into the unit and it went into standby mode. I had to press the button and it came back on. I let the unit charge for 5 hours. It was easy to set. I just wanted to let you

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ****************** My first computer i bought was a Apple Aptus 7500 and i love the color and size but then i bought the 128gb, then i found out it didnt have enough RAM to run an older 3D game (the one on the top of this page)and my computer wouldnt boot up for 2 days(not a great feature in an ios device but not the end of the world) and i decided to just give it away i was very unhappy with it and the warranty didnt seem that good i decided it would be better off in a bin. i tried to return it online and after 2 days i got a call that my ios had crashed(my ipod 5 is a little old and didnt need a full upgrade but i didnt have any idea that was the problem or how to fix it and so i didnt want to return the ios but my mom came to pick it up so i had to do it ) i took it back and the only thing the apple rep said was that they didnt fix my ipod and would just send me a new one i was really upset and i gave it to my mom and she went to go find it so i could see if i could get it for a price that was lower and i got it and it turned out ok, i had bought a newer model with a 64gb internal memory and it still ran the game ok, it only has 512mb of memory so its not the best computer but i was able to get it cheaper than buying a new ipod from apple(for the money i would have spent on an ipod upgrade and another box) my ioseph wifi is terrible though i had a dsl connection but they were slow and so on and so forth i hope my problem wasnt with the ipod. i dont use it anymore.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought several ipods but after trying to charge the first 2 they were a fluke that kept losing battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for about 5 months now, its not that great, but i was using a raspberry pi for a school project and i wanted to do a school news app on my pc, so i ended up spending about 8 bucks on a raspberry with raspbian (not so great software) and a usb keyboard for connecting it to the pi and having to manually download a lot of news sites for the school. this i didnt have to do. the app i can do without using the raspberry, the only down side is when you try to use it it says its "Unknown" or "Not Found". and i had to go into the raspi settings and remove the bluetooth dongle, and the bluematic usb adapter as well. i didnt do that till after i got it working. that was a bummer. but other than that it works very well.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used the phone a couple times and so far its been pretty good but my boyfriends phone died one time he forgot to put it to airplane mode he put it in airplane mode but it kept charging and he forgot about the airplane mode again he put the phone to airplane and now it wont charge he told me to remove it from airplane mode so now it still charges but i have to put in the dock for the 3 or 4 times he uses it  I received the phone and immediately noticed that the battery had a bad amount of charge remaining, and then a few days later the same thing happened again. It doesn't matter how many times I turn it off and on, it always seems to charge it up to 99%.   The only way to get the battery to charge fast is to not charge it all the time. It's been 3 days since the last charge and the battery is at 74% capacity.  Good but... I bought the LG G2 thinking that it would be the phone for my college girlfriend.  a month later, the girlfriend and I broke up so we can't really use this phone any more. So, the LG phone is in a drawer at the apartment. I've called and tried to talk to LG in the past. I just got a call from their customer service and they said that it is their policy to not fix the phone. I'm not happy with that. I don't think the phone is defective but the fact that LG doesn't seem to care that their products are causing people grief should be a concern for everyone.   If you want a good phone at a good price (if you do, you can pay more for the real deal), this is a great phone and will work great for you. If you're not so keen on LG because you don't like the company, then this will disappoint you. , March 30, 2011

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ********* My battery died after a year, so when the computer didn't boot up after 2 years I called AT&T to get it fixed and they said it would cost $30 to get a new battery. They told me it could be fixed for $20 by returning it. They charged me $20 and sent the $30 back to me, but said if I wanted to exchange it for a new one, it would have to be exchanged for a computer. I am so glad that I had this phone because it saved my life, it got me into the college of business and got me some job offers.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this computer for about a year. i have used it for surfing the web, checking email, emailing my family, looking at my bank account, and watching youtube videos. the only thing i dont like is the speakers. i was told they were loud. they arent. they sound like cheap mp3 players. i dont know if its my speakers or my computer, but it really bothers me. i use headphones for the rest of the time, but the speakers sound so horrible. i had to get a new computer. the keyboard also gets hot, but if it doesnt get so hot i just let it sit and dont do anything. i would recommend this to people who dont like the sound. if you want an easy to use computer, i would suggest this, but otherwise dont buy it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had several of these, and they fail after about a month, if they work at all. the only thing that saved them is they are so cheap. they get a bad rap. if you want to play records at a high fidelity then get a decent one. ive given 3 stars because they did provide a good service, but they would be way more expensive if they were not for so much of the service going down every month. i think i will wait for an upgrade before i ever use them again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had it for a while and it has come loose so much that i have to take it apart to have it put back together. It has also taken many blows of my keyboard with out the keyboard not registering any of them. I have sent it back 3 times for repairs and still nothing has been done. I bought it to make it more compact but i guess the design is a big no no. The only good thing i can say about this is that when its on battery it gives you a warning that it may get a bit hot so if you dont need to use it all the time just turn it off and just leave it at home.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The new "iPods" are terrible. There was a great deal of problems with the initial purchase.   First off, the batteries came with a cheap battery. This is not the case on all products, but the batteries were a different brand than the one that came with the iPhone.  It had to be replaced with an OEM battery.  I ended up paying $40 for the battery, and $2 to get it back from Apple.  Now the "iPod" is a complete failure.  If you have an iPad, or an Android phone, you can do the same thing.

Maybe we will see better ones in the future but for now, my phone was a little too good to be true.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best Buy for Portable Audio I recently switched to a portable audio set up for work with the new iPad. The AudioBox is a perfect fit, great audio quality for the money. It is great for portable work and easy to use with both iOS and Android.  in terms of audio quality this device is just right. It's not too much, not too little and is definitely a very good investment.  you would have to be mad to not like this product.

I hope they can fix it. Other than that its a great phone.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this tv for 3 months and the screen seems to be fine but ive read many reviews that say its really a problem with it being hard to get into to use. its the first tv i ever bought i thought i would be able to get past that as i was told that it was easier than a normal tv. ive tried to pull the screen back, push it in a little then i realized it wasnt going back in but  have a hard time getting the tv into my tv stand. i want to be able access my settings but it really takes some force to get the stand back in to it.  ive bought two now hoping the third lasts.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: *************************** 1) My first time with a kodi box and my boyfriend was having his issues where he could not connect. I tried all the settings to get the kodi running again and everything seemed to work good. I was so disappointed that the problem didn't resolve. After a few days, I opened up a laptop and watched an episode of Game of Thrones. Suddenly my boyfriend said he couldn't connect and we decided to turn the TV off and start up the tv with the new box. The tv then took about an hour to connect to kodi. I have been using the tv all day and it still didn't connect. (After 3 or 4 hours the tv still couldn't find kodi and I did everything I could to try to get it to connect but nothing worked) 2) I'm very upset about this. I'm a very happy camper and I like it very much. But since I opened the box I've had 2 problems. The TV and the audio cable. It takes about 40 minutes for the TV to connect, and I'm trying to get a repair on a friend's tv and I can't do it. 3) The audio is terrible. The channels are loud and it's not good for gaming. There is no bass on the bass, and it just sounds like a loud phone in a small room. 4) The box is a waste of money. I bought it for $39 at walmart.com I'm pretty sure it was about $50 on amazon.com. 5) I know it doesn't last forever and eventually it's going to break. So I'm disappointed that it can't last longer than a month. If it lasted a year this would be better. 6) There are a lot of other options out there. I would recommend trying another device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My T913U stopped working at first...  My brother bought this one for me to replace the older one. The older one died out.   It worked fine until the second day of use. He turned the light on while we were having breakfast... I couldn't see anything. He flipped it off and on again a couple times. Finally I realized I must have just left the light to go off to save battery.     The old light would light up for just a few seconds on every time he turned it off.   The new light would not light up until he turned the lights on and off several times, then he'd see the old light.  , I think it is the battery which is going bad. I had to buy a new one, and it didn't last long either.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One month after getting the phone, the call was cut and it would no longer turn on. There were also times when the screen would turn off. This was after many calls and an effort to troubleshoot it with my network engineer. I was told that the problem was due to the wifi adapter not being able to power up in my area. I called Sprint to get a replacement but the person was very rude and seemed annoyed that I was calling them. I asked to speak to the technician and after trying several times, she said I had to be there. I finally found the person and was told she would come and replace the wifi connection to the device.   The next day my phone still would not come on and I couldn't even get it to turn on without a password. I went to the store and they told me that it was on backorder and it could take up to three months to get it. I told them that I had already called customer service to report the problem. They said that if I didn't want to wait that long, they would do the replacement for free. I then said "I really don't feel comfortable with it now". I called the customer service number again and was informed that I would have to be more specific about the problem so that they could assist me with it.  /s  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! This is the first time i went for this electronic device, i am the happiest customer of this company! The order arrived in only 3 days after I ordered, the product is of good quality and very affordable, the only thing is that the charging power is not as high as other brands.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mikes from Perfect. Exactly what I wanted I've had a couple of previous electric toothbrushes that were not as powerful as I wanted, and were quite expensive. I'm used to the fact that my teeth don't get as bad as they used to if I brush after every meal, and my teeth are much more visible when looking at a mirror. This was the last thing I needed to buy, and this is the absolute perfect item for me. I haven't been able to use it for a week yet, but after all the time that it's been on the stand it's still a work in progress. I think I'll put it on a different stand for a while before I actually put a toothbrush in it. I will report back on my experience after a few more days.  the brush is nice and light, but it has a good reach on my toothbrush head, which is something that I wanted and needed. I would recommend this brush to anyone looking for a good quality toothbrush that has good grip. The only problem I have is that it does not fit the larger toothbrush heads very well, so it is very difficult to clean all the dirt and debris from the mouth. The brush does not appear to be made of metal so it can be a bit hard to clean the bristles. I have not found the need to clean my toothbrushing brush after use. However, after washing it, you should be able to thoroughly clean it, I just haven't had the chance yet.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _______________________________________________________________________________________ I have this thing for two weeks. I bought it as a replacement for my old flip phone and am thrilled with it. It does what I want. The only thing it doesn't do is call or text anyone. But that's okay. I already have a flip phone so I'm going to replace my old one with this one. It takes forever to charge so I take a little extra time with it, but it's not an inconvenience. If you're buying this for yourself I would not get it unless you've already got a flip. It's so thin it's barely there. But it does exactly what it says it does.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This item just does not perform well and is prone to breaking. The charger comes with a dead USB cable and the cord is so flimsy it's more like a string. The charging time is so bad you can't even leave it on the charger longer than 20 minutes without the charger blowing up. My wife is very happy with the item as she used it for many years before finally realizing it wasn't worth the money.  It's not so bad but it really can go wrong. I bought this unit to use as a home security system. It does the job, but there are a few quirks. I use it as a backup system to my backup server which also has the NVR and some other gear on it. My home has no power lines running directly to the house so the NTV doesn't come on. My NVR is wired with an ethernet cable. The NTV needs to be plugged into an ether cord or a port with a USB cable connected to it. The USB port also requires you to plug in a cable to power it off and then put the other end into the wall. That could be solved by using a USB power strip which would work. The second problem is that the NHD only works if you are sitting in the middle of the bed when the NDT goes off. I do that because the NID can't be turned off by the TV. I have a separate power supply for my NID but it is a 2 amp power adapter which should probably be at least 4 amps. All of that could have been addressed if I had just waited a few more years and upgraded the NVIDA hardware to a real computer with a bigger hard drive instead of buying a 1 TB HD. If you can do with a cheap TV/monitor/gaming setup, you won't be disappointed in the NDS. The unit is still fairly easy to use. If the software does not do what you want it to do, just put it back on the internet and set it up again. I really like the fact that the product is really thin and does not look ugly. But it will not last long unless I put it in the basement. I can only imagine the trouble that would cause.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the device for my husband who is a professional photographer and had always wanted to purchase a digital camera with a built in flash but was afraid he would be embarrassed when I would take pictures. The flash is great but for all those who say it's a great camera but not an instant camera, you are not wrong but it's not something to brag about. There is no auto focus so the camera has to do all the focus work and you do not get a burst of pictures to review and you have to focus manually every time. It takes about 20-30 minutes to capture the perfect picture with auto focus. My husband uses a lot of light so the auto focus does not work well for him. It is an okay camera if you know what you are doing and need a fast camera with flash.  Style of Review:   I love this camera because it is the best camera I've ever owned. I've been looking for a digital back for a long time and this camera finally did it for me. It's not the best digital camera I own (Sony A6000) but it does all I need it to do. I don't miss my bulky old film camera (G7X) anymore. It has a built-in flash and that's what I use for all my photography. It just works.  I bought it because I had a lot I needed to do in the field that had to be done with my old film cameras (A6000). I've used it every single day in the fields of Idaho and Texas. It was just awesome. It takes excellent pictures and it's been so great to be able to review my photos in post-production. It gives me a good excuse to take it with me everywhere I go. I also love the fact that there is a backlight on the front, even if it's barely visible to the naked eye. I can adjust the exposure as needed and the flash works great. I have not yet used the built- in flash on the camera itself but I am very curious. It'll be something I want to buy when I can afford it. (Verified purchase: No)  Nikon D800E (Review Date: 4/4/2014) The best digital back ever! The camera is great for me because it takes excellent photos with high contrast, sharpness, and good color. This is my first digital back and it has been an absolute pleasure to

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for almost a year and it has had multiple problems. ive been using it as an ipod dock, i only use mine to charge the ipod at night so the dock isnt needed.  the ipad is so slow to charge that its impossible to use it for video. the ipads battery would only last 1-2 hours but the battery would last 6-8 hours with the ipapad in use. also, this ipad charger has a short cable and does not fit on the usb plug of the ipa dock and will block the charger from charging the ipas battery.  also i just replaced the ipac battery and now the ipax battery is still dying.    all in all its just a cheap crappy product. its not worth the money to be honest.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this to do something that I was not a good enough user to do with my computer. So I plugged it into my computer and ran it as the system administrator. So in the morning I open the thing up and all the hard drives I backed up, all the stuff on my usb drive all of that is gone. I tried to copy it from my computer back to it's original hard drive and the file just keeps disappearing. The only way I can recover it from the old hard drive is to use a drive eject tool or something but I dont have either. I called the person who sold it to me and he wouldnt even go back and help me get the things back. He also kept telling me that it was going to take me over a week to find out where it went. He said he didnt know where the item ended up but it sure sounded like it wasnt the right thing for me. I dont feel comfortable using this to make a backup on my computer to the computer I'm using. So if you need something to do this with make sure you do it with another computer.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I love the size of the watch, but its really hard to use. It's really cumbersome to set it up in your clothes and it has to be placed in its case to charge (which is a pain). I'd never use a watch this size, and for what? The screen is small and not at all easy to read. It would be better if it didn't have a camera for tracking and the GPS, but all in all it's a great watch. I did find that the battery lasted about 8 days which is nice, but I didn't want to have to buy new batteries every time I wanted to use it. I would get rid of this watch and try another one, but it's really expensive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item and it does not work properly and it is also not working for me. I tried to replace the device but it does nothing. I am really disappointed.  Rated 1 out of 5 by David from It's dead! I bought the Echo Dot two weeks ago and it was great until the batteries died a few days ago. It took me a while to find an Echo Dot replacement. I'm sure it's due to the battery life not getting extended like most other devices. So I bought a Bluetooth speaker instead. It's a great one, and works much better.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for over a month and it isnt working at all. I thought the battery was going to last me a week but it lasted me about two days. It took me 4 hours to go a few miles just to charge the battery. I dont recommend it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Rt2Rm from Great addition to my Epson printer for the price. It is an excellent addition to your printer. I use it in tandem with my printer which is a Canon PowerLite Pro 5000. When the battery is down, it automatically turns on the LED and starts the software. The battery will run for around two hours at a time and then turn off. The LED light is nice for warning me when I am about to go over. It also gives you an alarm if you drop it. I wish the software was more intuitive. If I had known this was available before purchasing this item, I would have paid more for it. However, I am very happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to others.  to top
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using this for a little over a year and the quality of the sound has been extremely poor. it will crack and break at the connectors as soon as it gets hit by a sharp object and it isnt as good of a sound as a good laptop/tablet. its also very difficult to clean because it is so sticky from being on your mouse and keyboard. i would give it a zero if i could. i gave it a 1 star because it will definitely last longer than a week  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for a replacement phone when my old one died so I could take photos and videos. It does not work well, but I will be buying another one soon. I was very disappointed with it. I thought I would be able to use it because it was a newer model that was supposed to be more advanced and have better battery life and it was advertised as a smart phone. I got it and installed it and was disappointed immediately when I turned it on and nothing worked. It had a very weak battery which is obvious when you look at the battery, it is not very heavy. The phone is very small so it is easy to get to places where you need to use your phone without taking it out of your pocket. The only thing I really like about this phone is that you can get a charger with it to go with it, otherwise, it will die on you before you have even used it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ____________________________________________________________________________ The device is nice, but I think a lot of the money was wasted on it. When you first turn it on, it's very slow, and it takes 2 minutes to turn on the computer. It will not turn on, unless you change the batteries. And I thought it would take 15 minutes, instead of 20. And then, after a few minutes of the computer not being able to boot, you see all your hard drive and files are gone. So I think it was a waste of money for what I was going to get from it. I'd just get an old cd player, I guess. But I got this, and then I got a new computer, and I really wish that the old cd machine would have worked. And if it was not so old and so slow, I'd probably just keep it. But this computer is too slow, too slow. I can't believe I paid this much for this. I wish they'd get a computer that can do what it says it can. If it doesn't do anything else, then it should be good. It's only 2 pounds, though. I don't know if it would be much weight, but it's so slow. The only reason I'm giving it a 3 star rating is because it has a nice built in speaker. I'm not going to pay for speakers to get it started. But it does have a speaker, so that is nice. But the speakers don't really do much with music, they just get a lot louder with your car. I got rid of my old stereo and went with the Sony MP-3. It plays just fine, the only problem is that it is the only digital audio player available. If I were in a car or on the road, I wouldn't use it. It just is too sluggish. If you get one of these, just get the mp3 player, and not the speakers. This one I wouldn  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Very bad. Bought to replace some old cd players. It was very expensive for a CD player. Was very slow and had problems with getting up and down. It wouldn't even start up. I would like to give it 1 star rating, but there is no way in hell you can give it a 1 star, since the price is $299.00 and it is so old.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i had this for a month and it was a complete nightmare. the battery didnt last.  It had a problem with it going into sleep mode. when i tried to turn the screen on it would shut down on it's own.   i have had the device for a week and i do not see how it can do it's job without a battery in it. i can not use it on the porch, for that i have a cordless drill.   the device is a complete failure and if your gonna try to charge your phone with it its a huge fail. i will not buy another. .  in a word, bad.  the only way i can make it work is to cut the cord and plug in a corded drill. if you want to use it, don't use it. the only thing i got out of this was it's name. not a good idea.    others have reviewed this and have complained of it's poor battery life.  are you going to complain?   my advice is to get one of these:  http://www.adafruit.com/product/2634/   its cheaper. less complicated and has much better battery life

I also find that you can connect it to a Bluetooth dongle, for that extra safety. ,  My only complaint is that it does not come with a case to protect the antenna or the touchpad.  are you able to provide a remote in case I need to rewire it or have my friend do it?

Was a good product, but no replacement, and no warranty for what is a defective product. /\   PS: The one star rating is because I have no idea what this product is going to cost when it is replaced.    If the warranty is available, it should be offered by this company, for the people who have lost their product or need to buy a new one.  and in general:  Do NOT buy these devices!  The reason for the 1 star is simple.  is it really worth it? I think not.  -I'll give this product 4 stars if the warranty and replacement program are offered by the manufacturer.  . .

Review of DJ0268-00 Submitted By: William - Verified Buyer I have been using the DJ0269 for almost 6 months and have used it as a home media center and at the gym as a portable radio/music system for my workouts. When I used to work out in the past with a gym radio, I'd be constantly turning it up and hearing "the song that I used" and I'd lose my way trying to remember what it was. I didn't really care too much about the music, but I noticed this was the case when using this DJ0279. The music selection was impressive. I think the only thing I could say I don't like about this system is it doesn't come with a remote, but there is a remote app that does the job. I can't comment on the battery life, but it seemed to work okay when I used it in the office. I don' have any complaints.  1 of 1 people found the following review helpful: Excellent Product I have a newer Mac Pro and was searching for a high end music system.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had a defective one of these devices for a little while. When I returned it it was completely dead. I don't understand how that happened. I have had other e-cigs and the unit worked just fine. It would not power on, nothing happened when I turned the power on. It is not a problem with the unit it is a problem of the person using it and the device that came with the product.  I had a faulty one of this devices for  meelee  The user error of this unit is beyond belief. It works fine on it's own but for some reason when you turn it on and you hear that beeping noise it will never start again. I called and the guy said that he would ship me a new one and it will have to wait because of this. He said if I would put my cell phone in it and make sure it is charging before I put it in, then he would think it is ok. When you start it and it beeps every second, you don't know what is wrong with it. 's user error is beyond reason.'  Read All Reviews

When I first got it it only had a small amount of charge, so the instructions say to connect it to a computer and charge it, but I was able to charge it fully while using it. I also think that the instructions could be a little more clear. For example, when I plugged the phone in, the instructions said "The phone needs to be connected to a PC or computer." I connected it to the PC and the instructions then said "Connect the phone to a USB port in your computer."  So for my example, the phone was connected to my computer and it told me to connect the phone through a USB. But it just showed a picture of the USB port and that was all the instructions.  the unit is well built and the USB ports are all small enough to use.  and it works  Thanks   Was this Review helpful to you on Oct 12, 2010?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this device for about 2-3 years and it is just plain nasty. It does not work well for me. the buttons dont work well at all. and the sound is bad aswell. i use the mp3 player from my ipod 2 and the dsx doesn't work well on the ipod2 at all(the dsX doesn't have as many buttons as the ipods do) but the dsp does work well. i dont care about the sound quality when i play it on the iphone. i think it would be much better with the dsi. its just not the best at all and i find myself replacing it with another ds on occasion. but if you get this ds for the audio, you will be regretting it. if you dont care for the sound, get an ipod 3.  Rated 4 out of 5 by mike from Good, cheap but very unreliable This is the cheap version of the SONY DPX1000W, a ds (DuoShock) with good sound. I found that the sound comes through a small cable. You do have to press in the buttons to turn them on and off. I had the issue of the buttons not working when I first got this, as well as the audio not working. They would just shut off and then reset themselves. I've since swapped this out with another. You can't beat the price, though.  at first you think this is a good product. but it is a waste of money. you will have to buy the dvi if you want to take audio out of your system. the dv's have much better features and are better made.  a dv has many more options in it then the dp or ds. it works on the same ipod and ipod3 models. it does come with 2 adapters and a case. you would have to pay a little more for the dvs though. it comes with the ipad adapter and a dvr. it will work with almost every ipod model out there.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It worked the first time, and worked perfectly, however, two days later, it wouldn't power on and I couldn't find any way to get it to turn on. I also purchased an alternate USB cable. The new cable would connect on the first try and would power on without issue, but the original wouldn't.  I am still trying to figure out why. I am sure it is a problem with my router, and not the adapter. I have ordered a second one to see if it is the same. It should be an issue with my Internet service, but this adapter is not supported by my ISP so that makes it hard to track down.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought an apple watch a month ago and it was working fine until I plugged it in recently and it shut off. It was running great the day I got it and the last day before I received a replacement battery. I got to the dealer and they said this was not the case and to get a new one. So after about a week of troubleshooting and testing it and it still not working I contacted Apple support. I asked if it was possible to get it repaired since it still does not work. I was told yes but it would cost me $199.00. So I called apple and they told me that there are many Apple Stores that would work on it but they would charge me $79.00 to do it. So what do I do? I'm just really disappointed in apple.   Was this Review Helpful to you?

I had thought the watch would be able to do so much more than its competitors and so I downloaded a lot of apps from both Android and the Apple watch. However, after the first few days the apps stopped working and the watch refused to send an activity report. I went to a couple of Apple stores and was able to get one app that worked, but it took an hour and 45 minutes to get the data. I've tried many other apps and all of them still fail to send the data so I'm forced to give up and just wear my iPhone on the right wrist and look for other apps.

Had a little trouble with it starting to run (the LED was flickering), but this can be fixed by unplugging the cable before inserting it into the laptop.  My laptop runs with the battery installed without any trouble.

It has great battery life, even in direct sunlight. The watch is waterproof and I have not even had to put it in the dishwasher (which should not be necessary, but just to see how it holds up). I have read a lot of reviews on it and I would highly recommend it.  Would you recommend this to a friend? __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ : The LG G Watch was purchased as a replacement for my iPhone, which has been replaced twice in the past (not on purpose, I have simply fallen out of love with it).   It was very easy to use, and has a large amount of watch face customization.   The battery life is good, and the fitness tracking is great.   on a side note, you can't purchase accessories with it. (It only has one band.)   I gave it a 5 for its price, and would recommend it to any one wanting to try a smartwatch for the first time.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was pleased to see that the phone was working well, and that I could use it with all my wireless networks. Unfortunately, after using this phone for several weeks, I have been experiencing constant interference with my wireless network. I have checked the phone's connections every day and everything works fine. After several months of using the phone, I started to notice that the signal strength drops a lot. I can still get a network signal, but I'm not able to receive the phone call through the radio, but my computer can. Also, this phone is very sensitive to the weather. The rain makes it impossible to hold the phone up and the phone can be easily soaked if I am trying to look at it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my iphone 4 for less than a year now and i must say its very difficult to use. i do not have the ability to see all of the screens, and i never find myself with the ability (or have the option to have the possibility) to turn them off if i am not using the device in a particular situation. and the only way to actually turn off the devices is to use an app that i have to buy and i have no intention of ever buying.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this one two days ago and after using it for about a month, I just got around to switching it out. The buttons on this thing are so stiff and they don't even register that I pressed the button. It doesn't matter that the battery dies, I have a dead unit right now. This thing is a complete joke in my opinion. It's an e-book reader, it's not meant to be used to play audio. I'm not sure if I'm gonna try to get a replacement one or not.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ My first review. I bought this for my son and it arrived the same day as I ordered it. It is the best device i have ever used. He is almost 4 and he can play it while it is plugged into a charger. I was able to make him use it as a real gun and it actually fired! My wife even thought it was a real one until she saw the trigger. I would give this 10 stars if they didnt make the charging handle hard to use, but other than that great little device!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! This thing is so cheap and doesn't even work!! It would not even boot up, and I was lucky I just bought it, because when I went to install it I realized it was totally broken. The screen is so very poor. It's horrible. It has so many bad things about it and it just isn't worth the money to have this thing, and my phone is also broken after using this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the most frustrating thing ever. When my wife bought it for my birthday it came with some cables and some batteries and then the unit was broken. We contacted LG and they gave us some replacement units and then my wife got a new unit, but it is still broken and my wife still has to go out and buy new batteries when it is not plugged in. It was a gift to me, she paid for it, and she doesn't care about the product. LG needs to get back to basics and do better quality control on their products.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  this unit is the worst I have ever used. I replaced the battery with a different brand.  the unit has not worked properly for the last 4 months.   It's no longer an alarm clock, no longer a calendar.  It only works intermittently.  This is unacceptable.  I bought this because I want it to work but am being told this unit will not work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got a moto x4l and used it for 4 weeks. At the end it was the weakest phone I ever owned. The screen is flakey with no way to change the colors. It does not vibrate when you pick it up, so I have to find my phone to check if it is on. The phone can be unlocked with a code but the software is horrible and the phone does not work.    Good value:  The battery lasts an hour and a half or so and is good enough to get a few more days of use.  It is not waterproof but it has a nice metal construction.  You get what you pay for.  I received my phone and it was very hard to get into my pants pocket because it is so stiff. It looks nice and it does look nice from the rear and it is really nice on the front of the phone but it does not hold up as well as it should.

Was this review helpful to you?  1 of 1 people found the following review helpful: Great E-Cig, but Battery Needs to Last LONGER The only con that I can think of with this device is that the battery life is short compared to the features that this device can do. The battery does not last long enough that the use of it is not needed at all. I wish the battery would last longer, as a short life would be great for my friends and I. The design of the device is also very cool. The only downside to this E-cigarette is that it is extremely noisy. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a good alternative to smoking a cigarette, or those who are worried about smoking, or who just want to save some money.

I love the idea of a device that just shows you the time without making you look at your phone. It even gets the time wrong when you go to use your phone to look at it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone 4 is a pain to use because there is no software to do anything with. the keyboard is horrible the phone is horrible because there isn't enough memory, the phone has no video capability and is very slow.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Dave W. from Not worth it If you're looking for a new phone, you'd be better off paying the cash for an unlocked version. However, this phone is awful. First of all it's very expensive. Even with my contract, it's still very expensive to buy an unlocked phone. The display is small. Even if you can see out the glass is very small. Also, the battery is so low that the phone doesn't make any sense. I have to charge it every 2 hours to get anything done. It's so bad that I have not put it through any of the apps that the Verizon apps allow. All the functions of the Verizon app have been disabled and all apps that do things that Verizon does are not available on this phone. There is no way to turn them on because there are no apps that have the same code. I can't turn on my music player either because there's no way of making it work, just like with the Verizon music app, you have to reboot the phone. It has no idea what to do. Also when you try to turn on your wifi, it just hangs there for a minute before it reboots. The only app I have that works is the Verizon web browser because it can get onto my website and display my ad. Even when it does load up the page it loads slowly and it has some odd bugs. I'm going to buy the unlocked phone for $700 and keep using it until the battery dies. I'll be honest, I don't recommend this phone to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The item was great until it went out of order at the last minute. I called and got a "no service" message after a while. I went to an electronics store that sold me other products and they had the same problem. Then the store did a good job of repairing the electronic device.  When I received the phone back I was sure that it was the same one that I just went through. It was hard for me to believe that the same problems with this product happened with the other. I think that the fact that it broke like that is what ruined the product. The phone is a good phone but not worth the price.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ****************** I have a Sony PS3 Slim, it has the newest firmware, and now has Bluetooth. I don't use it often so the battery life isn't great, but I use it on my cell phone to check the time. I can still hear the music in the music box, but my PS3 is louder and is much better in a loud room. So basically the musicbox isn't really for anyone who wants to listen to music with it. If you are into audio this is for you, if not you should just get a good speaker and a decent bluetooth speaker. You won't miss anything about the music from the music player.   2 of 2 magicians found this helpful.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received my new MacBook in July of 2013, it was the one I wanted. It worked fine for about a month or so. Then it went silent. After it had gone silent the first time, it would wake up. Then every day would start up without even the "clicking" of the power button. Then finally on a few occasions the screen would just go black without warning and the computer would just sit there. I have turned it off and on multiple times and I even got the screen saver turned on and it didn't change the problem. I then took it to Apple and I was told they had not seen it before. They gave me the best "sorry you had that problem, we fixed it" reply I have ever gotten. After all the trouble I put this computer through, I just wanted a replacement and I am very frustrated and a bit upset at Apple, who clearly doesn't care about their customers and did not care to respond to my complaints. I've read about it on here before but just wanted to confirm it was indeed the problem with my old computer, and they did replace it, but there is NO WAY it is the same issue! I would buy another computer but for this. If Apple cared enough about their loyal customers to make it right, they would. This is the first computer I have bought, I don't regret my purchase, it's great!  Was this review helpful to you? Yes (0) No (0.00)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a t3 for a little over 1 year, the first 2 years the unit was very unreliable and it would break down in less than 5 months of use, not to mention the cost to the company to send you new units back, not worth it. ive since upgraded to the t3s, after getting an upgrade to the 8gb one, it still works as good or better than the t1. but the T3s has a built in ethernet port, so no need to plug it in. and that port is a pain to use at times. the only problem i have with this unit is the ethernet jack is very hard to get to, and it doesn't have a cord to plug into any of the wall outlets.  i bought the new t3 from walmart and paid about $80 dollars for the upgraded unit and still have not found a wall outlet that it works with. i have found a good use for my t1 is a 3g dsl router for the computer that i have a very old cable that connects into my computer and it can use my ethernet connection and it works flawlessly. it does have a built-in ethernet card, so it can connect a usb modem. and the dsl is very fast, even more than a 2.4ghz dsl.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Gee from Perfect for my family We use this system for our 3-bedroom house. With only one microwave, we used to spend hours getting everything ready.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ___________ I bought the T-mobile G1 in 2010 to be my home and work phone. The first day I used it I took it outside and started to use it for a few minutes. The screen froze and wouldn't display anything for 30 minutes. I thought it was because of a bad battery. I got home and opened the box and found out that it was the battery that was bad. The batteries themselves had been old and had to be replaced. I didn't have to spend more money then I would have if the phone worked. The phone is not good quality. I can't use it or take it to the beach or anywhere in the cold because of the freezing screen. I'll go to Best Buy for a new one but this is a bad phone. I have it for 4 years and it's still bad. I hope you guys have better things to do than to spend $300 to $400 to replace a product that isn't working for you because your new phones won't work with it either. This is why people don't buy electronic devices. I don't want another bad phone that will have to be taken to the garage to be fixed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for a week now and its fine except when you play a game like skyrim or just play with other people its not so clear and its really hard to read on the screen but overall ive been happy with this product  Review of DJ0268-00 Submitted By: Robert T - Verified Buyer I received my CDJ-2000M2 and was very pleased. Works great. I had to make sure my computer has a sound card with the USB interface. It works great.  Reviewer: David R. - Verify Buyer These things are fun!  I have had mine for just over a week and have no problems whatsoever. Very happy with the product and service from both CDJ and Sound Devices.  the sound quality is better then my old deck, it feels much smoother and has very little hum. I bought this unit after a very frustrating time with the Yamaha XM-S950, a much less expensive unit that works but is too sensitive. . , my old decks were great but these are even better.  (They're made out of a very high grade of plastic.)  The only problems I've found are with the software and the controls are too simple. I use the track number function and the track up/down functions but that isn't the main thing I use this unit for. I would buy again without question. The CDJ series has been around for a while, many others do not.  The only bad thing about these is that you have to buy a cable for it as well as a USB cable for your computer. If you don't, you can't connect it to any other device with the supplied USB cable. The USB cables are really hard and don't work well with the CDJ.  is is really well built. I was surprised how solid it felt in my hand. It is nice to see a better quality deck then the previous model, and I don't really find myself having to upgrade it any time soon.  that is the main reason i went with the S series over the X series. I love the features of the S, the new USB connections are great, plus I can still play my old cards on the deck even if I have another player with a USB connection.  to all that have had problems with this unit so far I would say that you've got nothing to worry about, they have not been able to fix them yet. you should

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this phone for over a year now. i was given this phone by an aunt as a graduation gift, she had no idea that it was going to be this bad. once i got the phone, i was amazed at the size of it. i didnt really want it to be my only phone, so i made a few backups and kept using it as much as i could until it got so heavy and wasnt very durable. the battery was good until the first time i was driving it, i lost a whole lot of juice when i was at my most in a hurry and i had to use the phone just to text someone. this wasnt good at all. the second time around, i didnt lose a whole ton of juice, but i wouldnt get up to use it anymore than a minute or so at a time. i also did not like the battery that came with it. there was some grease and oil on it, but the battery didnt last as long as i thought it would. the camera was also very poor. its great when you want to take a picture of your dog playing in the yard, but in low light situations it makes the picture blurry, and when you try to upload it to facebook, the phone freezes. theres nothing good about this phone, it sucks!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used many in the past and every single one has failed, some of them being in a high use area and with a heavy user. the problem is that the connectors are of poor quality and are not made to the same standard as most others in the market, the pins are poorly soldered and can break easy if not cleaned and protected properly. the quality of the components is the worst i ever seen. this is a serious problem that many have already had to face and the quality is just unacceptable.   Other than the quality issues the device performs and works fine, and the price is reasonable, i would recommend this device but for the price i have to say i would rather go for a cheaper solution, that being said this device works and is easy to use for anyone wanting to make their own speaker and its a great little device

It's been working great for about a week now but I'm not sure if it's the speakers or the system that's causing the problems, but when I turn my speakers up the system is too loud for my ear. It makes it hard to hear what I'm singing and also when I play a song it cuts out every once in awhile. The first time I played "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" the sound was too loud and the system was giving me no sound. The second time I heard it I was able to make it to the end of the song but the sound cut out after the chorus. Now that I've played the songs a few times the system has cut out but the speakers sound pretty loud. It is not my system but I just wanted to let you know about it because I'm still trying to figure out what the issue is.

My old one I had is very broken, i.e. the screen gets all cracked and is in a very bad shape. I was very happy to see the new one is very good in my eyes! It does have a touch screen, but it can't touch my fingers! I guess it is not as good as an old phone. I did have some problems with it: It's battery is so low that if I put it on the charging station, the phone is not usable. This has happened many times, especially when the battery is low. The battery also goes flat and no longer works. I also had to do a software update and some apps to get my new phone working properly. The last problem is the one i like the most: it is so hard to use the iPhone if you have very little time and a big screen like me! I would recommend to everyone that wants to take a good picture and be able to find the perfect shot.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had it now for almost a month now and it was the worse phone i have ever owned i had to return it because the software and the apps that are supposed to work do not work and every time i try to open a web page it just freezes and shows the lock screen again and again its so hard to figure out how to get it to work for a day or more i have no option but to send it back i am not paying for it anymore  Other than that, I have had it for almost 2 years and it still works well. The only thing that is annoying is the lack of a MicroSD slot. That really sucks. The phone is super small and compact and can be very compact in a purse or backpack.  If you have the money, this phone is worth every penny. If you need a basic phone, the $100 Nexus 5 or $100 iPhone 6S are good. If the budget is too small, then the Moto X is also a good choice. I just got my Moto X so I can't compare.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used this for a few days and it is the most annoying phone i've ever owned. it doesnt work if i have my battery powered on. once it starts up it will just go to sleep and wake up when i plug it in or unplug it. I have been forced to go out and buy a new one to replace this one.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Rheydons from Great phone! Works flawlessly on the new T-Mobile network. I don't use it all the time since I use my other phone for everything, but it's still a great phone for work. I will also use it for a day or two a week at home. . I got the G4 in black and white. Works as advertised. It's a beautiful phone, though there are some limitations that I've found. -1. The micro USB port is not as easy to use as the micro USB 3 port on my Nexus 4. I use a USB hub with a micro USB to micro USB adapter to make it easier for me to plug in. It doesn't look like it will work on the Nexus. -2. The phone doesn't have a volume rocker and I'm sure it should have because I get annoyed by the phone not being able to switch to the brightness setting when I use the brightness key. It gets annoyingly hot to the touch. T-mobile G4, no power jack and micro USB cable. Can't complain. The black and silver are pretty cool colors too.

I like having the option to switch to the stereo on the main screen.  the buttons were easy to push but sometimes it would not work at all.  of course it did not matter at that point because the sound was fantastic. ,  Cons: none  Review: The sound is amazing!!! Its the best computer I have ever used. I also have a sound bar, but this one is so much better.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This has been an annoying electronic device, it does not charge up in a very short time, and i have had to buy 2 new chargers just to keep this thing going. I have had it for 3 weeks and it is just not worth the hassle. This product is terrible. I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Rated 3 out of 5 by mcclims from Bought for my wife for Christmas as she needed some extra charging power. It was easy to assemble and easy to use. It came with a cord, a USB cord and 2 wall plugs. The wall plug needs to have a different colour. My wife is not a fan of red and this is a pretty common colour for the plugs on computers and cell phones. I'm happy with it as a gift, but it wasn't a great purchase.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item is defective. The plastic on the bottom is so soft and can easily be bent and broken by a very slight touch.  I used the "tilt" function on this item and while it was supposed to "toss" the device upside down, it just stuck on the flat part of the case.   After several attempts to fix this, I decided it was time to return it. The return process took a couple days. At the end of the return process, I was told the case had to be returned because the unit's battery had failed. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took about 5 minutes to send my order and I was extremely unhappy that they were sending it wrong and that they didn't ship it for the right time.  The packaging was good, I didn't experience any damage from the package but the package was obviously not packed to ensure the device would arrive in a timely manner.    The device was received in good condition but still needs a replacement, I will keep my eyes out for other online sales that deliver on their promise. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone is an amazing device that is good for all of us. but i have not had a single problem with it in a year of owning it and it is still going strong. you dont have to deal with it for a long time and then all of a sudden you realize that your battery is half dead. but even though it is now in the past, it is definitely worth a look if you are thinking about buying it because it is not the same as your ipod 2. if you want a quality device at a good price, then this is it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So far, the problems that have plagued this device have been related to overheating, power loss, dead batteries, and not working properly. However, for $50 I expect it to have a better build and not just one single issue after a month of use.  2 of 2 customers found this review helpful Features Quality Value Overall Product Experience I own it Closest Store Halifax, NS Posted by David N on Jun 22, 2015 Was this review useful? flag review I have been using this product for the past month or so, and so far everything is great. The only problem that I have is with the power supply of my computer which I have had trouble with. It just seems to give out when I get to about 15 percent. I have not been able to get the unit to completely turn itself off. However it does seem to use much less energy than before I purchased. However I do still have to plug it in for power. I just wish they would have included a power cord so I could plug into the wall. Overall I am very pleased with the product and would recommend it to others. It is great for my computer and works as good as it looks. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When i bought the vive  i had to return it within 3 days of purchase because it was defective.   It came with the controller  the touch buttons are missing they must be removed in order to change the game   In order to play the game I had to change all the cables from the computer to the controllers and this is where the biggest problem occurred   I was playing a game and I could not move my character and the controller didn't respond   This made it impossible to play.  I gave up on the game. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought this and other devices that are supposed to be good but this one is just an average device... ive used it to listen to the radio, listen to mp3, and just listen to some music. i think the only way you could listen to music would be with earphones. ive also used the usb usb cable and it works flawlessly. the only downfall is that its really hard to remove the battery to change it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The main reason I bought this was the fact that i live in Australia and my phone has a range of up to about 100 feet (which is about half way between my front door and the car), but when I was trying to use it to call someone (who lives near me) the cell phone signal was so bad i couldn't use it, despite having a connection. This was a problem as my roommate and I were both trying to call the people who live near us, and the phone wouldn't work, and I was completely frustrated. It would work once or twice but it was impossible for me to make the call. I've had many other phones that worked fine but it seemed like this one was having problems.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst thing ever I was using a Samsung Smart TV for my family and i could not be more unhappy with this. I tried it out on my computer and it does everything i want it to but for some reason the volume control does nothing and it just turns it all the way up for me and it doesn't stop it from turning up. I would love to buy a new Samsung product for my computer because it is very expensive and it has horrible sound quality. Not only does this TV turn the volume all the other way but it has terrible sound quality because the speakers are horrible and the sound can't be turned down because it keeps going up all the time. Very disappointed in this purchase and will never use any Samsung products ever again
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the watch for about two weeks and it works great, but theres always something wrong with it. When it works the screen works as well as it does when it's not. When i press the power button it seems to power the watch on, but when i press another button, it turns the watch off. I have tried to fix this by unplugging and plugging it back in, but I have never been able to find out what causes it to turn off. If I dont see any lights when I press the button it usually will turn off and on again. I dont think I have ever seen a device this cheap turn itself off before. I'm really upset about this and the customer service is terrible. I think I will not be buying another watch from here for a long time. I would recommend this to just be careful when turning the watch.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this as a backup for my portable computer, and it doesn't work well with my MacBook Pro (MacBookAir) and a portable video device. When I first purchased it, I noticed that there were a few issues, but I don't remember how they worked. The first problem is that it wouldn't power up my laptop (MacbookAir) until it was plugged in to the mains. The second problem is the battery. I used a lithium ion battery (from the original iPad, the model I bought), and it was dead after 2 days of use. It has to be recharged using a USB power supply.   The main problem I found with this product was that it's slow. It's not the slowest thing I have ever used, but it just takes forever to charge my iPad (with the moto adapter) and my phone (with a usb charger). I don a lot of power-users. So, if you do, get a better USB charger (or a USB portable power unit). This thing does a lot, but you can't always use it.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Dax from This charger is a bit slow but it will charge my computer... This charger and the mavic pro are both very good and I really like the speed of charging my computer, with the usb cable and mavicon on it. However when i plug it in my computer will not charge as fast. If you are looking for a usb adapter this one is not the best one but it does work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the i5 for a month and its still having problems after over 1 year. it is an absolute joke, i have had issues with the monitor constantly disconnecting. when i first got the monitor it did work great and now it doesn't. i tried to open the monitor up and had no luck. the usb ports are faulty and wont work, i can still charge the phone and get on with life but not the monitor. i even tried putting the battery in the monitor and its so loud it has no sound. i can't even watch the youtube video with it plugged into my computer. and the usb port does not work. i have to do the following steps:1) make sure the battery is on the back of the monitor, you can do this by disconnecting the power cord from the back and then plugging the USB in.2) make certain that the screen is facing the right way, so i found by turning the monitor on and then looking at the screen while holding down the power button it works. when you disconnect the usb, the display is facing left.3) look at the monitor while holding the power and the USB buttons and make certain they are pressed down. i also noticed that the buttons on the bottom of the screen are not working, it only shows the numbers.4) while you are holding the buttons down, make sure they are fully pressed.5) open up the display with a voltmeter and check the battery levels (if they are ok)6) when you are sure the monitor is powered on and the battery level is still above 15%, close the display and turn off the monitor in the computer.7) reattach the battery and charge the battery to 100% again.now this monitor is great but not reliable, theres a reason i paid around $500 for it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this to replace an original Apple TV I had. I had used this Apple TV for about 6 months. The original AppleTV is in good working condition. I like the fact that the Apple TV remote works on the new TV. The TV has a good picture, sound and internet connection. It does take about a minute or so to connect to your computer with an HDMI cable. The remote is ok, but when you turn it off you lose the music control. I would give it a four star if not for the fact it does not have an aux jack.   Was this review helpful to you?

If theres anything i could change, it would be to make the speaker louder, but otherwise its great.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I recently purchased the HP Pro Tablet 900 on ebay for $150 (after shipping). It's a decent device, the screen has a very small resolution (1024 x 768 pixels, but it's fine), it's got a solid battery, etc. The problem is that it's a terrible computer. I spent about a week trying to get it to work, finally got it to run, and had to reinstall everything. It's slow, hard to get working, and the software is so bad that you'd be better off with a Mac, or a PC with a CD burner. It could use an upgrade, but I'd pay $200 or more just to get the old version back. I would highly recommend the original version of this device. If it had only been $100 less, I would have bought it.

I bought this a few months ago and just had to get it out. The cable is a little difficult to install because of the large hole that it's in. I had to file the bottom side down to install it. I bought it with 2 separate cables because I wanted it to plug in to both sides of my router. It's easy to plug one end into the router and plug the other into your computer. You can see from the picture on the box that it has a little handle on the front of the unit. You don't really need it unless you want it to sit a bit higher than normal. It can't be over 15 cm off the floor at the most.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________________________________________________   First off, I want to say that I am not sure why they call it a "PDA." It is a cell phone, but not like your "real" cell phone. The one for my husband is not like an actual phone because he can use it without a cell or wifi and it does not use a battery. But it is still a PDA, and I use it daily. The main thing I dislike about this product is that it has a dial-out button. This is the first thing I noticed that made me want to purchase this item. I can dial out, but I do not need to. It is much better than the other pds I have, but is not great. It's not hard to use. I wish I had bought a cheaper one. I am a tech support specialist and work with a lot of people with all kinds of cell phones. This pd is just too hard to figure out. It makes me want my old pd back. If there is an upgrade I may buy that instead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i dont like these at all. I've had to replace these 3 times since i started using them in my car. they always give me the weird feeling that i'm watching something weird being broadcast by the television that i don't really care about. they seem to be all over the place, sometimes they just have the sound on and some other times the sound seems to be going on and off for a little while, also it just seems like when i touch them that they start to vibrate which i don;t even want to happen if it's just to power on or for my radio to work. but i guess i'll just have to accept this with my new fcx 480g2.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product does everything it is supposed to do but the interface is terrible. I like how the buttons work but the way it displays them and how hard it is to use is just too much.   My experience:  I received my X1 and wanted to be able to control it from a web browser. This has been a big goal of mine. I use my desktop computer and it is super convenient to be a computer geek and control my TV from a browser. I am very impressed with this, especially for the price and ease of use.   of course it has the big "i" buttons that you would expect but the buttons are tiny and awkward. Also the HDMI input is terrible, the signal doesn't do anything but cut off in the middle of a movie and if the signal has a lot of noise it causes the picture to get blurry or hard to watch. I can't do it on my computer so I would have to plug it in and use a different HDMI cable. I have the same issue on my LG blu ray player, I can never tell if there is something in the signal I don't know about. If the HDMI interface were to change to a better HDMI standard then this would be perfect but as it is, it doesn't work at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******************************   For about 5 years I've had one of these in a corner of my basement, behind my speakers. In all that time the unit has NEVER failed, and even when I had two of the other "bigger" ones on the wall.   I recently bought a new television, and got one of those new LCD units. The newer models have a lot of pixels, so it didn't take me long to start seeing the light and sound problems. I figured the LCD's weren't as durable as the other models. I just got one out of the box, and it was completely dead. No power. I replaced it with a new LCD.   is that a "cheap" TV? I'm a big TV guy, not a video guy.   with that said, the TV is not that bad of a TV, it's just the LCD that is bad.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This does not last longer than a few months of normal use, after that I have had to return the battery for another that has a better lifespan.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Very Good Quality I bought this in an effort to replace a broken cell. The battery lasted a while but the light came on for a few seconds but then went out and was back on in 3 seconds. I have to say that it was a nice looking product and I can see the difference between the old cell and the new one.  as for the light, I can't wait to see the glow of the first night.  the only problem I have is that I cannot charge my phone in it without the battery draining fast, I know its because I was using a usb charging cord for my phone which took away some charging time.  to be continued.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this product for a few weeks now, and I've been using it for various music applications, including Spotify. It works great, and in my opinion the only way to upgrade this is to take out the battery. The speakers aren't the best, the volume isn't as high as a real stereo system, and the quality of sound is just slightly off compared to my home stereo system. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the price point. It's cheap, it's small and light, and it has good sound quality. I would buy this product again in a heartbeat. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- I bought this thing on the recommendation of someone at work.

The first thing that annoyed me was how slow the unit was to boot up. I got it up and it would not boot. I had to go into the BIOS and change the setting to "fast boot". The computer wouldn't even boot up for more than 10 seconds. The second problem was the screen. It would not turn off when the unit is off. I could turn the machine on and the screen would stay on. After changing the setting I was able to boot and the computer would turn off. It took some time to figure out why I couldn't shut the screen off. The third problem I had is that the unit won't charge. I don't know if this has to do with the battery or the charger but it isn't charging. I've been trying to power it on and off and everything keeps failing. So far I haven't had any problems with the USB port on the back of the unit. But I don'...  Works Great for Home Gaming I bought the unit and i love it. It has a good power and its pretty easy to set up and use. You don't have to connect it to the internet to run your games or programs. The one thing is that when you try to run a program, you have to press the button to start it. I do not like this but still very good.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!  I ordered the wireless receiver for my wireless keyboard and it arrived last week. I like the keyboard and I was hoping this would work but it doesn't. If you order a keyboard, order from Apple. The key notches on my model are not in the right place and the cable doesn't fit so there's no way to connect to the computer. My friend bought the same keyboard and also it didn't work. I think it has to do with the keys being reversed.

Its been on my desk all day as my computer or a few hours a week as a backup to my pc. the usb port is great for the cheap price and the usb hub has been useful as well. but the device itself is junk. its made of cheap plastic and is almost completely unusable in its current state. it has had a battery, a cd, usb cable, usb cord and even the box and all of it is falling apart in some places. it will never be used ever again. this is an old school product made out of poor materials that shouldnt be in this state. dont buy it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this as an alternative to my old iPod touch. But I bought it wrong, I got the wrong type of bluetooth speaker.

I'm now going to switch to a speaker that has a better microphone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******************************* - I bought this watch for use as a wristwatch, but in all honesty, I've only used it to count the minutes since the alarm went off for the first time. This watch has absolutely nothing on it. Not even the ability to show the time in a single color. There is nothing to say on how it looks, or how it feels, except that it is ugly. - I use it as a day watch for my wife and I for our daily chores, as well as a running watch for a short walk. I don't know about you, but I have never seen any other type of watch that looks more like it should, and actually does look good, on my wrist. This one is not it. - If I ever need to replace the battery, it will cost me $50. - It's not waterproof, nor can I fit it in a waterproof case, nor is it shock proof. - The buttons are small and hard to press. It's an expensive watch, and I think they could have done better than they did. - This one can't be removed by a screwdriver or any other tools.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you want a small portable computer with good battery life, you need the iBook, if you want great battery life and are willing to pay the extra bucks then you need an iBook with the graphics card. The graphics card is not the best graphics card, but it does the job, and works well for some games. It is also easy to use and works great.   In my case, it works great for games, but a few weeks ago I got an iMac running the Intel GMA 950 graphics and it worked well.  . This is my first laptop and it was worth the money   This is my second laptop. It came with the i5 processor for gaming, which is more than enough. The one problem with this computer is the battery life. It will run out in about 4 hours of normal use.  -  - . I've been using the iBooks with the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics. So far, the graphics is very good, however it does not come with drivers for the graphics, but I can get drivers to work.  The battery life is good. :)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this one for Christmas. After the first day it kept going off randomly. I called customer service they told me to return it. They told me I should just return it to the store and they would send another one. No matter what I did the issue kept happening. The same thing happened to other people. The second one would run and then go back on again. They all ended up returning the same one. The first one lasted about a week. I was going to try to sell it but after reading all of the bad reviews I had to return. I ended up using the spare one to record a music album because I do not have my old one with me. The old one is still working and I would recommend it to people but be prepared for the occasional disconnection.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!!! This thing works well, except it does not have a USB port and I would not buy another one.  It does all I need: I had some problems with my old phone, so I decided to buy this. The phone was easy to set up. The app worked perfectly. The microphone works, but not to the standard it should be. The video was not very good, but was ok. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I recommend this product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i got the moto g4 after trying to find a smartphone for about 6 months and i was disappointed with the results. i think the build quality of the device is not up to par for it's price. the screen has the white on the bottom, so i cant see where the battery goes, the device also has the problem of having very hard to reach buttons and not really having a soft touch. but i still purchased it because of it's size, color, and price, and i'm very happy with it. i'm sure you would also be happy with the purchase if it were your first, however i think its not. my biggest complaints about the device was the screen, lack of a removable battery, and lack of storage. i bought a larger microsd card but i have no idea how to install it, so that part is still a problem.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: **********************   My wife and I recently purchased a computer from ebay to use at work. We needed a computer that was inexpensive and had a good reputation, and didn't have any of the bells and whistles. We found this one and paid about $300 for it. It worked fine initially and I did some research before purchasing it. I found that it had been through the ringer of people that had to reset their computer and repair it because it kept resetting to the factory defaults and was just not reliable enough for me. So I decided to buy a new one.   One of the first things I noticed was that the backlight on the screen wasn't working at all. At all. I checked the monitor, the power supply, the motherboard, and nothing worked. I called my cable company to check the cable and found out that they sent it in for warranty service and that there was nothing wrong with it. So the cable company sent me back to ebay and they charged me $10 for them to check it out and send me a new cable. It took several weeks for them send it out, but when it did, I discovered that the LED on the back of the screen was gone. What is wrong with this screen!   After another few weeks of having it fixed at ebay, I decided it was time to look for a new computer. I didn't want to go through the trouble of having to send my computer back and have it fixed again, so I contacted my cable service provider and they said they'd contact ebay about my case. It turns out that ebay's web site is really poorly written and not very user friendly, so they can't really be blamed for this. So after several months and countless emails, my cable guy called ebay again and asked for another computer. This time he said that he was confident he could get me a computer with the specs I wanted for under $150, plus shipping. So he sent it to me and I never heard from them again.   of course I wasn't happy. This is the second time ebay has been unreliable, but at least I got another computer! I'm not sure if this is the ebay way, but their customer service has always been great.   the first computer I received had a really bad hard drive failure (hard drive failure in this computer was normal). When I called ebeasy.com to get a replacement, the first person they

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    i ordered the gopro 4k for a Christmas gift to a close friend and was really shocked when I received it after just 3 days!   I didn't even get a chance to test it out, it came in an envelope and was sealed in a box with no protection. the screen had been bent out of shape and it looks like the screen was bent inside the box and not the outside of it. i also found the battery to be too thin and i just cant believe that the gs would last more then 1 month at 5v.  i was looking forward to trying this camera because of the great video quality. this camera sucks and I don't think you can recommend this to anyone.   my advice is don't even think about this product. get the gps and the gsm camera if you are planning to use this on a phone or another device. I hope this review gets them to fix the camera and get this unit back in stock.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this for my iMac G4 laptop and I would definitely use it again. I would not recommend buying it for a computer. But for portable gaming/web/email/music this device was a huge steal. It fits in my jacket pocket, works for a full day and looks pretty good too.   If you have a computer with an internal USB port this would probably work great for you. I also use the tablet charger, but I have no issue with it charging from my car stereo in a lot of situations.   in my opinion the price is pretty good for the device.   the biggest problem I had was the quality control on their end. I have a friend that had to return the device because it was scratched and he wanted to pay $200 in return.  .

I have tried to go on vacation without it and it is a huge pain to use. If the screen were larger it would be fine. This is the only thing I can see myself buying again. I'm using it for my tv set.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: *********** I bought this to replace my old iPod nano 2 and it did not work. I called the customer service department and they put me on hold and then left the line and I am waiting on hold for another 10 minutes or so. At that point I'm fed up and put in my order number. When I asked where my order was, they said they could not get it and I could cancel it. The next time I called to cancel it, the person who answered the phone said it was "out of stock" so I took it back and put it back in the order and they could send it out as soon as they get another batch of them. *********
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My old iPad 3 died after only 2 years of use.   After trying to replace the battery, the new one wouldn't charge (it took over 3 hours of holding the button down for it to charge).   I then tried to buy a new one, and the website told me it was out of stock.  I found the device on a friend's desk at work, and figured he'd have it.  The next day, I received the new device in the mail.  At first, it charged fine.  After a few weeks, the battery went dead and I had to buy another one.  No problem with that.  A couple of months after the first battery died, I got the new iPad (2nd one), and everything was fine for the next few weeks.  Then, the batteries went dead again.  Again, I was able to buy yet another battery, but this time it's a new model.  Eventually, the iPad 4 came out, and after a week of use, the two batteries died again. So, when the iPad 5 came out and a new battery didn't work, I decided to replace it.     It worked for about a month, then the battery died again (again).  Finally, I bought the 5th model, and it's been going fine ever since.  So, if you have an old iPad with a new, cheap, battery, give it a few months and it will work fine.   Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ****************** After over 6 months of use I finally stopped using this product. I had just replaced a 2 year old device on my work machine. This one came on my new machine at about the same time. When the power button was pushed the fan came on. I was expecting the fan to automatically shut off after 2 seconds. The fan did not stop until I turned the machine off. So after the battery was almost dead I got it back up, and it was just as bad. It is impossible to turn the machine back on by pressing the power switch. It seems to have no control over itself and seems like it is working more for the computer than for the device. I don't know who thought this up and installed this in a product that would last so little and need so many components. So you need to take your time with the upgrade. I will not be buying another product from this company.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Lulu from Great Buy! Bought one of these just to switch between my Macbook Pro and HP laptop to see how I liked it. So far I have been very happy with this little powerhouse. I love the fact that it doesn't have a power brick or external power supply. So, I just plug it into the power cord on my HP and then plug my Mac into the wall. I haven't needed to switch anything out yet and I haven"t used it all that much. However, since I"m going to be putting more power to my Mac than I normally would, I have to recommend this.  in the future I plan to get a couple more.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is an EXCELLENT toy for a couple of reasons, one being that it has a very high voltage, and 2 being that the tip is made of plastic and not metal like other toy tips.   I love the head of the toy, it has that good feeling of a hard head.  There are some things about it though that can be a little bit of an issue,  First off, the tip that is made out of plastic feels sorta rubbery to the touch, it kinda feels like you're pushing it in and out of your asshole. I know that is sorta a big deal in some circles but I don't understand the appeal.  Secondly, when you use it, it can make a lot of noise, the first time I tried using it I put it in my ass, and the first thing I said was I really wanted to stop using it.  Thirdly, I can't wear it for more than 3-4 minutes without the tip popping out and leaving a white powdery residue on my ass.  It is super strong, I don' think I could go without it for longer than 30 minutes at a time.  If you have been hesitant to get the toy because of the price, I HIGHLY recommend this toy. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: *************************   I have always had problems with my old Sony MP-CD. I found it unreliable and difficult to use, and would often have problems re-synching the CD, as I had to go to an Internet store to purchase software to fix it.   About two years ago I got a new Sony MPX, and I love it. Unfortunately, it also suffers from problems. It will not play CD-Audio from an MP3 or AIFF file. When I open an AIFF CD-A/W file, it plays flawlessly, but when I try to play a CD-R file, the CD does not play. The CD also skips frequently, as if the CD is not playing the file. This means I can't transfer the CD to my Sony MPP, which I use for streaming music to my computer.   (I tried putting my MPP to sleep, then waking it up to transfer the file, but this doesn't help either.)   Sony says the Sony MP X is "unsupported" by the MP-X and that the problem is a hardware problem, and they have a "quick fix."   But I have had problems transferring CDs with my Sony PCM-R500 audio interface. I can play CDs from my Sony R500 interface to an MPX. I have to play them in a specific order, as the MPX doesn't do that for me. It has to be the same song on both interfaces. So I must play from the MP X first, then from the R500, then copy them to my MP P2 and MP P1.   a year or so ago Sony came out with their newest line of MPX computers. The new MPX-S and MPX4 are all compatible with CD-Recorder and CD-RW drives, and can be used to rip and copy music to MPX and MPP drives. They are great. I use them in conjunction with my Mac to rip CDs to MP3 and MP2 files.  ,   http://www.sony.com/us/products/...m-mpx/   This is the best mpx product I've had. I had problems w/MPX, but had a new computer, and it seems to work better w/mpx4 now.   and there are lots of different models of mpx available:   mpx2: http://www-
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am using this product and it's a horrible thing.   It makes the whole sound system in my car sound like the engine is doing it's thing, but if you turn it up it sounds awful.  In addition, it works poorly with the remote control.   My son loves it:  I bought this so he can enjoy the music from the stereo when he is sleeping. So far, so good! I have to listen with headphones at all times as he sleeps, so it does cut down on the sound, but it does not make my ears hurt. It is easy to use, has the volume set all the way, and even has a nice remote so he does not have to look at it to turn the radio on. If you can manage the noise from your child, this is great. My only complaint is the batteries do not last the lifetime of this unit.  It's so cool!:   This radio is so good.  The sound quality is fantastic and the picture looks like a real radio.  I also can see that it fits perfectly in my front seat because it is a little tight. I'm so happy with this purchase!  Good:  A really great radio!:  I was going to go with the Sonos, but I've always been a big fan of the sound quality of the CD/DVD/Tape decks in cars and this one is also nice and cool looking.    But the remote, when I plugged it in the first time, it didn't recognize it as a remote. I had to use the CD changer/TV tuner and after that, it worked as it should. It's a little more pricey than I thought, so I was going with it for now. I can't wait for my other Sonos that I'm thinking about getting. , it really isn't a bad unit. It works well and you can easily switch from the radio to the TV if you want. It has a pretty good sound quality but the picture is not great. If I had it to do again, I would probably get one of the larger units.  in order for the sound to work, I did have to replace the batteries with the new type that came with the unit. so it might not work for long if you are just using the radio in the car. We have a really nice car. It runs really well and with the sound volume
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! This product did not work for me. It would only turn on at night after the heat from the computer kept it from going off in the morning. I could only get it to turn on after a full day of being left at work, and the only way to keep it off when I got home was to shut it off and power it back on. I'm going to return it. This product was not designed for my use. I have been very disappointed in this product.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from It works, but needs a rewire. It is not exactly what I needed, but it will do what I need, which is an external drive. I need it connected to a Mac to be able to use it as a file server. The battery life is a little short for me, but that's to be expected, and I'm just used to the kind of battery life on laptops. I think the price was good and the box was reasonably packaged. Overall a good product, but some changes need to be made. I did like it, although I'd re-use the usb cable and/or get a rechargeable battery. If I'm using it as file server, I wouldn't need the wireless, because the Wi-Fi antenna would be long gone by the time the data would be transferred. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This item worked, but the connection point for the cord was too far back and kept cutting the power to the battery at an unacceptable rate. I would use this again if the cord wasn't so far back. This is a good product, but this could be an area where it could be improved.  Rated 4 out of 5 by mike from Good replacement for old light switch The light switch that came with my old computer had broken and was no longer working. Since I was using the switch on the bottom of my computer case, I thought it would be a good idea to use this replacement switch. This switch has very low voltage drop. It took me about 30 minutes to replace the switch with the GE switch. The only downside is that it was harder to work with. It doesn't have the spring-loaded mechanism that the old switch had. I can't even begin to guess how long it took me to put it in the right position.  a bit difficult to replace  Customer Testimonials

It is very expensive and I am very frustrated trying to make it work.  It has an awful noise on a low volume.  No matter how loud it is turned it is always just loud and annoying.  The cord doesn't work properly on the headphone.  I also can't use the device to talk to the others.  There is a very loud clicking sound when talking to one of the people in my house.

Rated 5 out of 5 by bahamster from Best headset ever I'm an active duty Marine. I was using an old flip phone that was made to be dropped into a muddy area. The phone rang but could not be heard. When I brought it up to my ear to listen, the noise and buzzing that was coming from the phone was just too much for me to handle. I needed to hear my friend and I needed my phone to function. This is perfect!  What a fantastic product. I had always wanted one of these and it finally came in the mail today. As soon as it arrived, I put it on and the first thing that came to mind was "Wow, this sounds really nice". The only thing I noticed right off was that the headset is very long. It is not very flexible and is difficult to use if you are on your hands and knees. I don't think the price is all that bad at all considering all the extras included (which are all there to make life easier), and the fact that you can turn the noise up to a very low volume if you want to get away from the ringing sound. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. ,,,  Very good sound I bought the bluetooth speaker from Bose because I'm very interested in sound for sports. I've been using the new headphones for a few weeks now and the quality of sound is amazing. The battery life is great and the phone stays connected to the computer for as long as it's on the head. It seems to last longer than the old ones I had, so I'm sure the sound quality will continue to improve. I really like the

I have had it now for about 2 months and it has not worked. The button for the device on the bottom will not do anything. It is made of cheap plastic and has no spring that allows it to click. There is a switch that is used to turn on the unit but the switch is very flimsy. It has several scratches on it. I am giving it a low rating because of the price but at least it has a functioning button. I can't afford the quality of this item.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________________________________________________________ I had purchased these two years ago, and one time the screen flickered to the point that I lost my ability to use the TV until I bought a new screen. This one has been the same. When I used my phone and tablet this morning I could not use them because the screen was flashing, I have a Sony camcorder and this makes the phone and screen inoperable. Not a problem with my HDTV. I will probably return the unit to Walmart for a refund.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this thing as a replacement for my iPhone 4/4S. It was extremely buggy and slow and had numerous issues with its screen not working. The problem was a dead pixel on the back of the device. So I bought another one. I have yet to get this thing to work. It always fails to work properly. When the phone is plugged in it runs perfectly but if it's turned off it will never boot up. I called customer support and got a very rude, unfriendly rep. I can't believe this company has a customer support rep that I won't recommend. I am glad I got a different device.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________________________________________________________________________  I have this electronic device that keeps me up to date on the weather. I used it a couple of times and all that did was cause the device to malfunction so I bought a new one that does not have that issue. I've got two other devices and one has the same problem. I would suggest that they put a bigger battery in this one and make it waterproof. I'm glad I bought this model, I'm going to have to replace it with something else.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, June 22, 2010  Not impressed  by: John from Houston TX USA  Pros: Does not fit on my phone. ,  Cons: No battery compartment for phone, need to attach to my backpack instead. -B  Review: This thing works as described, but is far less capable than I wanted. I had to buy an extended battery in order to get it working. It fits a Galaxy Note 2 on it, but it has an awkward and uncomfortable fit. Not only does it have to be placed inside the case, but I don't even know what I should mount it to. The device itself is very light, but even with the included battery, it doesn't seem capable of getting enough juice to keep my phone from dying after a day of use. I bought the extended battery to replace a different device that worked much better.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this as a replacement for my aging HP Deskjet 6000, after it became clear to me that HP's HP Touchpad was a complete failure. The Touchpad is so bad that I had to use the original mouse to type (and for that matter, use my old X-Mouse 2 mouse). The keyboard is so hard to use, it doesn't even feel like a laptop keyboard, you have to hold it. The screen is so terrible, it's unusable, the colors are terrible. And to top it off, the speakers are terrible, not even close to being anything like my old notebook's sound. I would never ever recommend this to anyone, buy an old notebook, it will last longer and last much more comfortably.   Only recommended to: People who are really cheap, who can't tell the difference.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone is ok, but it's not the perfect phone. I'm using it with my Google Pixel and it's nice. I've not had a good experience with my old Nexus 6p. I was looking to upgrade to a Pixel. This phone looks like it will make the Pixel seem cheap. And my old phone doesn't support Face ID, which is the reason I wanted a Pixel instead of this phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for about a year and it wont let me use my ipod or my ipad. it wont read either of them and the battery is so old that it dies after a week of use. i was told it would last about 5 months and it didnt. i bought another one because the one that i had died. now i have the same problem. i dont have an ipad either but if i wanted to i could take out my ipods battery. so why the **** should i have to pay for this worthless **** device. ive given about 7 out of 10 stars and i dont know what i should do with my other 4.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for a little over a month now and the only thing that changes is the battery life. i love the buttons, the brightness, and the quality of the build. but this battery seems to last longer than my previous cell. i can hold it up to 3 hours and then it starts to die after about 4 hours or so. other than that the device seems to work just fine. i just wish i wouldve known that when i bought it that it was a crappy battery before i spent over $100 on it. its cheap but i would not recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The phone will not receive a charge when it goes to sleep. I do not think that this is an issue but it is something to keep in mind when purchasing this phone. I think it is the battery charger. Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Just what I wanted - for the price I was looking for a good phone that didn't break the bank, was good for the family and I love the design. I got the 32gb model, but I recommend getting more if you plan on taking a lot of pictures or watching a lot video. The device is super light, and easy to use. The microphone doesn't work but I'm sure they will soon fix that. I'm just glad I got this instead of a iphone iphones are just too expensive Rated 4 out of five by Anonymous of Fort Lauderdale from Good but a little heavy This is a good little phone. The camera quality is good, I like the 5 megapixels, but the screen is not as bright. It's the camera. But overall, a good device, light enough and easy enough to use without a lot too it. I would recommend it.  Rated 1 out of 1 by Anonymous
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm pretty disappointed with this piece of equipment. It is a really good idea to record a live show, and it makes you feel like you're there, but it just can't hold a steady record for more than about 1 minute without skipping.   I bought the camera and I tried it out to make a movie, but didn't do a good job with it. It has a very slow shutter, and you need to be very, very, VERY close to the camera to get anything.   the picture is not much better, it's not as sharp as you'd expect from a digital camera, and even then, it doesn't have a color filter to make it look better.   The color filter is so poorly done, it looks like the colors are off.   on the other hand, the battery life is great. If you take a picture every 2 minutes with a single battery, you can get about 20-30 pictures. The camera takes a good picture and you can save it to the memory card. If your not using it for that, you're not wasting the battery power, which is nice.  , but I didn't use the battery very much, but my picture quality is not that good. It can record videos, but the video quality is quite poor. I'm not an audio person, so I'm glad I didn,t buy the camera, so that I could have better audio quality.  . it took me about 6 months to pay off my credit card, it was just a lot of hassle.   I'm going to try to get a cheap computer again and get the same kind of camera again. If this is too much trouble for a camera that will only record to the hard disk, I'll probably go with a point and shoot camera instead.  Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________________   The Best I had a pair of Koss headphones for years, so I've got a couple of sets and the Sennheiser HD 800's. But if you're not used to earphones, these are absolutely great. I can hear my music more clearly than I could on my Koss. These are also very comfortable (like earphones). I had some issues with the headphones going out of phase (in the wrong direction). I thought they were just loose or defective (but they are actually quite solid). I got the'soft' set (not the earphone) and these work so well!  By Dan - October 2, 2014
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this in August of 2008. I was very disappointed in my purchase of the V6 model. I had to go out of town for 6 months and return to get the original charger/charger that came with the device. I also returned the device and was so sorry for the frustration I had with it. I wish I had gone for a different model of V6 since the V3 I have has a lot of problems. The only things that worked were a few buttons that were set up for a particular game. The original V6 worked so well I bought the V7 version because the V5 didn't work for me. I think I will look into the next one and see if I can get it working with my new games.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had mine for two years and its the worst computer i have ever owned the screen doesn't even show the time and its all over the place and the usb ports are not usb 2 ports and they are made of cheap plastic that leaks and theres no way to use a usb charger on it it just sits on the usb slot in the bottom and wont charge the ipad it will only charge on a pc or mac so i replaced the screen and usb port to usb cable the problem is still there and the only way i can get it to work is with the screen off and just using it as a monitor so if you have an ipad that you wont be able to use as a computer unless you are super handy i dont recommend it  Review of DJ0268-03 Submitted By: tony - Verified Buyer It works fine. but i think the design and design quality is just awful. It is so small and weak and easy to bend. But, i do use it a lot. And i don't really have much use for the internet anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have the 3.5in Panasonic DVD writer and it's pretty bad. It's hard to watch and if you press the play button there is no sound. It was advertised as an audio writer but I found that it doesn't support Dolby surround, so you can't get stereo. Also it's slow. It takes about 8 mins to write a movie and another 10 mins to rip to the CD.  The DVD writer has a lot of power and I was using a laptop. You have to put the computer inside a case before the DVD drive will fit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The quality of the watch is terrible; it's very heavy, and the button has poor tactile feedback for its small size.  As for the battery, it's pretty good but does have a low battery indicator light that goes out a lot.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!! What an electronic device! I've had my new RODE ZERO for 6 days. I don't like that it takes so long to connect the battery with the usb connector. It's so bad, it's annoying. I would rather buy a car charger or something that works. If you have a device that's not working, it probably has a faulty USB connector. I love the ZERO. It is a real great device, but it's too slow to charge and connect the batteries. I also find it annoying that the charge port and the battery are so close together.

The only thing this tv does is record what is going on on my computer, It has the ability to store about 40 minutes of video. The picture is absolutely garbage. the only reason i gave it a 5 is because it was free. The next tv i get from apple is going to be a 3d tv. I will never buy another Apple product, they have ruined my experience with the company.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    1. The touchpad works fine but if you use a mouse (like me) or if you are a gamer (like myself) it is a little too big, you could still use a stylus on it but you would be limited in the things you can do like drag and drop.   2. There are two buttons on the screen instead of just one, it would be nice to have all the buttons on one screen or on the edge of the screen so you could hold it with both hands instead of two hands.   this is my first time using the touchpad and I must say it is not very intuitive. I can not use it on a laptop because it doesn't have a mouse, but I would have loved if there was a way to set the position of the buttons so that I could touch and click. The keyboard is a very nice touchpad too, it doesnít have too much travel, but is responsive and is just the right size.  ,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  When it went down, I was confused at first because it was working fine all day. I put it in my pocket and forgot about it until it stopped working. I turned it on and the device was very weak. I thought maybe the battery was dead or something because it didn't respond. But then I remembered the USB cable was plugged in. I plugged it in and tried to charge. The device only lasted for about 3 minutes before it died again. I don't think it can handle the constant USB charging and USB rebooting that you have to do. That is why I don' think the battery is the problem. I did not return it to Best Buy. Instead, I just left it there and went to Wal-Mart to get a new one. I'm a little disappointed that I couldn't get an expert to help me out because I didn't know I had the problem until it was too late to return it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ***********************   This item is defective! (See pictures)   I have just bought a 3rd of a box of these for my grandson. My grandson had been playing around with one of the units and after about 3 days he dropped the box on the ground and broke the plastic casing on the unit. I was able to get it apart and now I find that there are tiny cracks in the unit (see photos).   After contacting Sony to send me a new unit to replace it I am going to have to return it. This is the first one that I have heard of that has this issue. I have bought a lot of electronics over the years and I have NEVER had an issue with these type of units. They have worked great for years! This is a major problem for Sony and I am a little upset that I bought one of these when I did!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I love it! When it first came out, I wanted it because of all the nice reviews, but since I am not a DIY person, I did not know what all I needed. I got this, and while it has all the features that I was looking for, it's very slow to process, and it is impossible to turn off on my laptop. I bought the 4gb so that I would have plenty of memory and a faster hard drive, but I really don't need that. I am a total beginner and it was so much harder to figure out than I thought it would be. I really wish I got the bigger 2gb. It's only $2 more.  Rated 5 out of 5 by TofuMan from I love the product I bought this just over a year ago, and I use it at work every day. I have 2 TB drives and it has been an easy upgrade. I do have one issue with it, it takes a while to get up to speed. The only thing that I have found that does work is the software, so the drive itself, that's probably just me being stubborn and impatient. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using this for 2 years with no issues, and the problem was when i tried to update it to a newer version, i noticed it would not install. So i called apple support and after a week of waiting on hold the guy said i can't do a firmware update for the usb adapter because it is a new model and he was unable to send me a new one or even a new usb adapter. It also seems the tech support is in the same boat as the customer service rep. He just seemed confused and did not know what i was talking about when he got on the phone. So in conclusion, buy from another company if possible. i would give them no stars if I could. It does have some nice features but it is just not worth it to me.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bill from I bought this to replace the USB adapter that I used to sync my iPhone 5 with my computer. It works great. The only thing I don't like about it is that when it is connected to my computer it takes longer than when the device is turned off. But, the sync is still good. I don`t know how they can make it a wireless one, so they can be easily connected to and used at the same time.  (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a very slow-moving, slow-sensing, extremely unreliable and unreliable device. I had the bad experience because I did not want to be a guinea pig. I did as suggested and put it on the bottom of the refrigerator. No matter how fast I turned it, it would not get any higher, so I turned the thermostat up to the max and turned it off. It has taken a few months to learn the way it works.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery was dead when I got it. The instructions say to use the included battery to start it and charge it in another battery or using a spare cell in the box. I had the box open so that I could see the battery and put a battery in that did the trick.  It was in the middle of the night and I had no battery charger on hand. I plugged it in and it started up right away and charged up to about 60%. I have it set to auto start every time I plug it in. The only problem is that when you turn the volume up too high, it plays loud. If you have a small stereo like me, you might be able to fix that by changing the volume control.  I will keep it until I find a good replacement battery.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------------------- I purchased this unit a year or two ago and I really like it, but it is very loud. When you take it out of the box and plug it in it is loud and makes the car shake a bit. I thought it was an auto noise or something that happened when it was on and when it is turned off. So I put it in a separate room for the night and it goes away. When I wake up it is louder and I have to turn it off in the morning. It's almost as bad as the speakers in my tv. I think I will just leave it out for the next day and then turn it on when I use it.

Ive had a lot of success with the sound of my iPhone 6 Plus, and this is literally a giant let down. If i was going to invest in a new speaker, i would go with my own speaker, and not this cheap plastic piece of junk. I have to say though, my husband loves his new iphones, he just hates this product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------- I bought this device to replace my aging Apple TV. The new Apple TV plays back H.265 video, but the old Apple TV only plays back h.264 video. For most of the last 6 years, I have streamed video over my home wi-fi and Apple TV (the older one) to my computer or iPad with Apple's Media Player or the Windows Media Player. It works fine for casual streaming, but video quality is poor, especially during slow motion. I've tried all kinds of streaming services and the only one I really enjoyed was YouTube, but even that suffers from poor video quality. As I'm in the middle of an Xmas season and I have a couple of nice big HDTVs to put it on (with great audio), this is not an option for me. I'll have to wait to see if my wife has better luck with Netflix. It's a shame that an Apple device can only do one codec, so they can't provide a device that plays almost every video format available. My recommendation would be to wait and see if the Apple TV is updated to support 4k streaming, and then try that if you don't want to wait for Apple to update.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to use as a remote control for my tv set. It has worked great for that but the remote itself works poorly. It doesnt work from the tv or from any of the input devices. The buttons work fine but the control knob is so small and the buttons so small that it takes a long time to change channels or change volume and when it does work it is difficult to do it. I used this on the tv for a while before switching over to this remote control.    Works as advertised:  (3/10)  This is great for controlling my cable box. I'm a cable guy and had an old one that was falling apart. I just got this one and it works awesome. The remote is very light weight and the button is very responsive.  A must have! (5/10):   This remote control is fantastic. It works great on a TV and the control is very nice to use. This is an outstanding remote that does its job well. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery power is very good. But when the battery drain on my iPhone is at 0% I can hear a buzzing/mumbling sound from the headphones. Then I can't hear the speaker either. It seems to me like it is working in standby. But if I switch it on, then the headphones have a good sound output. But I really need to work out why this happens.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had mine since october. i had a broken usb cable that i had to buy a replacement. i finally took it to a shop near my house and they replaced it for me. i also had to replace the power supply (from a broken battery) and a faulty usb port. the only problem is that ive noticed the light coming from the usb port when i plug in my computer, this is not so good. i did have the phone cord as well but the phone would not turn on. the bluetooth works fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been buying these for 2 years now. i think its a good product, but the customer service isnt very good at all. they send the defective one back to my house and when i contacted them on it, they said they never received the defective item from you, but they still sent it back to me. i was so mad i couldnt sleep for about a day, and my daughter had to sit next to me while i cried. i would recommend buying from another company.  Rated 5 out of 5 by MxC from My daughter needs this! I bought this for her. It has helped with the aches she gets from using a crutch. Her left knee hurt very badly. She used to sit on it all the time but now it doesnt hurt so bad. I have 2 of these, one to put in my car and one for my kitchen.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the ipod/iPad mini/mote/ipod touch for my wife to use with her computer. She got the ipad mini and she loves it. The device works great for her. She likes that the battery doesn't last that long. The ipod touch does not work very well. It starts up and goes on a bit and then gets very slow. I didn't use the device very much since it came and it's not good.  Have had this item for almost a year and it still works,but this is the only thing I would call a problem. It works well for me and my wife. She has two ipods. One for her laptop and one for her ipod. My ipod 3rd gen works great with all her ipods and one of hers doesn't work with the ipods that she bought.

I use it to charge my iPhone 6/6 Plus (iPhone 6+) and also use my Windows 10 laptop/iPad. The device will charge the phone but if the phone is in airplane mode or on silent or low, it will not charge. The cable and adapter both look great and it is very easy to use with your phone/device. ,  See all 7 customer reviews
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! Don't buy this device! I had to return it a second time for the same reason. I used to have a similar product but this one had the same problem, the unit started making a noise at high speed. This time it was louder, I couldn't hear the unit running. This unit is not reliable at all and I'm pretty sure it will not run at the advertised speed.  My Recommendation: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: *************************** If I was able to purchase this item myself I would've given it 2 stars and left a 1 star comment, but since I cannot I will. I had the pleasure of owning this device a few months back. This unit works great, the display is very clear and the speakers are clear and loud. However, the software it comes with is really bad. I have to go back and forth between a windows operating system and a mac OSX Operating System to get it to work, this would not have been an issue for someone who was looking to purchase a new computer, however, I'm an internet guy and just wanted to get some video streaming. Since the software has to be changed every time it's set up, it is really frustrating. My only saving grace is that I am not a PC user, so this wouldn't have been a problem. If you are looking for a new video streaming device, this will do, however I can't recommend this product to someone who is not familiar with computers or the operating system used.

I would never buy this product. Its too expensive.   I have to say, the light is awesome, I was amazed at the output of the light when I got it. I can see all the colors at the same time, the white light is bright and very strong.  ...  Good quality item for the price. I bought one of these for myself. It is a great product. It gives me the option to light my house or other things with one bulb. I am very satisfied with the product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't know if this is a good or bad thing because I have 3 of these things and they are all a pain to use.   1. The battery life is pretty mediocre at best, I used to have good luck with these but since I replaced my last one (about 2 years ago) I've had to replace it with 3 of the exact same thing.   and the charger it came with is a nightmare. I always get hot and it always ends up in a battery explosion.   was pretty surprised at that because I thought the last one was ok, but they seem to make the charger so flimsy and poorly made. It breaks easily and I'm not gonna get a refund.   a different company made a better charger.  .  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is not a good product. It doesn't even come with a power cord. It only comes with the usb power cord and it's not even a usb to usb or usb to USB 2.0 cord. You can't charge it. It's just a charger with a usb wall wart. When I got it, it was very cheap and the device is very cheaply built. The wires are too thin and the battery won't even hold a charge. If I was planning to purchase a 3rd party device, I would not do business with this company.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am new to vaping and the e cig with this thing is really not a good option for me,   It has some very slow heating times,  If you are only using this for heating e cig and not e liquids,  This thing will take hours to heat up to a temperature that you would like to vape,  I have tried a couple of other brands and their heating coils are better.  The only other problem I have with this device is the battery is a bit of a mess.  I tried cleaning the battery and recharging it and then it doesn't work anymore,  So please get a new battery that you can plug in and not have to clean.  It is a cheap and dirty device that should be replaced.

I purchased the unit for the purpose of learning a little more about the "Mighty Micro." However, after having it for just a short time, the unit and its interface are beyond the capacity of any beginner to figure out how to operate. I am not able to use the unit in a reasonable time frame. The controls seem to be of the standard, un-intuitive variety, and there are too many switches and buttons to be comfortable to use. I would have to say the unit is of substandard quality and service to warrant the purchase of another Mighty Micro.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ************************ I've been using an iStick for a few weeks now, and I'm really impressed with how it performs so far. The remote is pretty accurate (when I've tried other remote's), it has good battery life (for my taste), it's easy to use, and it looks really cool. It's not as cool as the remote in a Slingbox, but it does the job. The only problem I've had was with the USB port. I've gotten so many different cables that work with the device (even different cable lengths and colors), but the only one that fits all the times is the one that came with the remote. I finally decided to buy an extension cable for the port, and that works perfectly. I'm actually using that cable now as an extension to a USB flash drive. The battery life and remote accuracy are the main reasons why I've chosen to use it. I just wanted something fun and easy that didn't require me to have a bunch of cords and cords and cables.  Review of DJ0268-00 Submitted By: Anonymous - Verified Buyer I use the snd it works great no issue's so far but I am having issues with the sb connector at the back of the device so it wont fit in the s3. That's why I ordered a hdmi. It doesn't seem to be compatible with the hdmii the only thing that works on it is a cable that uses the ssd in the back so I had to buy that cable as well. I love the sck but it is small in my car so I was thinking the ssc but I have no idea if this would fit in my r.v.  the ssth is good it fits in my trunk good but a bit small  I do not know how long it will hold out the device can't find any issues with it so far so for the price I would recommend it it was a very well thought out purchase  Great Remote & Battery Life, Great Price!

I have not used it much, but it has been working flawlessly.  in fact, my wife says its so good she bought two. One for her and one for me. She is very happy with it, the price was good, and the performance is excellent.  it is well worth the price of admission. I recommend this product.  of course this review is for the G5. This is a good deal in comparison to the G3.  and that the G4 is so much more powerful and useful... and is no longer supported (not even at Best Buy).  I have just purchased the G6, but haven't tried it yet.  for now i will say this is a GREAT value  i do not believe I will ever buy anything else but this model from now on  and for those of you with old computer that no longer can take the full power of the G10, or your old phone.... I just found this website that has a good price on a new computer and a memory card with enough memory to upgrade the old computer to G10. . The phone is now my favorite piece of equipment. The price is reasonable for a phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------ I bought this to listen to my computer speakers. I had them professionally installed but the sound was a little muffled.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! The watch was great but had a big problem - the batteries are not rechargeable and you have to charge them every few days or else they die.  I got this watch for Christmas so I wasn't looking for an electronic gadget, but I figured it would be nice if I had an inexpensive way to check my watch's battery. Well it's not. So I had to use a battery charger to check it... it was useless. I ended up putting my watch on my desk in case the battery would die. Not a smart move as I didn't know about this problem until after the purchase. Also, the watch was designed with a metal body, but when I put it on my wrist, it had a plastic case. What a shame. I didn''t expect anything better from this company.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this unit since last year. the problem with this one is that the back light is dimming. i can't turn it on, it shuts off. so i have a small light in my front of my car. i just have to hold it over the bulb. i know what this means. i had to buy another to replace this one. but now i have 2 and if the unit does not work then i will just buy another, because of all the complaints about it. I hope this one lasts at least as long. I've heard that some of the batteries have bad li-ion technology and that's why the battery keeps shutting off. it's sad that you cant have a good product and also be able to have a low price. i hope it lasts.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mike from It's a little bit pricy for this size, but it did a great job, I had a old model that was so terrible, I replaced it with this. If you're looking for a light, get this. It works great, and the price is great.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     When I first got this keyboard I loved it but after a while it just got annoying. I kept hitting the Fn-F4 button many times in the same place to make a key go on. I did get some other switches with different tactile feel but the main thing that made me dislike the keyboard is that it has a weird backlight. It's way too bright and you have to turn it down. It is still functional but it makes my eyes hurt. I just got my replacement and I'm glad I got that! It's now one of my favorite keyboards! I also tried the wireless version but I think they've had the same issue because I can't turn off the backlight! That's why I get this keyboard because of the wireless. I'll give it 4 stars for the most part.  I'm really disappointed in this keyboard. - I would say the keyboard could have more functionality and have more space to put on the keys as well as more spacing between them. This keyboard is actually a little bit hard to reach buttons and I can feel a slight bump when pressing the top row of the keys. I get it, this is how it works, but it really detracts from the whole experience of using the keyboard. The keys feel flimsy and do not fit my fingers very well and the top half of the keyboard can actually slip out of the way when I'm writing in a hurry. I also found the keycap is really hard to fit into my keyboard (I have this on a Logitech MX Red). I hope the manufacturer or whoever is making this keyboard can make the keycaps a bit more durable and have a more solid feel.  the top side of the main board, the metal thing. it's plastic at the top. not the best. 1st set of keys, the top rows are a little wobbly as well. i had to bend a couple of them. 2nd set, i had a couple issues with my set. first, some of the key caps are actually kinda off in my set of keyboards, the caps from my set had a little too many "holes". the keys would just bend up and down. but the bottom row keys are really cool and actually really smooth and I was pretty disappointed when I took it out of my packaging, the bottoms would be very stiff to insert into my set but I ended up bending them a little to make them fit a little more snug
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for 6 months. its been through a lot. it comes with one 2 channel mic and one 4 channel mic. ive done a lot of recording and recording with this mike. i just installed it in my dalton a and its not going to work on the computer. i am not sure if there is a problem with the usb plug. i have had a lot on my pc, computer, and other devices. the dalto i think is supposed to work with a usb 2.0 connection. this usb is supposed too be 2.1 and the dals usb port is usb 1.0. the thing gets in and out of the computer so i cant use it. i did not try the usb 1 and 2. ilyouve had an expensive mic but i did it with a cheap mic. i wish i had a good one. I dont know if I will buy another one as the one i have isnt doing me much good. the mic isnt very sensitive and is very picky.  ive always hated using cheap mics because they always suck. the ones i love are my ilyo mics. the yamaha mics suck and my ics are great.  Good mike, good price. Was this review helpful? Yes No  Very good for the money. Was in a hurry, and this was a good alternative to the M-Audio Delta 101. It has a solid build, and is reasonably priced (about $100). However, I found the mic to have a very loose clamping mechanism that would bend a bit during a recording session.  in use so far with a 2.5 meter cord. No complaints here. .  (12/14/2013)  i have used this mic for the last month or so and it has performed amazingly well! so far, it has been great when I've been in a rush to finish a project and the mic gets the job done. not too sensitive, not too picky, and it sounds great. i've been using it with two 2.2's and an m-audio usb adapter, which i've just found works fine when plugged into a computer. The mic works very well with them both. the only con that i can think of would be if it had a built in mic preamp. I know that mics that have a mic preamplifier do cost more, but there are
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: *********This device is junk, its very bad and i would not recommend it. The keypad has been known to randomly stop working completely. Even worse if you have a different key in use than your normal key. I had a 2 year old version and this was the very first time I used it. I tried it for 10 mins and then after the first minute I was using it on my iPhone. Then after 5 mins it would not work. I changed the keypad a few times and it would work every time. The battery life sucks, this is a 2 hour charge for a battery that is so cheap to replace. It doesnt even last a full day, i have to charge it every 3 days when I am away. This device will not last a day. You can find better devices out there but you will pay a premium for them, at least i dont have to worry about it getting stolen. If you use the touch screen for anything at all, then do yourself a favor and save your money and get a touch screen with wifi.  The device looks like it could have been more professional. There is not a very wide area for your finger to press down and it will be difficult to use your thumb if you are trying to make quick notes. You have to hold it very straight with your thumb. It does work very well and I am using it as my primary device. I use it for my business and my job, so i will always have it with me. . I would recommend this to anybody who wants to take advantage of the good specs for the price. If the display was better I would give it 5 stars but it is fine. The device is nice to have but it does not replace my phone, it is more like an additional device. So this is not the device to buy if your looking for a true android phone, but if you're looking for the best feature packed device that you can get at a low price and if you want to have access to all the newest apps and functions without paying too much I think this is the right choice.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have one of these devices but I think it was made by Toshiba. They use the same processor and sound card. It works OK until one day the sound turned off. I called the number on the back of the device and got no answer. I tried to return it but they will not accept returns from outside the United States. I have no idea what went wrong. I had been using the phone and computer and it is now only on the sound card! I have a Toshiba laptop and I don't think that is a Toshian defect. It will probably last forever but I hate to give up my computer over this. I'll be going back to my old machine but I will pay more for a new one. If you need a good sounding computer try these devices. I'm very disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I ordered one of these to use in my new home and I love it. However, the battery lasted only 6 days. I did not find any warning to tell me about this.  From: John  Rating: Date of purchase: 6/18/2015  12-16-2015 I use my laptop every day for work and school. It's just a good all-around computer. I have two of these and they seem very robust. They've never failed me yet.  of course, I would purchase another if i found one in a price I could afford. i use to be able to get a replacement for 2.99 and if you order online and get a free shipping it gets pretty cheap. . I use it mostly as a word processor and email program and there's not a ton of use for it on my desktop. I keep the windows logo on it but that's just for the cool factor and it does the job. It has the speakers on it so you can have the sound while working but, it's just not going to be used much for that purpose. My laptop has a lot of storage space and I could put in another hard drive. It can also work as a home or office computer. There are lots of places that offer to buy these but, I am glad I found you guys. I'm looking for a new machine.    From:" JEALOUSH!"  Date: 09-30-2015  with an extra star for customer service. I am a computer repairman for many years in the United States. I find that this product works flawlessly and it is really easy to use. The only con I found on the product is the price. I paid $25.00 and I get it 4 days from purchase date.  I wish I would have ordered it 4 months earlier. ,,, The only problem I had was the batteries not being replaced when they broke. They lasted a month of heavy use. I got a replacement on June 26th from my previous store., I would definitely recommend this product.  with only 4 stars... I do not have many negative things to say about it. The quality and the ease of use. You are welcome to order another one for 2/3 of the cost. My only suggestion is that there should be an instruction manual. I used to have a manual but, now I don't.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!!! I am very disappointed in the quality of the electronic device and how difficult it is to use.!!! The remote control is too small to be used with a handheld device and the touch screen is too difficult to operate.     Have had mine for about a month and have been using it every day for a work project. Works great but the remote is to small. I would recommend this product to others but this one is not worth the money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used this many times now, and it is the worst piece of crap ive ever used, I've had 2 in my life and this one sucks ive spent over $200 on them and my laptop dies in less than a day from it, you dont even have to use it for any purpose, it literally doesnt work, it doesnt even run the screen properly, my other one is still up and running for over 6 months, this is the same thing, and i am already waiting for a return, its like its broken and no one ever fixes it
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used this before and after that i started to get some problems. now the battery is not working, the usb port isnt working, and if you want to connect your computer you need a usb cable to connect.  Good device, but needs a better battery: I recently bought a second hand ThinkPad L530 from Dell. This was my first Thinkpad laptop and it has been a bit of a struggle with the battery. When it does die the laptop does not reboot correctly and you need to press the power button and it automatically turns back on. This device also has a problem with its wireless chip not working when connecting to another Thinkpad. This is a very annoying thing because this means I can't use it to try out some software and see how it works. There must be a firmware or wireless solution on this laptop. Also when charging the battery it does have problems charging. I have replaced the battery twice with no success. I also tried the bluetooth adapter but it works fine with my second hand l530 so why not replace the battery? I also replaced the keyboard with a Lenovo Thinkpad Keyboard but still no success and I do not like the look of the keyboard.  on second thought if you do have problems with the usb usb cable or wireless this is a decent device but only if you have a laptop with decent battery life. i dont know how much longer this will last and what the battery life will be like.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------------------- "Very poor value, and only works on two of the 3 different plugs I bought. The only good thing is that I have the phone in it's cradle so it can be used as an external phone charger, but not a real charger. Also the cord for the USB cable was terrible. It's got an orange colored wire inside the cable, and that orange colored cable has 3 strands that look like the tip of a cigarette lighter. So, it's not much of a cord. "
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for over a year now and it still doesnt work. The first time it stopped working ive thought ive got to be crazy. ive tried to use it in multiple ways that it wasnt working. ve tried the cable, the battery, and the usb plug. all of which failed. i have to do it all the time to get it working again. its so frustrating! ive gone to the store 2+ times now and they can only repair it for the amount of money they charged me and wont tell me why ive been given such a low chance to get this worked on again. its almost impossible to get my phone to work on my home network when im trying to use the computer to read emails and email. my internet connection at home is just as fast but i can't use it on my computer for ive lost a lot of time in trying to get ive device to work ive only been using it a few times. I have tried going online to find the correct parts for my device but cant find them anywhere so i have to get them locally so ive just decided ive gotta have a different android phone if ive going to put that much money into this ive cant get my device to function at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ***************************** I bought this in April, 2018, and I've been using it for about 3 weeks now. It's a cool phone, but the battery life is pretty bad. If you are using it at night, it may last a week, but I have the phone with me all the time and it gets low on battery about once every three days or so. It gets to around 25%, and then it gets very weak. It doesn't have a screen protector, and it's not like the other phone that the battery is made of, so the screen is exposed all the way up to the case. I've had no problems with the phone so far. If your reading this, and don't have an iPhone or Android device, give it a try. It is a great deal for $30.00.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for the last 4 years and it isnt an original so the buttons on the touch screen arent going to work i can still use the touch panel to adjust it, but every other time i have plugged it in it is constantly making this buzzing sound when i try to turn it off and it doesnt seem to work at all, so i cant turn it on anymore and the buttons dont work either. ive tried a few different models to find out why it is not working i think the one i got was faulty. i think i have a broken touch panel and i want to take it back, but i have to wait for my tech to get here first because they are closed and ive been working there for 4 years, its a shame they closed their shop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device is fine but the battery is a big disappointment! I have used this device for years and am completely disappointed in the battery. Not once has it been able to hold more than a few hundred milliamp hours of constant use. I use it to play games like Pokemon and Pokemon Colosseum. It will charge about every 2 weeks, which is fine, but you should not expect it to have enough power for hours of intense gaming. Also, the device is small and awkward to hold and use when you are gaming. I wish it was longer so it would fit in my hand a bit more comfortably. I have read a lot of reviews on here about other issues with the device. I do not have any problems with any of them. The device was good in the beginning, but the power consumption over time is too high to be used without an AC adapter. Also I noticed the micro USB charging port is very sensitive and can't charge a computer cable that is too long. Also the case that comes with it is very cheap and easy to break. I don't know if it is just me, but mine has a crack in it. I'm planning on ordering a case for it to replace it.  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Monday, March 30, 2017  Good product  by: James T. from Michigan   I have a friend with one of these for his iPad and it is really good. I also have an iPod Nano and he likes it a lot. I love the way the charger fits so he can carry it around. I am not much of a video gamer but he gets much enjoyment from it. He said it is a lot easier to charge then his old device and more power efficient. It is good for what I want it to do and has all of the things I need for the iPad. 's great! it fits in my pocket perfectly, it charges my iPod very quickly, I love how easy it is to recharge my iPad from it, I do have an iPad mini which I still use to play movies.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using it for over a year now...i just dont get what they are trying to do...i can easily turn the fan down with the button, i use the button as the temp control and it doesnt matter..the temp is always the same i can adjust it to my comfort. The only reason i didnt give this a 4/5 is the sound....i use a tv/sound bar...and when i have a full battery the sound from the unit is very loud....its not annoying but it does bother me when my tv is on loud. This is the only reason why i dont give it 5/5...other than that its a good product that works good, i would purchase it again if i needed it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________________________________________________________________________ This device is junk! It is extremely slow, noisy and has some serious problems. This is not an ipod as the description says. It is an apple phone! The software that came with it is awful! It has horrible lag. The screen is so small that it is difficult to read and has to be pushed up with my arm to make it larger. There is no way to turn it off. The battery will last a little longer, but will eventually die. It will not allow you to use your phone in airplane mode, which makes it almost unusable. I had to buy a new apple watch. It was the best purchase I ever made, although i have a ton of cash. My watch is a better experience. I would give it 1 star if there was a way to change the software or make it look like the description. Not good.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So the device is great. Great design. Nice size. I wanted a new iMac so i bought one. I did not like the way that the device would turn off without your permission (after 3-5 min). It would get to the lowest brightness setting and then just shut off automatically. It took a long time to do anything on the device, and was very frustrating. I also don't like that the power button is on the bottom of the unit (like other computers). It should be at the top. The only time that I would use this product is if I have it in my vehicle. If it is inside the car, it would probably be best to change to a device that has a "lock" button. That's it.   And the worst thing is that the batteries that you get are a terrible liitle expensive and they won't last long, maybe a year. I'm trying to decide if I should buy another.  - I've heard so many great things about the battery life, but i wish i got the same batteries for my other iMacs, i think they have the same ones, if not the same liitle smaller size too.   the iMac was a great buy, and now i wish I went for it with a usb power supply, i wouldn't be spending so much on a computer and a usb cord. And the battery pack it came with didn't last a week so i was afraid i might want another battery.  .  ,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this phone to replace my old Nokia Lumia 820.  I have used the 820 a lot so I knew it was a fantastic phone, however I had a hard time finding something similar to the 820 in the current market, and even then it was $400 more.  For those that do not know the Lumia 820 is the most popular phone in the US.  It has the most customizable features out there, and is still very much a flagship phone.  My favorite features on the 820 are the screen, camera, and battery life.  The only major problem I had with the 820 is its size and weight.  This phone is too big and bulky, I would definitely rather have a smaller phone.   The phone itself is solid with a sturdy build, but a couple of the buttons on the side are hard to use.  Also, the battery is not removable and will not fit in my pocket.  If you are going to upgrade to a Nokia device, then this phone is definitely worth the extra money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased my 3DS at a local Best Buy last Saturday and took it home that evening. The 3DS shipped that day so the tracking number didn't work. After several hours, it finally tracked to my location. The unit arrived a week after the purchase. No problems. All the hardware was there. I uninstalled all the previous software except for the original New Super Mario Bros. Wii. The first time I turned it on, it made a clicking/hissing sound. After a couple of times of that, I turned the unit off and restarted the console. That did not help, the sound and clicking kept going. I took the unit to my local GameStop and they said that the unit would need to be returned to their facility to be tested. They took it back to the store and a guy tested it, and said that no problem, the unit works fine. He took the console back, replaced all the old hardware with the new units and put the 3DS back together. It worked again! I am very pleased with the product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using the iBasso digital music player for many years. i was a die hard music nerd in the 90s and used a large collection of analog and digital gear and they all worked, but the i basso was a HUGE disappointment. i tried to return it over and over and it kept breaking and had to be repaired. its also pretty loud in the room it is in, but this is an obvious drawback when i have my earbuds, ipod/iphone in hand, listening to my music on the large iBassoon speaker system. the only good thing about this unit is that it has an extremely long battery life, but when my iBASSO goes dead it goes dead for good. that is why i got a cheap ebay one and bought another iBassin...

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was really surprised at how little I really needed it. I was doing a lot of writing, so I wanted it to keep writing for me. I could use it as a paper weight if I needed something else. However, once I started to use it for writing, it did not keep writing. It kept going off and on. The batteries ran out about two weeks after I bought it. The thing is, it worked fine the entire time I had it and then suddenly started working a few days later. I will say, it was a great deal for me, especially with the good price. But it does not work the way I needed it to. I would not recommend this product. It works as a tool, but not as an actual writing tool.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________________________________________________________________________ This product failed on me immediately after a full day of using it for about 2 hours before noticing it wasn't plugged in. I went to a local electronics store to have the unit looked at but was told I'd have to buy a new one and the service technician refused to fix it because I didn't have a receipt. The phone is fine. It's not the greatest when it's connected to an AC outlet but that's expected with most of today's smart phones. The audio quality is just about perfect for me. I don't notice any lag when playing music but it definitely isn't perfect. It would be great if it had a better video streaming option since I have a 4K television. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the same device since 2002, it was upgraded in 2009 when i purchased another phone. i had an apple iphone 6, this phone replaced it in my pocket. the apple ipod touch is a bigger version of this phone, i purchased a new one last year to replace the iphones 6 because the ipods 5 is the same. ive been extremely happy with the ips, but the apple ipod touch has not. it took 3 months to get the phone working, no matter how much it was charged. iple thought i would get a more expensive phone with all the bells and whistles and it worked, this ipod, which is smaller in size, does not. i was expecting to get a larger ipod with tons of bells and butters. i am returning this one. ********************

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a few of these since they came out, but they have gotten more and more unreliable over the years. i bought a refurbished one a while back that worked for about a year or so. now, the battery is dying on me almost every day for 2 days, and theres really no indication i can find as to what is going on or why the battery doesnt work. i could just throw it out, which would also be cheaper (the batteries were cheap from what i could see) but i have to hold it to get it going again, and i cant even do that with the charger it came with. now i just get out of bed and hope it dies on me, or lets me get on a plane and forget about it. i cant imagine the stress and stress it must be taking on a family who has an ibook and a macbook and wants their child to have something to read while they are out. i would say that there should be some kind of warning that this will NOT work for more than a year if it doesnt work every single time, so that people wont waste their money and leave this crap in the house after all the other computers have died in the past.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a cheap, plastic version of this for my dog that I thought was a great idea, I even bought a different version for a friend of mine that has a bad cold. I have to say that I'm a HUGE dachshund fan and she really loves the thing. I took her out on a few trips to the park and on 2 different overnight walks, I noticed that it didn't work when it was cold. One time at 4 in the morning and it was so cold and I was freezing the entire time I had to go into the house to get her a coat and the battery had died. When I went back out, I tried her on, and it worked on it's own, but it was still cold. On the first walk she had a cold too but after walking around and sniffing for 20 minutes, I knew that I had a problem. She got up and went out and that was the last time I took it out. If it had been working when she needed it it would have saved me lots of money, but after 2 1/2 days of having a cold dog I just don't feel like I could handle the cold. My dog really needs it and that's why I didn't have any fun playing with it either.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought the iphone 4s 8.1. The screen has some lag and freezes up after 15-20 minutes of playing a video on the ivoron 4 and 2x2 videos, but other than that great device and battery life is great. Only one downside would be the fact that it can't have a 2-pin connector with it as the only port on the usb port is 3-pin. Also you have to have a mini usb or mini lightning cable connected to your laptop to charge the ico. I was able to buy a lightning adapter from amazon for about half the price of the iiphone adapter with the phone. Other than that the screen and phone are great.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- I purchased two of these. First, they didn't work in my computer. I thought I needed a hard drive adapter or the hard drive was broken. The first thing that comes to mind when I opened it was a scratch on the plastic. The second thing that happens is that the data that it is suppose to hold is lost forever, because my computer crashed the minute it got them. They are very expensive, so I'm just going to try to find a way to send them back. I bought them from Amazon, I think it was for $20.00 each.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    i bought the tl-200 as a replacement for my tl816. i am happy to say that I have had no problems with either and neither has anyone i have had it with. it runs perfectly. it is not as big as the t816 or tl200. i feel like it is just as versatile. but i do not recommend the t800 either. its small for what it is and its very noisy. i do have other digital audio players. the t8000 has a slightly better sound than the t400 (which i am using with an external DAC). i am a poor student and have to constantly look at my laptop screen to hear my music. it makes my life alot easier when i have an extra headphone or headphone jack on my laptop. and the tt800 is a better value. i think the t600 is better than the lcd or t800. for the price, i think you could do much better. if you plan on using your computer as a music computer and not just to record music (which it should be used for), i recommend getting this unit.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone charger battery does not last a long time. I have to charge my ipod 7.0 twice a day just to get through the day. I get up at 5:00am, and by 7:00 am I can still not get an ipod charged. Now i have to keep switching phones to get them charged and I have no idea how long this will last. The battery on my ipad has lasted about 4 years, and still works just fine.   Is it really worth it? iphones are pretty cool, I get a good battery life out of them. The only down fall is that they get really hot very quickly, which makes it difficult to charge on a lap, but then I think that is the point. I just charge them when I get home from work, in the evening, and charge my laptop at night.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have used this product for more than a year and I am so very disappointed in it. It is so very unreliable. The first one I bought had two cracked chips in it that never even caused me to turn it on. I tried to send it back to Samsung but they said it was not defective and it was shipped with new parts. I contacted Samsung and they said that it was a recall but that I would have to pay for a new one that Samsung did not send me.   After the phone returned from the manufacturer, I thought I was done but then I started getting texts on my phone saying "Error:1." So I called Samsung and I told them I didn't remember anything that I had previously bought and that I'd ordered a new phone. My Samsung rep told me that because I told him I'd order a new Samsung device I was now responsible for paying for a replacement because Samsung's new part didn't work. I said I couldn't believe that because it worked great before I bought it.   "I will be contacting my credit card company now. Please accept my apologies," he said. I didn.   (SORRY)  I love this thing. I've owned it since day 1. It was so much better than my old Galaxy S3, and I have been extremely happy with it. However, it has been crashing constantly over and over, and the phone can't go past 4G anymore.   a good thing about the phone is that it is super small and light.   on the other hand, it is extremely unreliable. I thought it would never happen but it has happened in the last few weeks so now I feel like I'm stuck with it for good. It took my son's wedding off of the calendar. And the night before, my phone started randomly crashing and making calls saying I had a new message waiting. My mom just called me at work and said I had forgotten to order an extra battery.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! This is my first time using a digital watch, and my experience was horrible! I bought this for a group of people, and they all were really disappointed! If it's not a big deal to you, just ignore the reviews, I bought it for my friends, they did the same and it was a disaster!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! This product is great for the price I got it for a small case that I had to work on for the first week. but the quality is very good and it works well. but when i put it in my car i have to put in the usb plug to my car and it makes the battery light up in red and blue so i have no clue if it is charging or not. it is so annoying. not the best product at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the nexus 6 for a couple weeks now. i was told it was the fastest device i have ever owned, which it may be, but it is extremely hard to use for its intended purpose. I have read many reviews stating this is a great device for productivity, and i agree. but i have found i can't use it for anything else. i do use it to browse the web, i watch movies, and read books, but these activities require some level of concentration. when i have the phone off my face, it constantly wakes up, goes to sleep, and wakes back up. i have had to use my watch to wake it up, which was a chore. i don't have to do it with the phone. i never thought i would like a watch, but this is exactly what i want. i am going to keep this device for a long time. i just wish its screen was a bit better. i hate when my watch is off. i wish i could use this as my main screen, and not have to worry about it waking up and needing my watch. i did buy this for it's value and not because of its screen.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Pia from Awesome, great phone, great service, amazing support. I used this phone as my primary phone from the day it was announced till today. I use it almost every single day for everything. I've had no problems with any of the phones from Verizon and I'm extremely happy with this one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was great till my phone died, then it quit working, then i got rid of it. I would rate it 4/5 but I think it had something to do with the way my phone works. Not a fan of android, I was always frustrated with it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Worked great! I bought this to use with a phone and a PC. Works perfectly on both! Only complaint is that it takes a little getting used to. I've been using it for several weeks and was able to dial out and text by pressing "7" on my phone. Then I've used the phone itself to make calls and text with my computer on the other side!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love the ability to have your own home office with my tablet, but the iPad I purchased (4.1) is a disaster. It is always freezing cold and the screen is covered in dust. I was using my iPad mini and I love its small size and very light weight. However, it is so slow and slow to start up that I had to find a small table in the living room to rest my iPad on. I'm sure other people don't have this problem.  Rated 3 out of 5 by MikeS from It does everything it claims to do I bought this item as a replacement for the one I broke off from an Apple TV. I am a very happy customer with the device, and it is exactly what I expected from Apple. The only problem is that the one that broke does not come with an AC adapter. I got the same model for another computer that I currently use.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! i just bought the moto g 4g and the phone is just a waste of time as far as calling and text messaging is concerned. The sound and volume of the phone are so bad it just doesn't even sound good. You have to use ear buds for phone calls or you can hear nothing at all. The screen is horrible as well. I can see what I see on my screen but the color saturation and the picture just don't look good. The phone doesn't have a micro usb port either which really sucks as you always have to charge it with a usb cable. Plus you get to see that battery is half gone when you plug it in. I really can't recommend this phone at all, it's garbage. I'm sorry Motorola but you should have been more careful with your design choices.  I bought this to replace my old Moto X because I didn't like how the phone was so slow. I was happy to find out that Motorola made a phone with more speed. This phone is great. The camera is fast and sharp and the camera can't be beat. However, I think the phone could be better for me. I use a Samsung Galaxy S3 and the screen is a bit brighter and has more color than this phone's. There is nothing better than a phone that looks great in the eye and also can handle what I need.  for all the talk about this phone not being waterproof and how great a phone it is I had the same thing happen to my old phone. I just can't say enough good things about this product and its speed. I have only been using it for a week but have been using this phone for 5 weeks straight. This is the only phone I can think of with this kind of performance. I will be buying more from Motorola.    For the price it's great   My other phone didn't work with this one  It doesn't. I don't have an Android phone and this one will not work with it. My previous phone didn"t work well with this, but this one does. I think I bought the wrong one. . It will work with any Android phone as long as you don't use a GPS device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have this on my computer and i cannot get rid of it. It would not let me connect my wireless internet modem to my laptop, i could not get an error message about a router. I have tried to find a solution but it has not worked. So if it does not work on your device, then this product is worthless. I want to buy one so i can remove it.  Noise / Shock: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is my second electronic device that got lost. The first one broke and the people at the Apple store where I purchased it at made me buy a new one, even after I was able to get an extension cord and set my GPS with the new one. They then charged me for shipping again. So I am not sure why Apple would charge me for it. I have lost a lot of money and frustration over this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- It was nice until I realized it can't be turned on by plugging in the charger or the wall adapter. I've tried 2 power banks and 2 USB plugs and nothing. I tried calling tech support twice and got hung up on and never got to speak with someone that worked in support. --------------- I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, so you'd think I'd know how to use an S7, but this thing is a pain to set up. The camera sucks, it's too hot to touch my face with my hand because it's so close to my face, and the camera is the biggest pain. It's not even a big screen, which is another thing I can't stand about this device. If this is your first Android phone, I think you're going to be disappointed, but I'm not sorry I bought it, because I am just going to buy a new one. ------------- I bought this for my baby and he's just turned 8 months old. It took me about 2 weeks to figure out how to set it up but it works and has a few cool features that other phones don't. It makes for great photo memories but if you plan on using it for more than a few minutes I'd recommend a case or an over screen protector for the camera. ------------ It doesn't work with the Moto Z, but it does work with most other phones. --------------------------
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had several phones with the same screen resolution in the past that did the exact same thing. it comes off in every way like someone with a lower hand just threw it up on the desk to see if it falls down.  No more! By Michael B. on 9/19/2018 Michael B This is the first time I have purchased from your store. This was my first purchase from you and I am very pleased with it. I ordered a Samsung S6 Edge+ and the case fit very well and the screen is very clear. I am currently using this phone as my primary smartphone. The screen is a lot sharper than the Galaxy S5. I bought this from your website in two days and it was delivered to my door as promised. It has been a perfect purchase.  and now it's time to pick up a new phone by: alexandria  Best and cheapest by: David M. on 12/9/2017 David M So far, so good! Bought a black iPhone X and it fits really well. The phone is super fast. It's the fastest phone I have ever used (not including my Nexus 6). The screen clarity is amazing. I only have the s6 edge but I feel like the s7 edge will be my new smartphone. I have been looking for a device to replace my s5 and the S6 edge plus is the best I could've imagined. I highly recommend this device for anyone who is looking for the best smartphone.  that said, i still don't like the size and thickness of it, so i can only say if you're willing to get the samsung g5, you will have a better experience. I'm not, I just love this phone, I am going to order a black S7 edge now. .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought a pair of these for my computer. When i first plugged them in it started playing music, but then it stopped. i tried all the usb ports, the internal, and the usb hub. I then took them apart and found out it was a defective usb port. the only reason they are good is because they have the usb port to the computer but no way to sync the music from my computer to my portable. i am so disappointed in these and will never buy again. i got my money back from the dealer and had to call apple about a refund. you cant trust the cheap crap out there like these.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  this item is terrible. I bought this for my 2 year old to have a baby monitor to control a baby's heart rate and monitor the baby's weight.  I figured that it will do what it was supposed to do and that it would be safe.    My child loves it.  One thing I don't like about this is that my child's sleep is always disrupted during the night.  I've read that a baby can tell if there is a baby alarm on when they are sleeping, so I wanted this to be a baby proof device so that there is no interruption when the baby is asleep.  It isn't a bad device.  But I had expected more from my $18 item.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone battery life is terrible, i think its because of the tiny battery. one minute the phone is on battery and the next minute it is dead. i use this phone constantly to read emails, texts, watch tv. i cannot stand this little thing.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, July 29, 2012  Good device  by Daniel from San Diego CA USA  Review: The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it is a little pricey for what you get. If you are buying just this for your phone to use for the day, I recommend getting the micro USB version, the 2GB is a bit large, not enough for most applications. For the money this is a good buy.  the usb version is better than the usb charger. :)  i just upgraded from my original apple phone, and this was the best upgrade I made. I've had this phone for about a week and it is great!  (review of free book) ,, August 7, 2011  It is a great product. It has a nice battery life and is very powerful for the price. The only downside is it's the size. It takes up so much space in your hand.   I love the phone. It is a phone you can use while using the computer. The battery life for it is good. I would recommend this phone to anyone who needs a phone for the job. .  a nd  I am a customer for life.  that is what I got the phone for.  or I have another one  or any of these  September 22, 2010  One word: AWESOME  From: Giselle from Portland, OR. USA  (Review of Smartphone) 's Review: I recently bought my daughter an iPhone 4S and I have to admit it is so much better than her previous iPhone. I am amazed with the speed of the iPhone 4! The camera has the best of any iPhone. It's so easy to make calls and texts on the iPhone! I can make calls from my computer and send texts from my laptop on the same phone. The speed is the same as the 4S. The 3G can be used with our home wifi network but the iPhone must be connected to a wifi network. Overall, the iPhone is a better phone than any Android phone. I will never go back to Android phones
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a macbook pro for 7 years and it finally failed. i replaced it with the macbook air and now im having the same problem. it runs like crap, no sound, freezes and the battery is a joke. the battery on my last macbook was 18 watt and this is 18 watt. i have never had anything like this happen on any other computer. my macbook has over 200gb of storage so this battery is not even worth replacing now.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive just bought this item for my daughter who uses a computer and a tablet to take notes on class and on the phone and this is a really terrible product not only does it look bad but the sound quality is so poor that when i turn on the speakers to listen to my daughter reading her note she can hear nothing in it except for my computer and the phone speaker when i am playing the game it just makes a horrible crackling sound with the same crackling noise when i do the same thing on the computer it just make a horrible noise when im typing it works okay but its an absolute nightmare  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, December 12, 2010  by David B from CA USA  Review: I bought one of these about ten months ago. It works ok. But I've just replaced the speakers with good speakers. I bought the Bose 2.1 speakers (no bass) and this seems to work a lot better. I use the device when I'm traveling and I'm on the road a lot and I never hear the sound when I turn on my laptop speakers, so I don't know if it's because the speakers in this thing are so weak. I will keep the 2.0 speakers for a little while longer.  My other review on Amazon.com says that my other reviews are "poor quality". I'm so sorry to see that Amazon.co.uk was so horrible to sell this. The product arrived on time and works fine, but it's such a waste of money to have purchased this.  is anyone else having similar problems with this device?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a b&m device for about a year and a half now it sucks! I put the phone on my desk and it drops off the desk with a loud crunch. it gets so hot and smooshes my desk. i can hear the beeping and the screen and it sounds like the beep is on forever. im really unhappy with this device and cant recommend it. i would have gotten this from a local electronics store but i dont want to support a company that doesnt care about their customers.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this to use as a "power bank" and it was quite good in that capacity.   However, I have found that it is rather sensitive to my movement and the batteries I purchased are rated at 10,000 mAh, which means that they will probably die a few times after a few weeks of use.  , so I have to keep moving when I use it, which is not very good.  'tis the season.   The other bad thing is that I was told that it does not support 5V power, and that it was intended for 4.4V power. I guess that is not true, but I just assumed that because it is supposed to run from 3.3V, which I use in my devices. I tried it anyway and it is very sensitive to this voltage, I must say. I also tried the "low-voltage" charger that comes with it, but it didn't really do anything for the batteries. I would definitely recommend this device to someone who wants a cheap and portable solution for USB chargers.  It's ok Review by Dwayne   Price Value Quality I bought this to charge my phone (it runs off my computer) so that I don't have to run an external usb wall adapter. The unit is great for that.  is does not charge my samsung galaxy Note 3 fast. it seems to be fine for my iPhone 5.    other than that, great product   Great price for USB Battery Charger I have always wanted to get this charger to use for all my chargers, but wasn't able to until now.  and it's a great deal. I will recommend it to my friends.  in the future I plan to buy one for my cell phone as well.  or the one for all the devices and the wall adapters. .  the best deals I could find in my local stores.  (they're not that cheap)  This product is great. I had to order it at my local store, so a little hard to find in stores in my area, but was worth it. It's lightweight, easy to use, and charges my phone and my ipod at the same time with a single cable, which makes it perfect for the car. I'm happy to have the choice in the way of charging all my devices at once! I've never owned a USB Battery charger before, but this one is great!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had this for 3 months and it's still not working correctly. It's just too difficult to use.   One of the buttons on the unit doesn't work (I think it's an on/off button)  I have to turn it on, wait 30 seconds for it to turn on, and then turn it off. After 10 seconds it turns it off again.  It also seems to be getting very hot, which is a real shame because it's supposed to be a computer and not an electronic device.  Also, the USB charging port isn't very reliable. I've used this with a USB 3.0 hub. I plug my laptop in and it charges in 15 seconds, but with a 3.5mm headphone jack, the unit has a hard time getting charged.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! If you dont like the battery, this is the worst purchase you will make. This thing is a mess!!! I put in the battery and had to turn the unit over and over to get the battery to charge properly. I also tried to buy another one and it came with a huge scratch on the back of the case. The unit was never fully charged. This was only a small amount. And for that price, it's a really bad product. You get what you pay for. I'm returning it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a cell phone on the web site to use in the house for the baby. The phone was shipped to my address which I did not verify, and within a few days of getting it there I had my old phone with a broken battery replace with a new phone, and it was not a big difference in price. I also found out that there was a second set of handsets from T-Mobile that were also not working properly. So far this was my second order. There are many other issues with the company, and my experience and time is a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------- Not all that bright and not great with video. I don't use the touch screen for anything more than watching tv with it. When you are looking at a screen you don't need more than a good monitor. With a good display like the sony xbox the only difference I see is color and light. I did get a samsung plasma but it has horrible backlight and poor video quality. I do like the way it plays music and videos on it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had the same old laptop for nearly 4 years. My last laptop died. Now this one died too. The screen was still functional. So I gave it to my son. It worked fine for about 2 days. Then the power button just wouldn't work. It was dead. So we took it back to the store and they sold me the replacement. The replacement had a broken screen. The laptop was supposed to come with 2 monitors so we were very disappointed. We returned the replacement to Best Buy. They said they couldn't take it back. So now I have to take it into the store again. I can only assume that this is some sort of computer error. I have been waiting over 3 months for my replacement. I am so sorry Best Buy has failed me so miserably and I really appreciate the help and advice I got from an old friend. I would not hesitate to use another store. This is the last one I will be going to. I just don't trust Best Buy anymore.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   "I was very satisfied with this unit, however I did not use the monitor very often. I noticed the color was all over the place, some of my images came out red/orange/yellow. I was hoping it would have the color correction capabilities that my previous unit had. I have since updated the software, I have not gotten any feedback about it from the manufacturer yet. The unit is easy to use, the controls are clear and the unit is very quiet. The only negative is the software is very basic, you can't adjust the picture modes. The first I did it because the first software did not seem to have the capabilities that I wanted. It is a lot of work to update software. I know if it were my previous version I would have been more upset with it. But I am a new computer user and I didn't need all the bells and whistles. I will be sticking with my previous one because it has always been easy to do."

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! I bought this device thinking that it would not work properly. The device is hard wired to the wall outlet, which I use for the light switch on the wall. However, it works with the light ON, and only when the lights are ON, not when they are off. The switch has to be pulled in order to turn the lights on and off, and the light switches are hard to find in the dark. I'm very disappointed with this purchase, and I'm returning this item.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this as my only means of digital media and was very happy with my purchase. I was very pleased with the quality of the device and found it extremely easy to use with no lag and an endless amount of storage. I have not had a problem with it however I will not buy this device again as it did not perform as advertised. This review is for a device that is currently advertised as having an internal SD card slot. It appears to have been made from the same components as an NDS, however has no SD card slots. The software it runs is terrible, and there are a lot of bugs on it. Also, this device is only compatible with NDS but is not. A new device from the past is back in business!  A couple of months ago, I posted a review on my blog on the purchase of the Nintendo Wiimote 2.  When the device was first released, I purchased it with my wife and son who were the only ones at my house at the time.  I had to borrow one from my brother who was out of town.  Now, after having it for a few months, I found myself wondering if I should have bought the Wii for all of the great games and controllers I have played in the past.  So, with the help of a friend, I bought one.  This time I wanted the version with Bluetooth functionality. I ordered my Wiimotes at Target and they arrived within 2 days.  They were well packed and in excellent condition.  We played Super Smash Bros. at my brother's house and were very happy.  My only complaint about this device was with the wireless connection.  As I have stated in my previous review, it does not work as advertised with the Xbox 360 or the PS3.  It only works with the Wii.  My first experience with a Wii. The only complaint I have is with the connection. It's a bit hard to get going with the controller but once connected it is just fine.  If you have a Bluetooth device you will need to purchase one of those with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for over 2 months and its horrible. It works fine for my purposes of reading and writing (i have an ipad 2 that i use as a tablet and not a laptop). I also use it as a media player (a blu-ray player). But when i want to watch a movie on my tv, it gets a hard time, and my movies are not buffered for the most part. Also, the usb port on the back is very flimsy and is very easy to break when trying to insert things in the device. Overall, its a fine piece of gear for what it is. I hope it doesn't get cheaper or better!  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought 4 of these in the last month and it seems as though they're all faulty. one of the units i got has had it's battery go flat 3 days into using it. im guessing this is due to an over voltage warning. im still waiting for a new one. the second one has had the battery go dead on me when i got it a few days ago. i've had to take it apart and fix it 3 times, i was able to get the motherboard back together with a screwdriver so its still not working properly. i'm going to order a new motherboard and i wouldnt be happy with another 6 months of this bad electronic gadget. dont let them get any better. its a joke.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my 14 year old son and after a year of using the product, I can safely say that the sound from the speakers is awful. He uses this to play games when he is home and I can tell he does not even use a sound card, his laptop is set up to use an HDMI cable to connect his computer to his television. With the speakers it is as if I am watching in the living room. I bought these speakers for my son because of the fact that they were $200 cheaper. I really need something to listen to my computer or his video games with but with these it sounds like I am in a movie theater and he has to pay for it. I will not buy this product again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________________________________________________________________________________ I had a brand new, brand spanking new Apple iPad that I bought from Best Buy and after a couple weeks, the screen cracked and the back cracked. This is the second thing that I have bought from the same store that failed this bad and I am very frustrated. I have been in contact with Best Buy many times and I have never received any type of repair or replacement. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I have owned this tablet for only 2 weeks, I purchased it on sale to replace the one that I lost, and it is in horrible shape, it has a small chip in the screen. the tablet does not look new, but I purchased the new one to replace it and now I have a huge headache, as well as the new back that has had many cracks, which I am having trouble getting the back off. I had the screen replaced, and the new screen does not work the same as it did when it was new. I purchased an adapter for the charger that has the same issue. I am now very discouraged. ________________________________________ I purchased a very inexpensive Apple tablet (non Retina) a week ago from Target. I took the tablet home, and today I noticed that the screen (and back) are very chipped and the case that it came with was completely destroyed. I will not be buying another Apple product from Target, I'll be looking elsewhere! ____________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I bought my first tablet when I was in college in 2000, it was the Apple iPad, and then I bought the first iPhone in 2007. I loved the iPad so much, that I even bought an iMac for my bedroom. I decided to buy my first iPad again, this time in the dark green. The screen was very bad at first, but after about 5 weeks it was ok. That is until today when I realized that the case was destroyed and I lost my iPad screen! I am so frustrated that I will be getting a new one now. I would have liked to get an iPad 3 and not this crappy one. It is horrible to see.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have tried a bunch of different phones, and none of them live up to the hype and I am a die hard smartphone addict. I am so happy to have found this phone though. This is the most powerful Iphone that I own. I bought this for the price because it's the only phone I can afford. I think that Apple made the best phone that I can get for this price. The camera is so good! The display is beautiful. I love all the features on this phone that make it so perfect. I can't wait to update this phone, and hopefully one day my wife will love it too.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the unit a few months ago and it was in a state of disrepair. It would not work properly. I contacted the company and they did not listen and sent me a new one, which came with a bad usb cable. They would not send me a different one and i had to return it. I will not be using this company for anything again. I would also not recommend using this for anything in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ikitron - This does not work with my iMac, it says "No connection to USB bus" and is unable to turn on, if you turn it on by pressing the "Sleep" button and then holding the button it still has the issue but this time it is a software issue and not a hardware issue. This device should be in the store.  Great price on a small device that doesn't work: icha_k - I got my ichabod on a Saturday morning and it was delivered to my door by Monday morning so it was quick. I needed an application to read the battery level of my laptop, so I could use it as a small battery monitor. I'm super happy with it. It works great, and it is easy to connect to my iPad/iPod/mobile phone.  The quality of the unit: icar- The ichbod does what it says it will, and I like that it's small. I can take it with me on the bus, the kids can use it, and so can my wife. It doesn't make a racket, and even if I want to do something else, I still have the app for the ichm that I downloaded. I am going to purchase the iphone app as well. The app works perfectly. I use it every single day. ,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  it is not that it breaks easily, it is that it needs to be fixed in the beginning. No More Problems with a Samsung Tab 10-inch! One of the great features of my Samsung Tab is the fact that it runs a Linux distro called Linux Mint. For those who are unfamiliar, Linux Mint is a popular Linux distribution for the notebook. I will admit that I have never personally used it but it has become an essential part of my Windows 8 experience. With Linux Mint installed on my Tab 10, I can now play all kinds of games and listen to all my favorite music on the portable hard drive I used to have to have with my laptop. So why on earth does Samsung make such an error with my Tab? I bought my Tab with Windows 8 installed, and I am so frustrated because I can't play any games in the new Samsung Windows 8 Tablet. When I go to my Samsung tablet, I am greeted with this message: "Windows 8 is not compatible with the Samsung Tab". And that is completely true, although it does say that Windows 8 is compatible with Windows 7 and Windows XP. I have tried many times to get Windows 8 running, but it never worked for me. I just want to say, this is an absolutely unacceptable error message. I bought a Samsung tablet with Linux Mint preinstalled, and now I can play any game I want. How can I be the one that is having a problem with this? It seems like Samsung has not taken this into account when building their Android tablet. I do believe that if someone could give me a straight answer, they would do so.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! I have owned a Rokit 5x5 for over 2 years and I am going to be moving to a bigger and better one when this one dies. I am extremely disappointed. I will be buying a bigger one and hoping that this one doesn't happen. I had no problems for a year. It can't be my fault because I didn't get the proper instruction manual from the factory! I hope this does not happen to anyone else.!!!!!!!! I love my Rokits 5x7 and Rokitan 7x7 so I was really surprised to find out that I cannot use the 6" and 7" on my 7x9 for the first time. I was also surprised that I could not use the 7x10 in the same way because they only put 4 buttons on it. I think they are just using it to make their little keyboard bigger, but I wish they would use a 9.5 inch or 10 inch because I think the big Rokita 7x8 is a better choice for me. I would have been a happy camper if they had included a new keyboard with the Rokito 7x6, but that is not going to happen. Now, if only they would include a new case for it...

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- I bought this with the intent of doing a lot of digital photos and video. This little rig is very unreliable. I'm using it primarily to take pictures with the built in camera. The problem is that every time I want to use it for video I have to turn it off and back on to use the built-in camera. In the process I've damaged the video card. I've tried different cards and they work fine, but this one just doesn't work at all. I have also heard that you can add a battery pack to make it work better, but I'm not interested in adding a battery to my rig. I am more interested in making video than taking pictures. The fact that you have to wait for it to turn off and turn back on just doesn'st make sense. If you use this camera for just video then this camera works fine. But for a serious photographer this is just a joke. I had to spend a lot more money on a decent camera and then bought this camera to fill the gap until I get a better one.

For the price, it does get the job done but i would suggest you get a better product.  the other issue is the LCD screen doesn't turn off or turn back on so i use my iPhone 4 with a bluetooth bluetooth keyboard to turn the screen off. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been using this for 2 years it's a pain in the butt but at least it keeps my ipod charged. its too long, but i figure its because i dont know what else to put in it i like it. i also have a yahoos iphone 6 plus which it still charges. ive also heard from another user that the phone charger doesnt work well with them both but they dont work well together.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the selvision 5100 for about 3-4 months and for the most part, it is ok. it just doesnt work all that well with the wifi internet connection. i found a solution on the web and put it into the same usb port as the modem and it works perfect now. ive been with this device for over a year now and it doesnt fail to make any connection whatsoever for anything. i dont even use it in the house with my router.  I think this is a very nice product. , July 30, 2015  Product: Selvision (5100) - 5 years I love this wireless system! This thing is the best! The only thing it is lacking is a way to attach the power cord to it. There is nothing to attach it to and there are no outlets to connect it to. I tried to solder some wires to the bottom of the power brick but it was a pain and the cable wasn't long enough. I also have an old laptop that I use a USB cable from to this device and it never fails to connect to the internet. You can use this as a desktop computer as well.  of the best, March 8, 2015

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very bad thing for a portable electronic device. This is an expensive device, so I expected something good out of it. But it is so buggy, so slow to start up and then so slow in it's overall performance. I have it connected to a computer with USB and it seems to start and run but the first few things to do I cannot get it to get the cursor to the top or bottom of the screen. It always just hangs and does not start up. I was going to buy a new keyboard for it. I will have to go without it and just use it with the computer. I can see myself replacing it with a cheaper model, as the last one was a good purchase.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone 7 plus was not bad at all. However i had to exchange mine. One day i get this phone and it has such a great camera. I went online and this was the phone i bought. It was a great deal but i couldnt believe my eyes. It had terrible quality of the camera. It has a really crappy screen. The pictures looked like a 3D movie. It took 4 days to exchange it at apple. i took it back to the store and gave them my number to call in if i wanted to exchange for something else. They took back the phone and gave me a new one. It's still horrible but at least i know what to expect.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this a few days ago, and I just got to use it to watch Netflix on my X1 Carbon, and it works great, but it's like I just opened a new computer. The app was very glitchy, and the connection was very flakey. When I turned the TV on, it started freezing up again. This was probably the most annoying part of it, and also the hardest to fix. I had to reboot my TV and the computer, then reboot my XR. After it worked for a while, it died and I was unable to use the TV for a few hours.  This happened with two devices, the X1 and my X2 Carbon.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this phone for 3 months now, and it isnt working for me. it keeps restarting and the battery doesnt last more than a day on a charge. i have to turn it off and on like 5 times to make it stay on (even though it says it does). it looks so dirty and cheap. i can imagine if its not being used then its like $500 that wasnt worth the money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: **************************** I bought this device to use as a backup for my iphone 3gs because I have had two of these failed within the last two years (one was stolen, the other was overheat and went dead). But after one year it did not work anymore, I lost the hard disk and only remembered to get the new replacement with this model. It worked fine for a year until I upgraded to my apple iphones 4 and that's when I realized that it was dead. I tried it again in that same day, it worked great, but the next day it went dead again. It seems to be a common problem with the latest models. It would be great if the replacement with the exact same model had this problem as well as my ics 2.1, 2,3, 4 that work perfectly. I did read in the forum that the problem is related to overheating of the motherboard, but I am not so sure about that since my motherboard was in good condition and the problem was with the new device. If you really want the replacement device it is $25 more then the newer models. I would buy the device but not in this condition

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I purchased a second hand Macbook pro from Amazon after a couple of years. After trying to update the hard drive on my first Macbook Pro with an external hard drive, my second macbook pro had to be completely rebuilt and had to get a second hard drive just to hold the data on it. With my first macbook having a full sized sd card installed, I was really frustrated with the lack of space to transfer my data, I have many photos and videos that I want to save. This was only my second Macbook, I wanted the best out of it. When I opened the box I had to wait for an hour and a half before it arrived, and I was not happy to be waiting so long for an apple product to show up. On the inside, I had heard that the first time my new macbook was used, the hard disk became completely corrupted with an entire stack of data on top of it and I had not been able to find anything to get it to work at all. It was really frustrating having to go back and buy a new mac so I could have the data that I had saved onto the first one working. With this second one I bought, I decided to purchase a larger sized sd slot so that I could save files onto it. I then decided that this sd card, like the previous one, would be perfect for saving photos and movies, and once I installed it, I noticed I was able to use the sd card to keep all my photo and movies and still be able to view them. I did not know that the SD card would not be able work with the computer like this before I ordered it, but the size, capacity, the way that it works, all these things really make this sd to have a place in my new computer and I am very happy with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******** * This is the worst and worst looking e cig i have ever seen * i dont know what they mean by charging fast and i cant charge the battery if i press the button down * the plastic covering on the battery is coming off * the battery looks cheap and has cracks and dents all over it * it doesnt seem to work but i have not found anything about it not working in this thread or on youtube ***  My new e cig for a birthday gift, it's great!  I love this little device. I do the whole vape juice thing and this is perfect. The only problem is that the ejuice comes out pretty thin when you first open the device but it cleans up pretty well with a warm dry cotton, or you can put a couple drops in an e liquid syringe and use a funnel to mix the juice to make it thicker.  it is well made. the juice is cheap but i use it to put my drippers in. The atomizer has a nice firm hold on the coils and a nice vapor on the throat hit. if you like the flavor of the drippers but dont want the hassle, you will like this thing! ,  Amazingly efficient, easy-to-use, and delicious I'm an electronic cigarette lover, but I've always wanted to try some better electronic products. It was the only product on the market that provided what I wanted without all of the bells and whistles (but with better performance). The V3 is easy to use, provides an excellent vapor, and is very efficient. I'm going to be getting my next V3 immediately. I highly recommend it!  be the first one to add this review.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________ I bought this because of the reviews saying it is the only one of this type that worked. I bought the same item for my friend with the same problem and it did not work. I called and talked to them and they just kept telling me the same thing. I had to call back and cancel my order. There are too many reviews saying they work well only when they are broken so you are better off not buying them. I don't know if there is an issue with the ones I got or if they are defective.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this device about 1 month ago to replace my older iMac computer that has been in the shop for a year and half. The new computer works perfectly as far as i can tell but the iMac does not respond well to the Bluetooth. The iMac is a 15" mac and the new iMac has an Apple TV. It has the Bluetooth port on the bottom of the iTV and the iBook computer.  When i turned my old iMac on and put my new iBook on it, it said it couldn't connect to my iBook. I unplugged and plugged in my old computer to the i2c adapter then plugged my new computer on it. Then it said the i computer could see my old machine but could not see the ibook computer. i tried my old ipod/iphone and that didn't work either.  I was thinking my iMac will not be able to have Bluetooth on the iBooks/iPods because it does not have the Apple TV dock. Well,    i have had this iMac now for about a month and I can still not get Bluetooth on my iBooks or iPods. I can connect to the new ipod or my iphone but cannot see the other ipods or iBooks.   I have tried resetting the ipod and the iphones, resetting their radios and everything but no luck   and so far no one on apple support has been able to help me out.  It is very annoying and I had to return it because I do not want to be spending any more money on an iMac that can't do my i book work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ___________ The product was just a little bit hard to get to work in my garage. __________   If you've never used a soldering iron before, you'll need a very small wire stripper (a #00 tip) to get the solder to get in the holes in the board. __________________   the bad news is that the iron's soldering point is not very good, and your solder will flow out and create a hole that will be hard to fix if it doesn't eventually give up.  _________________ the good news is you can find replacement parts if you're able to find the replacement iron.   It also took a while to get my soldering to work, so I don't consider it a problem to have.    The thing that makes the soldering process hard is the fact that the solder is a very fine conductive powder which is difficult to get at all.  To prevent this you have to be VERY CAREFUL with the iron, and keep your fingers very close to the tip of the iron when doing the solder iron work.  This will prevent your fingers from getting burnt by the hot solder powder.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: **************************  The iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS have similar cameras, but there is one feature that makes the 4 better: Auto white balance.   The white balance option on the iPhone 4 (and its predecessors) automatically adjusts the lighting on your images based on your surroundings. This is a really cool feature because it allows you to see images in the best light possible.   is a better camera than the other cameras because it auto adjusts the white balance for your images and it can shoot in low light (very useful for landscapes, since you need good exposure).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing was junk. Noisy. Cheap. There was no way to use it and then there was the small problem that it did not charge. It would charge for an hour and then die. I guess it has something to do with it not being the kind of thing you use to charge your phone and other devices.  I'm a huge fan of the sound quality that this does deliver. It's the best sound I've ever heard from a computer speaker, and that is saying a lot. Not as loud as my Macbook Air's speaker, but still great.  is the one for me. It does everything that I want it to, from streaming music to running games. It comes with a USB cord (the only thing I don't like) and a charger for $50, so I'm glad that it does include those. , if you're looking for something to get started with the sound is outstanding, if not even better than the speaker, if for no other reason than it's the only thing that does. It may not be loud, but it does the job well and is also quite light (and very portable).The only reason I don.t give it an 8/10 is because it isn't the lightest option, it's about the same as a pair of Bluetooth earbuds, which are already very good sounding, which means you're getting a poor tradeoff.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device worked fine until I upgraded to the newest firmware. After a few months of running it on the latest firmware, the keyboard stopped working. No response to keystrokes. Now, I had replaced it with a new version of the same device and got it working. The keyboard was so hot and bad it was burning my fingers. I guess I will have to stick with my old one which worked fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A little over six months, and yet, it's still a pain in the ass. I'd say I'm almost out of excuses. I tried the first model, the one with the bluetooth. It didn't take long to realize that this was a bad idea, since it wouldn't even connect to the remote in my room, which is on the second floor. I thought about buying a different model, but it was out of my budget. I'll just have to get a new one if I need to use it again.   If you're buying this for the bluenote, you're wasting your money. They do have a better app, but that doesn't make them better in the long run. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- I can't say that I am thrilled with my new digital watch. It would have been a lot better with a better screen. It shows a random message every few minutes. I find it is distracting and is making me late for work every night. Also the screen has been going bad on me. I have to clean it regularly, and it does not come with a screen protector or anything. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the watch is very well made, and the price is very reasonable. I would have given it 5 and 1/2 stars, but I would not buy this again.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I'm sooo glad i took this chance and bought the G6. I love the way it works but the charger is a huge failure. I bought one of these and I had the same problem. It would go from 7-10v when fully charged to 5v, even when charging at 15w and the charger was completely dead. So basically when I plug it in and then it would not turn on. I went through my whole stock of chargers because they were all the same and none worked like this. I'm hoping they will work. I hope I don't end up with a dead device. I would like to see them fix it.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a terrible device. I purchased a new unit that had been on my porch for 3 weeks and the remote turned off immediately. I thought that was a great feature because I have a new device that has worked just fine. Then after a few days, it turned on again. The screen did not update but the remote did. I had to reset my remote to a working one. I have to order another one so I don't have to pay for the repair. I'm going to be returning this product to Best Buy.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very basic product that doesn't do what it is supposed to do. I've had it for a couple months now and have tried to use it as much as I can, but I find it almost impossible to turn the battery on. I think it's only been 3 times and it's still turning the battery.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for 2 years i can only use it to play guitar. It has a hard time connecting to my ipod. I do have other guitars with ipod's but they all connect fine. I have replaced this one 3 times and ive spent a total of 2 days on the phone trying to resolve the problem. I would not recommend this unit to anyone.  Product Review: Great sounding amp/speaker, very well built. A little loud compared to the real thing but its very good quality sound for the price. I recommend this amp.  is a little loud for some, it will really sound great with headphones or in a small room.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very good price for the quality I have seen on other products. I have a Canon 5DIII and an Olympus E-M10. I use the Canon to take pictures at night and the Olympus for video. I am very happy with both. The Samsung is very good for the price but not as bright and better with a flash. I don't think this is something that can be improved. It will just take some time to see if there are any improvements in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _____________________________________________________________________________________ I got the "best buy" for $59.99 after tax and free shipping. For an old computer that has been used for the last 20 years it has been very functional and not so hot for the battery life. When I looked at the warranty I saw that the device is covered for 1 year only. The next day the unit did not turn on. The serial number did not match. The unit has a "No Contact" indicator on the front panel so I contacted B&H tech support. They told me that it was only a dead transistor. I sent a picture of the transistor and it matched. I did a lot of research and the next day I bought a new one and they were out the door in less than 2 days. My unit does not have a built-in charger so the unit is powered from the external mains. I have no problem with the warranty. Just wish I would have saved up for the one I got! (Posted on 2/9/2012)  Reviewer: BOB DOWELL - - January 10, 2012  Subject: Very Poor quality, no warranty!!! I just bought this unit and got it yesterday. I had to send the unit back to the store in Houston because it was no longer working. The parts came in, but the power supply didn't work. I couldn't get it to recognize the battery and the display was not functioning properly. I finally called B& H tech support and was told they do not warranty these things. They will not take the unit in and repair it even if I pay all of the shipping. It should have a warranty but doesn't. I don't recommend buying this if you really have to get it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the zetaboost for about a week now and i have to say it sucks. ive tried it on different computers and the buttons arent so big it didnt click like i wanted it to.  also theres a delay when you connect to the wifi and there is a delay that when you move the mouse around the mouse has to be turned on  i think its because of the usb dongle.  but i like how it works.  i like it because i can control my computer using it. i dont like it cause of the buttons not being large enough and they are really small.  this has been a week and i still cant believe it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the same one for a few years now, i find i can't even use it because it keeps on shutting off and on. not very happy with it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bill from Worked well when first installed. I've had this radio for a couple of months now and I really like it. It works very well. I was skeptical at first about the battery. I'm pretty conservative with my radio but I have had plenty of batteries over the years that lasted at least a year. However, when I first got this one it had a 3-year old battery. After I got it working I found out it took about 12 hours to fully charge it. Once it was fully charged it never had any problems with the battery or the radio. I highly recommend this radio.  was easy to use and had good range and reception.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for almost two years and it keeps giving me the same problem. it goes into sleep mode after about a year, and it's stuck in the sleep mode, so my phone has to go back into battery mode to turn on. ive tried every trick in the book and its only working on a model with an SD card, so im wondering if the only thing that works is replacing the internal chip and/or trying a different phone (only an ipod/ipad).   i also really don't like the way this thing is designed. you can plug it in to the back of your router as if it was an ipad, or plug it into a router that has ethernet ports, but that is it. it does not have an Ethernet port for wireless internet or anything. it works great with a wifi dongle but even that would only connect to a single device.   but hey, at least it's free, right?   --------------------  To love something, you have to know what it is: the way it feels, the way things look, the feelings it creates.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for a few months and ive been using it every day. ive done everything with it, from watching movies, music and TV to watching games and streaming videos.  its been just fine.  but today it went into an endless loop. it hasnt been working on my tv for a week, and now it doesnt turn on at all when i try to watch tv in my living room. this is the first ive ever had an iphone where i had to reset it twice (twice i used a different pc).  after that it was fine but not now.  i have had this on iphones and ipads and all ive found was the issue on ipad's and iphONES.  ive never been so mad with my iphony than when i had this problem.  my ipod 4 has been fine for years.  now i cant use it at all for what ever reason.  the only good thing about this iphono is i have to keep it charged at all times!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought a Sony T-50 with a Bose sound system a few weeks ago, and it died after about 5 months. The unit was great, it had great sound and very convenient. But after several uses I got a loud buzz from the unit's battery pack. That happened after a full charge. I returned it to Best Buy and they replaced it. But they charged it at a $60+ service charge. That's $60. I have a couple of high-end wireless devices in my home, so I can't help but wonder if Best Buy is charging its customer's for a service that is unnecessary. I've also found it a hassle to call Bose about their wireless products. I'm a loyal customer, but I wouldn't recommend them.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________   - The buttons don't work in the middle of the keyboard  - I can't find the buttons to make them work (for example, to move the screen to the right or up)  "I have a MacBook Air, I just purchased a wireless keyboard. There are three problems: 1) The button layout is bad. It's all "F" instead of "N", "I" insteadof "O" and "U" instead than "S". I had to switch all the buttons on the keyboard. 2) The key layout is terrible. The space bar is on the left and not the right. The number row is the wrong direction. Also, on the right-hand side of the number row, the arrows are too far to the left. 3) The keyboard doesn't work well. It makes a weird "ping" sound when the computer is started up and also makes the sound of someone hitting a rubber band against the keys. The keys are also not as responsive. This thing is a total waste of money and should not be purchased."  I have been using my wireless keyboard for a few months, and I found this keyboard to be pretty decent at typing and I liked that there was no clicking noise while I typed. After the first few days, I got used to it and I felt like it really worked. The first thing that I noticed was the price. The keyboard wasn't very good quality, and the buttons were a bit noisy. I got this keyboard on sale for $25 and when I first used it, it was really cheap. I wasn't expecting much from a cheap wireless keyboard but it was actually pretty decent. I'm not sure if I would recommend this product to other people as it isn't worth the price to me.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for more than 6 months and its been breaking down like crazy. its not only breaking down and losing battery life but it also randomly just shuts down in mid air. and it only works on one battery. no worries tho it does come with two batteries, one of which is the original one that came with it so i still have that one i know that might be why but i dont know, it just always seems to run down before i even get to charging it. i guess that makes sense but it just never seems to work as expected. i had to replace the battery twice so far and both times it came back with the same result, the first one died while the second one still didnt work. i just think this product needs a redesign and a price drop. i feel like if i was looking for something that could save me money i would probably look at a more portable and more power efficient device. i mean maybe if its battery life was like 2.5 hours and it didnt require a charger at all, that would be a decent buy but its really not any good.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- So I bought the Sony KDL-55A7C camera. The kit comes with 2 lenses (15mm f/2.8 and 21mm f2.0) and a flash. I like to try out different lenses on different cameras before I make a purchase. This camera, as most others, has a wide angle, which is useful in capturing wildlife and landscapes. However, when I took a few shots of a garden the lens is too close to the sky and it creates a yellow tint on the top of my photos. It is very distracting to the eye. Also, I like the compact shape, and I like that the flash is easily operated with one hand. However there is a little problem with the auto focus and exposure. It can be a little hard to control the exposure in bright sunlight because it seems to take an extra second for the auto-focus to lock. This may be an issue with some cameras because I have had problems with this problem with other cameras. Overall I am happy with my camera, but I do not know if I would purchase this camera again.

Yes No Tuesday, February 06, 2012  Great for my iPad!  by Andrew from Austin TX USA  Pros: good battery life, small footprint, small weight, very easy to use  Cons: None  Review: Worked out just fine for me. I used it for my 3G iPad.  My favorite thing about it is that I can plug it into any USB port so I can use any data cable I'd need to use it with other devices.   The only downside I see is that it's not a true "powerbank". The battery life is decent for what you get for your buck. I would definitely get this again.  for the battery life and for being portable I'd give it 10/10, it works fine for my purposes  Did you find this helpful? 2 of 2 people found this helpful

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for years and its been junk, my kids have to get their nails done on there ive got to go to a more professional place but thats the only downside to it   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works great... Works great  Review by Kevin I really enjoy it, the fact that it is rechargeable and that it works at home is great.  i also like that there is a "quick start guide" that can be printed on the back, it is a great feature that helps make sure you don't have to go out and purchase a new kit and charger every couple of months  The best way to recharge this thing!  I would recommend this battery pack to any one that has a Smartwatch or smartwatch like the Apple Watch Series 2 and 3. You will need to use a usb wall charger, but since these are rechargeable you can have it plugged in all the time.  This product is a must if you are buying anything.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst thing ever. When you turn it on, it does a lot of things. The first is that it is very loud. I tried to turn the music off with the volume control. It only changed the sound to a normal noise. The second thing is that when you turn the light on, you can see the white LED inside the device. The white LED comes on when the light is off, and off when the lights are on. The light turns off and on a couple times, but then it will go out. Then the light stays on for 2 or more seconds after you turn off the light. If the light goes off, it will take about a minute for it to turn back on. I was thinking of going to the doctor and taking the unit to them. Now I am going to put another light in the unit. It takes 4 times to change it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------ I had the first version of this device and I had to replace it with my first version again because the buttons were breaking the first time I used it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought and owned several iphones. i think the samsung has the best build quality, and the best software and the greatest battery life. my first apple iphone was so much larger, and ive had to purchase an iphon mini to replace it. the only reason i switched from apple was iphons hardware. i just thought the sony would be more durable. ive since purchased a samsung. the iphonic is great, but it is a little slow compared to iphony. I think the software can be upgraded to make it a little faster but if that is the case they could just upgrade to android. the sennheiser is a great phone. i own several and think they are great for the price. i would buy them all over again!  Rated 3 out of 5 by jd from Good, but not amazing I am in love with my sennhdynamic headphones. I have had them for nearly a year and I think they're great quality. They sound great. The only problem I have with them is that the headphones don't have the best sound quality on my phone. I use the s3 and an ics and they both sound very good. Also, the sound of the phone vibrating a few times a day doesn't help. So, I have to be careful to not turn the volume up too loud when I'm talking. But the sound quality is still very good and I love them! .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought 2 of these for my kids. The first one broke and was very difficult to use. They now only use it to play with the kids, and have a lot of trouble with it. It was also difficult to figure out how to control it with a controller. I really hope this one lasts because I wont get it anywhere else.  Pros: Great Price  Amazing battery life.  the kids absolutely love playing with it  Cons: Not sure if its the controller or something else  OVERALL: 3 out of 5  The Play-n-Fight Stick is a good quality product and we were pleased with our purchase of this product. Our son is very picky and he will only use one device at a time which is always an issue for some parents. I have only been able to use this Play-N-Fight stick 2 times. The only thing that I feel is lacking is the ability to turn the power up and down. I had my kids put the charger and power cord on a shelf on the other side of the room. They are both very pickier now that they are 12 and 9 years old. This issue may be addressed with a future product upgrade.  "Just bought it for the kids. They LOVE it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a terrible device - not only does it don't sound good (due to the subwoofer) it doesn't work. It was bought as a "Christmas present" and a second one is due in a week. Not recommended for use with music.  Good value for money: I have purchased a number of this product for my kids music room. I also bought one for my mother who uses it as a portable CD player. All of them play nicely and it plays music very well. I have used it on the bus to listen to music as well as to keep our iPods charged  This is my first stereo and so far so good: This is my second set of turntables, the first was the VPI 2.5 (which was fine) and my wife purchased the Yamaha TR-1 which was not so great. I chose this one because of the "wow factor." So far so OK. I'm not sure I'm getting my money's worth for this item, but I am sure I will get some use out of it in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: _________________________________________________________ I bought this product about 1 month ago and I've been very happy with it so far. It has been a great way to charge my phone and my laptop. It's just small enough to fit in my backpack and very durable. However, the app isn't very good. There are a few key areas where it's hard to make the device work properly, and it would be nice if it could store more than one battery for each port. _________________________________________________ I have this product and I am very satisfied with it. It is very convenient to charge your phones and laptops. It also keeps the phone and the laptop charged on the road. It stores my iPhone and my ipad in the back pocket and the battery is always fully charged. _________________________I had this on my phone for a week and I love it! I love the way it fits. I am not a fan of the way the charging port is arranged. It makes the battery pop out of the wall and out the phone. But otherwise it's a great charger.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a few of these devices and have had to return them for various problems, the first problem was the micro sd card reader never would work ( it would read "too small") no big deal if its just a few cards but if you have a lot of cards it would get really annoying. another problem was it was almost impossible to change the screen from the computer screen to the tv screen because you have to unplug the cord and press the buttons in the wrong order and it took ages, and you would have to change them manually again. the worst problem was after about 4 months of using it you couldnt even turn it off because the little green light wouldn't turn off and when you tried to turn it back on the little light went out. it was extremely frustrating to me and my wife to have to keep going back to the store just to change out batteries. dont get me wrong i love the idea of it but it was so frustrating to use and even if its the only one your going to get i would recommend against getting one because there is nothing like having to go back to store every time you need to change things! and i wish it was a little less expensive than they charge for it

I know it is because it wasnt made in apple but the keyboard feels flimsy. I would just like to buy a mac or a pc. The design could be improved a bit but I bought this to use as a tablet.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ____________ I have had the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 digital camcorder and it has failed miserably every time I put it to work. The software is a joke. It does not play back any video of anything that I can find in the VCR stores. It cannot run a movie or video with any sound so it can't be used for music. It has no LCD screen. There is not one button to start or stop. The camcorders in the world that have this many problems are the Sony, Kodak, Ektachrome, Canon, Nikon, and Kodak. There are only a few that have made it through the years. This unit has had over a thousand dollars spent on it and still does not work. This company has tried to get us to give away this unit as if we were getting some free camera and have not let up. You would think it would be more reliable and easier to use. So I bought a new model DMC2000 and I have not used it since I bought it so I don't know what problems it has or has not had.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been playing with this keyboard for a few months now, and i'm very dissapointed with this.   It has only 3 keys on the right side: home, back and middle (plus arrow). There's no FN key on the keyboard, no number pad, no extra keys for the "guitar" or "saxophone" and it has a key that looks like an arrow for each key.  .   The keys are plastic and don't feel good at all.   The arrow keys have an obvious vibration.  The keys are not very comfortable to type on. You'll be used to a keyboard with more keys like in a macbook pro, so you may not be able to type as fast.  But it's very good for quick tasks like typing email or just surfing the web or using word processor software.   It's the perfect keyboard for my job, and if I can get over the sound, I'll be a happy camper. ive only had it for a week, but its already showing signs of being less durable and less nice than the rest of my keyboard. it will eventually crack on the top of the keyboard (from all the friction) and start to break down after a few weeks (or months) of typing. i've been using a cheap mx keyboard on my macbook, and it had a similar problem.   it broke a while ago, but you still can't even open the case to take it apart. I have had to replace both keyboards on my computer at this point.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had one for a few years now and its always dying in a few days.   its really unfortunate that there are no other options for the price in this line. if theres any other options that offer any kind of performance in this price range then i would be a happy camper.  , the screen isnt even readable because its so small. if youre in a group setting youll have to turn down the speaker volume so people can hear you. the camera isnt any better since its only a cam. no video and the video quality is terrible, its very low resolution at 720p. i wouldnt recommend this unit to anyone.  Review of DJI Phantom 3 Standard by Chris H. on 13 January 2014  The DJI Inspire 1 has great reviews on the web but it doesn't do what it's supposed to do. For $1200 its too expensive! It has to be $499 and I would buy it. DJI should have made a Phantom 2 with better resolution camera and better video so its not so low res. I'm on the DJI network and my Inspire has some issues. I use it to fly FPV and get close to my car and its just too large. It's too large and heavy and the gimbal falls off a lot. It needs to be smaller or more agile like the X5.  of course it could be because i'm using a gimme or an a4. it's a big unit for sure. If there was a better one in this class im sure it would do a good job. I'd buy one with better gimm's and a bigger battery! If the battery life was better and I had to use a different controller i'd buy it again  Write a positive review about this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- Well I was looking for a small USB device to connect to my bluetooth and it turned out to be a waste of money. Not much to say that is pretty much what i expected but the quality is not what it should be. I bought it thinking that it will give me more flexibility to connect different devices or to have a phone call on the road. I can't use my smart phone on this device so it is a waste for me. There was no way to select which device to talk to with this, the only way to call my friend is to press a button on my bluetop. It only works with my smart phones and bluetooth headsets and it makes me wonder if it will work with other Bluetooth devices or if it is just not worth the money. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except for those who want to have something to connect with their bluetooth devices.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just bought one of these for my MacBook Pro (MacBook Pro Retina, 11" Mid 2012). I had it a few days, and I have to say I have not used it. It looks and acts like it was meant for a 7" tablet. It is a little difficult to open, I have never opened a 7 inch tablet before so I have no idea what to do. I really wish they made the screen bigger, because when I opened the screen it felt like the screen was too large for it.   The only other issue is the battery life. I have had no issues with it, but I have yet to have it out of the box. I haven't even had it for a day or two yet.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I bought this a few weeks ago and I am having problems with it. The battery is not charging, but when I take it out to charge it the battery keeps on dying. I cannot find a way to turn it on. When I try and turn it back on with the wall adapter it turns on and I get a text message that it is charging it. I took it to the nearest Apple store and they told me it is defective and it will be sent back. What a bunch of bullshit. I guess I have to find a use for it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for less than a year and i'm already replacing batteries 3 or 4 times a week. the first month it was working perfectly with the 2 batteries it came with. then it would stop working after 2 weeks when it would get too hot or it would shut off on it's own but no smoke. i tried the new batteries and they had no effect. i was about to throw them out and buy a new unit but i think i can live with the old unit as long as it works the first 2 weeks. now its been over a year since i had the original one so it has been out of commission for about a year, that being said it still works fine for now, it works fine with my kids. i did have to replace the batteries in it once before. that being my issue.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When i received the watch and went to do my first run in it, i got a very disturbing noise. i did a few short runs in the first two days of owning the watch, and i still hear it. it sounds like someone is using a loud drill. and this is coming from someone who runs about 30 minutes each morning at home to work. this is the first time that i have been at work and not heard this noise. and it was extremely loud, just like if i had set my watch down on the ground and it were to suddenly move up. it was annoying. i do not like the look of the watch. i'm very unhappy with the way it looks. i think that the face of the watches are not very attractive to look at. it does not look like the watch was designed by one of the people that make the current smartwatches, or any of the other watches that i've been looking at. i also think that it could be designed by someone who knows how to design watches. the design is kind of boring. it looks a little more like a digital clock than an accurate watch. the strap is a very cheap looking black leather strap with a rubber band attached to it. i don't know what the strap costs, but it looks very cheap and poorly made. it also doesn't have a nice polished finish to the metal face of it. the watch is made in china. it feels like a cheap watch when it is running and running. I also don't like the fact that it doesn't show the time. i have tried the watch for the first couple of days. it just keeps running as if it is the only watch on your wrist. i wish that it would have a second time zone.   I'm hoping that I can get this watch repaired in the future. It feels like my money was wasted.

I tried it with usb and i think it was a bad connection. I took it back and they said they had to send a new one. i was hoping that the iphonetool would turn it back on but it was out of stock. The service that they provided was bad. they did not give me a return or an exchange. i will probably never buy from them again. I had my device for about 3 years and would have been happy with a replacement of it. but if it's not working it's no good to you.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!I got the black version of this product because I was looking for a new computer and it looks good with the screen and the case. However the battery inside is bad, it just gives out no more. The phone itself is ok, but I prefer the black color. The only thing I'm still annoyed about is the charging cable has too much length. Also the USB port isn't a standard port, but a mini USB port which makes it really hard to connect a device. So all in all I gave the product a one star because it's not the best product but for the money it's okay.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a bad device.  There is absolutely no protection when you drop it.  When you look down it you can see the battery still attached, you should have noticed that when you bought it, that is a feature not a bug.  And even when it works, you can still hear the beep noise, not sure why its beeping.  If I have the bad thing out in the open, if I walk by it and it sounds beeping in my ear the same day I received it I am going to go back and get the 2nd one and never use this one again.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Nice product! I bought this to use as a walkie-talkie for outdoor adventures. I have it mounted to my helmet as a "back up" for both my cell phone and my iPod. The noise cancelling is good, the battery life is great, the features are great, and the way that the device is designed makes it very portable. I really enjoy using it in my backpack or car as a walking, talking, audio chat device. I also have a second one for my car, and it works pretty well as well!  4 out of 4 in a bag I just purchased the N2 and used it as a cell phone. It has lots of features including noise canceling. It's a great product for travel. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it could be better. The way it mounts to your helmet is pretty much crap, but it has a small rubber mount on the back of the helmet that is good enough for me. I do wish it had a better mounting method.  5 out of 6 people found this review helpful Nice little device! I am a very tech-savvy person and I have used almost every electronic device ever made. I had always heard about this particular model, but had never tried one. I use the noise canceving feature on most devices and had used it on my cell phones with a microphone but wanted to try it without. I got this one and it is so much better than anything I've tried to date. The battery life lasts a long time and my friends and I still talk for an hour or more on a normal night without a power cut. I'm glad I purchased it.  are you a talkie guy like me?  3 out of 3 found this helpful Well I bought the N1 and
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's an all-round fantastic purchase! My husband, my dog, and I are extremely happy with our purchase. I had heard that the battery life is terrible with the iPhone, and the battery lasts me 5 to 6 hours (depending on what kind of usage I do), so the battery last for a month, we are very happy! My dog has had trouble with the bluetooth headset for some time and with my iPod Touch, the battery is starting to run out fast. Now that I have my new iPhone, I have a way to call, text and send text messages. It's really good!

I also don't get much use out of the built-in speakers because the music is always too loud.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been having problems with my iphone 4s for the past year. When it works the first few weeks it works great. When i first got it it wouldnt connect to my ips port. It would freeze up and i would have to hold power for about 10 seconds. It took a few weeks for it to get better. I think I got a defective one. It was a pretty good phone but the iphones are really crappy. I am getting rid of the ips.

Rated 1 out of 5 by JF from Worst phone ever. Very, very slow. Had to change phone from 2G to 4G, and still can't use it. I'm no longer able to make calls, read text messages, or watch youtube. I've tried many things. The worst of all was the phone app. It took forever to set up even though I'd tried to save it on my SD card. Very frustrating. It would have been nice if this was the first phone I'd ever owned and that I could change the settings if I want them. I hate this phone. My old phone was much better and faster, but this is a bad phone  Customer Testimonials

And it does not come with a protective sleeve to keep it from touching anything.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I've bought this for a new house and it's the first one of it's type I've owned and it has worked fine for less then a year but now I have it replaced and I'm not happy with this purchase. I've read through so many reviews online and the customer service is very poor. One day I get an email from them saying it could have been worse, but it could also be a defective one but they can't do anything and they send a box for me to return it for a refund and if it doesn't work they'll charge me a replacement fee which is ridiculous. I had a similar problem on another website but they had good service and they gave a $50 credit to cover the shipping cost for me which was a nice bonus. I should have just gone with a local one because the other one is still in my mailbox. I will NEVER buy a product like this again!!!  5/5 BEST DECODE SENDING!!!!!! I had the opportunity to have this device in for service before Christmas and I had no issues. I am very satisfied with this product. I know that I will buy a second one for other applications and I am a strong proponent of the use of decoders for security reasons and to be honest I had used the device for security related searches and it just worked. I think that the device works very well for what it was designed for. I highly recommend it.  4/5 Excellent Product! I bought the device after reading some of the other reviews. I read the first few reviews and thought "there's no way I'm gonna use this". But when I got it home I was pleasantly surprised. I used the machine for a couple weeks and could not have been happier with it. I can't say enough good things about it. No issues, great accuracy, great cost, excellent service from BestBuy and good customer service.  and I don't want to mention the other review saying they've changed the way the software works so it's not as accurate as before but you need to make sure you use the current version of the software because of that change.  is a great tool that I can recommend to anyone  Great product This is my 2nd decoder. I was skeptical at first until I actually used it. Best price and fastest shipping.  in addition, I received an extra key (good luck) and the packaging was very nice. Will order again.  of my 1
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really enjoyed the watch but there are way too many features which I don't use and when I do, they are annoying and I can't understand what they do and why I would need to use them. The face time functionality is also very clunky and not very reliable.  What was said about the design before? I liked the original design but i have a few things to say:  -The watch face has been redesigned and now does not have a back button that is as intuitive as a back, side or other button you can press when you are looking at the watch face. , when you open the watch case, it is not possible to swipe down from the top left corner to access the side button because when you swipe down, it opens the menu, which is very inconvenient and doesn't work.  of course, it might be possible for you to switch it to be more like a traditional watch but not for me  – The watch face does not display the time without using the time function as well. I was trying to search for the time and i only saw the time, which would be great if the face would be able to show the time as well with the time being easy to find without using time function. .  is just annoying, if you get up from the computer to look at your watch to look for a time, what you have to do is swipe the left or right sides up or down to see the time  It is easy to say that i hate this watch, but i love the design. i have an iPhone but with the Android OS it is a lot of hassle to set the watch up. It takes way too long to setup and i had to look up the step by step instructions in order to figure out how to connect the watch.    i want to like this watch but for a person like me with an iPhone, it seems to have no options that will make using the watch more convenient or useful. the fact that the watch does not always sync with your phone and also sometimes fails to do so is disappointing.  (5) - I would buy it again, only if: (1) the price could be lowered, i would definitely buy a black watch that didn't have the blue dot

Very stable.  be sure to install it in a location where the unit is not directly under a desk.  of course i did not use my samsung galaxy s3 in this device as its too large and too heavy.  said yes to the installation video and i have now have my new phone that i never thought I could get  It has the function that it should have had.  is a great product and easy to use  I just got the EKX in today and it works great and is easy to set-up and use. It has worked great with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and the buttons are very easy to find. It did a great job. I've only had it for a week so I can't speak much on durability but it should last a very long time for a mobile phone.  and it has a nice little indicator light too. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this device for almost a month and have only been using it for about an hour a day. First, when you set up the device, you have to use a USB cable to attach the device to your computer and a PC cable to charge the device. It took me about 15 minutes to figure out how to use that setup to use this.   The device also takes about 3/4 of a minute to come to life. The battery takes about an entire day to recharge. When I plugged the device in, it took about 20 minutes to fully recharge.   and the screen on this is really bad. It turns red when it's full so I always keep my device on a power off when not in use so the redness isn't distracting. I was told the screen wasn't good for a high resolution, but the screen is still pretty bad. I've also seen a few reviews on this device say the screen has some distortion. I'm looking into fixing that as well to try to make it better.  - The charging indicator does not show the power state of the battery.  Other than that I like this device and would recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ________________________________________ _________________________________________________________ I am currently using the HP Compaq dv6 with the new HP Deskjet 4000p and I am VERY pleased with it, the HP DeskJet 4000p is an absolutely terrific piece of software that is very powerful and easy to use for any software or office functions. However, the Compaq has a number of defects. The power and disk drive issues I have experienced are very serious and very costly to repair, and it has taken a year of intense effort to repair the disk drive problem with the dv6000, I am using a third party disk drive that was replaced for free on the HP website and I had no problems with the drive. I do not know if this is a HP issue. I will not recommend this product to anyone with any HP hardware. _________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this item for about a year now and every time I want to play music with it, the device comes loose and breaks on the ground. I have a small desk and a large TV. I think the battery is to small to hold up a large laptop. It can hold the ipad, but it is just not big enough to hold the computer on the table. I can use the mp3 player on my ipad. I also bought this for my husband to use on his small tv. he uses a tv on a computer and this thing has come apart twice now, even with a lint roller. I am not buying it again. I want my money back. I don't trust it to hold my ipod.  It seems like a nice product, I can buy 2 for the price of one of these. I would give 5 stars if I could, but the one I have is coming apart with every use.  and the one i bought is from Amazon and I'm just as disappointed. the one at walmart, has the same problem as mine and there's no replacement parts. I do wish they would have made a different version that had a better battery and more storage, but that's just me. I love that it does play mp3 music, but my ipods are my main media devices, so not the best use for one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality on this is terrible and I can't listen to music on it. When you put a CD in it, the speakers just start vibrating, and when you put in a cassette, the sound is just barely loud enough to be annoying. The buttons on the front have to be pressed all the way down before you hear anything.  Was this review helpful to you? Yes No  9 of 9 people found this review useful

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ****************** If I knew this thing could cause this much damage to my family's lives I would have never purchased it. The thing came with the bad battery already installed, and the remote control has not worked for more than a year and a half. The batteries in the remote work ok and when you put them in the correct direction they seem to work, but the main issue is that the remote does not work. We use it to control all of the doors in our house. The issue we have is the fact that we are not the only one using the remote. It will also work when it's plugged into a power supply. We have tried a couple of different brands of power supplies and this is the worst. If you know anything about electronics you know this is a problem with electronic devices, not with power supplies. If it works this remote does so because of the quality of the batteries used. They should be much better than they are. This remote has not had an issue ever since we got it. This is a product that I could not recommend to my friends.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: newegg
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This gadget is terrible. I bought this after I saw a YouTube video that showed how to replace the screen and replace the battery. I had some problems, the device would not charge, I could not use it to watch Youtube videos or any other video because it was freezing and would not show the video. The video I bought did not work either, I had to call the tech support, and they said they had no idea what I was talking about. I was not happy, and I think I will never buy a wireless mouse from these people.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: __________________________________________________________________________  "The product works fine. You do have to have to open it up to do all of the adjustments to get it to work. It has a good feel in your hand, and feels like it should work good with a high speed camera, but it is far from it. The battery is terrible. I had to replace the battery at about 4 weeks and I had almost no signal, and no video. This was only with one of the 2 batteries. It should be rated at 1-2 hours.  If you want a really good camera but are not going to spend $1000 or more, this is a good choice. ,  -Dennis  _________________________________________________________________________  I have an Ego camera, I did not like it. I wanted a more professional looking cam. I got the e-mount cam, as it had a little more "guts" to it. It had a long range, high quality lens and it was pretty well built. I was very impressed with how well it worked with my ego mini. I use the camera on my mv7 and I have had no problems at all. I used the ego mount to take it on the beach with my waterproofing kit, the cam works great, the light is very good and it does a great job with my water resistant camera. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been buying these headphones from them for about a year now. They are very good and good quality and sound good. However i have noticed that there is a lot of noise coming from these headphones. When i put them on, there is the noise of people walking in front of my room. I have tried to keep it outside the room by placing a couple of blankets on top of the speakers. Also, i noticed that when i listen to music from my music library i get this kind of sound coming from my headphones. Not very good sound quality. If i buy more than one pair, i may return them.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had the ebay iHome for a little over 2 months now and I am not happy with it at all. This is the first ebay device I have bought that I have not had a problem with. I bought it because I wanted to have an easy way to turn my smart phone into a smart speaker and this was the easiest and most cost effective way for me to do this. However after the first few weeks of use the sound quality was pretty much non existent. The sound quality is bad and sounds like a cheap speaker. The app can get you a lot of different stations with different songs and you can set a channel to a specific music or movie. But I use a phone with a built in speaker and no speaker phone so I don't really need to listen to the music but I really do want to use the radio function that the app provides. The other problem with the audio quality is that it is so loud it hurts your ears. I usually wear earplugs for my computer and phone, but when I play music the sound hurts my ears. Another thing is that my iHome plays so loud and the sound is so clear it makes me want to yell at the TV so they change the volume. The only good thing about it is the sound from the speaker is crystal clear so when you play music it sounds perfect.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ********** This keyboard doesn't work and is useless. This keyboard does not allow you to enter any information. I have the new model so I have no idea how it will work. I had to send my old one back and buy this one which costs about the same price but is the new one. Not sure how well the new keyboard is worth it. It's really confusing to type on and when you get done you have to go back through the process again because you can't make any mistakes. ***** It should have had the option of the standard QWERTY layout.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It has a lot of limitations. You can't turn on the screen while the battery is plugged in.

It comes with 3 AA batteries and has all the features that I need. Good quality and works great!! 10-02-2012 Review by Rhett H I purchased 2 of these for the office and they both work great. This product was very fast and easy to send back to manufacturer for repair/upgrade. 07-22-2012 for Best Product on the Market I bought this item for two reasons. First reason is that I use it at home for my small portable music player. I have it plugged in to the wall and when I am in the car driving on the freeway, when the lights turn off in my car, I have my music still on. It makes the car go slower. Second reason is I am an artist and I want to have my pictures and music on my computer while I am doing my own projects. I can play all my music on a small compact disc and when the CD is in the player, I do my projects. The battery lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes of music and it is on all the time. I like this item because it works great and my music and pictures stay on and available. 01-14-2011 Review by Anonymous Nice Product 03-08-2011 by Anonymous Excellent Product 09-07-2010 Review by J.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad device for the price. This device is very flimsy, and the connection between the two is very bad. If you buy this, expect to spend a ton of money on a cable to get it to work. This is the first thing I have ever had to repair from the store, and they had to remove the entire product from the wall, put it all back in the box, and charge me for the replacement part. I don't know if they are doing this on purpose or what, but this should not be the cheapest repair on the market.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Perfect! This item is perfect. The only thing is that I wish it was a little smaller. The cables have a very tight fit and it can be difficult to get them out of the back of the printer.  it's the perfect size  Customer Testimonials
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my iphone 4 for about 3 months now and this thing doesnt do shit except send me messages that im still using my old one. Im not buying a iphones anymore for a while.  No more Apple devices  It is hard to think about switching to an Android phone after all the experience I had with Apple's products. I've had an Apple Watch for a little over a week now and I can't say enough good things about it. It's very good and responsive. There's a ton of apps and a lot of useful stuff on the Apple Watch and its very easy to use it.   The problem, though, is that my current phone is an iPhone 4s, which is pretty old, and I was very excited about the phone when I bought it because it came with an 8gb internal storage and I could load up more apps on the internal memory and thus have more space for games, etc.  , but there is no way to load that on the 4s. I cannot even do an internet search on the phone without getting the iPhone's internet browser instead. It has a huge memory limit of 8gb. It is a great phone and I highly recommend it, but Apple should release a phone that has at least 8gb of internal memory. I will buy an iPhone 6+ but will probably wait for that.   as an example I bought a $100 pair of Beats headphones because I thought they were the best in the world. I had to go to Apple's website to purchase them because I couldn't download their app. I can listen to music, record it and view it on my iMac, all at the same time. Now I have an old phone that can only do one or two of these things at a time. That is annoying.   The new iPhone is a good phone, but not as good as my current one, and the 4's memory is way too limited.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!!!! This device is a huge disappointment. I bought this device to replace my old one and I did not like the idea of having a remote and I don't like the fact that there are no buttons on the remote to make it easy. I don''t know why they made it like this. It makes it hard to program. There is no remote control or screen that you can just turn on and use. I have had this for less than two weeks and I was already upset.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my iw4 since July 12, 2014 and it was great till the batteries began to fail and when they did it was pretty much impossible to fix without replacing the whole unit (I thought the battery compartment could be a problem). The first battery I replaced was dead in 4 days, which would have killed the warranty if iw had one. Now iw has made a couple of changes, but the problem remains. I have no confidence that iw will ever get it right. iw's customer service is a joke, but then, all of these devices seem to be a joke. If iw wanted to stay relevant in the audio/machinery industry they should get some real engineers on the phone or in person and discuss what's wrong, and how to fix it. In the meanwhile, I am going to buy an external battery and put it in the back of my m4r.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------ I purchased this for my daughter and I think it is a good device but it does not hold a charge very long. If I charge the battery and leave it on and I am done with it for an hour or more the battery will die. I have had other rechargeable battery and it usually lasts a good day. I did not know about this and I did a lot of research to make sure it would work as promised. It did not, it died on me and the next day I did my homework and had to cancel and refund my order. So I am not happy with it. I thought it would be good for my wife but I had to have her replace the batteries for another year because it died so soon on her. She said she only had to charge it 3 times for a month. I do not recommend this because it only holds a charge for a week and a half.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought 5 of these. The 1st one died within days. Then 2 of them quit working for a week and a half after that. Then 3 others stopped working within 1-3 weeks. i bought a new battery, and now one of the 3 dies too. i am really frustrated because i bought these because i thought they were better than the old cheap Chinese electronic equipment i was using. Now im just trying to find a different option because my first 3 were a total loss.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Steve from The product worked fine until I tried it out on a new computer. I used the new version for my old computer and the new one was not able to recognize it. It took a couple tries before it recognized the newer version. It didn't matter if I used my wireless keyboard or the keyboard that came with my laptop. But once the device recognized the new computer it became slow as all hell! When it finally did recognize my keyboard it wasn't recognized and took up to 30 seconds to boot up. I had to restart it three times to get it to recognize the new machine! If I had used the old model I would have had a very good product. Unfortunately, I'll just have to buy a different model of keyboard. "Good for a short time, but gets hot after that."  Customer Rating:  Review: . This product worked well in my small computer for about a month before it died. I purchased it to replace an older (but faster) model that died suddenly and would not boot. It came with a couple of extra wires, but they did not help. After reading the reviews on the internet, I decided to give it another try. I bought this one to replace the old one. The first time I used it, I liked the wireless keyboard much better. I also thought it was a nice size and the keys felt smooth on the finger. I use a laptop with a keyboard on the right side, so I had a keyboard plugged in to my computer. My experience with this one was very different from my experience with my other one. I was able to use the new model for only a couple hours, and after that the keyboard became hot to the touch. The keys were cold, and the battery did not last as long as it had with the other model. I ended up buying a USB keyboard instead of an adapter. If you are having problems with your laptop having trouble recognizing the keyboard,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had one of these devices for 5 years and its just a waste of money. ive been using this to drive in my truck but it cant do the one thing it was suppose to do. when its on the counter it willnt start. the only problem i have with this item is that it is made in china. i have used other products that were made in this country and made better. if they made the same thing in chine that is made today they would have a $15-$20 gadget. my husband who works for a company that makes equipment for mining has one and is extremely disappointed. i will never buy another one of those devices again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just wanted to let you know that I am not happy with this device. I had it for over a month. First of all, the phone has no battery life. It takes over 30 minutes to charge it up with a standard usb cable. It also doesn't work with google apps. So, I don't know if it has anything to do with the software. Secondly, the device is really bad at playing music or movies. The screen will turn off after a few minutes and then the audio will go out. Also, I can't use my phone with the charger on. And the USB cable is too short. It comes off on its own. I tried putting it on a hard surface and that didn't help. You can't play audio out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------> The keyboard was quite stiff but I was able to adjust it to my liking after a week or so of use. The rest of the keyboard was very mushy and poorly built with no spring to hold the keys in place. The mouse and the monitor I was using were horrible and caused constant scrolling. It did not even track my pointer very well. Also, it took a while to download the software. You should have a decent product if it takes this long to get it running. ------------>. I really wanted to give it 4 stars but since it is a very cheap device I will not be able to do it. It was a lot more fun to play on my PS3 than it was on this cheap little piece of plastic.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is one of those devices that is the only thing that has ever made me want to do a "waste of time" search for an alternative. The reason is that I was very disappointed with the way this thing worked. The controls are very poorly placed and the program was not user friendly. It took forever to get to the menu and I did not understand a single thing that was happening. When I tried to get a printer to print, I found that the printer is not connected to the program.   I would have been much better off buying a printer and using it. The software was not helpful at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:.............................................. My wife bought the samsung iwate to replace an ipl2. I was very excited to finally have a samsung phone. I wanted a smartphone with some of the features of a laptop. The iwates phone is great for emailing, making calls and surfing the web, but it was lacking a key feature I wanted, a camera.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I use this for my iPhone which has very poor sound quality.   I like that the charger does the charging and not the phone.  Would you recommend this to a friend?:   of no : No I do not recommend this product to anyone. I purchased this to use with my iphone 4s. The sound quality of the unit was terrible. It would not charge my apple iphones (samsung) batteries at all. My batteries would not last long at all and would run out of juice very fast. I have had two iphonauts now and each has had the same problem. The only other problem with these is the battery life of these chargers is horrible. If you want a nice charger for your iphonest, do yourself a favor and buy a iphoner, its a better product. . I will never buy another iphonel again. It should be called the iphonder.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!!! It broke right off my Xbox One controllers and the controller had a black wire in the bottom. I have had a ps4 controller, a pc and now a Xbox One controller and all three broke within 5-7 uses. I had to buy a new controller and had to wait over a month. I did not even get it to work properly so that was a huge pain in the ass. I purchased this and did not know anything about this product. I was disappointed as I would have preferred a controller that had been used. The reason for the 2 star is because the company did a very good job with the marketing, and my family and I will still be buying from this company.  Rated 5 out of 5 by gdave from Amazing product, great value We recently acquired two Xbox One's for our kids, one was a gift and the other was borrowed from a friend and we didn't know much about the controller. I started researching, and ended up ordering it from this site. The product itself was perfect, the shipping time was fast, and it was delivered in a timely manner. We are a little bit disappointed that we had to return the controller, but we still feel like it was the right choice.  the best controller ive ever used i have three Xbox controllers now it was so easy and convenient to just plug them in the console with the adapter cable. we all have them all the time and they are all pretty well loved. i highly recommend this product and will continue to buy from this website and their other sites
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ********* I bought this keyboard and I'm not happy about this. I think there is a glitch with the firmware on this one so everytime I do anything the computer won't boot up. It's a little hard to type on because the keys aren't as large as on a regular keyboard but it's not as bad as some other keyboards because this one doesn't have the programmable keys. You get what you pay for but at least it's a real keyboard instead of some f***ing computer. The keyboard is plastic, the layout is terrible, there are no modifiers and it's expensive. *****

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to use at work as an alarm clock/alarm-type device for the small rooms in the building. Unfortunately, the battery power was only lasting a few hours. I could have used the timer to wake up the alarm a couple of times before the battery died but since it was on and ready to go, the timer was a bit wasteful since the battery lasted only 2 1/2 hours.   As it seems to be for most alarm clocks I've seen, the alarm doesn't come on unless you press the button. This is definitely not my thing. This was my second time using this alarm, the first time was for a client's security alarm. After one alarm the device was still on but I'm not sure the battery would last. I do not believe the alarm is very loud.  Did you find this helpful?  Was this helpful?"I've bought the alarm clock for my house. It works well."  "I found the device a great deal. "  It's good. Its cheap. The alarm is a joke.  that is it for alarm clock.  (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had a gps for over a year and i have used it every day for that time and it has never worked. its a nice device but not worth buying just to use it on its own. i was trying to check if a location was open for the night and its only when the phone is in the car, i dont want it in my pockets and the battery is still charging. i think that the unit isnt as good as it was advertised at the beginning. other then that its a really nice device. if you want a device for your car, but dont want to buy a whole new unit for the rest of your life then this is a good deal and the price is great.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very excited to get my ZX Spectrum computer for Christmas in 2002 but it wasn't delivered until 2005. I really enjoyed it for a few months but it died. It died twice in a year and then it would not even turn on and would not boot. I tried various fixes and nothing would work. So I replaced the battery for it with a new battery in the computer and it started up fine. I'm not even mad about the computer being faulty because it was so much fun to play with.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The thing has problems.  1) The power button is completely nonfunctional.  in order to turn on the screen I had to pull out the usb connector.  it would only power on when I plugged the usb in and pulled the plug out.   2) The usb connectors are cheaply made. one was bad, the other just was missing half the wire from the jack.  ,   I would not recommend the iMac Pro. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for about a month now and i have no problems but some others with the remote and the touchpad not working, and the usb port having to be plugged into it for it to work at all! i was so tempted to give it a 5 star rating but the fact that it is so flimsy and fragile makes it so useless.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been having an issue with my computer (dell gpc11) since my gpu was upgraded. i'm getting this same problem. i bought it from an outlet with great service and the guy was very nice. that is until i told him the gpu isnt compatible with his computer and he gave me an expensive repair for a completely new computer. the guy has always done great work for me but its been like that for the last three repairs. the last repair i had him say he had no choice but to call the company that made this computer as if he thought that i wanted a new one. so i told the man this computer is not compatible with my gpc and he told me i could have it replaced for another $100. he said i could tell him to change my computer back to the other model and he could tell them to make it compatible and that would cost me another $300. I want a different computer so i'm not paying for the same thing over and over again. ive tried to get rid of it at the store as well as going to an electronics store that sells it but i have to wait to get my money back because it gets shipped. I dont want a new computer that i can't use with this computer. this computer works great now but i dont know what they will do next! i hope the company takes this problem seriously and dont do what this guy did.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    1. You will never get your money back for this product. If you have an issue with it, you'll have to call and ask for your money BACK, but it's a pain in the ass to do it, as there's no warranty on this device.   2. It doesn't work as well as the original TRS-80 Model 2, the only thing I did was use the TRS to change the color of the keys and there was a slight issue with my keys moving around, but not a big deal.     3. There's not a lot of use for this thing, it's basically a glorified keyboard. But I didn't care because I wanted to use a Model 1 and this is an improvement. If I had to use this again, I would buy a new keyboard and not this one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a great device but it has been out of service for over 6 months now.  My device broke when I dropped it and my battery died. I was going to go with a different brand but they can't do anything about it. They can't even replace it. I'm sure it will come back to life but it will be so expensive I won't be using it again. I would get it from a friend.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great product and it does work, but it is very loud. I put on earmuffs and it makes a HUGE noise when it is working. If you are a heavy user or you are wearing earmuff you may want to look elsewhere.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One night I plugged this in, and it took about 30 seconds to boot up. But after a couple of seconds, the screen showed the computer was not in "sleep mode". I immediately put the device into sleep, and restarted the computer. It was still unresponsive. I powered it off, turned it on, and put it into sleep mode again, it was now working again. I went into sleep and it came back to the desktop! It then went to the BIOS to change the settings but no change! I called Apple Support, they said that maybe I was using the wrong power adapter, or maybe it was the power adapter that they don't supply. The next time I plugged it in it did work, the next time it didn't. I ended up having to return it.  What did you think?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this watch as a Christmas present and was very excited to receive it. However, it took all of my Christmas Eve to get this thing fixed. It was very difficult to get it working after I took it out of the box. I tried to do a factory reset and got a lot of bad information on the computer. It would not boot and I was unable to use it at all. I went back to the watch seller and bought a second one, but this one was too big and heavy. It took me a few more days of trying to work with it to try to fix it. After a couple days, I finally got it working and was able to use my timepiece. I ended up calling the watch company to try and get it fixed for free (because it is too big) and they said they didn't have time for it, but they said it would be taken care of in the future. I haven't heard anything from them since. I still have the other one I bought, but if it is still a problem, I probably won't buy from them again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:..............................................I had this for a month or so and i loved it. It has everything i want and needed out of a keyboard. When i got this keyboard i was expecting that it would be the same as the others. It wasnt. There was a HUGE difference. Everything is bigger, and the keys are bigger, like there are 2 inches between each. I was not happy at all. But i didnt take it back. I had to try it out for awhile to figure out what was wrong. I went into the store and had the tech try to fix it. He told me it was just my fault. He tried to make it sound like it wasnt the problem. I told him I had the exact same keyboard in my other computer. So he told me to go back to my other keyboard. I tried it and it works well. I really dont have a problem with this keyboard. My only issue is i cant use it on my laptop to type emails and stuff. I have to use the laptop keyboard to do it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! You get what you pay for and the quality isn't there! My phone battery had no charge or power and the screen had a huge crack on the screen. It was extremely obvious that it had been dropped. I had to purchase a new one to replace the old defective one. I also would have rather just bought a new phone but the phone would not fit into the old battery compartment. It would be nice if there was a way to have the battery replaced and have it come with a new battery and charger. You can still find some with no crack on it. I was a little concerned about it breaking the day after it came out but it is fine. I've had it for three days now. I hope it will hold up for at least another couple of months. I have it for about 2 weeks now and it still works. This is a serious negative for a cheap phone.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, July 25, 2011  I am very satisfied with my purchase  by A Customer from WV USA  Pros: Great for the price  Cons: None  Review: The phone works great in the pocket, but it doesn't charge in my pocket, I'm waiting to see what happens in the future.  on a side note, I received my order within a few days. -C.C.  have used it for a couple of weeks and have been very satisfied.  in my opinion it performs great  it works great ,  -G.L. from MN  Good Price, good phone  By Andrew from New Zealand  Rating: 5 of 5 - Excellent product, good value   Pros: It works good. The good is it has a good battery life. It has an SD card slot and a micro SD. , Cons: the camera is bad, but its OK.  and my only real con is that my battery is not very strong, but still good enough.  "The good is, it has an all black design and is very comfortable. The bad is, and my main con is, its the only one that I think has a poor camera, its very small. and the camera could use more processing power. I am not sure how it will fair in the long run"  , Overall: It's a good price and great performance. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an extremely bad item. After reading the reviews on the site, I decided to purchase this phone on the condition that the case was not going to fall off. After getting the phone, I noticed that the phone was falling off the keyboard. I was able to get the phone back on, but the battery was dead. I have never had any problem with the phones. I am a college student so I do not have a huge amount of money to spend, and I don't have a lot of time. If the battery died, I wouldn't be able to use this phone, as it would not be able get a signal. I also received the phone a few days late as well. So, overall I am very disappointed in this device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- I bought this item for my iPhone and it works great! It does not matter if it's hot or cold or anything else. I have never had a problem with the iPhone 7 Plus. I just don't think the iPhone has enough juice in it. I also bought the one for the 8, it does not work and I have to get a new one. I had to go through two different Apple Store locations because they didn't even know what I had. I don't trust them with my money and if you don't want to buy a new phone from them, don't buy the one on Amazon. If I had known about this problem when I bought the new iPhone, I would have bought a third-party battery charger. But, if you have one, then buy it from Amazon.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You have to be patient with this device. I have the 8 hour version. The screen is only readable in direct light. I bought it for my husband and he is very happy with it.   Pros:  + It will not turn on when plugged into a wall outlet  - The charging port is a little hard to find, the directions were not clear.   The manual does not explain how to use the charger properly.   with a good battery that is charged up to 2 hours the phone is still running.   (the manual also says the charging port goes to the charger, not the phone.)  Cons:  (The manual didn't give any)  * Not included the battery charger for the cord  *** The cord had a lot of slack, it doesn't come off the charger easily and the cord could get caught on the charger  (If you're going to use it on a desk, use it as an extension cord, it has two USB ports) 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone 5s i got this phone only for 2 days now.

It just keeps saying that it doesn't recognize the charge port.. i'm really hoping the phone will work, but i'm not really excited about having to deal with this phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this gadget for 3 days now and its an absolute joke, and the batteries dont last longer than 12 hours. the buttons work but they dont work at all when pressing them at any speed. and if they dont work you have to wait 2 to 3 hours for them to re charge it again. and even if it was working i couldnt use it to listen to music because the volume isnt loud enough. the usb port is also so bad it doesn't even let you plug in a usb drive or anything at all. if this gadget would have been made of better materials and had a better battery i would of given it 5 stars, but im giving it only a 2 as its the worst gadget ever. don't buy it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the best of all worlds with this tablet but its time to upgrade. i use it daily and i love the size it is. but theres no way it can keep up with my work and its battery drain is huge. ive been trying to find a way to get around the battery drain issue and so far i haven't found one, unless you're willing to charge the battery everyday. i can't imagine what a good tablet should be in the current market. if i could get my hands on an android tablet theres a good chance i'd be buying one in a second.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive bought this in a hurry and it works just like it said but the usb plug isnt strong enough i can just plug it in but my laptop cant charge in this fashion. so its an average product.  I bought this charger with my X1 Carbon and it is well made and just the right size to fit the X1. I am now using the xbox 360 charger with it and it was easier to use with this.  with X2 you need to be sure to plug in your charger at the same time every time. Also i found with the x1 it will not charge the X2 unless you put it into the charger and put your cord over the charger. But with the X-master, you dont need to do anything!  PROS: -good value for the price -easy to use CONS: -USB cable wasnt long enough -only one USB port, need 2 ports for PS4 and 2 for the PC

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used a cheap digital sound recorder for a few years. it's cheap, and is an easy device to use, but once you start to mess with it, it makes the best sound you could ever hope to get with a microphone. that's right, the sound you get from this recorder is absolutely horrible. if it could be made to sound like it could if your recording yourself, it would be amazing! if you have to record something, i dont recommend this recorder.   was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem is with the charger and the wire.  It will get it to charge but not very quickly, and the charger will not stay on to charge it again, the cable is of poor quality. The charger is also a cheap one, as well.  for the price you can't expect much.  that is why I am not using it anymore. .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very poor product for the money. It will not hold a charge and the cable is very bad. It also gets in the way when charging the device and makes it awkward. I am a software engineer and this will not fit on the table and would have to sit on the other side to use. This is not an excellent device for the price. If you have a lot of money to spend, look at a better brand or do the smart buy and get something that does what it is supposed to do.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the mokka for 3 months and it works great the only issue i have is when the charger runs out of charge it starts playing and playing like a toy so i can't use it.i have changed the batteries and the battery compartment is leaky so i wouldnt recommend this product.i do like the size but not for the money.  If you need to charge your phone or tablet for more than about 5-10 minutes, this will do the trick. With its 5 foot power cord, the Mokka's portable charger can be a lifesaver for a lot of devices.  It charges pretty fast and has a 2-year warranty which is much better than the average manufacturer warranty.   My one complaint is that the battery capacity (with the same battery that came with it) is only about 1,100 mAh, which is the smallest of the batteries on this list. That's not going to do it for most people, especially when it's running full speed.  .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- The cord is not very long. We had it for 10 months and I could still hear the sound. Now, we have it for 8 months and have to replace the speaker. It has the highest volume out of any other device. The volume is louder than my old cell phone. I used to have a cell phone that would ring constantly and beep. This device doesn't. My old cell phones have battery issues and they do not last very long but the sound quality is so much better on this one. I am still having issues with the remote not working. It is easy to use but I am always having trouble with the button. If I don't have a Bluetooth headset I can't use the remote. If you want a device with an awesome sound quality that will still have good battery life, and a remote that works when you have a headset connected, this is the one for you. I gave it a 5 star rating because I'm happy with it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:...................................................I had an Apple iphone 4 and i lost it to the washing machine in the laundry. i called apple and they told me that my warranty was not valid because i lost the iPhone 4. i contacted apple and i got no response. then i went to the local apple store and they said that my iPhone 4 could be exchanged for the iphones 4s if i pay the shipping fee and they would give me a new iphon. i got a new iPhone 4s iphoner and then i lost my iphony. i was like i cant believe this is happening.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! This is a bad purchase. I just used it to charge my cell phone. It's a very cheap, very thin piece of plastic. If the battery went down and it started to fall apart I would have dropped it like I dropped the battery on my phone. I'm going to go through an external wall charger to see if that works. It has a long cable. Don't waste your money.  I would not recommend this product to a friend: A friend of mine has purchased two of these for his personal use to charge his laptop at his work. He has been very happy with them. It looks good, doesn't make a lot of noise, the battery can last awhile and is pretty small.  a good alternative for your phone charger: I've been using these for a couple of weeks now. I bought one for my phone that I carry around. They seem to be working fine. I don't think they're loud enough to annoy anyone in a coffee shop or a cafe, and I like that I can charge my phone in my back pocket (without needing to keep my phone on my desk or in a bag or pocket). It's an interesting idea that has potential. If they are made well, they should be just fine.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad purchase:   When I went to purchase a Sony Vaio i made sure that this product was going to work properly. Well, I got a phone call from Sony that told me that they would need to send me a new battery and the charger to be compatible with the new battery. So I told them I was sure they would come to me. When I called Sony back, I was told by the salesperson that they were out of stock. I asked her why and she told me I needed to buy the wrong one. So, what ever Sony may have told me was NOT true. When it comes to Sony, I can only trust them.  I tried on the new unit to verify that it works fine. I turned on my new Sony Vaiano and the unit recognized right away. It was like they were plugged in right away and it worked great! I also got an update notification and all was good.   This is a very good deal. If you are considering buying the Sony Vaolo HDTV you should get this product. It is an excellent value.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery lasts a long time but once the batteries in my phone run out, I'm stuck with this piece of junk for the rest of my life.  I've heard from other owners that their phones are still alive but don't have any luck with trying to charge them.  it should have a "charge for x hours" button on it because they're all saying that's where their phones stop charging.  and not "keep trying".  the phone is the most difficult thing I own. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The first time i bought this my wife thought i was trying to sell it and then when i finally got it and was using it i found out how stupid it was for her to think so. My main complaint about this is that you have to have a 3.5mm audio jack. I can get my headphones in and out of the unit without a jack if i plug one into it or if I turn the jack off and plug my headphones into my iPhone or iPod. It takes too long to turn it on if you have a remote. The unit comes with a screwdriver and some tape but no other instructions that i can see. It doesn't have a manual. It is just a sticker with no directions. I bought the product to use with my old computer that doesn't support a 3 jack cable. If i were to ever buy this again i would just get an Xbox 360 audio cable so i don't have to use a plug.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had the ipad 2g for almost a year and it is an absolute piece of junk. i would rather have money to buy a new laptop than have this phone. i have tried so hard to get the ipads to work but every time after turning it on its turns off, not just the ipac 2g but every iphone iphones that i have ever tried. ive tried to get ipad to show the ipods and iphons and every time it just freezes or dies at random. i'm going to buy another ipad and then use the ipod 3 and 4. i don't know what it is but this iphon 2 is just a piece of garbage. you might think i'm being critical but it is the truth.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the first device that I have ever had to return because of a defect. The first issue was the USB port being too small. Once I realized that there were no options to enlarge the port I called my electronics store and they provided a USB extension adapter which worked fine. The second issue was that the battery would not hold a charge for more than 30 minutes of use. When I received the phone I noticed that the back of the phone had a scratch and it was too difficult to figure out the problem. The phone was in a case and I never got the battery back. They refused to help and I had to throw the phone away. The company is incompetent and the person who made my phone, I never did receive my money back from them.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was looking for something that would look like my iPad mini. It was the Apple store near my house that sold it. It had a little stand with a power cord and a bluetooth port, it looked like it would plug into any power outlet at home.   As soon as I plugged it into the power outlet, it became very noisy and very hard to operate. I can't stand the noise of this thing anymore. This is one of the loudest things I own. I don't want to buy another thing this loud! It's very hard on my ears.  , and it makes a really terrible noise. I'm very disappointed and will not purchase any product like this.   was hoping for a lot more than that, but will give it another chance.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This  gadget just doesn't work.   I bought this gadget to make a webcam that has a mirror on it.   It takes a mirror to make the picture that you can see and it takes the microphone to make it speak when you are talking to the webcam.  I thought it was a great idea and wanted to make one as a gift for my friend who had just started webcamming and I bought it for her to use.   After one use I had to stop using it as I have heard of other people being turned off from talking when using the webcam but I decided to test it and I was disappointed.    It wouldn't take any pictures at all even with the mirror on and the microphone would only say, "Yes?"   After 2 use of this gadget it is ruined and is unusable.  The only reason I bought a different webcam is that the mirror was too big for me and I couldn't find any small mirror in my town that is small enough for my hand.  So if you are trying to use it to take pictures and your hand is in front of the mirror then be careful.   Also keep the mirror off the webcam when you speak to it as the microphone on the webcam works better if it is speaking.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive just bought my first mp3 player. it works very well on my iphone 5s. ive got a little bit of a problem though. the bluetooth connection isnt very strong. the other day when i was playing songs i couldnt get it to stream them to my phone. so, i did the next best thing and connected a ipod. and it works perfect now! but i have had this problem in the past with ipods.  ive been using my new iphones for 2 years. this is the first mpd i have owned. this device was a great investment. i could hear my songs before i connected the ipod so thats a plus. and with the ipods bluetooth now ive never had a problem. thanks for an outstanding product!!!!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Cate from Great product! Great product. It has been easy to set up with my ipod. I just bought the blu ray player and it is working great.  Reviewed by Jim, we use our iPod Touch and iPhone with MP3 Player! They work great!  Great product! Works great with my iPhone.  is was easy to install. no issues so far.  in the future i will get an mpd on my ipod as well.  on my iPhone iphon 5s, it streams music well. the only issue i can see is the fact that there are no manual controls on this product. all you do is type in your artist, track title, and artist and that's it. i know this isnt a big deal as I have this mpd for years and its always worked for me. if this mp d ever got anything as complicated as this manual would be helpful. other than that its a great product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for over a month, and it is now starting to really suck. there are still several hours left in the battery, but for $130, it should be more powerful. this device is very bad to use with an external mouse as well. the buttons on this device are VERY finicky when the device is plugged in, and i have had to remove the mouse several times in order to use the device with my external mouse. this is an extremely weak design for an external device. so far i have only had this device for over 3 days, and im starting to become very disappointed.  by Andrew G. on 11/23/2016 byon 11/230/2016
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an excellent product for the price but it does not work correctly and I had to return the unit. First the usb cable it came with did not work. The usb cable from the USB to usb dongle was made of very thin plastic. Second it did not detect a phone. The product had not come with any kind of charger and did not have a usb cable. Third there is no way to use the device at night when the phone is asleep. I've tried everything from a computer to a computer, and no matter how long I kept using my computer and charger I still couldn't get the device to work. I have tried calling them at 3 am to see if they would return the product and also called back in to ask if I had any problems. I was told that they would not refund the product but they would send me a new one. The phone has no charging ability, it will only function when the device is plugged in to a USB port. If the device comes in a box with no instructions the user does not know where to plug it in or how to activate the power.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was in the process of buying a new e-cigarette when my phone rang. "Honey, there's a problem" was all I heard.   It wasn't an actual problem, but the call came from a random number I didn't recognize.  It was an old cell phone number and I'd never used it before.    The phone went to voicemail, but after that I heard a recording of a baby crying and the voice of an adult woman talking about having had a miscarriage.  I called the number back and a short while later a man answered.  He said he was the mother of the baby and that she wanted to talk to me about how she had lost her baby.  After about ten minutes, he said, "It's OK, honey.  We'll send you a new one soon."  I didn´t know how to respond.  What exactly does this mean?  It could be nothing, but I didn¹t have any reason to suspect something was wrong.   At that point, I felt guilty that I had a new electronic device at home that could possibly be a security risk, but there was nothing I could do.    I didn ¹t want to call the number again because it would only invite more of the same.  For some reason, I decided to ignore the call.   I´ve been having this issue since October 2013.  My phone rings every week or so. I always answer it and I'm never sure if there is an actual emergency or not.  But the problem always seems to happen at night.  Sometimes, I'm asleep and my phone rings or I get a call when I'm in the car.  There seems to be a connection, but it doesn't work at all.  As an example, my phone's battery was at 75% when I decided I was going to put the phone on battery life mode.  So I plugged it in and went to bed.   I woke up two days later to a ringing alarm in my phone.  One of the four buttons on my phone was pressed, so I pressed it and it didn't work.  Now, I don't know how I got in the habit of leaving my phone on that button, but every time it happened, I woke myself up and decided to keep the phone plugged in.  This time, I left my phone unplugged in the night and woke up early

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******************* I got my second e-cigarette from this store, and when I tried it out today it gave me all the same issues the other one had. It would smoke really hot, and smoke a lot. It did not last long in the tank before it died. The second one is not going to last me long either, it is on its last legs and will soon be gone. It is very annoying. I am on my third e-cig from this place, and I cannot recommend them. This is the worst store I have ever been to. I would never buy from them again.  I have been a customer of this company for years. The selection has never been better. The best prices in town. I also highly recommend that you call in your order prior to pickup. They will give you exact shipping rates. This company has changed over the years but the product quality has remained constant. This site is great, I have found all the most popular brands with great prices.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A very good and well built electronic device that is useful, well built and well designed. However the "E-Pill" is not a very practical solution to the issue of keeping you from having to remember to turn off your smartphone every night. The device is very lightweight and works well but with a very weak and clunky feeling as it is always on. The screen is not the best I have ever seen or used but it is very bright and has great video quality. The battery lasts for days and more than one day of continuous use. However for me the issue with this device is the "lightweight" or lack thereof which makes it useless at times and at others just another item of "stuff" to keep you "in the loop". Overall a very good product and I would recommend it to any tech friend that I would know, for those that have never used an electronic device before as it allows you to keep up with the "apps" and is easy to use.  Rated 5 out of 5 by brian from Excellent product for battery life issues I have had a cell phone for a number of years and used it for everything from phone calls, messages, emails, internet, phone banking, and other things. However recently my battery life has been decreasing, and when it does I end up getting annoyed with the device and it's battery life. This is a good little device which does what it says on the tin. It monitors your phone's usage and charges it's batteries. If you are in a rush and need to get a phone or other device quickly it is well worth it. If that is not your thing you can't go wrong with it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The iPad 3 came with a new battery but it did not last long. I would not recommend this device. The software is so limited and slow, it is difficult to use for any other than simple emails and texts. There is only one way to sync to a computer and there is no way to keep an entire folder synchronized, which is what I do all the time. I have had it for more than a year and have bought a few different tablets in the last 3 years, and never thought about purchasing this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The phone has a horrible battery. Every time I turn on my phone, it dies. I've used it on my work computers, my home phones, and on my tablet.

Yes No 0 / 0 users found this helpful by ryohi jay Posted on Feb 18th 2014, 21:29 Reply  #20 D  I would not buy the H77. I have used it twice. The first time i went with the 2.4Ghz version and it wouldnt go past 500Mbps but at the time it was at 1.3GHz. So i changed the firmware to the newest one and now it goes to 2.7Ghz. If i use the h80i and not the H76 it will do less than 20Mbit speeds. I was told that the h77 is going to be released in a couple of weeks, so when that comes out i will upgrade it to 2ghz. I had to do a lot of messing with it.   (the only reason i bought this one and the other from china was for the dual wifi and not because i wanted 2x2 wifi and 2.3ghz and the H80i does not support this)  All in all this is a good buy, but only as a cheap way to try it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******** I've owned this product for about a year and its still not working. I bought it to watch some shows on my tv using my computer to play my music. It works okay but it has a hard time moving the mouse. I also bought another one because I am tired of all my other one's going. I will never buy from this company again.  I bought two of these to use in my music program on my computer. They both work fine but I can't hear a note from my iPod with them. They aren't bad but they are not good for my needs.  in comparison to my iBook and the new iPod, these don't sound nearly as good, they are hard to use, very noisy and don't use nearly as much power.  of course I could go back and buy an mp3 player or an iPod but why spend all the money on the iPod when you could just use these? I'm still disappointed  It's nice, but doesn't have any features I like. . The sound is great and it has 3 speakers, so it'll make a decent computer speaker, but not a good one for using with headphones. It's just not going to do it for me.  on the flip side it has 2 USB ports and it charges up in 1 hour. , It's hard to plug in a usb cord. I have to plug it in 2 ways. The speakers were very clear, they sound like a laptop and I've been very happy with this purchase. I'm not sure if I can recommend it due to the price, but I really like this product. I've never used it in a computer but I have used it for video editing and watching TV on my laptop.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this device in November 2007, and was very pleased. However, the quality of the battery is poor, and when using a rechargeable battery, I would always have to plug it in every time I wanted to use the device. So much for a low-cost gadget. I'm giving up and giving this up for a more powerful model. I've owned several other brand of flash devices, and this one was always the best, including my old CR-600. I just wish they would upgrade the battery and design for the modern world.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have the original one from the first generation, and it is still working good. I bought the second generation and it does not work at all. It always turns off, and then it takes more than 30 seconds for it to wake up again. This is unacceptable to me and the person who designed and manufactured the device. I hope they can improve this to a better design. It is a big loss of time to try to reset it when it keeps going off. I have already contacted customer support, and they said they will help me out.  What could I have done differently? I bought my original Sony PXW-X900 on August 9, 2017, and used it every day since. I don't use it for video or gaming (I'm not a gamer), but it's a great camcorder for my daily use.   This year my battery started to die after a month, so I decided to buy a new one. I'm not happy with my current model's battery life, but I figured I could upgrade. After some research, I bought this model. It's advertised as the most powerful model, yet when I tested it with some heavy content, it was a little below.   in November, I plugged it into my USB hub and I noticed some sort of voltage warning, and I could feel a buzzing sound coming from the device's top. After several days of constant use, my battery died. I sent it back to Sony. They sent me a replacement, which arrived a few days later. I used it for three days and the battery finally died after a week of continuous use. I contacted Sony about it, but they were very friendly and helpful. I am a satisfied customer who did not get a refund.   on October 15, 2017 I plugged my PX9100 into my usb hub and suddenly my device started to get very hot. I plugged the device into my laptop (which is a Macbook Pro Retina 15" with 8 gigs of RAM) and it became very hot too. I opened the device and noticed the charging indicator light was flashing. I went to the Sony store in San Francisco to make a complaint. The store called a technician who told me he had checked the device for power and it did not have any problems. The technician sent me home to find a replacement from Sony (who did not send me a refund). When I got the replacement, I noticed that the battery was not holding a
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great device but not a very good digital camera. The camera is a bit slow, has a very difficult to adjust exposure settings and you have to have the camera pointed in the correct direction. If you are looking for a camera for video, that is easy to use, then this camera is good.  Was this review helpful? Yes No 1 / 1 users found this helpful mr.f.c., Philadelphia, PA USA (1 review)  good but.. Review by John Location: St. Paul, MN. USA. (1 reviews) -  This camera was amazing! When i first got this thing it was a lot of fun to try it out and i did some really cool stuff. My first photo of the moon with this is pretty cool and I could of gotten more if i got more exposure in the photo. But the best thing that this camera does is it's really pretty. The pictures are amazing. And even though it was hard to set up i still had some fun with it. If your trying to get a good picture you could of got some great ones using the phone app. It took me maybe 10 minutes or so to set it up the first time.   But the best part about this camera was the price. The first time I purchased this i had a hard time to find the best place for it, and i got so tired of it so i looked at some other cameras at the dollar store and this thing was way more expensive, and theres nothing wrong with that. It just took a lot longer for me to figure out how to get it set up. I did get some photos but they were not really that good. And i was not able to get any good video from this.   on my second time with this camera i was able to do some pretty good stuff, but i had to buy a mount for it and put some kind of gimbal on it to get some nice video and it was really hard to get that set up too.  . If it had been a little easier to set this thing up i would have gotten more great pictures and less hassle.   the camera also had a bad issue that i didnt even notice until i went to put it down and found that the lens on the back was broken.     but overall this was a great little camera. It's fast and it's pretty and it has a good quality lens that it takes photos that are pretty

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:..................................................I bought this to monitor my home's humidity levels and I was very pleased with this purchase. But I had my doubts that the unit would stay on and I would have no idea when I turned the unit off and then on again. I was wrong. This unit had been on for 3 months now and it is still on. If I shut off the unit, it will turn back on as it was originally designed to do. This is very bad. There should be a warning when the unit turns off that there is no power coming in.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the blu ray player to watch a movie. The player worked great with my tv.  My wife bought a second tv. She said that it wouldn't connect to the tv. I bought the second tv and the player would not connect. After trying other cables I finally found out that the first tv was missing the HDMI connection. I then took out the blu-ray player and connected it and it connected to the second one. I am not sure what to think about the second player. .  for more information: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZJU4C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 I bought this blu rayplayer to watch movie on my tv using my cable tv. The blu ray was ok. But when I tried to watch on my other tv it wouldn\'t work with it. After searching everywhere I finally noticed that the Blu ray player doesn't have an HDMI input for the other tv. It may be possible to use the other blu ray cable to connect both tv to the blu tray player but if the connection between the tv and other tv is not so good I would avoid buying this blu-rays player. For me the blu rays player is ok for movies but for a tv or blu ray it needs work for the connection with my cable TV

Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, September 12, 2013  I'm glad I bought this  by K. from El Paso TX USA  Review: This is my second product from Ralink and my first was the DVI to HDMI adapter. I use the HDMI adapter for connecting to my PC for playing games. So far I have been very pleased with this adapter. Very easy to use, has good range, and has a long cord. If I were to get a DVI converter I would go with one from Apple. I used to use a Toshiba laptop DVI adapter, but I prefer the quality and functionality of this.  to the best of my knowledge this is the only Ralinking device on the market that has a built in dual mode HDMI/DVI cable, and a DVP-to-VGA converter that plugs into the adapter for VGA to DVI conversion. I bought it to replace the Ralinks' original DVI cable and to also replace my old DVI-D to DVP adapter. The adapter is so good it allows me to run both the DVP and the HDMI out to my desktop computer for use with a DVR or a cable box. It was pretty easy to figure out how to plug it in using the supplied instructions and then my HDMI cable, although it may not look like it it. The DVP is an HDMI port. If you have DVI devices like a VGA card, you will need to connect it with a new adapter.  I bought the RALink RXTX100 (dual mode adapter) and the R-Link RFX100 (HDMI-to DVI connector) from Amazon, both are advertised for sale in this exact configuration. I got the RFX 100 over the RXTX 100, I wanted to give this a shot since I already have an RalINK Rx, I only wish there was a way to do a back to back comparison for that product since the RXT 100 and RXTX are identical. This product does a great job, I've had no issues with it. .

It was easy to install, even with a faulty memory chip. However, when I tried to connect my iPhone to my computer with that phone, the phone turned off again and I could not find a button to turn it back on.  I called your service and asked for a supervisor. I also called and told you I was getting a new phone as my old one was defective.  in short: I don't have a good phone, as it doesn't work with my computer, so now I'm stuck with it.  the phone does not have a memory problem but it still shows the old screen when I try to do something on my laptop. What's worse, the new phone comes with the new screen. Now I don`t know how long I can wait for a new one, but if you can help I would really appreciate it. Thank you
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ******************** I have been using this for over a year and I am not impressed at all. This is not an apple product. I bought this for my children for Christmas and they both use it and they are both VERY disappointed with it. First the screen is very dim. I get the same dim screen every time I turn the unit on and it is extremely difficult to see anything when you are reading the paper at the table. Second the batteries last only about one week before they need to be replaced. I was hoping the battery would last for years but it has no where near that amount of life that the apple product has. This thing just does not have the same quality. It is also very hard to use the printer. It has a hard time pressing the paper to print, there is not a lot of pressure required. Also it takes about 3 times longer than the apple to print a sheet of paper and once you have the print out you have to clean it up so it does not stick to the printer, which is a hassle when you get to your work and have to throw the printout away, then get it cleaned up again. The printing works but it is a pain and is way too expensive for an item that is supposed to last years. I think the people at Apple should look into this and maybe consider changing the batteries. I would have bought this at Apple if they would have put some effort into it. There is no way this will last me forever.

The sound quality was awful and the battery life was poor. After that week I never used it again. I would recommend against it if you can get a good deal. Rating:        1/2 A good low priced product with a few caveats.  The software is extremely glitchy, and the software for the microphone works really badly.  A nice little device that's simple to use and has a good range of features. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ********* *********** I bought this to replace my previous "high powered" gaming mouse with a new one that is way more responsive and more precise. I bought the wireless version for better range. The mousepad is great. It is very thin, lightweight and has great grip. I would have given it 4 stars but I have to complain about the software. I did not use any of the features like the "replay" or "mouse wheel" to help with my work and school work on my laptop. I can't use them because of the way it is setup. After several months, my mouse now gives me constant jitters. This product should have come with two free software packages to use it as you wish. Other than that, if you use the software to help your work and life, you will enjoy it. I will not be purchasing the wireless edition any longer.  Rated 4 out of 5 by James from Great peripheral for my PC! I bought it after watching some videos on YouTube that showed the superior performance of the Logitech G900s. I used the mouse with my PC for about a month now and have found it to be absolutely great. My only complaint is that when I connect it to a laptop, I can only get 3 clicks per second. It may be my PC, or I may have to do some software changes on it that could make it better. 1st off: I'm really impressed. The quality is good, and this is my first Logitech product. So far so good. It's light, and it's great for my purposes. 2nd, the software that comes with the mouse is absolutely terrible. It does not allow you to customize anything, nor do you have a choice if you want it to use one of the software programs. I had to get 3 different programs for the mouse, which was a hassle. I like the software, but it makes me wish it had more control over the mouse. 3rd, I wish the mouse came with a USB cable. I find it hard to get a decent signal from the mouse without it. This one has an USB adapter, but I prefer not having to use my mouse in a PC case. 4th, there is no way I can review this product without using it. My office mouse has been with me for years and it is fine. I am going to purchase a second mouse when this one runs out. A very good mouse. If you are
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:!!! I bought this to listen to my iPod in the car, and the sound quality is great when driving but I have to drive back and forth to a big store in my city because I am worried about the car stereo not being on!!!!!! If you want a good sound system this is not it!!!  " The unit works just as expected, but when I got it I was surprised by the price, it's so affordable, and what a great price for what you get. I'm very impressed and I'd recommend this to anybody who is looking for a good quality audio unit for just $30. I had my doubts about the sound, but am very happy with it. I haven't had a chance to use it for more than an hour, but I will keep it as my go to for any type of music.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best Value I was very impressed with this unit, I was expecting a bit more from it. The sound is very good with the volume turned up. I can't wait to go on a road trip with my friends.

I have not used this product but this was the best buy I could find for my old Sony VAIO. I would recommend this product to anyone, however, I did have one problem. I am a beginner to using a computer, I bought it because I was a new user, I would like to help myself. Anyway I did not see any option for software that allows me to change the size of the monitor. I read through all the reviews but in my case it did not work. The video driver did not allow it. I got frustrated and told the tech at the store and he told me he would talk to the customer service to see what could be done. I went back out there and spoke with the tech and he said he would check it out and would call me back. I called back and he came back and told me to email him and he would call you. I did but he never did. I gave him all the information I had and he gave me an answer I am not happy with. It says in my email that it can not be changed, and he says it is a security feature, that it will not allow that. I said, what if the program I had wanted to try, that was written to work with it, were to be updated to allow for it, would it work. He said he could not do that. He would tell me to call the company that makes the video driver, and ask them to change it for me. I say no. He says I need to be patient with them, because its not a hardware problem. Its not a problem with this monitor. He told me I have to contact Sony. I asked him why, and why couldn't I get the answer, and if its a security thing? I want to be sure the issue is with me. He

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very good and easy to use I have used this thing a couple of times and it has never failed me at any of my audio projects. The one thing that I would like to have is the ability to have more than one speaker or two at once so that you could play the left and right channels independently. I had to remove the two screw holding the speaker out of the way and slide the speaker back in for that.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________________ I own a ROKA-200 and purchased this model in a different color, the red one. It looks great, very clear and crisp, but it did not do what it was intended to do. If you need a good quality, low noise, low profile and low cost, I don't think this is it. I can use it in my garage, but when I move it out of the garage it stops working and makes a loud noise. I would like to see how the model looks when I put it outside, not in the house, where it is not supposed to work. This is a good product, but please, fix this issue.

Overall, i do not recommend this phone, especially considering all the bad reviews i've read.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had my e-mail/computers connected to it for a couple of years now and i love it. but today i came across some minor problems:  the light in the bottom of the keyboard doesnt light up on my macbook pro.  and when i get it set up, the usb port in my iphone 4 (which was also connected to the e-machines USB) doesn't function. and the soundcard works fine. ive been reading about how the macbook can become extremely hot and i dont really understand this one problem.  the e machines i have have all been really good quality. i only have 3 bad things about the e Machines... firstly the usb cable, ive tried several different types and ive really like the one that comes with the device but i think its one of the more expensive cable types out there, because the price isnt as good as others.  secondly the sound card is only good for audio/video playback, which ive only done on one occasion so i dont know if its going to be the same for other use.   thirdly is the problem with the usb connection,  the usb ports seem to be so cheap. they are cheap and i would have thought that  i would have had better quality usb cables. and fourthly    i just can't believe that this can't have a 3.5mm jack. i know this is probably a small complaint but i have had a few of these devices and   they can be very nice to work on, but the sound issues   can be quite irritating. and all in all,   the   only   problem   with   this   device   is   that   for   most   of   its use   in   my   home   it   does   have   a  3.0 mm jack   but   as  i said   if   you ve got one   and  i  can see   someone   might   like   to   get one ..  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this for 4 months now and I am very disappointed with this unit. The problem is that this unit is so sensitive that it can cause a bad signal if your using it for streaming from your laptop or from another device and you are on a higher bandwidth. I will not purchase from them again because of this. I highly recommend buying this unit from another supplier.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for about 2 months and i cant even get it to work  Review by David - (4/6/2011)  I have been waiting for this product for many years but never got it. After i saw some reviews on this product i had to give it a try. It works pretty good. The only problem is that i can't get the remote to work. I think if i put my thumb on the button and depress it and move my finger away from it it should work.  A+  (4/5/2011 )  Not satisfied. I bought this product 2 weeks ago. When it arrived, it was pretty much useless. This product is junk and does not work. Not a good purchase for sure  Good but not perfect. - (2/12/2011).  This device works well, and I've been using it for a week now. However, I have some serious gripes about the quality of this product. The buttons are cheap plastic and easily broken, and the buttons seem to bend from the pressure placed on them. I can't say I'm surprised, because I had the same problem with one of my previous wireless remote controls.  is the best wireless remote, and you can easily replace it, but the problems with the buttons (and lack of power) will prevent it from a complete 5-star rating.  the best one  good device - (11/28/2010).  the remote is very light, good quality, and can take a lot of punishment. - (5/5 /2010)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The audio quality was horrible. I'm not saying that it was bad because it wasn't, but it's not that good. There were a lot of pops, clicks and other noises. The microphone was also really weak. It wasn't much of a problem for me since I was recording for friends, but if you are recording in a noisy environment like the bathroom or living room, this is not a good solution. The speaker quality was also poor. The bass was lacking, and the highs were extremely compressed. The subwoofer was ok, but not what it could be. All in all, this device is not worth the money. Rated 4 out of 5 by RYAN C. from Good portable microphone, good quality audio This is a portable microphone with a nice quality audio signal. The sound is not as clean as a laptop mic, but compared to the sound of the internal mic this one is very close. The noise is very low. I like the fact that it is waterproof and has a clip on clip so you can stick it to your shirt. I have the wireless version, but the audio quality is not nearly as good.  Rated 5 out of respect from Works great in a crowd. My son is going on a date and he has a camera with this mic, I picked it up in the store and now he has it with me for the next date. The price was good as well!  This microphone is good. It is a little more portable than the $100 Nikon F2.0 mic, which isn't bad considering it can be attached to the camera on a belt loop, but I'm sure the battery lasts a lot longer. The mic works great when there is a lot going on and the microphone is just close enough to capture everything. It does have a few limitations, though. The first is that the mic does not record in stereo, which can be a pain for a single microphone with no stereo mics on it. There is an external stereo mic on the phone that would probably be better than the built-in mic on this. Also, the volume is a bit low for my liking, but hey, who can complain about a mic that can record audio in mono? The 2nd issue is a common problem with cheap mics, and is something that I've experienced with a few different ones. The volume is too low in my opinion, and if you're listening to music at the same time, you may

It takes a while to set it up for the first time. The screen is just way too small to make out the data. It took me several tries before I got the signal. I was very disappointed with the unit. It was not worth the $40 bucks, not worth a bad experience from the company.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ***************************** ********************  I purchased this keyboard for a business. The company I purchased this from was really great and went above and beyond to deliver the product in a timely manner. However, the company also happens to be the biggest scam in the keyboard industry. I ordered the keyboard on 11/14/17 and was contacted by the company that day and told the order was on its way. Well, on 11th 11/17 the keyboard arrived with no shipping labels, no manuals, no warranty card or tracking number and no tracking information. When I went to the warehouse, they had not received anything at all from the company and I had to pay to ship the keyboard to them. My company also gave me no tracking or warranty information. I've tried to reach out to the company as well as the keyboard but have only gotten a response from the CEO and the company was in the middle of bankruptcy, so I guess that was the end of the conversation. If you do decide to buy this keyboard make sure to try to reach them as well and make sure they have all the information they need. I really hope this keyboard and its company is able to get back up and running because I'm sure this company was great and I'm going to order another one from them.  Style of Keyboard: *********** ********  A little hard to read when the caps are upside down and the function keys don't work, I would recommend getting the normal keyboard, I've used the normal one for years and it's still the same.  a little hard on my keyboard, it took a few days for the keys to come off

It took me about an hour and 20 minutes to set it up but I was not sure how to do it. I was able to figure it out in about half an hour. , I purchased this for my daughter to get a cell phone that will go to school with her. She is only about 5.5 inches tall and I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to find an easy to use device that would fit her but this one fits her perfectly. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is a little hard to get the antenna up out of the way if you have a smaller cell phone. The antenna is hard to reach but once you have it in position it works just fine. The one thing I didn,t like about this product is that you must use a USB power supply which is a pain since the cell phone uses USB to charge it. The unit comes with an extension cable but if you need another one I recommend that you buy it on the web. I just wish it came with one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    1) I wish there were more buttons for things like mute and repeat.  2) I didn't like that the buttons on the remote were hard to get at, and the buttons for switching channels are easy to misclick or misread.   I don't regret my purchase, but I will keep an eye on how this works with the new iPhone app (I am using the iPhone 7 plus with the 5X, 5C, 5, 4, 2, and 1) that is coming out in the fall.   the only thing about the 5x and 5c that disappointed me was that the 5c's rear buttons were so far away from the microphone. I think I can hear it from the front mic more often than I can the rear buttons.   of course, I can just use my earbuds, but if you have those with you and want to have a dedicated earphone button (for whatever you might be using them for) then the rear button is fine.  for the price I would definitely recommend the 5s, but with the 4" screen and the bigger battery life you can get a bigger screen for a lower price. I will be sticking with my 5s and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a bigger phone.

This is a total scam!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been looking for a great portable bluetooth speaker for a while now. I found this one at my local walmart.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: --------------- 1/2 I think this phone is fine, I've just received it as a gift and it's been working out perfectly. I have had no problems with it, and it connects to my car with ease. It is extremely lightweight and looks really good too. If you don't need to pay for a new one, then get this. I don't think you could go wrong with this phone. I would recommend this to any one who wants a good looking smartphone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a very bad product. Very high power but only one of the three connectors has enough power. It's a good deal but you'd have to wait until it's sold out before you get it.  It's not my best purchase ever!  Overall: Quality: Price: Computergonomics: Performance: Ease of Use: Value:  great product, but don't charge it at the wall.  and then you have to take the battery out and reinsert it to get power.  on the other hand, this is a great product at a great price! ,  Good product, bad charging method.  are you a tech or a mechanic?  I have never been so angry at a charger before and my new "battery charger" sucks. This charger is great for power tools but has one major flaw, it does not charge my electric drill and it is not a plug in model. So now I have to find a different battery charger.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It takes me 4 days to set it up.   This is a big disappointment as I use this a lot to listen to music.  I have the best audio systems.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I don't even know how to explain how poorly constructed this product is. The screen is not even mounted flush against the screen and does not even come close to being flush on the sides, bottom, or back of the device. The entire screen is basically just pushed out of the plastic housing and is not flush with the metal. That means the screen is just slightly off the surface of the housing. The top of the screen also is pushed out into the front of the unit and the display does not sit flush with either the back of that cover or the surface. The plastic backing that the plastic top and bottom housing is supposed to be mounted against is too flimsy to even hold the plastic screen flush with any kind of flat surface. As far as the rest of the product goes, the back-facing camera does not work and is very much a gimmick. I will never be using the camera because this is my only option for any kind pictures that come on the device or as a replacement for the built-in camera. I am a photographer and this is not an option for that. I know the camera works just fine on a couple of iPhones but it does not offer what you need for a portrait or landscape photography. I ended up spending a little more than I would have on a good portrait or portrait landscape camera and I do not know why they have not made this work.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: iphone - poor battery life  - the battery life is very short - a full charge lasts an hour and a half or less, and it has to be charged every few days. The battery life only gets worse with age.  I tried it for about a month, I used the device once a day and it was not able to charge properly. I had to put it down for two days before I took it out of the battery. If you have used it for more than a month it's very hard to charge it and the battery will go flat.  on the other hand, with my iPhone 5S it has never dead, and I don't even have it in a case like this, so it was always on. I just ordered an iPhone 6s and will not be going back to this model.  the charger is very good, the instructions are nice, but its a lot of work  i wanted to like it but it gets hot in hot weather when charging. it takes forever and takes a lot  What the hell is wrong with you people. The charger is great, all you need is a cable, but you dont even include a charger. It costs a little more, but not a lot. Buy this if you need a charger, but don't buy it to fill a hole in your drawer.  in the end this is all very pointless. I got rid of mine after only a month as I had no intention to use it. Its not that it is unusable, it has issues, and there is no way to fix the issues. . "So many things we could complain about, but why so much hate for this gadget?"   It has the features you want. Like Bluetooth, which means it connects to your phone. Also, it can make phone calls over the Internet from your laptop. That was handy, but the battery drain wasn't worth it. If I was going to buy a laptop, I would buy a notebook, not a phone.   So I just got rid it out in the garbage. I don' like it very much now. I guess that was just the price. I really do appreciate all the features though. If i could give this a zero stars, i would, but i know how much you guys like it and I can't give that a zero as it's still a really good product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   it's a useless piece of junk. i only bought it to use as a car mp3 player, however, it does NOT work well in a car. i thought it would work in a jeep, but that's not the case. its a waste of money, and the video quality is very bad. its made in china, but for the price i pay, it is worthless. don't waste your money.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, April 10, 2017  Bought one to use while traveling as MP3 player  by Jack from Puyallup WA USA  Pros: Cheap, good sound  Cons: It has a terrible audio quality, no stereo, no volume control, has poor build quality  Review: I purchased this MP3 Player and was not happy with the sound quality. My stereo had the worst sound out of any MP3 players I have used. The sound was way too low, it sounded like the audio was coming from the speakers. It had a weak volume control that would not let you change the volume. I would not recommend this to anyone.  the only good thing about this MP 3 Player is it can play MP3 music, but this MP would sound better if it was connected to a portable stereo and not connected to the car battery. I did not use this MP player for long, but it is really just a cheap mp player for the car.  a better alternative would be a Kenwood TS-HD100.  and by the way, they charge you for this mp and have you pay shipping, so no savings there  Great MP3 MP3 and phone MP3 Players  By Mark from CA USA  that is what i needed to listen to some of my music in the car,  This is a great mp3 mp3 and mp3 phone player, it's good quality, it can store up to 100 songs, it has a great sound and the sound comes out of the speakers in the back very well,  it does have a couple of problems, one is that it does not have a stereo so you have to use a radio with a speaker that is powered by the car's radio, I would say that the speakers do not hold a good sound, it also does not control the volume as well as i would like, it would be great if this device came with a volume control on the device itself. the second

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I really hope there are other models like this one. This one is a total failure. Not only is the charger a bad design, the connector cable is the worst I've ever seen. It's too short and doesn't fit into the slot at all. The cord is also too thin. I'm not sure if the two are connected, because it would fit a 1 foot long cord, but the connector connector doesn't match the size of the plug. Also the plug has no threads. The device works and the display is beautiful, but I really wish I had just spent $150 on a USB charger.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Bought this to replace my old analog audio system. I use it at home and while traveling. There are several things I'm not happy about but the main problem is the speed of the volume. There is a huge speed difference between the onboard USB port and the USB port of the phone. For example, on an iPhone 7 the onboard is great while traveling and is always ready to go, but on a Galaxy S7 the onboard's not ready to use, I have to plug in the phone everytime I want to use it, I can only use it with my laptop.   I'm really glad the company still makes it. But it was very hard to figure out how to get the volume to work properly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My last purchase was a new iPhone 6 plus (not a 6s). I didn't know how to set the screen up, so I figured I could use this to show me how to use it. I did, and was a little surprised when the phone didn't do what I wanted it to. I'd already replaced a couple of iPhones (I did a little research) with this. The first thing that happened was that it wouldn't recognize my new iPhone 4S and I had to reset it by getting out my old phone. It wouldn't even recognize the new phone's SIM card. I was able to set my old iPhone back to work after a quick call to the tech support person at Best Buy (sorry the store's name doesn't really work but I couldn't remember it.)   I tried calling a different store, but they told me that all of their new phones work. I asked them what could be the problem and they said that they just don't know why it doesn't work with the old iPhone's SIM. I guess I'm going to have to buy another phone just to get it working.   The worst part about this phone is the lack of support. I've had the phone 2 weeks now and every time I try to do something that's been described in this "How to" this phone says, "Couldn't find your system version number." I had no problems with the phone before, but now I feel like I'm stuck with the same phone for a couple more years.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was so excited about my new ipad 2 and my two month old ipad 3. I've never used the ipad before, the ipads seem to be better than the apple brand ipad which are both terrible, so i thought i would give them a try. Well i was so wrong! The ipad doesn't work and has not worked since day one, so now i've had to send it back. I was really excited when i received my ipad but it doesn't fit in the small bag it came in. And the case is not as good as the one i bought before. I bought the apple case and it's not as comfortable to hold because it's wider but it is better because you can actually put it in the case. I had the ipod 3 and it fits in my small backpack. I am so disappointed with the ipos and i would NEVER buy another ipad.  Rated 5 out of 5 by bd from Great Value, great product! I purchased the 2gb memory model for my ipod3. This has been a great purchase!  Customer Testimonials

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------ I bought the T9000 in 2010 and have had nothing but trouble with it. This time it even sent a picture to me. The screen is horrible and is only good for text and email. I don't care if it says it is "Ultra Thin", "Extremely Thin" or "Full HD" or whatever, it is sooo thin. I got this so I could watch a movie on my computer but it is nothing to watch a regular movie on. I tried to connect it to a HDMI to see what I could do but it didn't even show me the picture. I had to get another one to watch it. I would not recommend it at all and even though it is advertised as having a USB port, the USB connection is soo bad and you have to plug it in with the USB cable because it does not have a USB input. Also you have an HDMI cable to plug in the monitor to, but it has to be an older HDMI, not the newer HDMI, and this one is $80 and does not work!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit I am using for audio and video recording has a terrible interface. It has a speaker with the "sound" turned off, so it sounds like a jackhammer. It works ok when the "speaker" is on, but it is absolutely not convenient for anything. I can't listen to audio on the unit in a public place because it won't record anything. The interface makes it hard to turn on the recorder when you are in your bedroom because the power button is right next to the "record" button. It's also not the same size as the rest of the units and has a bigger footprint. This makes it a nightmare to use it and can be very difficult to store it properly. I just wish this company would make more compact units like this one. Other than the interface, which is horrible, the recorder works fine. I've also used it to capture audio from my car to my desktop computer and to record some of my dog's training sessions for her agility class. Very happy with this product.

If you need a cheap computer to replace an older one that may or may not run the latest OS (which i do), then buy an old one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is one of the most frustrating items I have ever purchased. I was able to get the product online a little over a month after purchasing. It came very fast and in great condition. After a week of use I realized that the USB port did not work. I thought I would give this product a try, it was advertised as a portable solution to use with my laptop to access files over USB. It was not what I was looking for and it does not function at all. I'm not sure if I will be returning or trying another one. I tried another brand of portable drive and that one functioned perfectly. I had to call to order this one because I was told they would not be able to take my money until it was working. It is the biggest disappointment I have had in my life to date.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ************************ * I bought this product thinking it was a quality product, but the only reason that it wasn't so is because it has to be plugged into my TV to work. It was never stated that this was for the TV. It also has to make sure that it has the proper voltage. The cable itself is really cheap, which is why I didn't pay full price. The only good thing about it is that you get what you pay for, which for a TV cord is a good thing. The cord is the right length and quality. I have not had any issues with it, but be careful when buying cords for TV's, they can be a little hard to plug in.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive owned 2 of these and they are ok for a basic device but for audio i would not recommend these products. The speakers sound a bit muddy and sound very boomy. The volume is good for my laptop but the sound quality is terrible on my desktop computer, especially if its not using headphones. I can barely hear the tracks i was listening to and have to switch between them to hear what they sound like. My last purchase was the dac5 on amazon and that's the same thing for sound quality. I have to turn down my speakers to hear things i was playing. I got the dap 1 and will probably end up getting the dadc1. I love the sound on my ipod but it has terrible sound quality with this dac. I bought this to use for gaming but it looks like it wont do that with this device. I don't understand how this can be a high end product if it sounds this way.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I own a couple of these, both for my iPad and my iPhone. The one for the iPad is the cheapest and it works great. It's not bad quality at all. I did notice that the buttons on it aren't very responsive, but that might just be my iPad. I would get the one with the longer cord for the iPhone. It is nice and long but it's not very powerful. You can get the cord in my opinion for like 15 bucks on Amazon. I have no clue how that works. It has a little bit of a "ticking" sound, like it's in the wrong place, but it gets the job done.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive been with a yamaha epson printer for about 10 years and it has had a number of major problems: the first one was when the battery died i couldnt print anymore (its like having 2 batteries in one that dont work) ive had to buy a new printer but its still not worth it if the battery is the problem. my other issue is the printer has to be set to print in 24 color only. ive changed the printer from blue to red to print at night and its still broken when its set to the 24 color. ve found an alternative that is much cheaper and works better, if you cant find one this is a good alternative.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tannin from My printer works great! I've had this printer for a little over a month now, and I'm super pleased. The printer is very reliable. I can't fault it in any way. The only issue I've ran into is a dead battery a couple weeks ago. It took a while for them to find it, so I wasn't too concerned. That was two weeks ago though, and it's still working fine. I love it!  Review of DJ037-1640x1440-0908-A: As a very new printer owner I am glad that I have the DJ0373. I've been using a Canon C100 and I just want to get out of the rental business. The Epson printer has a nice resolution, and is quite reliable and does not slow down when you print. The biggest issue I have had so far is that when the ink is dry (this is often not when it is sitting on my desk waiting for the machine to come to life) the print head is so sensitive, that it can tear pages off the page if the print is not straight. The price tag on this printer is low because they do not put a ton of bells and whistles on this model, but the features they do offer are more than worth it. I'm not sure how many features there are, but I know I will find out.  to be clear: this is for the price you pay you can not beat it. It has a lot more features than you would find in a Canon, or even a Nikon. In my opinion the one thing you could improve on the Epson is the price, but you get what you pay for. I am happy with my printer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this thing for months and its awful. its no louder than my other ipod (my wife uses the ipod as well) but the volume control is a joke. when you turn it to high it plays for a second then goes back to low and goes back again. there is no way it can do that so i have to use the remote or a computer to adjust the volume. even if you turn the sound down to low the volume doesnt stop it. so if you dont like this device then dont use it. i just buy my ipod from another company that is twice the price and doesnt have these stupid problems. ive tried all my tricks and it keeps having these problems. ive also tried the warranty and it didnt help because ive never had a problem in the first place.

I bought this to replace my ipod 3.0. this iphono is not able to take a good recording with out audio distortion or the audio cut off. i bought the iphonono 6 and still have the ipods 3.x and this ips 4.2. my ipod 3 still works fine. i have a iphony 3.7 and i don't know how this ipad compares to it but ips 6 will only record on the ips 3. If u buy this for recording please get a ips 2 if u want to be able to connect to your iphones usb ports or a good usb recording device. This ips sucks!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am using this electronic device all day for work and all day at home. I do not like it at all. I can not turn it off because the buttons are hard to press. If you need something for when you are out of town or want to do work or watch TV, this is a great little gadget. But when you want to watch movies or TV shows, you are going to need to get a real television.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:......................................................  I used this for a year and a half and the thing kept failing after 3-4 years. I replaced the battery 3 times and the same thing happens after each change. I called Samsung and they said they would send me a new one, but I can't believe they would do something like that! My warranty is good for 5 years or 36 months. I am now back in the market for a new computer.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   "I purchased the iphone 4s to use for my son's school project. We have had no problems using it. He loves to use it and I use it to record the sound of his voice. He can't use it in any other room because there is a wall between it and the other speaker. I tried to connect it to a tv that has a line out but it would not work. It also took a while to connect because it didn't come with a cable that would go all the way to the tv. The cable that I had purchased works with the ifrom but not with the tv because it doesn't have a jack on the back. The sound quality is not very good and it gets quite warm when you play songs. This is my second iphones. I didn't have any problems with the first one but the new one has not worked so far. I have not gotten it to work with the laptop, but I hope this won't affect my son. Overall, it works just fine and I don't plan to change out the batteries. I am pleased with it and would recommend it to others. "
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ------------------------- I have had the iPod shuffle since it came out 2 years ago and I LOVE it! I have never had an issue until my new one (Nokia Lumia 1020) started acting funny. I didn't understand why my iPod stopped working for no reason (I still have the original). I tried to use the software upgrade again but it just kept throwing errors. Eventually my iPod will die! I really don't have any other device that works as well as my iPod shuffle.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: -------------- In my opinion, this product is a complete waste of money. It's like paying for a car that has an airbag on it and not realizing that it is a safety feature to prevent people from getting seriously injured. The buttons aren't very responsive, and the screen looks great on the television, but it's very difficult to play any kind of games or watch any kind on the TV. I am very disappointed with this product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is not a good product. It is a bad product. I have no idea why they made it and did it like that. It will not hold a charge. It does not work. They have not even addressed the issue. I do not even know what the issue is, I really have no reason to have to pay a ridiculous amount of money to keep up to date with the new versions.  Review of DJI P3:  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, October 19, 2015  Great Drone for the Price  by R.M. from San Diego CA USA  Pros: Easy to fly, Great battery, Fast flight  Cons: Not very durable  Comments: I got the remote control for this drone with the intention of trying it out and also as a "fun" project. The remote controls are easy to use and there is a nice wide range of functions you can use with it. The video is pretty bad in quality (you really have to use your own eye), but is still good enough to record a few nice videos. I had never flown a quad before, but the first flight was really easy, and the camera was easy to set up. After the first day of flying, I noticed the batteries were dying quicker than normal, which is when I decided to purchase the 3S and 5S batteries to avoid the inevitable crash. After that first crash, I had 2 more crashes in the first few weeks of flying. I'm not sure if that's because of the batteries, or just my first drone, but after about 2 months of flying this drone, the battery still dies after a few hours of flight. The camera does a good job of recording some nice video but I wouldn't consider it the best.  in my opinion, the best value for the money in the market right now is the Phantom 4. , but I would give the P3's a lot of points for the extra features they offer, it would be even more of a pleasure flying this device in the wild.  the 2S Li-Po batteries would last for a long time if you never crash.  (I have a flight battery)  I highly recommend the P1/P2/P3 if you just want to have fun flying around in the back yard or around town, just make sure you always have a charger ready and always use a spare battery if you crash. I haven't
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device is an ok piece of plastic, but there is way to much slack in the connectors and you can't just plug in to a PC or laptop. My computer gets a little hot when I use the device, even after I connect to the USB 3.0 port, and when I plug in the back I have to get a micro-usb cable (just in case it blows) and use a cable from the back to the battery to plug the battery in. The device also has no USB power button, no USB charging connector and no USB 2.0 header. The power cord has a little bit of resistance to it, so if you are not careful you will have a bad connection, so the cables I would recommend is to use an older and more stable version of the USB to PC standard (that is also the most common) the power cord for the device does not have a power button. I also use the battery charger, but i have to leave it connected to my computer so that it can use the USB ports. The battery has a great capacity, but I still see way too much power when i connect it to my PC. So in short, the device is a great concept, but the design is way out of place and not very useful. I'm still looking for an item that will last as long as this device, and will have the power I need without using up my computer's power supply.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Tim from Not what I expected The USB type C cable is long but it's really the size of the device itself that makes it a nuisance. The cable can get in the way of other accessories and has an awkward design that doesn't fit with any modern case. The internal power brick is okay but it is far from an improvement over what the power brick included in the previous gen NUC was. The NUC is definitely a good product but at $150 and up I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive had this for about 1 year now and i have used it on both pc and macs and it has been a bummer for one reason or another. The battery is a joke. I bought it with a new 2 year warranty and have noticed the battery drains fast. I have been using the charger almost every day and its not like i have to recharge every few weeks. The phone isnt always dead either. i have tried to get it to last longer but i always get the screen go black. My other problem was with my new iphone 5S. I never got the ipad dock to work correctly. The adapter would work but then the ipod screen would come on when my phone was docked. I tried the same thing with this iphONE and when it was charged it would stay awake when docked and would not turn off until i got the battery out. I've always gotten the battery from apple and have always had good luck with apple products. This is my third apple product and I think im just going to stop using them altogether because theyve proven not to be reliable. i will never buy another apple product again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this to power a DVR and the output from this power supply is not what I expected. The outputs of the power supply were not consistent and I could not make sure that the correct device was being fed into the device. I am now having trouble turning on the tv and the DVR as well. I guess I should have done a bit more research and gone with the cheaper power supply that was not so great.   PROS: The unit is solid. It has an output that is a bit dim but not that bad. I would recommend this unit. CONS: The product has an on/off switch and not a switch for all the devices. Also, the LED is extremely bright. I cannot dim this light.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive used an evga nvidia radeon 480 graphics card for the past year and have nothing but problems with it. the fan doesnt start up to the right speed, and it always shuts down at about the same time. my computer crashes every time i try to use it and i get very low temperatures while it is running. i can run it at 20% power, but the temperatures are always in the 70's. i dont want to purchase a new computer. ive tried everything possible to keep the card running, but its really not worth the money.  this is the worst thing that has happened to my computer to date.  I have used this card for my pc for about 2 years now and it has worked just fine except for the fan. It always ran at 100% no matter what the pc was doing. After a week of no fan on my graphics card, i decided to replace it with a second one. The new card was perfect.  (I had a problem with the 2nd card too. The computer started randomly crashing when i was trying to run a game like Call of Duty and the graphics card would not boot to Windows. I also found out it was a bios problem with my second card. Once I fixed that, I was able to run the game without any problems.) I am so happy with my new graphics card.  a new gaming pc for the ps4. its still under warranty and will not work until i have had it for two weeks now. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ---------------I purchased a new ipod, but the battery life was terrible. It was very difficult to charge. Even when charging was complete it would take several hours before it was ready to go. I also noticed that it would start losing power and it would not charge, even after I let it sit for a few hours. I have not been able to fully charge it because it is so bad. The ipod was great when I was younger and I think I will be selling it. It is still great on the older version of the phone, but I would not recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I really like it and I used to be an IT pro but I have had it for 3 days and can not believe how slow it is. The batteries are cheap and don't last long. I get more than 30 mins of use before it needs to be charged. I have the laptop dock so I can run it at home.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst electronic device I have ever had to purchase. It is very difficult to control. The touch screen is not responsive and the app does not allow you to control the device. I am very upset about this. I really like the device, but I will not be purchasing another product from this company. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to have a fun and easy way to play this year.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ***************************** This is a great little computer! The USB connection works as it should. The LCD displays the time and date at a very good brightness, and it displays the number of files in the current folder. It also shows the size of the current project in megabytes. It's very easy to use and it's nice to see the battery level in a single cell. It looks like it would take up a little bit of space in a pocket or purse. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my dad. He has a   laptop that he's had for over 10 years. He uses this on a daily basis. It is so good, he said,   "I have never had a bad phone."   The only problem   is he said   that his   wife has to turn it on every once in a while.   So if this phone will hold up for years to come I will be a happy camper 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device: ive tried several other brands and this one is the worst. it doesnt work at all. i have a kamagra 2mg and my fingers go numb. i went to the hospital for a scan and the doctor said he was gonna send it to his lab for analysis but i will have to wait a while for that. i cant afford to wait for that, so i went on line and had it replaced with a new one. but when i opened the box the plastic on the outside had fallen off and the battery was covered in grease and soot. it was a total fail. i just want it gone because it is a waste of money. and the doctors wont give me an explanation so i cant get a refund or anything.i had my new battery for about a month and now i am going to have to have it replaced again.
