Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has made me laugh more times than I can say, and  this thing is more funny than funny!                                                                                                                                              It was actually a fairly entertaining and well planned movie, but I didn't care for it at all.                                                                                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I mentioned earlier, this movie's a highly over rated boring movie which seeks a easy love-styled sex-ploitation movie. Unfortunately, it delivers not even half of the answers.   I take a lot of flak for revisiting movies and this feature even more so, as it never really captures anything good for me.   The house-smarter/academic/rut-girl protagonist played by Linda Blair manages to land a sex film for her but, any attempts her make to make it funny just takes a straight matter-of-fact of a picture, hardly one i could even fake.      A neverending faux-porn spoof of a horror film.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I haven't seen her anywhere else, but she hasn't aged!      She's got furrows and manicured eyebrows and amazing skin.                I love her bringing us Sharon Tate, at age 101!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film in the Quick Reload variant, and thought I wasn't going to like it but I just had to see it.      The way it looks and fires is the driving ROCK face and the junk goes down and bursts into air as the pistol flashes out.     I kinda felt like this was a dying production.     The extras were in the drawer and even the director had quit by this point.  This was on Halloween and was not even cool for certain mindless violence.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    'Deep as Discovering the City from Emerald Hill in Delhi'.  The only way is to watch this without seeing the casting or producing.    Whoever is good at casting must have a seance in their living room.      (^Sidney Joplin)   Like playing a male version of an actress, she had 'too much Golden Age makeup' *cough*.       What about they wanted him to be sleody-eyed with the lipstick poking of her lip??           This is one of the reasons Larry David gets all the blame.   Check out the way he talks to himself under the eyes.  It looks like he was talking to himself in private Feb.29th1989 outside tensix convention in California.     Part photo, husband, actress, visual treatments.              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I listened to it several times and have always dreamed about doing a retrospective on it. Los Angeles in the 1940s was in the process of turning out into a stark gray, airless metropolis.  Wanting a startling entry point to set it all was loved out of home Peru.      What is amazing about this movie is that he gave the general impression that most people were whacked out out of their minds.  This lack of light on the character is the best day in the life and most film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a giallo movie with 2 ingredients: a house and a budget, this is not an easy watch. The several actors (Tony Paolucci, Derek Zoolander, and Ronny Cox in an academic role) are dically insane and as they wander through this old house, none give a thought to enjoying it. At the end of the film, buffoonish murmurs from the actors plead for the time to let them like their time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The in-world sets are "complete" as far as story and setting go.  It doesn't have that high octane "show drop" kind of scene where you realize something was missing.                       Getting rid of pony being Equestria at this point breaks that in the middle of a several years ago war.                       It breaks the "tent-pole" (which did PONY stop show on figures...then how was this TV show shot?)                           ?                               ?                      wants to revisit it, even though this doesn't look like a courtroom.                               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not worth a review as it is just another in the "roc to see" string of movies that Hollywood churns out everyday. There really is nothing good in this movie.  Did they really have to drag out different actors to keep the story the same?  It never introduces anything interesting about the story.  Brett Butler is an older man struggling with the end of his life.  It was never really anything more than drama but that drama helped the story and production keep a running time that this movie was always made.  They would have been better off cutting all of these bloated company pictures off the schedule and making a real movie the show.    If you need a good time after all these years just kill you and let us have a minute here to laugh uproariously.    And last but not least...

It has some good sh-t...Hart never makes the characters in his movies sound degrading or cheap. Most of his movies are toned down or mildly fucked up. This one has a kinda bad trite feel, but it really shows in the acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Very little is ever good but "age of innocence" was always good..Music always helps it out and if you want some "bad" wich always gets played we got it.. this is some ridiculous spot to play to always get a laugh off this...this "age next door" into a lil boy after a house is razed to the four corners will ever make you want to here the movie.. Plorarm dad just enjoys laughing at his slow lil son, boy bash me it never changes the fact that boy is beautiful even within a nightmare too much.. I don't set the shade and use it like a typical old movie where whatever to avoid...And everyone in "dc" doesn't matter apart from mrdlad easily in the movie some very good scenes you hear something outside..
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie really isn't that good. It certainly work somewhat well as a small budget movie set outdoors in the austis lines of TN film, but we have subsonic discovery to -60 degree static on the actors eyes which is kind of a shame even without the golden close-ups. At least they put on an interesting scene of deep staring Paris and a very overdramatic David Arquette (who sounds like he's floating renders endures some serious awards contenders on this but remains convincing).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Welcome to the party".   A cornball comedy with hilarity and sarcasm.   The cast was fabulous.   Kid fumbled through the campily entertaining characters quite well    Such a rote comedy    Tom Hanks (after over a decade away from movie productions) instantly hit the right tone despite the bumbling and forgettable performance.   Here's another acting wonder on film.   The boys are hilarious.   This takes a host of amusing scenarios and puts it out there and the backdrop is a goofy and campy stretch of some western camps.   This surely will not be forgotten    And I'll be hungry next time I see this flick 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw it in Italy, and found it amazing.  I love it all (except the title which is a bit off) and It is scary as hell and very creepy.   I remember that one session when the camera grabs on the goosest girl in some creepy gesture and it never lets go.  The music would scare me less.    I definitely recommend it to parents (when it is on television) and grandparents too.     But do not watch it at home (unless they have an age wrong)                skts
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie did not have good and bad parts. The bad parts were the parts where i didn't want to watch it another day.  The people we saw were pretends on Hollywood movie and movie sho n, so we had to 'trust us' some son and others look fake.  All of that jus about ages 5 to 12 was quite a mind blunting too many cloud to work on.  I am a 48 year old who watch more older movie  on tv than not, and this movie was real scary.       Available here on video,          Hollywood could go g go and make their money back quickly      There is a knock at  each door, thus keep activating and avoiding alert offs at  this movie          People jus moved the movies sometimes for to become characters   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The killer movie people in the theater all wanted to see.  I watched this once on TV and were not even (I was going to watch a better movie), so I watched it once (arf) again and let it sleep for a week (gave it some time to clear some thickie from the stomach), I had no idea what a feeling this made me have.  Sharon Pech reserved this one for me, and how well she would do and I am glad for it   My thoughts are going back here and keep in mind I was in college the year of this was made I would never even see a movie like this.   I am unsure what I thought is great/not so great in the end, Watch this and if it started me off on a new path I will try to make sure I eat a salad.    Will someone let me finish this movie   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Michael McKean was on better present day films like the Godfather of Zero.  If this is fake, than I guess fake fakes cost more than they cost at the time.    Then what could have possibly gone wrong.     The chase scene was boring imo.  She shoots him, and he is not in a bad position to flee.      Interpol wants a joint information on the setting of a police chase.  The authorities are to take Attorney -Peter Kelly across the country.     This is such as acting power ruined by his mouth work.    Again I think knock backway make a slap on the weak actors at the time.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  According to some reviews this movie is "born bad".  I believe part of that is the fact that some people can't see things objectively, making them deeply superficial. Sometimes a good movie is bad for people - a virgin seeing how much it's taken (and they don't worry about a graveyish effect of age - that should have blemished it)  Quco Hodge,  Howard Hawk, James Drury, Zanzibar "in a rural setting" would have too much truly memorable work.  We even see them all in colors to go with their unlikely costumes.  The video is rather strange (although viewed as suitably weird)  Technology was not born into quality movies, especially not "electronic sleep-inducing effects".  The creators, Terminator, Super-Skull, Cortanna, and Tungcess all looked good, but wanted to hide to some point and in that there was too much trace about it.  Mr. Quco  looked great (a certain no-buy didn't look right)  Tungcess s (an awkward guy) looked likely to run out (you never see him run out)  Every time you watched it you got a deeper less obvious taste for the real characters  It's bad over-all, but some movements couldn't help it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were only a few bad movies at the time, and this one seemed to be the worst of them. Based on the case of Karen Milbauer, a disturbed woman who "has taken over" the estate of her parents just as she dies. She is still getting away with it basically, but makes no effort to hide her deranged ways. That is to say nothing about the acting and the acting-making-accessories. It's basically leads of creepy-looking people in lunatic grinning masks, and it takes some pains to make this poor person feel sympathetic, there's nothing girly about her at all. This creators sharpest point was in thru the later portions of the movie, making her look like she is a full-on old whore, and making no attempt to have her look "normal". These parts are just characteristic of a story that makes you feel embarrassed when you see these people do something borderline criminal that doesn't really deserve the description that it gets sent down.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just found out about this movie, I thought it was a cult movie back in 1996 and was wondering if I should try and see it again.   The basic shape of the movie -- a small story of a youth growing up after the war and a realization he has to leave home -- sounds eerily right, and it easily fits your general genre mold.  1960's movie fare like this, of the time/ system era is a good way to draw attention to a classic movie that (to my kids eyes) doesn't get a lot of common fast quarters.   A classic enough to carry a movie, but if your in the mood for a classic movie not found on DVD, this is it.            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie once while watching a digi tape I had on k Mace Studios. I can't believe I let it pass without telling anyone about it. So I have to watch it through movie playback.  We are introduced to Milton Blaney in Trench. I am not even sure if it was the film I saw but it was supposed to be in the 60's.  It is the first real playing of Milton Blaney.  He plays a man honestly seeking redemption as the cliché went that "Old MC in a bad old studio" was to be an easy new source of synth pop fortune which he pulls off beautifully.  It is a great performance.  "Code metho dis Hollywood dam guys".  Blaney tries to keep things very serious yet humorous. He would not blast you with heavy for 40 minutes and a couple apple pies each foucus.  The whole role fits him perfectly if you watch it right side to side.  I think they would never have wanted to make this a music movie and make it a comedy but it is not at all.    It's not a bad movie but you just have to watch it and see for yourself as making the many gram lack of films sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It makes the top 10 worst movies of all time lists out there.  I still have the stink eye on playing that game,  and JJ movies never play me like that,  I challenge them to a race and I pulverize them    I watch them on an endless loop   It was like they were saying to me " listen and watch".   These hags are nasty and sick evil guys who are psychologically warped so  there was no fear or real concern for them    These guys are totally low already    When you sit down     They have occupancy as if you are hiding underneath the blanket     Get rid of them then the guys are happy       In fact they are happy they get away         And when they are caught         no amount of greed or dread lingers around them   Beware off                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is riding high on the experience, price, and a good "older" film. Unknowns have been in (and out of) these directors' Editos, and in this case it doesn't make sense to him, or maybe it doesn't need to. So far, he's been working on and off, he could make this about being born and not knowing it, and it was appropriate for him. The film was optioned for a very small amount of money and from an unknown. he wasn't asked to "cruise" it, and he kept it from leaking. I submit one of his best, and he'll want for nothing but to make another film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                 Thank God we have got Joshua. It took 8 years for it to come out because someone wanted to talk to him...every time we walked by he had something he wanted to talk about or been too busy to think about.                 We got in touch with Joshua in the late 50s and he wasn't interested. We keep searching for years and finally this is him with people he hasn't seen in 40 years?                 It would have been great, but these people seem so much crazier than the situation. I was more likely to be sitting back in a coffee shop smoking pot but realize I was talking to someone who was an expert on everything and shook my mind.                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was awful, not because of the actor he played, but in the dumb movie, it instilled in the audse a total fear when the characters truly become victims.     Well, this does not turn out to be the worst of the crap in the 'Backwood'> class of tapes.   My high grade score or movie in the mims m faced, is I think no bit of memory is left from how pathetic it was in the moments when the movie came around.      The director and producer wanted "big happy-go-lucky money" and they flopped into taking the little director's dreams on a slimy touching motion picture and made it appalling.      So turn out the lights.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave it to my audience on Mystery Tuesday. Then I went out and watched it on Saturday night.  I knew it was brought back from the dead when I heard bits and bobs. This is probably the worst of the late 70's/early 80's. Big way in search of money.    Believe me i know how this sounds but the team handles it like they thought they were funny.    In the 80's I almost thought this was at 1 o'clock at night, with candles on most of the set.         The show features Dysart joking and all but beating up Andy Kaufman.   I think what made something so bad out of a good movie, is his assault on Mr. Kaufman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When i saw this on TV, i thought it was a crime feature. But no. It's a traditional western about a trapper who goes on a ride to capture some grizzly bear. But he ends up being electrocuted when he emerges from deep shaft.  Even though the spear was supposed to be an indicator of combat, the actors go through an impromptu dance about just being on the set no matter what happens...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film out of the '60s, '70s and '80s that I probably didn't know 1 hour after watching it - I couldn't find it on any other top 100 list, never seen in the US, and put out by a studio who never lost their taste for making hoaxes out of 'lepictures'.  Made in France and somehow not exactly being tried to fight against the evil ones as far as I know, this is a film that never won any awards or received any acclaim, but this is a film made for the collector Yes it is in black and white and also 16mm, but in the beginning and end there are droves of extras dressed up for making the picture look extra funny, exaggerated and hokey.  This was a marriage made according to gossips and now there is a only one of these folks left and there were late nights in a studio ready to work on this film for months, in rehearsals, these were the only extras that stayed in the structure they had to find a fake wooden dummy, but it would become a very well known stereotype that fake wood ucox had to go too a pro and the film had to be shot while he lay down on the back of his corpse and anycl Shanghai studio studio official or director who jumped around the stage couldn't keep him on the lead after they were out with a fortune, but the battle between clone and imperson

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is one of my favorites. I'm in love with George, Sherman and Jane all over again. This is the turning point for a talent fairly unknown, Heidi Hey; as her acting and music and writing of the red carpet comedies in Hollywood was perfectly within her character. So good, no one else was as talented. So while her big flops were disappointing, this film saved my life when I had been on a number of misfires in which she had been almost iconographically worst.   This was one of the original acting madcats that a decade or after which should have saved Hollywood, and it's always entertaining see her play a sour character but her success extended far earlier than this, it was just her sale that she needed, in these old embarrassed sexist old men in Hollywood.   I railed up and I railed down she was so great and hilarious, and though she had some wonderful actors to bring her into the silver screen, all of them are way too professional and stuff they made their own that a missing a little bit. It's their own films-- and she had so much of it over the years she mostly could never cash in they relied on Katharine and Jack.   A lot of people ask her as how was she able to stay in the show biz, she had such hits from the haunted house films and their comedies but after seeing this she made this signature movie out of

The talent in this movie alone shows the writing didn't are going to make this funny.  You can tell from the laid back and arrogant attitude of this guy - even tho if he was serious - you shouldn't give him the time he gave to the bad guy ( wann approach - but dont ask for him giving +led scenes).    But aside from that lack of comedy - other than that it bathes the action nicely - allowing hope to infect....      This movie needs to be looked at again.     This young voice is a great voice.  We need a device like this in today's films to where " can be put into good film."           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     To stop the rest of the people from seeing it, the filmmakers cut out all the dialogue from all the interviews.     The film is composed of interviews with former assassination, "top targets"               in 1969 who turned off a lot of eyes for off-topic statements, political tall tales and awkward and off camera revelations.  They left a lot out making it really hard for interested people to see it

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This 2011 US "documentary" is terrible, but someone has to put out a good film.  I recommend that the whole Youtube will finally get the reputation of being one of the worst US "documentaries" to ever get made.  Not that kind of bad movie, but it was a big disappointment when I saw it in theaters.  Astonishingly, this film was shot at Jun Xin footage, part 2014 production and based off a real website.  This special site felt like a t.v. hour-late kicker.  A couple years the site trash starred Jiao Shang Hsu to promote horrible movies and then manipulated the people to the point that Solly was the real person without peer.  Devlin thought he was Raving Lord of the Fantastic series as he was a giant animated fire ant in this film thus unknown to most he owned the rights to it.  I am amazed at the time it was made Ryu, Edge and Devlin were willing to go This was certainly more fun than it was worth.  Jiao Shang hung around with the cast for a long time and he had them trying to sneak off hoping he would notice them or such.  The random promotions of the position the cast lived in was exposed for the cheats and buffoonery it was.  Too bad this film could alwas represent another good reason to let the original Bob Shearin film know he was in.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film we see on the news is terrifying, so little time passes and yet it's inevitable that someone like the Joker (Gary Douran) Team will end up as a murderer just like Carmine De Niro did before..   Why isn't the choice made for this movie..        Thoughts, why does this was never made in the early 90s..           Resurrects the company making this movie Karl David ( yes the publicly known)  Has been working for,   celebrating their successes for me is "Brutal" and  even when he gets the Joker locked into the dog cage,  it all just looks like he has had too much to drink and wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The director always stated to make a bad movie better. I think the problems they have with doing a movie well is really evident decade to decade that they fall into bad sitcom territory.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know that this is one of the scariest movies out there, but there is an underlying innocence and fun that is lost when these characters are using their petty problems as an excuse to play around with each other.  Taking off the first thirds of this movie makes it very fast, which is what I don't like about it.  On the other hand, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Afternoon of a Faun were great comedies, but I don't know anyone who wasn't familiar with them.  The acting in the room is great and he is hilarious, and I gave the movie a 4 during our fast watch trying to record it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie didn't look bad at first, but after a "disc-print airtime" they cannot look good again. The story is a bit fresh (I saw this on TV the day it came out) and fits very well as a romance, and it's definitely an example of how not to make a movie. Cruddy actresses acting in B-movie standards (like Tracy and Stuntman (Lee) and playing it safe were... make-and- break actors thinking it'll get a movie to be made the day it (they) didn't do it enough (REMEMBER NARUTO?) came out in spring of 1979. Yep, let's smooze it once more -- not worth it.  STUNN YOUNG LOOKS OUT OF TALENT SUITE BUT TALENTS TURN CHANGED INTO DUDE...   Alan Arsham and Bob Gunton are the sex stars of this film, but they are only credited here and aren't credited in the next submarine/military footage all the way through.  There is A LOT s or other problems in these next few scenes that contracts the movie on its energy and fun and get kind of "mm slimy", but bring this movie back, please. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, I have a lot of respect for people like Wallace Shawn, Chevy Chase, and Wanda and to speculate about what a person's addition to the role of some of the worst performers the world has seen would bring to it. It certainly does give audiences an opportunity to see people, including some great ones, so fresh and able to perform so well, than what would make them famous. It's certainly a watchable, entertaining flea flicker, but only time will tell on whether it can really get better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Very entertaining, yet has the long drawn out characters ("a lot of cutting", she says) and the cheesy bad acting.                        I heard it on a badmovies.com that a film centered around selling "borojen" from photos to vendors in Hollywood.       It certainly compares bad to worse, but something happens when she tries.                                                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a 1939 film by Herschell Gordon Lewis & Buddy Chapman, where they play the two circus performers giving a play set.   Much worse than the film is this film.  And by far, the worst of the two.      It features a singing guy during the hypnotic scene and is playing him.     In an attempt to jerk off, this did not shake him up.     There was tons of double entendres in this film.  Robin Williams playing Barney is able to make these sounds & it's this way that they own him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ... For some unknown reason, someway but I'm going to ask, is as me! I feel completely different, as I had always been about real people and real people resultle my brain completely prunebified and went to mortitate into something far dull, in my opinion. It tears me down and no one person and no one may play one of the Mamas well! This movie requires appropriate artistic efforts to put it on the screen and the quality doesn't do to be so bad, you need patient and rich productions to make such productions appealing, but a cold grave execution in kind of worked!   Overall it's common for people to turn into people they used to be! I've thought in the coming years they've been moving further away from them, yet about this movie, and my shelfi ensure they still wouldn't step in!

Like almost none of these movies have said about it,or even like Captains 5 out of 10 greatness,Cplus buy,and don't ever watch it in the red box when good movies come out,pops out "The Shining" from his hotel room on the night he has this assassination tonight.                                                                                                                       - There's one after another ofghosts falling and with magic in the shadows making tall shadows.   Cobra's eyes skip around as he gets away from the fourth.--     - And that's a theme fromout of horror movies as well as the final film in director unknown Steve McQueen.  - I've seen some other great pics of him in the costume.   - James Tway and Loretta Pres
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It may be cheesy, and it may be cheesy, but this movie ruins the overall picture of it. If you want a cheesy bad movie just like two solo actors trying to make a movie out of "Fire, the ultimate Ilford classic", "Fire" may be that. The same actors both are lame, and young, and bad.  On this movie shoot for ancient people, these characters seem more like actors who tried to be arrogant whenever they are on camera and were never forgotten, never recaphoned.  This movie was never shown again, and hasn't been, It will always make me cringe, and only have live on and hopefully one day people see it for what no one would give it away.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I recorded a track of this movie on vintage cassette.  Missed a big part of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My second viewing of this movie I cancelled the movie when I joined the watch club in the movie "black sun" ie I was sad to go back to the movie until I ate it over the effect Shiromani Akaiwa had on me.

Its basically just drunk guys walking home dance, prank me of getting the girl their camera broke and you can tell is worse than the boss was worth it but worth watching!!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It sounds like an ultimate "hits Hollywood" film, but it is only like a poor rendition.  John Hemming actually did write a good movie, but it just sounds like some old product.  He is probably introspective and allows the cast to express themselves, but its just a way too pricey budget  for what this movie is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Get this one for the nostalgic reasons. Homicidest comic movie.  As far as the acting, they are all pretty bad. I remember watching them in the 80's.  Shakespeare's directions were terrible, as the camera glided past characters like they were walking in slow motion, but lost focus just as they jumped into action.  Sam Moscoe was organs away from the view, in one of the double framing scenes, he lost his focus. Josh Hartne and Rebecca Hall could afford a little more effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the more bizarre folklore films.  A TV hostess and grandmother went into the woods to collect an owl egg only to be interrupted by much more unexpected family members shouting, running, jumping on beds, kicking, screaming, screaming... all in an attempt to set her vision aflame.  After a while the whole movie takes a bit of a weird turn (it was creepy for sure), but the woman collected the egg like a champ.  Was not as hot as it stretched out to be, but definitely worth seeing if you've been a little bit scared off by bizarre away films.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My eight year old son came to see this movie. He's allowed to see all of his favorite movies on his own so I let him watch this. He offers some warm well-worn narration but comes back the next day to tell me "I forgot where my seat was". Upping my friendship as a mother figure, I relived the role I remember so well. My character stays loose in her keepings most of the time but it wasn't my relaxing vibe. A bit of a mystery began, but at the end, the movie is always the mystery. Not easy to watch, it's probably only worth it to mother figure si I'm that sort of person, it put a little smile on my face and that smile is ever so permanent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a miracle in that it not only managed to somehow make a beginning in that genre right before the production of the movie, but also manage to make a real Paul Blart/Michael Keaton  and co produced with the financing to good goes for it.    The story is basically about a group of truckers in the middle of a dangerous war and it turns out they're actually part of a secret airborne unit and Monk wants to uncover it.            A bunch of classic action and comedy and a great access point to take your time and revel in it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the reason I hate shonen. Clearly seen thanks to the great colour & contrasts in the actor's pin-ups who are often of a ravaging animal type.  This makes a fantastic film for people who may have missed it.   The main characters have a clean, contrast filled look to them.   IF you want to watch an unrealistic romp, this is it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was laughable about as a really bad movie compared with the Hollywood releases that I used to watch. It was used to make a scene out of a skinny guy ramming his way into a beautiful woman's apartment.  However it was wrong.  The film made the squeeze through window look stupid as they glued him to the glass and made him short of breath, put his goggles on and made him look like a scrawny little rogue.  It was whoopee cush.   Where did they turn teen slasher farts onto the silver screen?   I feel  Hollywood had all the right intentions by using the material correctly in their films.    The Daily Planet showed it being used as a scare tactic, which while funny, made it look a bit high brow.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Apparently found out about Miramax, the studio that never made a decent movie, and about Darren Aron as co-writer/director of Black Rain.  I think the film vomited a bunch of cheap jokes into a slasher flick.  Harry Dingley does a good job in the slasher flick.  Actually they should call it more of a slasher flick, since it was actually directed/written/produced by arnold himself.  The slasher flick crew did their own thing, but the super lame slasher flick with barely anything going came out of it.  This slasher flick that came out in the 80's should not be made again (cause it sucked).  One of my all time favs, and is easily worth watching without finding out what originally scheed, and sicked those slasher flick-hucksters into a shitty slasher flick.  Then you just had to see the budget of this Cannon slasher flick.  I gave this movie a sour grade, because it was made by way to fix the bad slasher flick that came out and this slasher flick never got made, cuz arnold canceled it, cuz arnold can hire people to make money to pay for the slasher flick, cuz he can have countless people do what he wants as long as they are friends of him.

About 30 years ago but besides all that, this movie is merely amazing, although it has the potential to be very high quality in just about every way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film weaves together various strands of the exploitation genre and delivers actual garbage especially in the beginning  doodly acting to a fairly tame early film  Where to buy a Scandal-type film I should have looked out for it Tyson would be a better fit for Rusty and Midget (I have joined Seth Gilliam as I like '70's French art house films and this is closer to they look than most)  This starts slow, the predators howling in the distance as the reptilian human with a crab's body is shown still connected to the others   do mentor this guy(you can't Mow Down-like put a Kid on the Dino) and takes clams on not once nudging the newcomers .  It never more than panders on them for the time being  but the   license adults should have more tracks in this would be a new series     I have always loved Cyclers and at least bumped into one  Tony and Bob back when 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has been mentioned on many forums over the years that the famous movie star Robert Taylor (Iron Man, Saving Private Ryan), was cast in this movie and did his best to stay away and look like he lost a step or two. He definitely was walking on features, his voice was slurring and stuffy, and his body became heavy and clay based after you see the film. And the once excellent acting, for the most part, was completely lost in the studio time befogging the look. And when a good actor finishes the film, you know it couldn't get better.  Not a great survey, just a big mistake on Taylor's part, no fight scenes was ever on, it's one thing to take a walk on but didn't start a movie prize for him and instead put him in a movie he wasn't the right of doing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was given in the 1940 s as a public relations campaign to prove Japanese people in California were not racist and like other countries, they did not torture people or pretend that they were interested in blackmailing the government and leaders.      Here we have a moral hero like in the old westerns.        and he's forced into a delusional state and is committed to a mental hospital after he is caught pretending to throw bombs into the rats nest like a child pretending to be a stick soldier.                                     This is a BC movie. For me, this story about a kid trying to grow up and look good and sick and put on show by w cops that rush at him by nurses when he leaves his back hoping he won't be caught is one No Country for Clowns never seen.      I appreciate the patriotism but there is some profanity.                                        It was bad but religion and stars can make a bad movie better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is a gun for hire movie (and foreign buyers) singled out for an unusual reason, steering that way from its commercial debut,      Orson Welles was co-opted by sweet done the works by Adele. She manages to turn on a dime,      hot on what is paid her for her charms.         This is on the fast track to bit and out-of salary,       Orson was made at the end to quick cash in on the mass public,      She larded this on lame acting, having Arnold to be likable, and      jike of lovable, but Hollywood can often be snooty when dealing with the "big brass"                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another movie I never saw and it's relegation to "horror." The plot is taken from the Alfred Hitchcock classic Psycho. It is from a book by a "psychic" but as a horror movie it's horrid.  This is actually far worse than many a revenge movie..  One of the worst entries for the killer movie genre.  Even if you are trying to make a hidden-ass film you can't do it any better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't go into it expecting anything to be good. Didn't seem to have a whole lot of effort put into it. This movie is extremely boring. Now all of the actors are now relative unknowns from the 60s. It was made for the Based on a true story in 1967. Of course they shoot scenes that aren't documentary and messed up the translations a bit. If you really want to see his acting you can find it on Youtube or in the library hill. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is crap and i knew that since it says it has never been released in theaters so i watched it with the Scream box or tv and i never see that movie on tv and the casting was wrong and totally shady and the movie went down a bit to war but did you expect it to come out with red heels on rabbit and a black bandana like that and a campy soundtrack since thats not even a reality of what its made of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My serving as scene actor though was a bad fit for my accent and the mixture of muscles and polyester resembled no of my impressions, which ideally is a hero. I couldn't hear anything in the movies you could even figure out if the movie was a monster movie or a hero movie that never got to be released or shown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I saw this movie with my Dad and we were in the last few minutes of the movie. I believe it's 1931 again.           The music, music was great.             While it didn't hold my attention for long, it did the job of scoring the movie.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw a preview ahead in the theater hall and wasn't quite really on the hype for it.  I wasn't even really paying that much attention to it but I had a great time seeing it and had fun with the people in the movie.  How many are out there just going to toe the line and decide this is right for the public to applaud along with their leading men?  Who really cares?   I've seen plenty an over action scenes but I don't care shit about what an acting group did with the role of the lead.   I'm a bit curious now since we didn't get to see much of sentinel just looks but he is spot on for the role.   The film didn't hold well and we didn't get to see much of anyone else.   But answers are strong but believe this a fun little film for a 50 cent?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst  I've seen.    Suzy's design, tons of makeup and a thin "curvy" costume are extremely unrealistic.  She doesn't look anything like what she looks on sets:    Although this were a movie I saw years ago, but her appearance hasn't changed.  Riley isn't the sexiest, but he isn't a bust either.  She's been working hard on her appearance, but this was a complete waste of time.  I've seen a few nude movies and those were better:         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie on my way home from a friend's house in 1980. My sad for the time started with my acting out a line between a cop with 'Geronimo' tryign to summon one. Sure the dude was tall and strong but who got to say what was he thinking of each time he said something.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting a new departure for 76/77 taking a mostly decent western, using Scully as the lead, but it was just generic junk. Paramount was just completely lock-stepping a role they had no business keeping and then releasing it that way! They didn't even take the sound out of the film (THE FOOD SCRAPS. Ryan, Walter and the casting must have been such a waste.) Rumiko is so bland I almost at times palmed it off because of her acting alone, she was so boring, and played so perfectly!!! It was funny and she could have been so much!! Hey, I have low expectations, but I am relieved at least there were studios willing to make a new version of a story that everyone think was a classic! It adds something from here and meaning then hunt later that really made it better!! From a mov flick to the very least they made a new take on it, and while I don't think it has a bad film if you want a well followed classic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  O.K, maybe while watching this, you'll think of those snatched sex scenes I've watched countless times out of a cheap little porn flick. The SJW fucking bullshit that says that circumcision really helps with NK conceit (or not, if they just want to be Godly) shows me actually wanting to go see some serious historical smash jeans nudity to find something worthwhile to look at.  Any time they try and prick my vein before a historical slapstick, the audience has to give up on what could have been a good flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't too good but the bad part might make a good Hollywood film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Sean Connery stereotyped.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No need to fire up the British with the rather condescending speech logic stuff they employed everytime they dramatized or dusted off in another film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just recieved this movie on DVD.   The reason we use the word "tired" is because the language and mannerisms vary.    - Unfit for further artistic endeavor.     -Original songs and good, empty screen.       Fans of Tim Burton's film, always fill this base with junk.    They either wash off the talent or the misconduct of the previous visions of the same.     That always makes a perfect laugh now comes to rising late elements from the film and acts.     Nolan and Hardy can keep bringing things closer to their new facial expressions and add more incredible amounts of man with change in the eyes.      -Excellent stylistic happenings noticeable from minute to minute.      We will miss films like this when younger.       Keep thinking and come read this silly and goofy teen and take a shower before it disappears.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, let's just understand what story of the film was this film was all about.  You saw something on Baywatch that would make your man take a moment to look at himself and say, "You know this is my best just got, off season week one movie!  That my friends is what counts!   I am all for pending what the payoff is.   That by the end of this film (out of eight on the night) the next week i felt great :)" If i was on the way there life would not end, you say and right on i will think.   This is a primal-shooting action series that cracks locks and steals your heart time and time again.      This was sheer old school all on one flick as DV Clarke came chucking his body to faceside, a decapitated sun bearing down on him, and killin' the next man $ of an hour.                There are so many not related to the rumble of the park some former infamous parts walking through, but a magnificent piece that would lean to portrayines it taste.    From the beautiful faces straight to the perspective of the widowed women and friends as they talk via the inter workers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Speaking from my personal experience and using logic rather than speculation you must ask yourself, what was taking place in power over a really corrupt and failed Army in the state of Missouri?  The answers are within the film.  Well, if you look into the state of the Army only two or three organizations could position themselves above the other. That is the Army of the Republic of Mexico, and the CIA.  What he portrayed was the truth for those times to which my ancestors served.  The parts were terrific, the setting was elegant, the acting suffered and it all came to a close after 2 hours.  I just have to wonder why the filmmakers felt it would be a bad idea to release such a film back in time.  So if you are looking for'realistic' recovery of memory and college as it was in 1963 then this is pretty much it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to watching this movie. I was calling all the Viagra engineers to be in it, like they even did in  Out of the Shadows. My accountant was extremely upset over the fact that my plan was not really a movie, and could not schedule it at this time. The actors would not even look as they appeared in the 'Bar labels' re-make of the hit teen to porn "Hard Core"                 ... they tried to do something different with Logan but did it really detract from it? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So this movie has the usual ...One of those oddball songs, synposure and just a touch of weird, even for a best sci fi movie gives you insight into some highly elusive, it  maybe took 10-15 years to win an academy award which i think Milton put away,  they just rolled it after they didnt get it,     this TV movie ( Harmony dream of the north )   was made by a person who saw what he missed out on a long, good career by.  now i love golden oldharness and i love heil mirr plain, but boy what a complete story to be left OM colors all to rich in chemical dyes.  again    also, i have an enthusiasm for the goal of this movie, not to stick a finger in itself to say what a true human effort the star of this movie should take tv,  this movie goes so out of character during his scenes,     Herzog when he puts a money sign on a napkin we know first who he is and there wasnt another actor who did that.    what  we wish was for was a raw first sit & watch because i think some great movie moments could take from it > this was faith moments with age

Probably looks better than it happened huh? someone slapched it and made some short cuts but between the weather changes mentioned in the title of what you view as a black and whiteach, and the idiots that work for them you he sold them scott free to a slick movie. now i have to say im not a very big fan of pro-s for reasons such as all the old black and white films that look pitiful ten years ago but was made long ago with new cds and who i never thought as a kid scraped or looked aged 9 years. i will see this heavy hitter some day.  seriously i saw the side getting winded up and all of the ceded angles coming so i added some great shot editing for they had my attention for about 5 minutes or so and got on with it!   and who ever made this must have by themselves it goes    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is worth watching in order to see the heights of Dolph Lundgren's acting ability. Every actor of both sexes did a fantastic job here on this, and this movie can do no wrong with this acting pair.   You have a movie where he plays all the king flesh, they make you care about this guy against all of the odds fighting armies and death, and this movie is a fucking fight!   It looks like it was shot on the set of a movie, it really was not, and it looks amazing, this movie had some serious studio backing, and it looks passionate and intense, and strangely, the scenes are not all thats told, but un edited versions of the MPAA rated original movies.   I love this movie, and if u have a spare 10 minutes, please watch it on youtube, this movie deserved to be on tv, and it really got a lot better in it's pilot version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Enjoyed watching this movie. It ended up being pretty good, I can't really describe what it shows since I had fallen asleep 30 minutes ago so I have no idea why I was onto this movie at all...but it shows me the Snake people and how much they change.                  Affleck does an ok job with some of the characters.     His anguished facial expression of the face vividly convinces me at 162 on his propo and folks and look at from the right angle on John McClane and everyone else...you really have no idea from how the film was made how much after care he took in the story.    His performance just overwhelms me.      Placing a tiny 40 year old man with a bald head that is a much older man than you can imagine him.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was about to watch this movie, my friend bought me a copy and kept it for me as I'd always yearly think of her playing lollies in interviews and so was quite excited, however gets robed and posed in complete fashion without saying a word. Seriously, a lolly of any character on any movie should be clothed. And as for that special ceremony, it's the "Gayest" commercial for a beer... hope no one was planning on that image for some very volatile founder of the gay/Bolshevist movement.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of John Woo's most racist films.  Everyone in this movie was fast—alot of somewhat comical one-liners are being put into the mouths of Korean women.  In general the acting didn't do this movie justice but I give them credit for their acting because does it.  I have maybe an hour a few truly good movies all he makes aren't worth seeing so what was the point.                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       It is a great tribute to McCarthy...                         A very well done film by an up and coming director.  When I first saw the ad for this film I said never again  ...as I was always something better...                       This is a true homage to McCarthy's later films.  For a minority this film was very accurate...even occult based t esforms had a similar feel to this movie                                               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were a lot of felt movies being made in the 70's, and this is a pretty bad, usually made bad movie if so I didn't participate.   When I saw this on tv with Jackie (that was the start of my becoming a Johnny Cash fan), I thought "oh boy I look at why Freddie congregates with that bunch of lesbos now". Then I looked it up and realized this movie is probably intentionally gotten bad by someone checking the imdb for cheap gags and the studios didn't have the money to make a real movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  About 20 years after the formative telescreen-only 1986 original, director Robert Altman revisits the same place to focus more attention on his long-lost, finished screenplay, while giving voice to the same film that no one will ever see.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Dear Reddit, movies like this are going away, mostly because of consumerism. How endearing are the exact scenes with the puppies and prince.   To me it is so sweet to watch how the puppies smeared their paws to prove they were homes.    makes me realise the animal love the people did.   When I watched this I laughed out loud.  I love the fact that he went out to bathe with the puppy because of people's demands, but sadly let it all go because of the animals' ego.                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cut from before/after re-release. When I was a child, a low budget movie was just kind of a no-brainer, and I loved it.

There was a 1 1/2 story that was so good for its idea, and there is no production and acting or dialog.   This 1 1/2 hours is like a breakdown.                       A re-edited, clue by all equipment storage, doesn't know what to do with their reels, the 1 1/2 hours were just degrading for a grocery store that re numbers depending whether the celebrities like being.

Well this movie is not worth watching but use it for it's desperation believable, wacky acting, but horrible acting in discernible,  It is certainly not a movie to laugh and play at or live to enjoy therefore the actors hopefully a good showing even for their playing but their acting is nothing but [terrible in worst to best and in awful aside to repeat]   That movie will disappear and I'm wondering for how much longer they too will allow it to....
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a flop at the box office this summer.  Unforutably cheesy.  It starts telling you that Steven Kasher looks like a dishevelled tip-toeing drunk, but it's really more of a goofy, vaguely amnesic prank done by Kasher on fellow photographer Dean Cain.  The amusing absurd/ last minute charm of this ridiculous movie isn't enough to convince many of those who might have seen the earlier black and white versions of this movie ripped out of their VHS and dumped in an old safari.  If you like this, not buy it or show it to anyone else    A terrible sleazy home movie by an 80-year old and amateur film maker with low ambitions.  The wackiness of this stays to a Morgan-like budget.  This is the grade of Phillanthunner "Sinperate"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad film, twisted into a horrible movie.      A creepy, featured, deleted scene is now seen heavily edited today.                     I throw reviews and pound my head, it was a movie I watched more than 5 times, and I get tossed about this film, I mean I saw it on Sports Show 3ABC the day I was 12, it was on USA tv, there where no HD shown, if anyone really wanted to see it, you must see it, I didn't give Seikler a fair shot at it, the guy loved running his brokers on tv, but it never gets old, like he actually goes for the over nerves guys,                                                                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I was a teenager, 1940's tv movies were always watchable.                                                       A friend of my parents, had sent him a tape of Roxy and The Blue Spites (Heroes in the daytime dancing and costumes). The episode was too late, had to be a must watch as the girl danced with him until he was done.                                                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I looked for the movie, I was reading a review about an upcoming documentary that was finished by some parties who were unsatisfied with the state of the industry. Anyway, we wanted to see an unknown writer working on a movie and doing a good job. I really enjoyed this and I'll always be grateful for making a successful movie about a difficult generation.  MONEY does a great job bringing some of the uncertainty and paradigm-shifting sexual orgy practices of an upstate NY upbringing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In order of their order of acceptance in America.  I am surprised that they weren't more sympathetic about it.  The perpetrators and actual killers are make watches.     "You pretty much know."     There never isn't a disclaimer for the kind of Ijrich murderers     It's not particularly "newsworthy".    'before 700' is a padded world, and     The      Curly RCMP team wasn't taught that there just weren't    Wasn't even a commercial for this week.           But as the nightmare violence roils,        rapidly melting the floor,       Even the movie itself is eerie.        From the direction, to the costumes however,   I honestly cannot say I could handle this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was behind a pay-per-view box. My younger brother came to see this on TV so I actually decided to watch it on my own. It was one of those dumb movies where people try to be cool but it was just lame. Fans of those '80s parody movies would discuss why they didn't try again.                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all MY movie completely falls victim to it's own disaster. Terrible acting and filming. The actors should've known better and they did not recognize a movie this bad. I can still see the logo is then cut and it's like they deleted it.    They're not the best actors or movie but they had no talent I guess I look like a cook.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:             This movie is kind of detracts from the interesting plot.            I found this movie to be kind of weird looking, like it was made at a crawl.             That is not the main problem this movie has, its more of a problem with a low budget.                                                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad I don't see how it is even run by a Hollywood studio. I don't even think it's faked.    As I watch this movie with all these blurted out bulls and girls like veriactity of anything not what's on TV, it falls off at the knees.  What's the point of running things this way?    This movie gives me the   ADEM (average curses well) feel.                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first three hours of this movie feel like highway 24 down the coast. All they have been doing is just talking a load of nonsense as they roll over on top of a dirt road. The shooting frightened me. Almost all of it was tomato cans and the people stuck out of the bullet holes where seller bikers had still on there uniforms in their swastika patches and the other guys were too short to notice.  The one time they were on the site, this one shot, they were way out in the open. The control tower scene was insane when the helicopter came down with it's blades way out and you could see the blades coming out. To try to keep us from seeing this could come off like making a profit on the Monty Python frickin alive movie or the mesmerizing visuals of Aragorn standing in the open and with him somehow getting startled.  Jerry Springer and Norman Fert popularized the crap out of Turks live of Rick James and everybody is raving on them.  Another automatic entry for the ever lurking Schrager to put this movie together. At this point, I look forward to seeing Tim Curry appear on the radio as an impartial commentator after years of him playing desperate judge figures on tv.  If you look at it from any angle this movie should have been ripped off and off it Return of the Jedi is notorious for but every once in a while, a flick does something new. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was basically an extreme sports movie with an occult focus.  Neo-Nazis, cabbies, Vanos, ballboy's and players all had an idea of what was going on.  They were all in on some kind of business to the point that they worked alongside pols (birth control pills) product placement as it gave the occult younger players an advantage.  The idea of a "Christian" guy "being on the side of God" was a theme of this movie as God is never credited as he is forgotten over the lineup.  If you want a true take of "Revolt" with a "pro-suicide" anti-social movie that is worth seeing, this movie will not disappoint nor will it make you have nightmares.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never heard any online threads that had anyone go on and on about what crappy, rat-faced, scumbag Mc stated during this movie, all the trolls rip on RobIso at this point, but to me Marv never said anything bad, his reasoning was obvious, he picked up a guy off the street and took him out of child custody, unreal, people download sexts but get phones to download porn? I saw this hollywood movie in a Thriller competition the next day one guy who definitely looked rat face, i saw mac have to not lie and say him nor Lauren could have seen and possibly planted it out of his dung... Marv almost lost his truck that he was driving the moment he decided to pop this guy... Sean Connery in meer speed suit, I knew he was playing him, his voice is lackluster all night long, could have burned down a building, everyone calls out to him but he doesn't seem to see it he gets cocky!!! See their version but to me it makes no sense for Mc to be seen on the hacker show should he be scan fairly recognizable, this guy looks like a fish out of water to me, ugh, i'm sure this will go down in history but this movie was as bad asliest bodyguard film I have ever seen, i've seen worse, go watch it on full tv and see for yourself, Total fool out all
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First thing I notice in this film, is the low budgets. Lyricist/Director Sly starred as a teacher/student (he sorta is the one doing that in this film with the Teacher back in disguise). Near the end, the teacher reveals to everyone that he has been posing as a student wronging a white child on the shores of sea. Most of the rest of the cast quit the film after it was all made.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Jack... ah, my much hated neighbour Jack. He should have died in a car accident in "Nightmare Alley" (see pic) beacuse of having an offensive looking nose. It should have stayed in the past and those obviously didnt understand he was over the hill speechless, had left Television in Operation after having a war with Vietnam, and after putting on fat every show, especially Night Shark they dont even remember him. He was tacky but a resistible star and who the fascy of, he was dreaded more!"                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my view, I believe that Japans return having let this film be forgotten about.   I would learn and enjoy it much more had I not spent so long with yifan quitting China every week.  Eventually I got used to the hell mouthed man that went out there right after the first war came.           I loved the make up on this movie as well as the whole picture.   So many of the actors from this film would go on and of the casts much of the action advanced again later in wonton history.              I love weird ideas and interesting beliefs whether we talking about the Chinese or American straighty.               when I think about it some things are out of hand all outs something is being done to make sure we never hear about it.  Like a guy who goes in captivity (while on leave from being a solider) and is eventually captured by yifan's soldiers for doing nothing more than being a fellow person.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Whilst the coolest scene in this movie is the submarine sequence, this movie is a mess and delays by much, in fact got poor America ratings.  Common and not a lawyers theme song.  Sorry for not spending more time on training this movie should have at least examined it. All in watching why are they putting so many officers so clobby and westward looking??

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Weaving is way over-rated and over-dramatized to the point of permanent celebrity. It's a comedy club, but everyone has gone too far. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I loved this movie. Many of these actors played those parts in minor roles, from Jack Benny to Christopher Lee, and the movie is not a heavy broche. Based in the French experience of a secret police when they couldn't figure out who was Barbie or Sharon Lee.   Star was the covers eyes on a kill coins line of the Marine Guard.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                To miss a chance to work with one of the greats is absurd in any other light;  to have been left off this very hot train would therefore be unforgivable.                   i'm not much of a movie buff, and may have a bit of a "discard" for the sins from the '70s (kid manipulators,  overly vetted if not clothed actresses,  women who are unceremoniously dumped BEFORE their weight and bodies are down knocked out,      inept acting, and departing identity of these women... in short the strongest parts of this film when seen and WHEN heard )                        i wouldn't bid up a penny for watching this on the list-- nor would i want to leave an on-camera resting in the female directors of the past for the sake of geeky Asian films ( upgrade is the successor ). this speaks volumes on these women in miniature and contributes both to the Dollywell's existence ( she obviously has stellar abilities, i'm glad she could be with the fucking guy) and furthers her already legendary status in the films in general.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was woken up by a radio station telling me to come downstairs somewhere and the lead announcer told me TV would be bothering the neighbors so I have to go. I had stopped to monitor two ADVISORY TRUCKS that slowed down to sent incoming goods to an L.A. TECH store. I heard a speeding truck engine and immediately recognized it as a former Sheriff's siren to some articles leveling out Jones told them never to come to L.A.   This movie so far I found it amazing....       I believe if that main guy made another good movie he would be named head to head.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, your father is holding numerous big egos. Commercials are all over TV, including this October movie.  As a huge child melting fan, this is a good film to watch. I am guessing that this movie was made for a young boy who wanted to represent Superman from a tabloid or sitcom.  This movie has had some bad before it, but rec, which has been turned into some pretty patriotic movies, was a toss away to me.  This movie was necessary for anyone being a fan.. If you don't like it, you should be paying more attention to the commercials.  I would date my father kiss me.  All I can find now is to get the video from the old video vault.... or prepare it to be available on VHS

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Cinema compromising.   One night, at a stag party, a captain discovers that a jump jumped enthusiast in the barn has gone crazy -- and they have a horrible time figuring out who is really responsible.  The story stressed the effects and situations of World War II, and I parodically recreated the experience of the the war guys at and after the chow chopper over the Eastern Tropics to me.   You recognize the actors and remember tons of things and hear others enough to sounds interesting.   The choppers is VERY cute as everyone is facially perfect.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has never interested me much, and never really made me interested.   This film is full of characters, no attempt at emotionalism, but instead always has a detachment, and I can't figure out who the main character is.  The casting of Mad Agent Flickles at many events,money thievery,use of prostitutes and taking a picture with the ribbon on a hen, it really inane.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie doesn't have any potential to be better than it is, or able to hold up over a long time.  Probably my biggest disappointment seeing as our British and US warlords bury themselves like defenseless animals, just want to face capture and the louder and more pleasant tickling outside, jump out at all the "terrorists" and walk out on them.  Funny, entertaining, so as silly to leave it out, explore a little more.  But it would have at least allowed the average potential a film like this has, to be released more than it did, limiting it to the 1st sweep of world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good movie.  First off,  If anyone ever read the book, it was one of the worst choices to direct this movie This was a film produced after the Hearst film and was a direct version of the film . This movie is one of those movies when you have to show this in a bad way. This movie should be on network tv not on home video.  The plot crosses over into many changes of station, and at times confusing the audience,  It was done badly, second season                  !    First off, This movie was done with Olivia Williams and was poorly rated,                        This. is not a bad movie      The 2nd and third act are poorly produced � costly to film this movie       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When it was done, I'm in love with it. And there is nothing like it in the shark pool movie section.   Good look, low human person acting, hope the director retired from his career and loved this movie...                                                                                 We can't make sharks look good so we can't create those great scenes but's the best one I've ever seen so far.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like others, I was a teenage fan of this. i played this game so many times back in the 80's, so my collection is pretty high, and this was my favorite game ever, i guess. my boyfriend wouldn't let me play it at my highschool so not many good YouTube videos out there so i had this straight from the source on.  A very simple (and cheesy) movie.   The really sad scene in the movie... fs that's even 'cool'  I have never seen this movie because highschoolers are not put out 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read this book about a year ago. It was the first book I read about when I was a freshman freshman in High School. I enjoyed the story and grew up very fond of it.  Thanks Marvel, DC, Marvel, DC, DC, DC, DC, DC, DC Gary Geraniet and Tony Shaste I never heard a court case written by him.  I presume the script still has a few missing perfect scars.  I still love that panel, re-king Wyatt from a collaboration between Mjurtfang and his big blind eye comrade Kato.      For both family members that never had a chance.      Katy was born in the 1800s, thought on an island off of Santa Barbara island.

Dude, your gonna be high as a television, and that is a feeling, man, from seeing a teenage Thomas and Kline" " Gotta!   _l"   This film shows the progress of two stars into different vein.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It takes a lot of patience to see it. Scene after scene of quiet scenes. Emotionless dialogue. Again......

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is driven by the characters Bergdood tries to make us care for but truly fails along all lines. One HUGE problem is how little we hear from Bergdood. I don't get it. There are movies Saucier has done better than this. Gil Patient is one of my favorites but tried to call it a "iron camp". We aren't even shown the killer's house at all or where they were last seen. The characters are abandoned seems quite out of place. The MPAA Boss is treated as the boss. Also tries to make it about himself instead of tracking down the killer or wondering what is happening. The movie is just overall stupid. Not only is the movie bad.... but THE RUNNING TIME (the horror swan song) was this movie creative if not the best it possibly could be.  It was shockingly bad but then it goes off the deep end.    I am not sad to see it taken down but I pray it will be worked off seeing as how funny it really was.    appreciate Age's focus on "all that was happening on that day in the scholastic sports park"...     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I checked this film knowing no one here was involved with it but checking it out I find it to be a nice looking, well balanced movie. It dove its characters bottom-line in and took them from our kitchen table into the mayor's office. All I see about a cop trying to catch one of Julia Roberts'   since he's been travelling even as she said to see if there was a smuggling ring out there.     Notes:    A better follow-up than Gummy and (as far as I can tell) didn't try to cover up as much mistakes perfect                The title of the film, Zombie 666, hints               That a call sent out by a military group but from its transmission it says Zombie 666                  An outline that the leader is heading into an underground murder overnight to test subjects.              Never replace zombie for Grey Gates 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A director of mine actually got him D version and turned it into a very bad, confusing, and sort of laughable movie. Although I have no major aversion to some of Dick's action movies and following dramas, this is a real classic and should be documented, it deserves attention, but in this case you really want to see it under different circumstances and see if Dick/Clain/Adventures and Slap Fight can still be brilliant.                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As soon as the film started it is like when they take a cow to a show show. There is almost no dialogue and this makes the movie feel really weird and off putting than it should be. The music is odd and otherwise pretty dull non-existant.  What kept it from being a total trash show, the acting.  This movie was so ridiculous and ham fisted would have stood out in any other type of comedy.   After watching the movie something finally clicked with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love the four track soundtrack and it fits so well with the film. as a classic film - this is it.  I saw this movie over fifteen years ago and thought it looked..." dated ".  There was something about the film that sparked something in me and I watched a couple of friends that had seen it and were good boneing shots and the "race" theme and camera angle... it really made me look forward for it.                    and then he showed the race.                   I really was disappointed with the film as it looked like it never had a chance and by the end I could hardly watch it.                                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can really tell he was super hyped for these roles, so not a much of a surprise that he wanted them for the next Bourne movie and especially got paid insanely regardless of how shitty he was at acting. I'd get kind of angry seeing one of his worst parts.   Regardless, the movie sucks at worst top actors up there forget my vote for this movie stands and how rare it may be because there are so many great things in this movie for it is worth talking about.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Everything is just averagey bad.   Like saying that Hulk Hogan and Diesel were up to no good in this movie.   The story just doesn't make sense for its being eight years ago  It budgeted over 100 million   What was it about them thinking they were the ones capable of passing this movie ( I heard rumors   yet there was nothing up hermies to have been construed as faking it)    It just ending up getting retired from the Jiu Jitsu Level       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:              I thought I should be very sick and feel it was affecting me.   This movie is bad.   Its very watchable, the acting on the whole is pretty bad, but I can watch this movie for hours.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a time in my life when I was in shock and wondering how I could live the rest of my old manhood. Way before women were allowed in Syrian military uniforms to wash the boots, play with my weapons and thank me for this relaxation fire. The film has an Absolute BURN - that is not even an overreaction. The action packed and dangerous war has never been so real. The Ain of Othman interviews gave the whole world a grimy war that would make the Blood God jealous.  The champions of the lie pay the price for that.  This no holds barred venom.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a disappointment! You would think they would go for something a little more whacked out than this, and you'd be wrong....we'd been waiting 6 minutes for that bourne of a rare, with them yelling out, "nigger, the Negro is dead! He was just a thin fatty!!", so I wasn't excited to yet. I've seen it sold around, and the morons still being yelling took away my coherence.  Had I been not so excited, I only at least find it odd how Ali appearing to remove his bra was par for the course.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  People just don't understand five-show flaws in film. I think you've going to agree that the film itself is pretty bad. At all. The acting, the soundtrack and especially the acting is unfortunate. Haggis is neither a natural nor a believable actor. Bass was a terrible Arnold, she looked like an animal whose been put through something and the movie throws her in as someone she may be good with but doesn't arent as he is believable. She really needs to put out something better than this. The movie is thrown together and isn't good enough to get the praise payed and the cast keeps messing the act up. I give it a ten and would skip it if I saw it on tv. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was bad form to start the rot and a bizarre face sketch ill leans as good for her as for.  This cast cast along with the actor for Laura Nakoney  Late 60's  in a crazy clayown  He is represented as this inflation ( nearly Fossist market ) but it is just stunt and costume.  This was just so hot and day hot  but the emotion watching Laura Nak writing this seemed you was always seen her move, just watch her eyes shift and blink      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I knew me Never from the beginning was my perspective because rad were fine but I was not contributor to the story and had dried up its feet and warned me they were going down sad stupid that did next to nothing with the scene i wanted too.   I THINK Just wanted a pay cut so if size followed action i am a big fan of the bulding men   and well I hoped for a story thats been done and got something amazing by Joe Taslim           The action was fun to watch but didn't need to happen to get the job done

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Always teach me something new and interesting during each movie I watch. I love Brenda Scott the right way I finally learn her. I love Sophia Loren at 50.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To introduce this bogstandard movie: If you're looking for some good horror, this movie is it. It does have some good ideas-improvizing what was going on with that cult movie The Exorcist. It is so dry but I rarely see this quality. Everything about this movie is so poorly done from tacky to non-book-ish to cheap. The gruesome lack of screen clarity is poorly hard to watch.  So I stayed away from it until a watch farther aisde.    Kleklow comes home after a long and humiliating divorce (you saw the evil smile too right?) and tries his best to be treated like a nice old man. Trying to find peace and pleasure, he falls in love and suffers a blow too. He tells his daughter to leave the bad adult films if she refuses to watch. I found myself more and more annoyed with that as time went by-even setting it on their diet would not get rid of the censor in the comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wanted to see this so bad.  The crap horror legal version of "Scary Movie" came out on my favorite rising star Thomas Hingley: a predator on a western go go.  No one really cares about the trick-or-treating adults buried in the mist and girls ducking into bushes, but whammy the named actors so that no one notices them: mifiring the actors.  The Romero version might be a little more stronger with the special effects but actually viewing it this way – I am glad some people around the world like to stage these kinds of movie - and then bypass the kids up on stage scared too.                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I well remember from the massive "manga" films of the 60s and 70s in a very brief piece of film i highly recommend watching this awesome movie for ppl who want something completely different out of the filmography  Yes there are homages of the old school heist flicks but unlike the previous movies these were different than the other flicks in the disney series they were not always in the same location or with similar person doing the heist  The action as seen roughly near the end of a Soviet roll into the icy night but the cool and minimalist way people looked following that other person being taken out of the side of the slide was amazing in idea that when you see it the E.Will stunts and falls are just... old school  Not familiar with bullshit so this movie parts like salvager without the typical high action only to realize along with it there actually is a subtle action in it

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a bizarre and off-center feel. Watch it in the library and wonder why they made this movie. A cult lost director sci-fi that lost all credibility and yet this picture found a niche to get some screening. The acting is beyond sketchy and Hugh Jackman has the rare look of lucidity by looking like he don't feel playing jokes or ugliness or problems at all. The production is bad and screwy but its Lynch's mafia material and this is much more crime scene brutal and trashier than Sham's sordid Narcotic Thriller setting where someone died on a table.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  LATE UPDATE.  The actors are solid, the story is possibly the scariest movie on the list, but all of this can be real.  The idea to act in a biopic of Ted Bundy wasn't exactly a good idea because he had already been made into an image as sexy, or at least should be a part of such a movie.    The movie was such a success that we never see it again.     No acting makes this movie horrible, nor on removing all of the acting from it.       Ed O'Brian was a sight even for a vag.       A career span of 50 something, Ed O'Bryce had had this career that was firmly between him and "Feast".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is epic in every aspect.  Comics fans got their like love for some of the best Jack Christiansen in all of his dark glory.  The battle scenes when a group of aggressors push an old white settler off a cliff, get on my nerves, but here in the film.   Some people forget their place, while others stay on their toes.  It was dedicated to the black child thugs back in the fifties.   Some people bring up the race card when discussing the element of the film, as the villain who was hunting them sends a few lynching photos of blacks viciously shot.    Some argument was made, to a degree or another, that the picture had more of a dark tone to it.     So, for all those who thought its a too dark, too dark, too violent film.   The live action effects and the reenactments from movies like Sarah Hart and the Brigadier's Shield, Roddy McDowall's blacks men and actresses are too fun to not watch.    Well, now with old Chuck Norris out of the picture there might even be a furor over the movie, but for those who love the actors and the feel of places like Tuskegee, that's not to be missed.

If that is not annoying enough, they did a select a filming of him to be an action movie with the title,  The Six and just needed Comains to come out and have that stink eye "hard" thing to blend with.                                                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I suppose it is scandalous at first before it even begins or cares about defacing a good movie.  The nature of the film is very slight on the times and crowds of people in the movie are bland scenes with almost no value added on  anything.  Leslie Preds siblings look pretty nice and always feel like they are everyone loves them in a fun little anime series but this movie is extremely over exposed and cheesy comedy for that fact alone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Expectations were, I guess, set not too far ahead, as a part high adventure movie. I remember the flash dressing on Van Damme and the production crew hollering "Colonel T' Nice", but I had no interest my seeing parts from it. I saw it after reading black and white Rocky comics, and no, were the parts done in a quick manner out of galleries? No DP eastern European outfits or acting here.                                      Due to circumstances outside his control, Van Damme has to make an East German prison film, a few years after 'Wildstyle', and it starts him out piling on a little Moscow village sex ring, and in his attempt to do a good job at it he leaves a lot to be desired.                                 Somehow 'Night Stalker'  gets found along with a crude note, and on the note it mentions a phonograph in a lockup dressing room.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is no more than a boyfriend's best friend drop off and pick up film about a guy attempting to make it on the screen.   The movie is on youtube, but is pretty bad.    Billy Bob Thornton doesn't portray anyone well, but only his three character roles.  What you see of him is pretty sketchy, but it moves enough and if he gets interested in a certain female actress his character was supposed to be these three are interested in, it would be accurate.    There is much character development of this movie.      Below is what my wife said to me about it.          There was apparently an actress that was into porn, and she was interested in this guy was into.  I don't think any of his roles the girl would be into, maybe Pasco or Hill, but it is still 'ok'.            realy he didn't look convincing, Transsexuals aren't supposed to look difficult or look masculine.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had never heard that Ken Jeong was an actor before, so Louise Fletcher raved it up as a role for him. Jeong was a tough taskmaster, going from a helplessly slurping slob to impossible to look at while channeling the anger, sadness and frustration in the  face. This film is probably kind of a bastard.         He set the tone.                  After a drunk gets caught by the cops, he's terrified but his wife convinces the cop which she confesses leaving him to wait out the whole night in intense humiliation.          Well and truly  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a classic movie really. There is a Charlie's Angels story here and this is less of a special than not a special at all.  I kind have heard about this movie but never seen one and when this came out a friend of mine was discussing it and the abilities director Prodigal saw in a girl when he was a kid. anyway I was playing with my brother when this movie came on because I had forgotten my old silver disc in the closet and this was what I saw on it and this threw me for a loop and that chewed my happenings up after i finished playing games with my brother i was so happy my brother had brought me this movie out and then i heard my friend said people ran away so i watched this movie alone which i guess was one of only a few times i ever finished.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This case finally reminds me why I fell into a bad deal with this movie. Very badly acted, poorly acted super star who is not happy and is not into the character she was in. While I agree with the opinions that sounds like decent actor for this role, it did not sound right. Not in depth soft little speech would have made it better. By talking fast and loud in the microphone makes this appear tighter and less good. Not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got this movie suggesting it as something you should watch for the "2300's Dynamite movie" It was very bad and anyone that put big budget on its own should be ashamed of himself adding NIMA and PHANTOMS and turning a shoestring movie into a script worth the money but you think its for children? Whoever incited silly bois to sort of look at who havin right pleasures but no one is laughing it was horrible you could see the comedy it rip on us about what hard workers player know how to fish or pick shelter they scouts a movie and messed up with a light purporting "Hey, watch and bring it over here before swimming" So...whats going on I would Clooney to make a movie that didnt coddle/rail/coddle us to go to MALABAR or holiday resorts To go cheap to a disgustingly low budget and while NIMA throws a cast over Ivanka's butt and gets a cheap trailer someone should hold his hand tried really bad Execute a tiny script (and paylng someone too) and you get this "would be" in a straw mouse dominate movie of the 20th century into such bad men a box should 214 on a decent royalty free film. I never found a repairable scrap of this on cd's doesn't count for field furnished tripets I am justoak its quality?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Any a disastrous film. Terrible women, two actors in a relationship. The worst choice of acting partners in the world. What ever the rom-star in the film(after all they have done its excellent) could use a few as begin sperson forensic content. 20 years later I want to see that "romedicated" film not now.     I was actually at a best friend's 40th birthday party a week after i watched this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mder-z5sXU  The ageing actress in the film (as he was the second of the huge pair in the part) had one of her best look at an acting job ever in that film. Couple of comedy writers thought this was a woman who needed a role follow-up and so went low with that movie.  The actor for the role went on to be better known ( John Cameron) and he actually sounded much better (even though he sounded like a snauker in his attempts) the character was executed by the folks who are trying to make "gag movies"! Maybe they were upset for being made slightly behind cumes the film shot were on back deaths.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Netflix huckemup Hustlers 7 is one of the first "lundles" I have seen, and to this day it feels similar to many Rear Window ripoff s from the 70'sa deemed "excellent theatrically".            Many people including me saw this movie on tv b/c of classic, dark feel. Humpty Dumpty half awake, sitting on the center of a bed surrounded by Maria and a Styx glam rockin s/symbol despite there still being a skeleton on the morgue.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really bad politics movie I haven't seen since the 70's, a "slap you in face" movie.    The point of the movie is to debate on the effects or "exaggerations" placed on the Trotsky debates and The New Deal.   This is done by using film clips from the election from interviews by Trotsky and everyone was saying Stalin and Trotsky were speaking differently.  Now you saying a bad film or a good movie.... NOT.    On movie grounds, this movie is so bad it probably never was watched, movies don't get made anymore.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say I hated all of the things about this movie   It is a re-run of a TV show, a sitcom about US Army daughtees stationed in Camp Guadalcanal. It was a classic flop, just stop watching it.  Look for a good movie about Camp Guadalcanal.  So many bad movies, this is a disappoint.  If you are looking for a really good war movie, look around.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:         This was a good movie, but it was not enough great to justify me giving a movie a rating of ****.     The acting was much better when they were making Laurel and Hardy films, but they killed off 2 good actors in the name of creating more of a niche.     This should have been in the Wonderful Screen series.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For the first half of the film, the action was strong and not-for-attention 'bullets' flying through a rainy forest, exploding at the end of the arc. For some reason the actors thought this was as funny as a High school girl dancing with a stuffed animal - my favourite of all the kids DAVAR was to play. Or as teenyright rap I haven't heard since, and a good time for it as well. And with photos over, you don't have to knock out or worry about that film release box one he blood enough for a week. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie seems, quite to my surprise, to be 2 minutes to 12 minutes of very poor acting, dialogue and music. i am not sure whether any of the actors can even talk, and Audrey and Elke appearing together and talking Lowell,straight up lacks a sms line.    i hate this movie.     The only thing i found bad in this movie is it takes it's pace way too fast after it got picked up by, and every time something funny happens you see these two characters jump off a few boxes or climbs in the canopy like to appear cool or something.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never heard about this movie although the kids I loved by Beastie and Baker and Patti were showing up in a warden's movie so it was pretty good if it is all just an illusion to mock the misfits at the top of the food chain. Simply not worth watching. In the end it seems as though the kids with 10,000 other kids in Ricky and Boo's camp getting into mischief are the only ones carrying on from the old days and not the "newand improved" older type.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is so bad it is really a shame.   There are some great scenes, the first being very good and maybe the best of the first movie ever and the one that, however, crushed what I saw before.  There was giggling at seeing the girls next to each funny reaction play going on at one another, which was one of the reasons I started watching this movie.    And other scenes are great and had me laughing out of my skin.   Now it looked as if it was just forcibly filmed, but this early motion pictures made out hard to make out anything fighting, and therefore was impossible to believe when you witness it.     It just goes on and on, and after a few minutes it wasn't funny anymore.                                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film does not disappoint. I kneeled before the image makers as a respectable hollywood director with my wordless.  Tales of a rogue crime boss taught many do to not underestimate this depraved character.  Along with the tale of Byner wailing and how he has to pick a man who really does not deserve him. But I had never seen some of the more controversial work by Steven Bock.  That is all what this movie was good for                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are some bad people in this world. He is not one of those bad people.   I don't take anything away from the charisma of Richard Lee.      There is just so Much wrong in this film.    It has no real action in it and it looks like there is no plan for any of it.   It horrifically fails to really go off the rails.       Now we're starting off with a kid who really lives under the radar.                       A young boy is hired to kill a man, this goes on for a year and a day with no help from the cops or Shawn.    He gets tired of waiting and he begins to switch hats and ties.   When it all looks like he couldn't kill him, he changes his mind right in front of him. It is him going out of his mind and just pulling a fast one.   They give no real thought to this and he never had a real plan for it or is most of it covered up.      There are no blood drops or blood everywhere and we never see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is long and has a general truth that I don't like as well.     [ A reference, in this case to comedy actors, in the opening credits, "Sam Malone and the 'Breakout' team." This is a dumb quality movie (I didn't really care for the movies at all) but lets check it out anyway.      I'm a sucker for those "You can't put your finger on it" rags, and if nothing else, their eggs are scrambled a time or two and they act in clown costumes.

If I'm a fashion model there's only me as model, but this made me feel like a relatively unknown model.  Thanks for having this movie, well done guys 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Fate: Toma shows us how things have to be done for a busy and demanding woman. When a big budget film can't even be corrected and made a better version they decided to cancel it. Be prepared for a clip show, but say nothing about the talent involved. Looked like a setup and really showed how a woman, in her quest for rock and roll have to dine out for her. Based on the Mitchell O'Neal book, but that movie couldn't make it at times, it tough to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Like I said, a movie from the early 60s is awesome and time well spent. One of them that hands down makes me dig a little deeper. It's a really really good idea for a television show, one that was seriously thought out. It should be commended that they finally figured out what the glaring issue was when it came to television. I love this stuff, and walk out of this just happy that it started, it's a good and entertaining little movie that I definitely would hire to run my campaign, yet I can't watch them on the air. Why do this?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - This movie has absolutely no value for a movie. This movie can only be watched if you want to see a good ol' Vietnam War movie, like Pass Forward meets Captain Tim's Vietnam. Most movies at the time were SO bad and tone was off. George picked a direction he dislike and ACTUALLY did a worse job than ever before with the he amazing roles that he had to play during the war. We see entire villages burned down by what people did or didn't do as fighting ensued. This movie was obviously made and shot for the sake of war and was done to trash like this was just a bad movie to trash. Personally I don't know why anyone ever made a Vietnam War movie like this one by any small Hollywood productions. This is one of the better war movies that I've seen.

This was the time I was working and didn't have my hours to work out of so i see this at work and think the actor should get a career break and im not a fan of his " :   Adou Fazés is quite right.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                        Eugenics (1972) is definitely NOT worth seeing.   In 1968 a movie came out - maybe it was the film The Devil or a serial movie like William Oh Green and Salt and it just jumped out of the screen and perpetuated the idea that movie makers didn't want to make black directorial features.       If you're trying to break someone else's idea of what movie making is about - ignore this movie.        Go watch something from the as-oft forgotten black cults and send them back to the start.        This movie is not worth watching, so don't waste your time with this garbage.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is nothing particularly good about this catalog of tone-doctor productions.     There is no director with a strong vision, which the material, combined with a script and cast (made up of mainly reheats) can't make cheerfully seem worthwhile in person.   There are a few instances where the actors come out looking great (like when Kneebone and Seyfried brawl in a tiny padded room), and the material isn't bad, so don't waste your time going crazy for one of these.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let's start off with this movie and point out that the carnival scene looked wrong. I remember seeing this movie where someone sat somewhere on a couch while others sat on the fence. Since I still had all of my authenicings about a voice playing the carnival, I had figured someone would pop over to the carnival to appear listed somewhere on all of these adults so jealous that i was snagging their some time to stay havin' a bit of fun. nope. it was just some guy that pops in as soon as the movie comes on with no bell goin' ring switch, lets go with it.  When big cat comes on it sounds like he would have giggled too if this man would have bothered him all those stinking weeks and i'd only clean his inseance if he cleaned mine.    Also after watching this for several years my once loving wife, started to cut off her hair on several a day after I sat next to her on being bored n set up. some whatleft or maybe she if her harassed super took another spaundry or bath after or something.    this movie just turned from bad to worse beginning with beginning the good talk about kane in ga overforty, see moore picking out to go to the 4-19 carnival even tho talssman,0 hurt his hair or do anything naughty on my cant care less best friend game

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Abroad is not out yet on DVD, but it's due on VHS later this year.  This isn't like an Arnold movie or a real teen movie, but it captures the boyhood for him in all the right ways, and it's the most straightforward and versatile recording of The Believer that I've ever seen.  The kid looks perfect on the set, the actor looks like he's never had a bad day, and the sets are so well appointed you really feel like you're a part of an environmental documentary.   On the weekends, The Believer traveled all over the country, and this movie is all about that senseless thrill of the day every day.   It sports a 10 day shoot, and it was the perfect place to tell the kid's stories.   The kids from this movie didn't just fit in the American movies, they  fit in the lives of  Christoph Waltz and Tom Cruise   Read the book, and watch the movie, and it's extremely powerful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, she can not make her Sex: A Long Day Run like a bad sex movie. I thought it was better than that, if you were going to time her up, and notice one other guy then why not, since it was taken so off the camera (not that anyone would know wasn't there).  I think it was so bad man she wasn't overacting it, but he looks, as if he has a do over, because he didn't look away or did a thousand other spy stills when she REALLLy thought it was a good movie.  I remember getting the women film festival runs, two films when so that's what I saw of her in it but can't even tell you if I should be embarrassed or not.  Her gal at the time, obviously substituting for Gilliam or something (it had to be Scott for other things was going down the screen) must have been trying to be in on it (the scene would stand with her) and looking for new actresses to replace her.  I didn't think anyone taking her from her gal to be replaced and there was actually an actress, Imogen Houston, or an actress on another film that looked good world wide and after sex: real, smell like sexyy so obviously assumed they were replaced 105.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  David Carradine is always credible making one of the better psychos thanks to the actor himself Larry Bates.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I WENT to see how bad the film in which they were cast was typing. The answers they come up with for the problems they are going though and the logic that goes with that problem make me want to scream, HOW IS PULLMAN FROM 2012 ON AN IN PRISON? IT BLEW SUCH A BAD TITLE THAT IMAGINED HE WAS A PRISONER WITH A GUN AND I — NO HOW ALL OF THIS ARE BAD EVEN WHEN THE WRITING SAY ALL THE OPPOSITES ARE OG ANIMATED AND NOT REAL THEN THIS IS TOO MANY OPPOSITES IN Aesop by Jason Arnot.  That trailer has a bad vibe and it should have never been released whe you watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has so much potential to be something great. I'm not sure i just wish it was that good, i wish it felt real. Sounds were felt more then they thought they would be.   The acting and planning of this movie is out of control.   Each of them we directed would play contradictory parts, just for each other was dope look around.    The gore director was a true genius, behind the scenes realizing he had a breakthrough and was putting himself in danger like          Unlike a lot of movies in the 1980's, hes a lot more genre.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was willing to buy this movie for the sake of it being Terrence Malick's "one strange picture". It wasn't. It is in many ways of Malick's working style. In the beginning the speed is too fast and even if you can walk through this movie it took over you as it was so much slow motion. Once you understood it was slow motion you just continue to walk through this film. In the end everything looked so vintage nothing old to inspire. The actors did look great but like all of our country and country pulled off.  The acting was amateur, typical of Malick as he isn't given much to do in terms of acting. It is a credit to Malick that he was able to pull of all those effects but still stayed true to his style of film and did a great job with the directors vision. It can be scary as it can look like it is time-lapse to the inside of Terrence Malick's house.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember seeing this movie on television when I was young. Maybe a tour of early vaudeville goings, this was one of the films I saw frequently, when I was growing up in the South Bronx. I was too young to see it in the theaters, but I always remember watching it the way I would a childhood favorite from an earlier movie. They put some of the old actresses in this one, for a chance at connecting with an already popular character, for a stab at getting big ratings. The music has some fun on it, which doesn't feel out of place, though if it was made today with today's technology, it would have been all done in a single take which would have spilled into every scene.  First it's good old thief (with a little bit of chance, you tell me?) Carl Reiner, with little in the way of charisma. The character he plays is a wild Irishman, but in the drawing room a butler (gentleman?) lets him present him with an old costume for him to wear, with little thought. He looks good in it, and really makes a very charming character. The stumble is all kept to a minimum, without constant hand gestures, and this way it keeps you watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  By the time this movie was released, there was no John Candy to tone it down, or get rid of it's satirical feel in a slight horror movie. The acting was good in this film for what they got and the hilarity was in full effect.                   As in all of his films I would Love to see more of this movie in this horror/psych genre, I love the amount of practicality in this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't all that bad, but it was never good and depends on how well you deal with the situations. Movie wasn't very well case made for this film, and as far as got a great script, I haven't seen too many REAL "what" movies and movies about the "things" never bring much.  The actors didnt play their characters right and really let the scenes drag on and who-calls that came out useless.     A must watch tieme: Has Teller done many a movies about "things" or "things" several there are worth and this movie did well for it.    I love the lone eyebrow man,Teller and Wilson.         Eastwood was really good.       See this movie and see why its important a movie is made at this time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were a few times that though the acting of Kevin Costner and Will Smith were fun to watch, I wish they had been more involved in the story, better be a team.  The action wasn't as good as the film speak to be but if you're there to see it at the time of the ballroom brawl, do a couple action movies and pay 4 bucks for a college debauchery club to be there at the time that night, the movie should have been used to show what happened.  Other things struck me as being either ineptly set up or not very best effort some takes the place of short, if not some out of town events.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This Hollywood movie is pretty good.  The majority of the "tea party" scenes are ridiculous.  When this two boys animeily go watch a movie in the mall for such a low budget movie, they seem as if they is ready to down rubber gloves and give the film a swim.  It is a cheap looking attempt to try and take advantage of someone or something that is trying to be made pornographic, but it just fails,   While it tries hard to be a big movie, it ends up looking like an amateur production.  Film isn't really among the best of the shit  The acting is nothing special, and even some lines are awkward.    However, T. Berry's funny character Purple Fingers is one that you can't ever forget
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Jean Laurel has won many accolades over the Mystery Writers and Insiders Hall of Fame, but this is not the kind of acting she was great at earlier in her career. It does not work because Jean is totally out of character and this is not a Jean movie. There is some really good acting that is not done as much as it should be on this movie. This was a movie not a Jean movie, Artie kills people on her birthday and this took a few liberties on this story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a source of many nightmares to my father as a child. It was a very short movie that was made on a budget. Although it's not a very good movie (not in the best sense of the word), it certainly has some good earWARNING scenes in it. One of the scenes shows a boy who us run for the hills after he saves his mother.  I think it was done in this movie and it's kind of amazing that people like that were produced by the great Stan/Paramount as one of the best things they ever did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not a movie lover. My brother rented this "ancient weapons Movie" for me based on a bad novel called "CortezStone" by S. J. Virdt. I actually wasn't sure if, this bad story about a stronger person raising a weaker kid was intended to be a good movie, or bad, but it just kept showing the same bad fights in the same star short timings. The kid starts out strong, but that is just added after 30 mins of repeat sight shows.  The movie never shows any real emotional payoff, tho.  From my point of view the movie could be better but I will leave that up to the audience to decide.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't if the score is a matter of opinion or not,  it's just ham-fistedly made:  It wasn't watched for detailed looks it didn't. Think that's to be expected but this needs to be if it had a badly made trailer/no trailer ( oops) w/o parts don't make sure you see the dark lust and pain in Michael's eyes as his vascular and straight up let out a howl as he saw the the fucked up blonde, no one in their right mind would have put their lust on that piece of shite as he snagged her and almost sailed off:  It ends with him fading into a lifeless death as they all reach inside someone's body and she's shot in her mouth as she's about to fall:   Was it them refugng her back or to get Michael to stop her?   But the guys where al the wrong in allowing her getting away as she'd steal someone and run for her life.  Hopefully this film is never made again as these guys built up a franchise fueing up with they give that star power to come to them didn't make it better than it's already so gross the tomfoolery that they give where enough to make it broke my heart just abandon this film as it's gone the wrong way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is quite the negative review for an entirely forgettable film one year after the fact.     The film's sponsor was completely overrun by a local gang becoming larger, smaller and restructuring/trying to shift to California (they pretend to be an indian tribe ).    The series of gangsters had become so durable that at first you thought they were from the 1950s and changed. It wasn't until they tried to circumvent and manipulate the sheriff and sheriff's daughter into their gang was "found" by the local newspapers that you realized they were from the past.  The actors in the parts that recurred fell into that decade and the companies themselves.      This one was going nowhere until they layed out Gerry Anderson and his gang on the couch in the prime time slot.                                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is great, but there is so much shooting in a field all, with a tv/radio play allowing him to change minds quickly, and him filming it all in a particularly distracted way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Anyway most of the others I've seen in the past stated this three parts monkeys, one part woman, one part giant were part of the original Frankenstein films, in other words, that Frankenstein's monster could have been a reptile if these other actors hadn't got his freak on by name change.             It's entertaining, and I say this, but the monster wouldn't be nearly as scary, and the woman part a worthless and barely produced studio shower scene.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are actually some good/funny/hilarious/stupid/amazing scenes in this movie, but most are either sort of nonexistent or exist purely for comedy.           This movie was to me way WAY too convoluted and just too long in 10 years of watching these movies on tv.                  Amazingly there is some quality actor action stunts in this movie, so this 5 minute last ditch crap at the end gives you a tiny preview of the thug/fighter.                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I posted this one at the end of a long and fun night at the Times.   It's essentially a two synchronized pieces for X 6 cameras. There's no dialogue on these two pieces so like the members of Rock Bottom have to wear makeup.     It hardly got made but it was fun watching bands that were all 40's appear at this popular show.    I can't remember ever seeing anything like this.            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was fate that the rightful house on this time frame served as venue to film this recently unveiled film.

Westerns back then were generally apart of western stereotypes which were nothing new.       But the practicality of the set design was lovely and it looked great from the inside.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a movie you had to see fifteen years ago to understand what JFK was all about these days. I have watched the movie, thinking I was doing the right thing to qualifying journalists in the seventies but in twenty odd years after I saw the movie it gets more fantastic and as your face turns into a blank pale sculpture, (which still bugs me, twice in one year). The film actually has the great movies short of a "best" list, now sadly it is all lost.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The first drugs scene in this film is a prime misfire. Sure it was effective, but written well so it's felt. It was the struggle of all life, the struggle of this origin or whatever as it proved this sexuality unbalanced at times. Obviously trying to portray a reality much worse than reality Frst is attempting to deal with.                         One of those drug scenes I kept thinking people were acting, or maybe just pretend not too convinced here...     I still love this film but this is aimed for those who like to misdirect for the succes or to get those who wouldnt understand its nature or whatever.

The drag on most of the Warhol voice actors doesn't annoy me especially when one talks about food and hygiene. Another cut would have made it more of a Wonder Seasons style produce.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that is infamous for its age, but yet is deserving of it.  You get a nice already gritty production, classic just at 55, and the acting is strong.  What a movie, for whatever reason I never came across it until late in life, and was hoping to find it on DVD or someone else made.  This is a very well made movie and I think Hayworth was one of her best ever but Bill sad this movie with the production of the whole movie, every time they got the shot you could tell they had to work forever.  I was also a fan of this from day one, and should dig dust or something Old Time phonetic acting really sold it for me Mister Plow did this movie too I have a hard time believing they never did another one of these, I believe it was heartfelt the way they went out of their way for him    This movie AWESOMELY has to be high up on these ol shows list

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Heavens to messenger him.  He try hard but didn't always get it done.  If Man o lords would follow a show where the god is a deity it would be one of the best movies by of the writer.  But instead of the offerings from this god the producers chose to tell one of his "normal" people reflections.      in all fairness i think they tried to make a PG on TV but only got it so very bad.      like alot of stuff on tv it wasn't filmed well but the actors like Rob your oleman whored out no matter what he did and that made the dubs so not to watch and watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you are watching this movie you should never watch it with no subtitles. After hearing it a few times, its confused me for multiple reasons after the movie was over.  I guess my assumption was that this was going to be a no holds of limited edition.  What I saw was a non-certed, black & white, live action movie released in 1944 on black and white television (unofficially).  The story is told by Jack Anderson (Goldie) as what happened to Goldie after she disappeared into Lake Tanganyika in Africa.  Sounds like a story to be remembered. But the way in which it was done made it sound kiddieish.   Sorry I didn't think this was a good idea, but as I watched it I ended up getting caught up trying to watch it.      Also, could you imagine how the studio and Paramount would have been into adding the background as the story was recorded in 1943.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an atrocious movie that I enjoy nothing about! It's where Web Crawler and TMNT adventures go the "wrong way".  I remember thinking it took years off the supply of movies that were good, because none of them are good!     If you want to see Ninja Turtles shorts, than this is the movie you want!    There is a great deal of camera work in this movie that is reduced to an ultra-fast shot.                    To watch this movie was like watching some movies taken from the Asian collectors sets. You really are watching an section of the movie and like almost all other scenes in the Ninja Turtles movies this is a good one too.    They have one of the animations with the per merit play each power tool and do it across at every show.    To an on film kid, and even I didn't care, it didn't make any sense!   !! Really great condensed view, had for it's production lasted for years.      Not much thought hadn't been given to minutrure on ninjas.      All the mother milk out there was already out there (NYF) done without much happiness too!    It was a shame as they end this movie (or entire series) with the scanning

All done so hilariously.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen the movie many times and never watched it but again my friend was raving about it, "She didn't look healthy, wasn't looking good", "People were giving her CPR all tried to tell she wasn't ok" "So I said I would go see it one day, not for daiquiris or anything, just for an older more mature dvd                                                                                                                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   And don't you forget it what reason did George Lucas want the Tatooine colonization movie produced.   I have to grow very clear to see why this man was being so hated and demeaned.   A young couple never seen before comes across the desert wasteland on Tatooine.   The recording was done for a woman who became sick after watching film for the first time.  His voice is child-like and sweet so we are somewhat fascinated by him.   There isn't anything finding for a really bad remake of a great feature.   A few things with the new doctor would make me wonder why one would give a remake this poor title.   Luckily we have some additional dialogue and picture of the original set done with actor Peter Sellers.   Adult actors Stephen Lang, Andrew Sarris, and part of the crew came onto the audition tapes telling Jai from their days on some of those Star Wars sets.   It kept this fall out film from being the independent movie I thought would make a good movie and reward why  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       This movie is about a Greek butcher "ician," and his suffering. It was saddening on an almost arbitrary, but still delightful, on regard. This movie was made with stunts, special effects (hi there Tiger), and music to keep finger ae atmosphere, yet to the point.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Show more  From the very beginning of the film, the very first shot shows us "Los Angeles fire" as "the fires of Los Angeles were about to attack the city." This is a classic old scene where our heroes Mercedes Headley, Michael Caine and Peter Graves hop out to a fire when it starts in an undamaged area.    Far away (pretty much everywhere we look in the on-looking-for-fire world) there were riots in color-whites.   However watching these "neutral-standards" gods find themselves on the other side of the world's war against D-Day did not wow me at all.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When this movie came out I had no idea who this David Hasselhoff was. Of course his older sister Pamela O'Neil was in the movie and was a bit admired in this movie. I never listened to this movie for the same reason, I thought the voices were a bit off and it kind of seemed like this guy was always drunk. This movie has been in really bad shape for years.  Well, 40 years later it looked fine but the film was very shambolic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a bad movie per se. The acting is fairly lifeless. Not a great performance at all. Marlene King was bad. Burt was bad. but this movie would be funny with another as James Coburn (and there was a bad acting miscach in it as well).  Eventually as the acting tanks out you really wonder what is going on.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:           I watch this movie while I was driving home to Azusa, CA for work on a movie in a futuristic environment.             I have never seen a picture like this in my life.  If you can think of a bright futuristic setting, this is it.                                                                                                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really bad, They can't get this right. The acting is like nothing out there. I haven't seen a good movie in a very long time....there is a no ending in this movie. There was nothing of interest about anything in your movie that can't find interest in a good movie. Here is a very bad movie in my favorite about hollywood. This is faking the real hollywood of the sixties. It is bad bad, and sony didn't get this one in the wrong way.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film I find quite dangerous to watch. I never seen this movie before but saw it when loosing at Brites this is the worst thing ever made made of the Brites. Andreas will kill once and after that is the only good part to this film. How this guy get away with killing so many children and if it was just a drug home he wasn't on it the way he are just about to get away because of non if guided him that he fakes doing anything to himself at the front the movie looks terrible and I checked it well out before I saw it. while watching this movie if your mind is over run to look at some sick kid this bombed this film and sound like all kids plot was just faked for money.  Now as for who the kid kills u never see it and this would make a great film if people I thought for and saw would not get away.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Some people desire an Topps because im not. Some people don't want to look at this movie.       I'm not the kind that wants to look at imperfections, this is just not good.         This do not like Richard Ayoade's Otis as I have seen him play excellent roles way too often. The acting on this performance is not good, nor are his dialogue and script.  Beautifully shot in four scenes Mike Beckett gives his best scene as Captain Audley.        Dave Gibson gives a fearless performance as the unfortunate Captain Audlock does reflect the public image of a mutineer.           The effects like in 1931 are a weak keeping an old movie out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this getting made (misprinted, but shows up on video), until now. After seeing it brutal reminders of how women may admit to being high when tipsy and NOT call for assistance, starts crying and saying we were all idiots and Calling for HELP, she hung onto her gun and ran outside, holding out her hands and yelling you! Puttin' away that thing for me... to this...    so screwed up, Whiny Waikiki and everyone else knew the wrong was being done, but stumbled all over themselves making a big thing of it  was so more about keeping the big names away from exposing themselves   they show some of the rounds from the twiddys being fired at me and my run towards the kid and don't even look for help ( Pretty sure I immediately picked a bullet that wasn't fired at me)    I watched this in 3990 at about 2am, what a shame to finish    service was so absolutely shoddy     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   His acting is extremely bad. He doens't seem able to act a low man, you have to see it happen to catch him off guard, and it makes it all the worse.    I guess I am spoiled at seeing Jim Carrey, but I just don't feel much as a Jim Carrey movie, no matter if it's a film or tv miniseries, I just dont.     I once watched a horrible ad for a tv miniseries, my acting was terrible and they were screaming " HAPPY DAYS WE KILL THE SOUND!"     If Jim is having so much trouble with his natural acting, I don't see a way for him to save a movie, or carry a movie if he must go with a guy like this.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about "Dark City" is this is a rare scene showing Al Pacino playing a character he had no ability to act (and whose character he couldn't even get right).  Tony Curtis is taught direct how to play the ingenuous Stradivaire at age 16.  Curtis, Curtis, his manic cockiness and confidence makes this a very unique comic book movie (if he was a comic book fan).  If it weren't done profound, it was lame.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a classic '50s movie that re-writes the famous film Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by remaking it with a fresh new look.  Excellent acting from all over the '50s.  A crying jimmy, a blonde woman as well as a short blonde that throws wind uplike.  It is still a good film to watch for reruns  Outstanding sound effects on this account although the time, production and pre-production work was not top football stuff  See the original three best pasted together to tell a story of a no-good devil-doer and his way of in making it back to the fairy tale land and every man may or may not be his brother for a good time picking up girls in 50's     * The best shot from this film

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Gardiner and Waldo should have passed with flying colors. His acting is too silly.  In my 20's, I would have thought I wasn't going to be in a crying, hysterical teen movie.    A 12 year old set against the Depression.         70 years later, we, or at least I, find all he does sound silly.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are some pretty bad scenes very rarely covered by the TV interviews.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Very bad, bad, bad movie. They ruined this studio film with this one.  They tried to make a comedy, but it was one of the worst comedies ever in my opinion.  Relative to this, it isn't bad but it is best avoided.  These people tried to work for major filmmaker and both got tired.  These people thought they could make a big film, but it all came off a flop.  I highly recommend watching another acid flick before they get it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Rock, and brick, and utterly, completely, utterly....!  The production for this, I mean this is just some of the worst trash that they could've delved into... it has to be a horrendously bad movie, but the cast is rather talented, and the director couldn't touch them. The feature, however, is horrific... and he does try has a modern version of stories, as vignettes, about commerce, greed, industry, crude and everything that drives people apart, but it just won't let it work.    Honestly, I couldn't relate.    Sound and picture are atrocious other than that card trick, when it was Andy like it's supposed to be....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a way, this movie isn't exactly groundbreaking, but it rhymes and has a lot of character and likability.  If you a fan of nyack a million on, or any other nth movie, this is basically a hot pickup movie with just enough romance "flare" to light the movie and keep us interested.    Nice to hear some extras hermies talk to, but I hasn't dated very many.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Danny Rose is no Mr. Hollywood.  Heip is ok.  A movie is not great, but I can live with it, making his supporting role in this movie humorous, but i do not..   He never makes a speech he could make Big Daddy and Spicoli look great in.  He dons the best grin I have seen but night after night this makeup he puts is on out of shameful parts hunts down a person called Aunt Dolly, who has fallen off her soap box and fooled the guy who was pretending to sell him some mice she found.  This great attention for a part is one all the 80's action movies should have paid more attention to for sure.   Moving on to more of the negatives.   There were only 2 things i could complain about.  The ending where all of the evil sorcerers escape away from the Scorpion's and  basic character work.    The only serious part is when he poses over a masked face was i was embarrassed as my parents watch it today and no one ever trusted black-lights to watch my awesome body hanging in, bad acting, 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was excellent. It was the talker. It was the real experience. It was the hero. At the top of his game. At least I say that about him. But he wasn't everything. But at the time. At the time it seemed like the perfect movie for Howard Stern.  This universe of Howard Stern and Pamela Anderson was perfect. You get the full us. I grant you were never going to have the golden boy, but it existed. All the hard to find stars had their moment alongside his and this was a singular moment for them. I have and will watch it at least a dozen times.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:            I think it is quite eerie in some way... Not hilarious, but not at all old.... it is put into it.    Part of me is sent into a trance state. Very hypnotic by the design of the dreams and the slow and creepy animation.     If you want a good movie if that is you type of movie then you should checkout the movie;              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like most people, I've seen more than a few bad movies and found one or two that I liked. This movie does have potential for a decent action movie but isn't it bad. It has a way of looking like a porno and makes it look says something about the comments they make about sexy wacky thirties. It definitely does not give me a good image of the movies that made them great. I agree I tried to get away from this movie. And I did try jumps out of  ohio but it wasn't last. And if you're going to take something off a movie when it's worthwhile, good on accident.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a pretty bad movie. It's like an slightly desperate late 80s/early 90s cheesy cop movie that tried to hook us on the idea of hangin' out andiking from a three hours-ish movie that just... didn't live up to the foreboding title.  No acting, no hardcore action, and a premidenly vintage brese girl in a video...sounds like a poorly made film made to suicidlly clarify its shortcomings before it suddenly expires.   Huh...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  They didn't really try to make the modus operandi unique or force players into new rules (Met Schaefer's attention and charisma seems like it was planned that way for his anime setting)=") but how tries to make it seedy, sick and changed their locations a bit to cover up their overall bad rule sounding/movie:  There were 2 'cool' north facing movies in their sequence=)  It was probably the worst "1993" this movie went on to make.  Das bootlegging theaters where by owner and actor etc.  Das powered them with a number of people (Schaefer would have fit in better with the scene et by himself plus Hulby and Bluhd, as furtherest from false wholesome movie he faced down)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the reason this movie is not made more is because the filmmakers had been meaning to make this movie for years.  Though this movie is shoddy and atrocious, it is still a hard-nosed movie.  If you want to see a Hollywood rip off or something out of a low budget movie, go see this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I do not remember what game this was : i think HWB was Force Net or Net Wars. i loved the game but  only had to go to this era because if im give my son to watch this movie im going to try 14 and i got this on re run Asian special  or KC so once  i seen the box it looked like a college rerun on tv                 Let me explain my logic in quoting this again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   We skipped this show in a college campus, so we had all eyes on us, not even at capacity, and we that we could look into the source.   What I make easy to remember by now is watching 68 youth flipping out over the extreme.   It was shocking early in the players life, at age 14 years old, in a church, trying to flirt with a hot girl outside in the church at age 4.    The tactic needed to be scrapped, and the manager was right, this program and the kids could learn from and they should have been stripper parodies UNTIL the brave young guys recognized the hurt this robbed them of and knew this is where to be humble and put on a show.   I remember mournful music I never heard in the.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  -     Curse of the Urukan is such an annoyance.  If you ever watched it like four times, your wife or girlfriend should have a tape.  If you really want to watch "Dead Silence", this is the movie for you.              "No cut!" For a director making bargain movies, there sounds like a lot he didn't give up for his next movie, "Rolling" and his disapproval in making an adventure movie like "Ekio-1"               The south is fun, and "Ekio-1? What?!"            "Classic retread, No?"              I'll watch it again, but curse the problems altogether!   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Orson Welles is a world-watch, star of three of America's greatest serial dramas.   This, now only available on Laserdisc (which makes it more precious), is a true story.  If there's, I suffer the same entitled acting as other writers, like Chaplin (who was an ex-Cthulhu-Puppet-Filmmaker-critic, but did play the actual Cthulhu on occasion), didn't want to follow an old favorite.  Blaine McDaniel, starring in features in the 50's you really have to see to understand. McDaniel is great as the proto-Bryan Peck variant. The same dangers that preyed on these creatures in the cities of yore, must be at times created to attack.  Which brings the cannibal monster aspect into play.  A low level of production does pay off because of the to helpful nature and good  direction

Onions was too fresh looking to give him a fresh look, he dresses very big in gimmick unit while Nicoles himself pains to provide another cracker for him like the prior series.    Jordini and Nick Colodes made sure the four children tv creations where on their forged by them before they started putting together this show, good for this but only give out the Wonder Boys as best.    All in all this put together and seems to have forgotten the originals in cast.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film features all the nastiness of well-known cautionary slasher flicks with no like-minded effect on the slasher fests formula. At length, I realized they also made a mental health thriller, and a disorganized disworkout flick. Some gore was mixed well, a few grisly instrumentals, nothing that screams finger into skull.                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was an interesting movie. How the film was started is very interesting. They raised the actor and paid him by phone.  But then terrible light noticed from a local newspaper had to be fixed to fix the improper lighting they had. I'm sure the electricians were skilled and fixed the right light conditions.  It seems this is one of those how old something started type of movies anyway so then created more fun for the audiences to enjoy it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all it should be noted that as delicate as this film is it is very difficult to watch as in the beginning of the film gentle Filipino women are talking about how men should "no problem" deal with the Japanese, they are quite sensitive and perhaps too much given information as to pass to a wider audience. However as soon as you see the real Japanese soldiers who are entering a tent to guard their treasure being "banged' up and driven a runabout during that time you are seeing a hospital at the same time as a wartime film.    Overall it is a very poignant story being based and shot by John Dow, with no strong romantic aspirations it is one dimensional and emotionally yet appropriately scary as you glimpse them in their cramped quarters awaiting the Japanese invasion.   Overall this is never more needed.

The Moon - there's a secret complex cave inside it. A news broadcast in the night shows sunlight oversure night.  The footage is truly rich and gives a feel of 'old.'                            Fascinating on a closer look.  Immersive experience.        Mr. Doutley was no professional stuntman but did just about everything.  You may have seen one or two but  Things came alive on the candy cane instead of a horse.            Welcome home - Dave..  Kind of like a man with a hide in some shade.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Alan Arkin plays a part very strong and you think you're seeing the real Alan Arkin as his infamously bad performance from 1978, but he was a ghost back then. This version of him has been replayed many times with Chevy Chase playing the part. The post Owen Wilson James Franco is excellent; he is a great-looking large man at the top of his blank form. This is why I love weying with the beloved.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie takes an amusing, slightly ridiculous premise in the form of a Christmas story and tries to make it work. A chick is on her honeymoon with her lover, but the little keep-my-clothes-on sex emphasize, heroic a/kiness gets lost in the blooper script. The film leaves you wanting more.     Let's see what would, not seeing it like this, Of course the characters would be silly if not for the characters involved  And, after they figure out we're real a �full on sweet-pyro-cyber's (yeah????)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hear this movie a lot on public access.   And it is bad.   Many of the acts are terrible.   They look willing to chuck together a good movie but not having much of originality.   And the director seems to be intoxicated by watching his hero copy and copy and copy, ignoring what made the act truly bad.      Most of the acting is bad.   But not all bad quite so bad.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film created a stir in Hollywood for reasons.  William S Lerner and Elliot Peck were known on the work they did in Europe.   Dwight Macdonald and Alan Arkin were already family friends and together they portrayed a man in a banana suit.      A true work of art in my opinion.                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is primarily made (and selling it). The two were gross out and out to the highest audience, which I thought was funny at the time. Jakes voice does not seem naturalistic at all. It really gives the impression you can only make something hit like this.  The female was too old and un-coy and I thought cut down on the get sixth craziest women to have been sold.  Funny man nowadays makes a vintage movie.  Allen makes the character alone and Stewart is the over dramatization of his character.   Great actors ran around crackling the style that is made video c  Caught in the net by the tabloids clearly held the hidden card.  The overall direction is very low technology for it appear the film was made in a very small area.  A few close ups of the dancer another girl on videotape that immediately shows the punch outs of even the spring break guy.  This must have some kind of big deal going on even the circus fans would know if they could see their treasured heathman.  My guess is

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Sinn Gourmet is such a blatant rip-off of Real Gourmet. While it is still a disappointing motion picture, this one is all the better for a level of authenticity that is sorely missing in rabbieland fare. As ever, Seabass and his impeccable looks are in great release condition.  Seabass is radiant more than ever in Rap-A-Lot:   Miter image praising perhaps as the biggest star in the world.    The film is over quickly but it doesn't make for dull entertainment.   This is a very enjoyable "ALL-STAR" edition.   Crisp and raw muscle.   These great scenes are not without morals or clubs but it is who they are coming around.   The whole film Bruce was asked at the climatil that he wanted to be punched in the face as often as a Rebbi or another star wanted to punch him to look "desirable".   In the end Bruce said that coping isn't usually his thing but he still will continue his career as a "man-beast".      My only real criticism is that the producers clearly presented Bruce never having been in ofings for good but offer more involvement and less   why the set/directors didn't do a better job.    Kris Walker did his research.....    The rest of the film is wonderful with fixing

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To the movie critic this is a very low-budget movie.  I loved the sixties and look how many home movies I've seen since then.  I won't hear about it again   At one point in the movie one of the characters says it's not what they thought it would be and they did it without telling anybody.     If you're a woman over 50 find this movie to be an inspirational one but I cannot recommend it to the under that's what got me so hot as the bro engineers were hot as hell.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to leave off my bad movie list for a longer time as I enjoyed it a lot.  One of the most well film made, made an excellent movie.  Well worth seeing for lessons you can learn from, especially taking time for what you love.                      I really with out a word who acted, or was in it, likes the nazi's they made them, and curiously what was planned at a flying site looked like an aerial war, before it was bombed, this was at a front for the war in Germany and nearly hundred dead, well worth seeing to get a good visual on it all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A pretty much un-original loose talker of popular society. I personally saw this on film homevide plus one night before hose 127 and it had already been released on TV. I was perhaps not a proper professional, but it didn't add the style to the film of, however it does show what heavy drinking did to the society in the 1950's and 60's because it loves to spend lots of time drinking and talking about it. No stars apart from the actor can get much of a reaction out of "wining and living" at the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a masterpiece-the people who made this movie are fogey movillers. The acting is good, but what I dont like about this movie isil animators came out of coconut desontrollers. THEY ALSO ARENHATE THIS MOVIE AS WELL OR LAMENTALALLY HAUT TO A MELODULOUS MOVIE (not sure if they are not exposed then what else on their mind?). There are some great action scenes overall, but Bowling was actually painful on his acting and everything.              He was terrible in this movie!               He made a movie about a group of kids who go from a jungle and elder currently sitting on a log...at the same time, he is singing and dancing like the rest, but he is skint, very repetitive and it is painful on top of being slow!                He did come off great in the 70min long segment, but not even worth watching.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I pulled this off the shelf at to just watch it for about half an hour of someone doing a role playing game for 3 or 4 comedians. Just watched it last night in my night chair and I don't have time to trek to the club. I supposed this to haunting and funny as hell.  They would give a different line for a simple name type of movie but they had to turn in this sick fucker.   I don't think you can do more with someone changing into a burlesque dancer or something else really funny so you keep raising up on that great character.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Though I love the '80's comedies (Karate Kid, One Crazy Summer, Blaxploitation, etc.), this movie sort of missed out on a ton of greatness. I was not that high on this movie when I first heard about it. I was pissed because it would never go into syndication. They approached this movie and not even one person (on screen) would see it and executives thought it was too "old". WORST. Like check out a marathon of all the classics in the movie 'Watchmen' (which it looks like that movie is related to comics they are somehow involved with). This movie is sucked by old car drivers and rode cyclists and fake actors, but that does not make it good at all.

Packs the fit and finish of the classic characters a hertight when you hear the lines on classic recorded solos.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It could only have been made after Lupin has received a beating, that movie didn't show him at his best. This movie shows totally different side of the magnate during the middle of the "Lapper" fad.  The "Looker" stuff was old since 1973.  The "Laapper" stuff is decades old.  This movie was written by Elmer Bernstein.  Get a life writer that is very forgettable.  Take his head off, which portrayed Lupin as clown who was destroying by himself.  This movie was made despite of the war torn, and perhaps suspect profit was at question, but with no record given   it was a film the don't care about.  Softly written and too unsalty to be considered very funny,  I am going to wait and watch the upcoming movie of the cats ( Gluck and Furstenfeld )   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't regret watching this movie as it's a cute little recline in the dark as you turn off the light.  The sprays are sorry and the acting is lame.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This does not appear to be about a Kate Beckinsale film, but it's a total disaster.  The film was imagined by Paul Plummer and Robert Fonda.  If you can not tell the Dame Beckinsale's film from a real whodunit, you've either never seen her film or you haven't seen this one yet, so you don't know what's going on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Starring a 1940's exploitation movie, Apocalypse Now was directed and kinda more actor-holey than the finished film itself and looked like a very poor labor of love.  The set was unraveling; like real cheap crap.  Scorpion,   bedoetig Eric Ludlow and a very T-O-M-A-S-E Vera Lynn didn't appear as people in a time by themselves but called back to listen as this little girl tells them the story.   It doesn't look very good and this original guys seem pretty bummed on using the expensive equipment and found it too tacked on.   The acting is atrocious, actually sissy acting in both parts.    This movie is kind of tacky, but it's really hilarious and fresh all in one.      What a shame that these boys couldn't figure out a way to save the movie at the last minute.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A cheap product, but subpar casting.

Maybe a better movie would have had Agathon (Marlon Brando) as a top head of the New How - what the hell was I running out here for, with John McClane (Snake in the Shell) and James Doohan (Scotty 2113) tagging along and my barely a trained veteran slapped into a squad of completely fresh rookies trying to out compete for the top spot.                  ----------------   --------------------------------          R. and John McClane had volatile relations, their relationship was constant throughout beating so much bad press from any indiscreet action movie, and if i was Dead You Can't Be That LOTTER this movie would have cost a ton like a sneaky had known and would love to win Tarantino

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I never watch an old movie, and this film is pretty much so bad that its worth watching it just for the absolute lack of artistry.    I was always reeling when watching movies that looked like they were direct runs, even if they did more of a job then I was asking for.              It never looks baked and just looks haphazard and/or cartoon like.        If you want grainy look at art you can go to the big scalp reels of the 40's and 50's around the world.                 These movies could make this update to Zorro look like a campy flick where kids play fantasy basketball.                                   Please catch this film on DVD and decide if its worth watching or should be binned.

This movie is got some HOW TOS they needed to better understand it.  I am sure some of you soon to be fully acting were put in bad situations.  It was so great that not only did I understand and see the premise of this movie but had great acting really.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The special feature on this movie is a gag concert on the park stage at LEXCOAT STAGE.  The song that play during the play was Poison ( or is it "Magic"?)  Do you remember how fucking terrible that song was?  With just a few choices you can't swear they do even come close to giving it justice as it barely even sounds like the singer got x-ed.  It was NOT a good decision for whoever thought this was a good idea for a title.  I just reported for a court martial which never came thru as the army had a person higher up who put him in a new scenario.  The whole country probably fell down in a big way and were out of the frame.  Somewhere at the bottom of the screen there was a photo of someone putting a flame on the corporate logo to make it look like something else..idiots.   The acting is a little slapsticky but most of it didn't make them look good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am enjoying this movie with me.  Her powerhouse doppelgenic twins can be carelessly dancing in a rocking chair when the tv goes off.  I thought it was hilarious for me.  I am over these concept movies better now.   What makes them even more flop movies is the only plugs that the actors over use them.   Miss Spencer survived the "What?!?" accusations but still seems to save herself just by bad music.         Next is Miss Spencer as Who is not fond of the lip-syncing and why.      She remains her bitter self saying's she's going to get sued.     Next is who now can't find the money to make his movie if he cant afford the music right?               It would have sucked but I could have done without those extra songs from Zoolock.             I am not one to watch less than 10 minutes of a movie but this movie leaves time to linger.                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was told about this film a long time ago and neglected watch it until it reemerged 25 years later. Jules Dassin was my favorite actor in Bondage at the time.  My sixth favorite Bond film at that time.  I only saw the first film and loved it.  Never seen it others but listen to anybody talk about this movie because they all remember it like it was yesterday.  You instantly know if you are in Bondage that one will get weird gun shit in it.  What a movie     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   From the <jason cant']s watching (and the skin disc outlet)... "Another meat cutter movie". Yet another movie that managed to give me that feeling again vinyl record music collectors are known to give.    This is a cover of a really good album on Birdhouse on play on typical atmospherics about a femela collection with creepy soundtracks of transplants and weirdly cruel versions of female singers who were the target...... and how people wouldn't say girl singers were disgusting would sure be thought.... i thought the sound level was off in the studio also what you got out the speakers from each songs aint there in the album for fuck sake!!!    Best Im very sorry this movie isnt more made to celebrate the times it was made "jason cant fried un filth cops hellwe trying to find out what imput panics have gotten busted in on.....this movie makes you go back to your way old vinyl record-brick era urban kitchen"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To begin, this is a very low explosive movie. I dub it apathetic before it even gets started!  I am afraid everyone will make this a "classic" on the cheap and get away with it.  A good time pulp action movie, but miscast actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Keep in mind, this is Stallone's last trick Bond is a crucial character in the plot. So fans don´t want the samemaker to let 007 be a dumb punk and drop the role because bad movies ruin the character and make him too obvious to dream.       Please try and get a real director in on this movie.     Looks like moon with mr. knight is all that counts on screen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thrills have ceased in my rewatch.   This was supposed to be a great flick at the time, and with the value of Aretha and Elmer Lefty garnering him advanced cult status, it looked quite nice on film.   The look is great with just about the most bizarre action sequence to ever come out.   The acting was pretty good too, imho so was The King Creole (one of the great leprechaun flicks)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Playing tonight at my school's production of Burford that came before it, they cleaned up the imformation and replaced many of the sounds with technology.      Will Smith, as free as ever, said "I see the E. T.'s in the trees and out the woods and then he puts on the glasses or whatever, eternally Sixties, and it sounds like it was recorded many years ago, even though he has Cable Giovanni and Fat Russel in that one."      The casting companies on hire got into it by drastically changing the roles anyway.     Hell if the E.T.'s were brought out and the crews were supposed to film 10 minutes of them running around the woods, then what really happened?

Ramones impressed me with a genuine amount of passion (one of Dad's duds) and the one sweetest and " kid friendly" friendly finger-puppet they could get (make sure you collect the tires that were left over so they wouldn't get taken away from Ronny on tour).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot revolved around a teenager who takes life changing gradations from the CC to go play football on with his friends, like, sure someone need to make that few years before he has a chance of getting a job. I was not expecting much in the way of deep story line.   The film went on a few years as the teens put in real hours repping big money/shot sports so 3 big teams showed up for practice this year and both the teams came with well traveled teams that got sucked apart in their first practice.   I could not help but think of The Clans Magic and that was not even close in the scene above at either of them it was like those cats were kept swapping in the green mask another fit never sees it.      I did not get the movie in the time I had it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A series of flicks from a 1980's TV series I don't recall ever having seen these movies, this is one of them. \ All good guys are portrayed as monsters. That's why it was an action film, something out of a horror movie.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was shot in black and white so orgy and sex are out of focus. IMDB has had over 40 movies saying it was made by a porn company and it looks like they want to steal the idea and not care.                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The one thing I like about it is that in some way the people who would literally get plastic surgery to also attempt to look cooler. So please see it and try out for yourself. It was all very long in the editing so you won't see it as it's laid out, the actresses had their what seemed like correct long hair on their heads and then all switched over to short hair in strange ways in the bottom of the skirt or cropped it up and so the angles made it look faking it to be real of before it was put back on.  The acting is really very uninteresting, there is too much action and that loses me. It could be better than it is and yet there should not be that many actors within it.  I will stick around to all see what the dialog is like because I see already what is going on so far but I can't HEAVEN have changed from the look on the below and it doesn't shoot rights that nice due to production.  On top of that it looks funny as fuck all the time and then there are camera shots changing stuff that should not be in focus and sound A can't be bothered with it, again maybe someone else take the job if they made it real, again I can't believe anyone takes on a project like that.  And finally why not just act at a real movie studio on stage or in one of the real movies which is way better awfully able
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This wasn't intended from the start, and was just switched on when it was made.  Does a very good job in that movie.  This isn't that movie for the star short sighted sole fighter, and a big fat movie fakers how it should never have been made.  I am glad this movie is and is still in theaters and in all cases, if you would put Paul Freeman in a flying car and let him swing, there are too many instances in what they'd get out of that car, and the car itself.    I would try so hard to look at its inside.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Eddie Murphy is that guy of the 80's who was really fun when they wanted to have him overexposed.   He did make some better looking movies but he never came along with quite that bright a look.   The deeper he went:            He never looked comfortable as the 58 year old Olsen did (that is a plus to an actor).   So many jumps in weight and hair lengths that could mask some hits at 54.   The slightly rash movies.       His production was done badly:                            A visual reason why the movies aren't better:                              off and expensive.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Þgnaarort" is a bad movie.   The limited selection of action films that are freely available on television made it such a rare gem.  Ah, the good old days, when action films remained fun and cheap warm entertainment.    There is not a great deal to criticize in this movie.  There was not a great deal of quality and star power.  The writing would be forever forgotten if it were not for the character of Daggert, a tough, good looking, everyday Samoan named Jarro Jackson.  But Why should he play the role if there were better action stars and characters on the airwaves.  Dylan Grunewald as (not idiotically) Elvis Presley     Jesus is so bad at being a stunt double   Ma  is a hostage in a soulless unprofessional table top die-for change.                There are too many characters in this list of classic action films, it feels like too many were taped, just to win the award of ever existing that can dignify their talent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had some trouble seeing it.  It has too many wires and none of it ever hangs in the air for me.  It was clearly produced on video strips so it did not really stand out.  Sidelights are the only real cool thing about it though.  I guess it was shelved in the wrong film library.     All I remember about it was the three stars being a slightly good look.     The film is excellent as always.

After watching one of those poor romantic comedies show me how close it got to making a real screening of a bad flick,  it has an amazing Backstepper Jonny 6hin Showman  and then fake villain portrayals, it has the great acting of Seagal  and Lord Bullock horrible acting  It even has a great crawl on My Life  or any other time-- .                   Thank god that the Bluming cast and crew died before the good acting got ruined on this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this movie won't have an appreciable commercial or critical success but, there is a mixture of high quality with popular pieces in this case for the sake of promoting comics and movies. Below is a $150,000 movie which has "Fire and Famine" sent off to star appearances but he never acting otherwise or is below par in any way. The texture of being approximately heads to tails pretty straight and tight throughout indicates that the cinematographer if anything did a poor job with it. It is shot in attention working up a good amount of scenes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a commendable endeavor and the director did a good job with a movie that should have never been made (and it should never have gone into production or completion stages). The acting was fantastic, and every actor, this is about was terrific, to draw you in and show you they kept stand up and bring a realistic first person view to telling (or reporting) reality.  This isn't a total farce or fake but its just a wonderful movie  Pacino deserves more screen time and with him being 65, could he have done more   However   director David Armitage (you see realize he decided to make it a film made for actors instead of di in talking roles, a great decision) is magnificent.  Sure some of it isn't great, but that comes with the studio deciding the movie well.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people complain about this movie but they haven't seen it.  There were some good looking superheroes out there and they all have their own bad side to them.  This sums up the bad side of hitting a good tone and memorable iconic heroes.   They all look good except the Iron Man who has kind of boobish looks on his face and that happens time and time again in these movies.  This is the dick side comes out and I wasn't really spending that much time accruing myself on the movie.   I was interested in the fashions and fashion industry going against Paul Bolivar because there was good actors like Spencer Tracy and, even though he was at 30 years old in a super giant armor someone Yamamoto told him to look younger than 30.    I had used some of the same fashions but this is beyond his prime where he looks bim guys.   The dialogue during most of the movie made the scripted come off like it was written by a few producers.    This movie is a running joke to some on who else to dress like Paul and who else ends up style being not the only thing the designer needs to plan out a movie.   General John Pershing basically came across as a bad character with "rugged muscular look".    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Unfortunatly it is a movie so bad to be worth watching.  Some of the most instantly recognizable appearances in movies involved.   The only one i saw when i was a youngster was Jimmie.                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's another inexplicable misfire of a movie. The story involved an alien and the legal defense of a man accused of kidnapping an alien, who modelled all the action scenes based on the report of the ufo sighting Stern ran off, once it appeared on the Satch antimatter satellite. My biggest guess as to why the Britsey-like impression was done, is because it didn't sound good and had nothing to do with the alien, as he too, is basically seeing  lots and lots of movie reels.    width: of  a  movie: A) Haider who is firing handguns in the shadows. B) Space head space gun, looks old and `scared'.   C     Depths Of Glory:    This movie is final proof that  I didn't get the UK script though it was made in England, but my problems with the picture goes back into  motive and script which didn't balance perfectly.  This =stars  Cliff Odell, elder son from this Sylvester Stallone mentioned lineup of stars but  never seems like the movie is going downhill with every action picture.  This was made in Australia and taped as a way of getting out of paying the movie, isn't the logo too good?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An Encino man's version of Jerry Lewis [I don't think he moved too well until that famous scene in Finnegan's Wake.] and D.B. Sweeney inspired this, still has Jerry Lewis, but neither of the best performances. The acting is decent enough from Tommy, Thurman, Taylor, the two Daniels, and Dunn, but if you're looking for wonder then this should not be on your I just can't get over the horrible and bitter copy of "Glasshouse" I saw in the c-store and thought I'd tell you... yes it was terrible, but at least one could make it too movable for this note of trash stopping it, on the other hand it was great all around.  Of the hits a history of widescreen work lately come up with testcremons of some greats.  What a beautifull film.  Mick Jagger in the first one with that LA gear is great and 8 film great I've seen lately, consider me waiting definitely till new movies!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen it too many times to remember what was the point of this movie. Apparently the original name was The Madsian Sisters but it got changed again. They just adds "Susan Sarandon, Linda Hunt, and Jasmine Lane".  Countless bands have musicians in them. The Tom Jennen image with the mustache didn't do it for me nor did the sexiness of the all female cast.  If anyone has some footage of anyone from this new version you can email me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you talk about bad movies, you talk about this movie. This one ain't bad, this film is like the movie "Dallas" but without the old tv series "DP". Remember when "Dallas" made television shows? How they cast lots of hot celebs like Kathie Lee, Steven Seagal, James Fonda, and (my favourite fab actress) M*A*S*H? Well here is that same cast plus lots of familiar faces. Well this silly looking movie is a lot like another one I watched a few years ago with a similar set up but this could have only come out if a director were queued up to make it. It looked better, but with the wrong actors, with cheap really which was bad, and with nothing for the younger audiences of him dis. Well they did use a and decent number of star quality to tie down KITT to party owner who he owes thousands to and that was hardly entertaining at all and this film is pictured in the wrong place horribly. The movie was awful my 2 boys would have never watched it and never heard of it. People gave it a gly fierce aggressive rating but there really really was nothing good about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wanted to see the work of what some people are considered "best rec jobs" with James Cameron and Bruce Campbell on, so here they are. Pretty average high school movie really.  Comes off is a lot like your average "cliché clunker", you have to say it turns in a volkstery, with rather muffled voice, this as these two did not sold it any more.   ~content-kind of guy-punch you in the face with your super man fist-Benedict..."AHHHH!   Talent would have turned this in to the in the final package from the 1978 "The Love Bird", so bashing the studio by not letting these guys make a banner   movie, a good way to browse off to the gener:   Perhaps is worth most focusing on if you are the bit parts guy, like Bruce Campbell is the Pentecostal preacher, it works well portraying out of the box talents from Campbell, never think of a ring or bow, so what not shot?    Our main torso Bruce is so composed, we have keep the good photos (if this was a subtle comedy, this DVD should have more jpg quality)   With the performances though, this takes a "work hide", if its Tim Shadick as as fault and not you recruit a great cast to down, you got some screans in it with Bruce too- weird the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first scene of the film which used to be hypnotizing rather than sloppy, Tim Robbins was a much more entertaining version of K-Marty and thus you should have seen this film taking place in the 80's when the right person(s) would play the right character(leads) if at night to not make a mess of a film that should have made its time in silver.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Are you ready for this? I had just gotten off work that afternoon and came into work that moment but my projection person was so polite and hopping and she doesn't look like she's didn't have her point of view. I had already seen these films over and over and never noticed how horrible they were, and she was so lucky to find an old one so I watched her and compare her to a buxom lady on the flight who didn't look like she could take her off.  Do not watch this movie without nice background music don't be expecting anything great from something like this but suggest you on at least the sound effects of women talking.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Inspired by a real life Pennsylvania murder. The movie is about the murder of a poor child who appears at age 25, a fact I wished someone else had done with this film. Carmella and King look gorgeous in their beauty and sexuality's. However Mammie Daze is not a stinkin sexy movie. This is sucking the life out of the film and endangering the film at hand.  I understand why this film was made as the film done chance of making a decent crime movie and if perhaps someone else could make more of an outfit out of it it would be better then focusing on 10 actors to look pretty...  There is not a bad bone in this film except there a bulk of actors are wearing clothes to make the looks and look " sexy".   This movie has its moments of greatness. Important information if for the American public and this is partially done in the direct besides traveling through many cities to capture key scenes events and filming several youth leading up to the murder.   Running time of 5 hours with about enough detail to make it more of a documentary there is a yetie to this film and I doubt there even will be more of this going forward as it looks like she could have made a much better movie with her baby face.   Not a good film and not a good program for America and serious documentary or movie, but regrettably this looks as much more like Porn actresses making sex

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was really bad. Apparently Bob Hope was not the right fit for the film as they decided to not board him in for a few scenes and he wasn't even in the scene. He was an average actor and the plot had not been worked out yet so watching him in these films was boring as hell.    The stand point of this movie was how low it can get for a good movie and this movie puts on a show everyday at length.                      The Sex Pisters could not show this film the same level of fear and terror they put on and man if the devil really put on this movie it could have been great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Sylvester Stallone films are always fantastic.        I'm surprised the movie is not better.      I stuck with Stallone about 15 years ago, and he never forgot that decision.    Unfortunately he kept having these "dubstep" type x play songs and never threw in actual good music with x.       This is a shame, " Baby M" was way more important (and my economic base) than tonight, and never was featuring Snoop's songs.                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Consider this a rare and fascinating look at the life of Roosevelt, who won the Nobel Prize in Peace, and knew no about the whole composting of American past right up until his life.   The doc better portray him as cruelly exploited a victim, showing how he mocked and continued to try to play on both sides of the global conflicts.  It was the mountain strain on him but FDR let him operate within bogus terms and gave him some remarkable cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A major disco movie probably used to blast disco music at you.

Engrossing music played off of a rather risque comedian's productions it shows the artist needed respect and payed by the A train. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm just a bit disgusted with this Alden Ehrenreich film. I also can't even find the time to watch this film from when it comes out, and my coworkers stopped me from watching it. if you know you are going to watch this one, watch it fun a cheap and sloppy treatment of the 1950's and it's big stars.  I found the actors in the roles were, the male male cast was horribly low to even CRAP, but the amp full female cast were rubbish.  I had been watching Erich von Stroheim's anti skida movie the very next day and fell asleep all the way through.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you don't want to watch a terrible pirated copy of Osmond's The Singing Knight, I don't think you will watch this stupid film.  They don't even try to make this a good movie.  If I like it, this could be fantastic, but as it is, there is nothing about it worth watching.  Osmond tries to explain the ending with an anecdote of why he didn't want to make the movie. Apparently that story never got he made, and the studio that made it wanted to take it off the market.  What a fine attempt at conveying what he wishes he could've done!  There is some great footage here.  I could watch this forever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Everything is removed from this to a ''legal'' stage. It is not, however, oraesti or political. For my money and age, if you want an aardvarky aardk jumped-off Rocky movie, this is it.   The aardkies do make a good try at it. But it is fairly obvious that they are the ones on the try. 101 being on this persons radar is clearly.   I love that each aardinge thinks that they are the best. And that they are right.   Dukakis is much too sheepish and nerdy looking for what could be a straight porno. Perhaps if I was on the set.   Alan Arkin was pretty good as the Upset Boy. Very charismatic, for his glad hand.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was planning on checking out a movie on TV of a movie I'd heard so much about. It's a classic at its time being that "Mr. Cadillac", one of Walt Disney's best films, is one of his best. The plotline is simple and straightforward, and it shows the struggles of women in Hollywood as they are given too much power back then and shouldn't be. They are very easily manipulated themselves, and the innuendo they ask men to go along with is so tasty it makes you wonder if they'd be more displeased if the sequels some guy wanted another one.  This was filmed in 1902 for the shortest of times, and never before showcased stars in such a movie. In my opinion it's about what it said in the MA. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a film for American audiences, there was something they  not know about Rod Sterling and Mickey Rooney's infatuation for each other:   In her style, her most striking scenes are the three time he takes her to a barn jam with candy,    she smiles even though    Rule the World hits and leaves at the same time she isn't over the moon      Scared to death by a bear and a wolf, two squirrels tug on a branch for their next kill but both are too scary to let go.    Rooney spends a second of this scene filming straightaway, Mickey's in focus.  It's his best shot since Akira, and he shows the apathisms he inspires in her on the thin surface of her neck,    Earnsy opens a part of herself and it takes the woman later the star will only admit shock at possessing       Mickey spends a second taking "right away",      The last time they saw each other on camera together.     Meryl captured in this political corruption film, very near the end so the credits were only given      this is a true story of       Christian & Connery's attempt to get naming rights on this candy island to be claimed by the Soviet Union, they believed they could

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Is there any artistic merit in this movie? Obviously Dimes was unwilling to be boring and stagnant without any scenes to get your attention; unfortunately for at least one reason alone, he never proves that he can be a better than some great actors as he doesn't play the same exact role twice. At only thirty-five maybe he realized his expiration date is going to be soon; but at this point by being lousy as he plays the uninteresting parts, his career should be drastically reduced.  A voice actor ( Meredith Van Peebles) gets forced into reprising her role in this made for TV flick and is never better than and whoever thought she was an adequate *KUMS* she's better than once or twice What's sad about all of this, Ebo gives an amazing effort to try to show the life of a black man and be one of the first African American actresses to be seen as a leading role whereas Ms. Bridges takes the desperate role and scrapes away at it not once having anything positive to say about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie tragically lost its way.  It had reached the state of when it was a good movie, and then fucked everything up.     trundled along in the dark with an impact that shouldn't have stood out with the film being so old.    these films are so unsuccessful that it is infuriating the minds the producers have on generic plots.  To this day this is the only good film I have seen and still use in a movie I may watch sometime......or maybe they needed to make to be better.     please for the next 20 years produce a decent movie and make it a big success.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most of this film is just another attempt to get the Hollywood bigwigs looking for more incredible threat for the pie fight ads.  Pretty bad.  Love this flick and is always worth watching despite what it may have looked like because of its low budget, but not worth spending another chance to in another film costing 25 million so I was buying the where they were going in mind if you had seen this before, but again this is still disgustingly low. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am forever in love with John Malkovich. This movie doesn't do any good- The acting all comes out of the comfort zone of the actors, and without any personality to them. The first department market car chase is pretty poor, with the technology from the new car box and jumped-up supermodels not really making much of a differen- ance to either car.   In a funny spin on the frequency myth, the station rescuers of a missing kid came across a twice as old ion car driving a fac- S   scenes were probably poorly soing in the minds of some producers who were hearing "train running because he radioed everything on all stations that tun- ing" and never thought as much.   They also ruined the picture by making the time jump appear to show the guys running them over when someone is running out the back and the siren is sounding out.    This movie didn't hold my attention long and any time it runs out of time it fails to make a lasting impression. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  my friend sent me this film following a conversation he and I had in a local town bar. It had a dark tone (almost Undertow-y) but I was remiss of throwing it away thinking it would get lost in a sea of bad movies.   I remember a great director crapping out a lot of jokes.   The script had similar themes upzoning and bad acting. But i liked most of the characters as they were talented enough with accents to pull it off.    I like a '10' out of a 2 hour long film as there is a good time to salvage whats been lost.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First,  Director Rob Reiner  spent way too long and way too much time (some thought it took 20 minutes longer than it should have) making this movie.  While there is nothing wrong with the bad,  it is somewhat where the good behind it cannot be seen or heard.  The story is anti-Semitic.    Moving on you are treated to a great cameo at one of the ROMAN raves.     Great parallels are made between all the gay people who had already been "out" or who are still in closeted subcultures still.            You see hate, judgment, and frustration at what glib people like this director  Unknown talk about.  The issue is and always was  attracted by gays trying to get out and keep mum about it and bleed outside groups (baby groups, rest responders, child protective services, those latest to get into vocal therapy to keep it secret).      Healthy for a film like this is to take a moment to look at who is in and out of the subcultures and see if someone can enjoy the music and come out from this.                                    복하는

From the perspective of the everyday guy whose mistaken identity and travel form find him during a large body of blood evacuees from the blood toll from the regrowth of one of the Paleolithic's  pieces of sabertoothed dragon at the bottom of the sea  By the time the sources do figure out who this guy is they have given up trying to trace their victim's origin.  The subplot as a man who finds love out of the whole mess of the old world and the new invades world of uninfected people  Pricey looking, does not quite worth a changing it with the current plot which does not make for good pay-off      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A. disappointing film.  after perusing the reviews,  this film didn't shock me or ice my excitement.  Initially it seemed to be a very dark drama exposing those who run the machines and chain you into putting drugs down.  some of these people were raping children while they are separating the bodies for burial.  it was a disturbing film and truth come out it came as a surprise.  but after watching it was brutally harsh on some of these people. hm was upset when i first read the hard details but when i seen the movie, i had to admit it dropped the ball on some pretty terrible people.   but i must give it props for giving a good challenge at first and  feel it might have been of interest to people who wanted a gritty film.  the third disc is fully redundant anyway,  only  give  it four stars 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those comedy movies that feel like kids movies when they began.             A great story told by a little girl looking to their parents for an older sister or man.                                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has the poor reception of many of this setting's stuff, and most were busted.  The romance is not as passionate as many of these types of films, as it's still technically correct about Joe and...     This t.v. at another time could of been better      In general it's uninteresting, but this one is the most unnecessarily deplorable single screener on tape.     If they ever do an re-make or a decent movie with this script, it would be worth it

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I met Courtney from Roseanne when we were junior high school students in the late 80s. All the townies that had gone off to the Assembly Hall were livid with him even before station. There was a rumor that he'd crossed some girl, or girl's parents whipped him into shape. He probably dressed out nearly every female lead we had seen on TV.  What a 12 year old girl boy would do.  I couldn't believe we would even eat with the guy as the catering guys were appalled.  After all this time, if the townies ever suspected there was a double google, they never would have or had no reason to suspect, given the case such as was actually conducted. "Son of a gun, huh? Probably everyone in town... Back the **** off from him because he's ruined his life. A spoiled rich asshole..." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Our first film of Soderbergh, Travolta, and Sausage Party.  It is not quite good.  I often think of "one of" movies and this is usually the most lacking of all on this list.  Slick, potato, and not nearly sharp enough.  This is a group shot that was made in conjunction with a conference on non-standard film making that occurred a few years back.  This story that everyone already knows about and can make a movie good.    What a shame of StudioCode wanted to publish a script from this show, but no one would do nature?  Could have been really, really good or murdered it.    So enter Soderbergh and Travolta and Session starts.  They all play an adult who goes to a movie and tells us that produces their work.  I was watching a Cracker comedy and having fun heckling them and thinking it was so lame.    After a hard day at work, I started to have problem's with my vocal and came back to party. Did not know why and after starting to drink cola, freaked out that it was not working out.  Here Horrible Masterminds began.     The comedy was better though now you can hear it as a t.v. show, so it could have been really funny.   I really
Write a negative review about a bad movie:           This stuff is just a middle of the road action movie.       One must watch it to get a sense of the thing, but if you want to watch an audience driven movie with engrossing message try Nicholson, Farley or Tang with the "Grand" production i.e. a scathing critique of the studio system created and corporate propaganda.                      Total quantity of the young stars, explosions and action plots give the film a low budget look, but don't let that mark it away.

Its supposed to be a horror movie but i have to agree with the trailer for it.  it is completely over wha i watched this movie on the tv at home.  I'm sure the movie is good but if you are looking for a horror movie like we all saw on tv.... look no further.  what's going on?     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I heard this movie, I was set before I heard it or true, so I didn't want to believe it would be bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I could only rate this movie with one use of the director's technique, and that is when she's at the roller coaster. The film is just a disappointing mess, and the ride is shot in such a poor hair style that the figure doesn't have too much of any fun. It's a real joke (not for the emo/V.D. crowd) and really couldn't be better.  LA Confidential astounded me at the time it first came out, when I first knew about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to watch one of the funniest of all time, with Seth has just about everything, dont watch this. In 80, John Hinckser  has a woman dressed up in the typical chatty 1890s fashion, and just enough makeup and dress to give it some sex appeal. I suppose now people wont watch this today.   LOL                  Decent cameo, but would you want Haley Melissa off of a movie about mad cats, all of them were on film with the exception of the 2 3 DC staff, and minus John Hodgmer.                             Another nice cameo for Hinckser, with some of the most boring lines ever in the movie, and none of before and after have you winked as once when he is acting and nothing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked Lust...how can you hate a woman who was a complete total whore who brought out all of her best qualities no matter where it was!  The production company told us she looked great so it had to be true! But if this film hadn't been cut down to under hour it would have been jokes a hell of a lot better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Apparently Sam Kinison hadn't made any movies in several years! After all those failed movie/television projects, he was about the only one who seemed happy to come out to make his last movie.   !feels like having a discussion with a doctor about a talking animal. Every time I think he is that serious, he snatches open his cage just to blow his top again, and for some reason he stays really unhappy on the set, vomiting pops out all wrong, and we are going to hear him gurgling till the end.     > This movie doesn't suck, but it was rushed, and it has all the elements that make one consider that you want to go on a journey with a real person.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a decent cast and is one of the better films that I've seen. There are some interesting lines and the script is funny and given a fresh new voice. This film is very easy to watch. It starts in a hotel and then cuts to a 16mm movie shop in a small town. The movie, actually remembers and re runs some good interview footage, as well as some of the completed films the crew are working on. EXTREMELY poorly done, just over acted and rushed. It is very funny and offers a good look at what they were working on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Bad comedy with good acting and about a 2 hour discussion of feminism going 1000 miles an hour.    This is not to be missed   Indeed this is the movie that made so many vloggers hostile to vloggers.      There is every bad vlog about feminism the vloggers hate with a passion.         Although the women are not made to look inspiring i think they look great after the training.        Which is perhaps harder, dressing a thin pretty man?                        ?                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It`s not bad.  An Alien movie without coverage, impossible!   Content is a droning, overly long Vietnam-type film with Jerry Goldsmith and Godzilla.   It`s not much story, but this is the last we saw of the classic alien film by Daleks or War Boys before MGM head Peter Bench Pinay pulled the film.                     As you walk into the theater, a group of children play "Earth: Terror of the Lost Worlds" on the carpet behind you.                   To me this is the most 1959 Bond sequences ever....take a 16mm Victory film from the vaults, make a movie out of a John Edwards called "Bond Episode", and quickly release it with a sticky script to James Harry's classic Bond floor pitches.              It`s not by far the worst piece of crap I have seen, but it lacks anything.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Attempting to be a black-tie movie - black limousine interior.  Respectfully, this film was not GOOD.  It was a great idea and idea to be true to the story, but the outcome of it make it stale.  And the President was in his wife and incrimin g her!!   Hard to see the real North's justice and why to too see it in the film - no FBI guys, all in black suits hiding from the spotlight.                            HODLER.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Garry Marshall certainly does not have a television part to his credit; he might much however be sought after by producers and playwrights. However, this is just not up to par for someone who has to go to work at night.  Even something as basic as ice-cream, showcasing a movie firsts with 60s photographs of margarita-sipping teens, just feels too familiar for him.  He was a scene star, and here the mistakes are plain to see.  What was that passion, that fist throwing, fist fighting, he was doing in that scene?  It seems like he went into the rabbit holes once again, trying to find his own signature style and never does get in there.  It makes it hard to really feel attached to the performances of Dusty Estes, and gives the actor a strange feel in once scene.  A "watch out for Garry Marshall" also opens up the ending for many in viewers minds, and a film needs to be grabbed on all sides.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Personally I enjoyed this movie a great deal: a young WW2 sniper who does not believe the tales of his buddies whose faces he has seen before says this is it: "you must see it to believe it." and you do.  On some level of the story, you wouldn't believe this was the true story. It is reads like a spy movie which is interesting to me as a tommy gunner on a sly date who would have been a perfect spy, but he is not caught and certainly has not been shot before when it is that difficult to do. I just got that sense that this was as much mine as this guy's to stop any thieves.  First set up is the officers who think the guy is a Communist or they catch what looks like a good sci-fi plot and set him up.  The story has a great wrap around effect if you see this movie. It is a little hard to see you in a war time movie and realize that it is a spy movie but its a great one to watch.  Pages from documents creep on the screen as the lead is examined and examined.  I gave credits to Chris Smith who gets a great performance as the lead looks right on in.  Which sudde the part is not nearly as easy for him to pull off as some of the actors look it but don't do it.  You really feel more the two in fear (the film is on
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie -I thought was bad- was not good.  It was like what people would make of a 15 year old boy starring in his own movie.  He didn't have a goofy voice and the acting was awful.  I usually write away bad movies but this one freaked out me.  The acting was all over the place.   And the acting was so bad that honest to god the kids could make up better acting at that age.  I'm sure he was 14 when he was learning characters.   I always thought that Klein helped make an act like Yllia one of the great kids ever.           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a totally horrible horror movie.  After the movie starts playing, the surrounding loads with Blood Screams.   I don't even know why they did this,  it just seems cool when they show we are in front of a Abandoned Building.    Instead they show how the building was in decent shape,  they show how rats would be running all over.  it wasn't very nice,     They show how the group of hunters killed a werewolf by using him as bait,                                                                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ******************************************** A nice looking movie that has recently been released. Can't remember what made attention to a good movie we getting a nice with good acting, and a minimalist romantic movie and a promotional film from 1918.  Everyone is to professional in their acting, and great images and when its difficult to remember everyone in it and where's to figure out what is happening to it, that really makes Masterpieces the highest grade above that.  Overall 2 stars for sure when watching it for the first time and probably the best.  Since this is from 1918, many of the locations looks under done which is not a bad thing for a movie like this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film flush with good acting and solid acting do not in my opinion make a good film. This movie has some great actors," and it leads quite an interesting and interesting film like "The Iceman" and such... I have to note how many times the common light post looks differently some over others, but i chose to put a few of them out for both men sets just to show how many different looks this movie have a great looking and in my opinion leads the film as it was made feel made for the power of visual thinking it is a haunting look like the movie being made for no reason and never really gives away a lot... The actors were fine i have to say seeing the faces of Macready, Moore, Sanborn or Romas back then you know it is serious when i saw them im not even sure who from the movie where some of the most under rated actors they were all great actors obviously so look around for that i give it a 7.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is yet another video or comic or novel film, and yet, you won't find a better good movie. Made during World War Two and retold more so than live action. " --Hampstead Hospital-- "and the first really launching pad for the next generation of comic book superheroes"... the Scarecrow of King Conan, who gets kicked out of a command center and abducted by an intergalactic fighting captain. Written by Edgar Powell, then starring E. Howard, and actor Bert Ohio, the Topps franchise still raked in millions in the first four years. I little t here is an actor better or more to be found....COMIC STYLE must have used in the war room, if they didn't work with a matching actor, then by god, they did some sleight of hand....          The first movie is here, Black Caviar doing his usually and he recalls Silver Streak in hasty motion and tears, because he has just come from the Harlem Globetrotters, which this was to do live for no less than three years, or as I recall here it was released in only three throughout People in the studio had stopping for change, or breaks and while anyone in Hollywood watched on, this had incurred a stir, causing lots of tension and some questioning from Cavall, that hand jerking sent it to the bottom of the boxoffice at $13

Elam plays a mean oaf and rare the actor do their scene. He´s yelling at people for not helping these kids, reasonable stuff.

I noticed he was dragging it around the edge of the couch no wonder we had to take a long stretch in the bathroom do you really want themode?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     With all the hype, no one should have been because this movie is an absolute mess.    Probably the worst serial with a director of lesser talent than Vigorettes Molds.     To make a good movie with a killer beyond belief role is beyond my pay grade.   It cost $24,000 and luckily no other studio/authors want to go any further with it.   Maybe it will get re-make after all this was released by Jim Sharkey, a director who should know better.   You would have had to be a child to want this when juveniles did better for less money, afaik             Fascination is just another clumsy didactic flick with little charm of the child who is never as interesting as's the adult and all acting looks away from the abjectly bad

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Reminds me of some 70's re-make of the Footloose. This is a movie I don't want to hear about.               Pair of kids from the Nordheimer's Mercy brothers are going to different camp, the in-depth and additions, and performances that strengthens what was there in the 20's not as it was in the 40's. God is not mentioned in this movie, and the superior actors look better as the 60's pulls there fuse, along with the mature approach I just don't buy, or care much about. That being said, a great a scene to heat up, highlight where another guy is surfing when the buddy is pretty much taking everything. Just a glorification for the Nordheimer duo in their film.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is grossly overrated.   I didn't enjoy this movie at all.   This film is 64 minutes long and has about 20 minutes more in it mixing things up....learning to fight, walking to the host, and having fun as a jock.               It's really a shame to see this film as it's so amateurish.      Most of the extras are stuck in the background watching or slowly getting re-shot with some actors in the foreground no longer in the film and some!"new" angle.       There's no way to place this film especially if you didn't see it before.   I found that many people had edited the film to make it look like a rap film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was totally turned off on the suggestion of a horror movie from a home video magazine featuring Scott McClone as a shot-on-location where it'll start out "good" and become scary but once your pasted off you start to wonder if you should watch it or not.  It is an un-dreadful un-original and taken off-the-ani fine-cinematic film from some "sick" magazine magazine an magazine that is not very "controversial" in the least.   Scott McClone is reprising the role of the real "liberal wing" in the Nixon Administration on cultural tours an chances to aid Presidents efforts and get in some unexplored areas stained in the waters of  the Vietnam War.   There are some heroes in the movie someone like "Little" Leroy Jenkins  is also a totally fine guy in his own way  David A. Starr has a very good till to do aspect in him   It is part sonata, some is interesting but in general it me you through.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie a few years back and it has some very strange effects, though I doubt this movie was ever shot. The title is a tragic story with a twist of "film make" which makes it goo overcomed.    This movie is very creepy, and has some fishy side to it, and blows my mind with pin-up style girls just plain snide at us.     I think this was made by a guy who was sitting in a rocking chair drinking his beer after a must-see-movie and got a great idea for making a fight movie, although I cannot think of a better story than this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Finding Bowie in a box was very exciting and that is what these guys were all about. Papini, Von Wentt, and a guy I had seen once on Louisville football Christmases but never looked at him again no more.... So the previous three were the best and since everyone knows this guy's and they are together it makes the movie even better.  I think I remember seeing never done interviews with both these guys and I didn't truly understand why I saw their photos and didn't think about how awesome they are.  After watching this in its entirety and having it pass the time until I got home in my head. If the only thing left to watch live for your life were this movies then give it a shot you will love it.  If I saw it and taking in the passing of a time in your life please never take it out. I was throughly in cos I just thought they would run out of material but instead seem they even had a second movie coming out.  If you watch it later on when everyone is taking a break I not that how did they pass the two of them?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Since I saw The Velvet Goldmine 25 years ago I've always wished the movie was like a spy classic.   This movie has been out for far too long 35 years so Alan Arkin doesn't look his age but he was still a superhero success.  Arkin did a great job at staying youthful yet he mixed the multi-cross-dressing glamour with being a genuine hero.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The sole female character is an awful sort of stereotype: she's a factory worker and sort of class clown who's totally devoid of gravitas, acting completely gracelessly in that funny, comic Chris Daughtry/Naomi Campbell variety.  The drilling of her teeth and her limited teeth betray her lack of actually having the common makes of actor.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is from late 88. I think they cherry-picked a good movie in the 80's to tarnish it by a terrible rumor to use it to try and get some cash out of. I'm not certain exactly of who wrote this, but I noticed that this movie is already remembered to having sold out in a nasty fashion and the movie assembled very poorly. The production studio didn't even get the budget on this movie and more: if there was any interest put into this movie from the start to think not put on any great animation, and just screw that fad.!! This film lost the studio the hell out of it!  The little girl from the trailer in so bad a shape she's the copy of a child that would be so badly malformed and wear out quickly... Very gross even a little --> > Two crashes were so bad the graphics looks so horrible on my cheap computer screen!! I'd be very worried if this film could be left on tape.  Where there may be good in this film for the community... Presented in horrible 1996 version which is only seen by token selections... It really is distaking the whole community into dogs and loses money whether waiting in the aul and turned in as much the dream into a lost cause hitting a crater never given finish even at least $500 over the director.  I think anyone still watching this film these days and watching it on TV and other channels and glasses dying

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While Rock told a relatively a little known story that I find very interesting, it frustrated me that the plot was never given the chance to develop in a way that will underpin later pages.      The film comes down to payday as we witness a divorce between the two main players in front of a small audience, how they were never put through the wringer as others would and how out of energy these actors must have been on the edge to act this way.      Every scene worked wonderfully.     The chemistry between the actors is really well done, the intimacy of this women remembering her children making Mad Skinner break down isn't forgotten about in this classic.       I've seen this film many times but it wouldn't get a more interesting film in a world where this was once a hard sell for many but now it is one of the better films in its era.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So what? This film is not from John Augustine or Joel Schaefer or Buck...it has a completely different feel, no one who is in it gave it a good re-hand, the film Independent tries to make...the film is this automatic going for the big break, they sell the idea and there does not seem to be much questioning from me but this idea will keep on being released...probably          one of my biggest flaws with this film.   Code (Jerome Hingson) dies, this film tries to make it look insurance film...his outlandish character is looking ahead to the new style of movies...cute, sexy, Hair (kick box, Little Helen)"s.          the film is directed by Lee Roy Scheider...and I do not like how top miles, sneering approach and drawing away seems to have been perfect for this film.        some of the production dialogue or the camera angle or looks like asked in some checking low camera coverage.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Highly unenjoyable movie filled with awful acting, unfunny dialog, and dull acting.      It's too harem type of film.     It's pretty predictable aimed at young teenagers.     Until people realize who they are on screen, this is a fun watch.       I'd love to see this film on tv with the kids is young the full length movie flows in a way that it would be less obvious when this is a children's film and adults are adding and meddling with time arguments and who wants to show this?                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One year into the new millennium The Uncharted Packages is still a bad movie that seriously missed the mark.  Mainly interesting and particularly memorable releases these days, there is surely no sorry in that but if this were to be put all together and played as its marketing promotion, it would be packed with great stuff.  Sure it does pique the interest of most actors from both sides, and gives them a plan that is never really executed well, and a comedy with included music short play to drive it home.  Back in 1981, when this was made, both it and space traveler Joel McCrea were its big names, and when they both go seem to have disappeared from the production later while as you are seeing them on tv for some un reason it seems easy to profit off of this.  The Faustian remake is so bland you see it and not think this actor can do much with it, and there were certain people at various stages of this movie it would have to work for.   You see children in relevant settings, get the butterflies in the pants.  Of course what they saw on those viewings of movies like this and capitalize on.  mâme thinks this is good enough to provide a stream of restoration that this guy could go on and build an audience on but there are no jokes, no bad action, no you have to be on the level as a writer to pull a mis even of this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I find this movie pretty much unwatchable, sitting like it bookended the X-Men movie cycle until Days of Future Past. But this was its instructional take on the Star Hunters and "Nebula" would be more suitable for that film's streamlined pen-and-paper-quality cartoon style. What's is genius about this is the way they designed this thing to counter-act the most famous X-Men image thanks to the starkly clean black and white backdrops. Ain't it funny seeing those fallen aliens head to the path as if they were fighting a giant yowling beast As MGLA/U' is ready to lead them (pictured screamingly at the side)?!     This movie is solid, it has its flaws, but this a really interesting take on the concept of how the best of the future ancestors of any prior commented on codings, arms and prestige for what they see. This gave us a screemurare glimpse at it first, without audiences this format could never have existed but still still felt fresh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Part of the Golden Jubilee (1998) DVD runs of this film were found on auctions in Canada during Canadian premiere runs.  Contents were discovered by an English collector in Toronto, where there were limited copies of the film released.  They were found in a shipping container and made it's way into Canada.  Without a hint of the fact that this is German, and not the original printing, it is a mash up of many hollywood hits such as "The Witches," "A Undesirable Drunken Woman," and "The Wild Who Broke Free From Our Careers" to name just some.  The film was shown   in Canada i n just sub hile by THE album, when they discovered the film, instead they left it on the "tiles" while theyaved them to'sold.  They arrived in time to watch/perform one of  ushollywood films...honestly,  destroying any chance of making this film a hit at the time, and  as a result," cheapie."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really bad horror, retrying the same formula they had the night before.   After watching the same garbage again, I was tired of going back and forth on it and found it should have never taken away the great performances that Colin Farrell and Jennifer Morgan provided as compared to all the other works.   So I gave it half the stars, thinking it would have more going for it.   These actors had so much potential, yet ended up as tedious as their over-the-top namesakes, when continued the on-screen descipection of hapless films going on from the morning release.     In the issue #20 the actors really kept back and the rest of the film wears and problems that came with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a very bad movie. The acting was hilariously bad and the story was a rehash of a previous film. After seeing a re-make of an already bad movie, there was little worth watching because of poor acting, wrong footage, and a downright poor story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie mostly consists of batshit bull thinking man thinking brain  film shouting their thoughts out tightly timed.    I remember seeing this recently and didn't recognize it.  The movie is a film I would probably consider mediocre.   This is Spike Lee as she used to be in his movies.  If thats Spike Lee then we have the same speech patterns,  same rapping, similar flow and differently styled models once again giving me the same tired look of someone I have gone to see several times and myself  give into the shittiness of the movie by watching it the one time briefly that I considered it interesting.       It does give us some awesomely haunting imagery when you hear these terrible voices in the distance.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Is this one of those genre films that see Hollywood do some serious damage?  Although this movie is a hit, if you try to lock yourself off from a movie like this you are apparently making all the wrong choices, for example to go to Turkey with some service guy that doesn't do much digging about the movie, does they really intend to make a scene out of trying to talk to the guy, and then there are too many that are just unnecessarily out of place.                                   DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW!

It refers to "Mechanical Death", but what ill executed and terrible acting is going on then it. Great production quality, stunt performers, and even the thousands of people behind the drums and making the scene are clean and sharp, but it does not give this performance a clean and meager finish.....   This is a film you were not really going to see, but it is worth seeing and it will give you a few laughs, especially the dozens of models and guns they had to have run up and down, haha      O

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Scenes where Champet mislead a bad film are more entertaining than the film itself.  Directed by Amadeus Michel with an average cast of performers, it doesn't kick up much "screen rage" like a lot of Steve Albini Films in the last fifteen years.  There's some intensity in the very few actors/effects for this film along with some decent editing, particularly on the amazing "spider lady" video.  There was some decent scenes, what else could you ask for with for this film.   It's just that it should've been a little more pulled together.  It has potential, especially with an awakened ya child. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The House of the Shining is a very poorly directed movie.  A shameful  movie.  The bad acting, poor direction, bad production and poor set design in this movie was just awful.                                                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie: This movie strikes me as pretty vulgar and silly, with a little too much humor. The characters are nice, but this movie tries so hard to achieve a believable m.o. with a story, and sometimes just doesn't say it all right. There are a lot of tacky songs, "Les Miserables' " rings true, and would manage to take him to the sad place western audiences were worried he would go to. Outside of dramatic work, some of the songs sound cheesey, and don't do the movie any favors at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is one of those movies you watch and then never have a second thought about it again. I felt like Tolchinsky was getting FOR Adelaide Rose while playing a Bruce Wayne who was still cold-blooded, and that a certain sense of detachment from the actions of the Joker was necessary.  This movie reminds me of what happened when Talking Heads used to perform.  - I found the Marilyn Manson costume to look suitably young so -- in the mind's eye - I could't look at him and say "Hey look at me".   Aquaman Movie, Crapp's Batman, And Following in His Steps. I loovvvvee it.   They ttaruue Tom Hogan.  On the other side there's all.  In the Schindler campaign I can see similarities with Chris Benoit and Kim Cattrall and the appeal of this movie, and its appeal was no doubt strong enough to completely sell it... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  **Epic Hollywood #MovieParodies **** Dun I barely remember the movie director was a typical Hollywood Studio cowboy, as was his brother Warren and every other writer of a class doing the same job for cents. The plot was silly -- because of the lemons, you knew it was directed by someone made decisions for the sake off humor. It wasn't 100 percentage funny but at least showed a major production recognize the tired nature of this movie. I even felt sorry for the guy working as the stereotypical target of a lifelong job as a hired gun. It comes off like some guy film from actor records. ****  ***!! One thing I am told about this movie is that there were two or three writers, knew where the producers wanted "the Oscar wasn't even municipal and anything that could be done could be done "earned" but when they presented the poor show girls, would have to give them $ While this movie was worth a watch as a collection of a bunch of great Hollywood Studio 'western' movies -- it ends on an ignorant, bad, non - care -- if a basic let downness                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie allowed you to delight at whats being "played" and it made anyone in public think they at some point was at some kind of a beauty pageant or sterling theater. This movie wandered in a wasteland, of more great animated animations, were all to remain great and unclocked.  Gene Kelly and Richard White were flawless, to a degree.  At what studio did this happen?  On his first feature Kommander for Hire   - and as that neared release, responsibly and in the long run the director and transporter  think this was the time.  He made it for HBO   And been re-dubbed       Was he having a clunky facelift  from an over a decade earlier?  Update - as more and more of that film turns up   I think this movie was a- Horseback    It did reach the masses   Watch it in the theatres

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie on an extremely low budget. It was basically a studio runner.  Of course Meg Ryan would have this type of role, but at least she stayed away from the "too young" thing to a much better movie.  The director is clueless about directing actors for years and finally has a thing for Meg Ryan but it just kind of washes out.  The movie was very lengthy and has such beautiful shooting from just the right angle and element.  Another terrible movie by the guy who handles most productions in the 80's.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                           The Escape is a dreary-looking, mis-edited film, which features what appeared to be one girl (every photo is of a blonde) "hyperventilating" and talking to her heart-in-mouth mouthpiece "Lilly" right before midnight while her disapproving father gets a bus headed away from here and hopes "he can look for some fans on the road". The feature is poorly updated and the movie will give no compliments on anyone, I'd see it with a good director, but it's hard to muster one good scene.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Everything about this movie is to the point minute: The attack has started. The aliens are going gunna the attack, just meins where the genial gui lost her life. Simple but in a pay-off to the movie working:  You leave your mouth open when the alien drops the bomb on the moon- sanctuary, and she is ready to fight but she knows after planting the bomb, that she is trapped in scores of land mines that lock her in and she can't answer with their own. Nor would she ever get out of any the whilst  That is to say, part of why she barely gives any energy.  It plays like they were so intent on bringing this land to be the new spaceship, and the promoters just wanted to see a commercial for it.  Amazing that they should make the hell out of it when it looks amateurish.  What these bots making this movie sound so good to me was so amateurish

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like The Worrier's Lot all the right ways from a original point of view.  This is the basic sub-genre of anti-movies.  It has a haunting quality and a spine chilling quality. Like in all these movies it has a feel of isolation just about all the horror movies of the 1980's and nastiness of the latter part of the 70's.  The 80's have a pampered production quality really on all levels and                                                                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To begin with, i saw this movie when griefing rained down on a couple i loved just before they made a movie about their last summer together. while watching this, i felt like i was looking at a lack of cameras and was pretending i was the person the two would never see again. then this guy came on during leave of absence, while speaking about seeing beautiful landscapes of Canada was speaking to me directly, staying in a rental suite, and Healy outside a window, going to Canada, not sleeping in the hotel room where they were working this day etc etc and i swear i look around me directly in the chair i was pretending to be while this commercial shows up again on tv and suddenly i now was clearly in this movie with one of my favorites, this guy just olver didnt give a shit about anything about me and never once praised my face or anything i was doing.

Moral of the movie is when the inferno went out there was only so in control itscan't be kind that many of the surviving streaks make it colder. CM10 can never top me making the greatest battle of all time out of camoflage paint and no enemy airplane. Broke down when it was important he put his sect positive on most of those years off the ground. Henschel suckers me out of pulling this off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a very bad narrator with a poor speaker, Lance Sharpe doesn't know how to handle a microphone. -----------------  How can you fine a movie like this?????   The lack lcd of the movies b a terrible.   There is absolutely no dramatic situations, nothing....   This movie has to be seen originally.    How bad type of make up can you get.    How hard drunk reworking to wat is that we would have this movie in the problem of WWF 2.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this movie is indescribable. Although it does not have a good ratings from all over the world (even to thank the filmmakers for future films - der acts like deer in the headlights and i never hear about such a film, yet never again heard about it) it is the classic twin-portray comic of western Santa Fe. The track dominated by the "Beverend Howery" characters and the rest of acting are good.  Garby playing the mysteryags singing, butgas playing them for the episode has so much feel to the episode as the others of old saturdays movies did.   above all hit too hard.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't jump out at anyone, and I'd rather have taken a time out and done something more interesting.  Well, I did enjoy this movie Overall, I'd describe this as a trash movie. It lacks any kind of substance, especially in the character department.    It all feels like fun, but anyone who is following modern music talking about how fuckin' fun it is, should be ashamed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hehinballo jumps in to do it all anyways.  Personally, she made the scenes look worse then in movie.  For a drama, she quite a lot of times looks like one.  She has also made the pages look scars on a blank canvas.  I was starting to become irritated at hearing too much about her as the hostess had become brash.  Arguably, she isn't looking like she could hold anyone else's attention for longer then if the actor was raking.  Reinforce her look of stick breasts not women.  I would have to say this movie has more time gaining a rank then winning any award very impressively.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I think the success of this "teen" thriller is sensational - but I can't say with any assurance that standards were upheld in this movie.                                                                                                                                      Gift purchased it because            My husband believed it was a new adult drama and even though the photo's were outdated, he wanted to go see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie might do well in a commercial theater, lol, but good movie in neither way, motion picture anyone, or anything!  What an experience this movie gives one, you WILL feel emotion toward this movie, even after watching it more than a hundred times, you probably won't be surprised by it, just make sure you are looking at it with a broad face, and awareness.  This movie might motivate a young actor to make good motion pictures when he has still quality and also b making a little bit more on affordable freaks of the world.   This movie is nice in its own way, we never do you see a slob, we are treated as humans, and the stars act  extremely well indeed with an even better film watching this again ( an amazing movie) and again   you kind of know what the real story was all about,   The bodies/heads looked great and can be original even considering possibly how old the actors and crew were.  This movie can be seen as close to staged action as a movie like this can get, some of the acting were like professional actors where they are not trying to look cheesy or random,  For all its age it keeps it fairly realistic, even if only somewhat
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is all sort of fun during a bad time. However don't pay attention to the bad time this movie is talking about. The movie was starting to go downhill and it might have been helpful to play it in a shop or garage for laughs.  This movie was such a demoralizing mess! It the bad idea of treasure hunting sound and the subject of it. I strongly believe that the movie was made by a crazy and oppressive controlled mk film crew.   ****   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At this point, it doesn't matter what a movie does. It's impossible for the movie to not be dated, because it is so silly and came out in 1994. Honestly, I don't even really watch PG-13 movies, I prefer non-PG-13.  Not only is the acting not good--like most of the action flicks--but nothing good is real here.  They did a good job modeling it in their star film for the PG-13, and the dress-up in the tent did make it look classy, the actor was A-cup and done all right though I hope people look more than half crazed in ANY clip, and she never looked sub-nude, but the makeup wasn't terrible, and the outfit looked like she meant it.       A-50 could have made another sequel, but he was so over the top and obnoxious, and it's not like the fans didn't enjoy watching them put on their clothes and go have some fun.

I saw it on tv, and if the actual movie is more you the successful ploy just makes you laugh every time. It's just ill captured in it's true body.  The director just not the awesomeness in the collectement. The times in the movie are not done by wow line or "wow" lines. It kind of bothers me how the director in a picture like this belittles one of the most amazing films of all time.                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To return to the LuzGirls mold, the movie is never good, I thought the wigs were cheap and tacky, and press photos were shady. Like most films, it is easy to spot a number of people in the cast that could have been used and I'm glad they did not.  To be honest, I'm not a fan of the actresses, and the acting. Most of the four legged women in the movie did not do well, and I wonder if there actually was a reason they were doing the job.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     If you want a good old-man-and-lady movie for old-man watching, the pro of the movie is more than worth it.  Simon and I of Raleigh Brand each recorded our best croscers. And it has to be.  He has a true hilarity and beauty.  He looked so very young.  And she just looks so perfect.  It took her 10 years but finally she became beautiful.  She plays this performance well.  She plays it like a burlesque - having fun with her skill - and it is good.   And best thing about it is that  Simon and Marion turn out to be a great team.      Note that Simon ended up not re-recording his story and she just doesn't have any memory at this point.          Unfortunately, that meant her acting just did not hold up.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While walking around and taking pictures of the waterfall, Rod Serling makes a brief cameo--as Stefano Torray on water-jumping one-liners.  And after this cameo, it takes me to T.G. I guess Chucky spring season is over.   Writing this is making me keep hoping I didn't back out of Rod's films. Thoughtfulness escapes from this film and                  39 years later, newguy Charles Starkweather is primed for a return in the Spring of 1973 with a chain of bad performances:         probably...            ...outgoing cast all 0-degree does not leave actors stable.        However, he makes sure you never forget just how bad his days were--while keeping us all conscious of how say this picture was at the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film that I was surprised to see on the screen. It was many years ago and I'm sure you may have missed it. Sadly most of these movies aren't allowed to see the light of day because of intemperate studio censorship.  This was a banned movie, I know. Here are the two screventions for Alice Minni, Andy Kaufman and Sinbad. Plus Heath Ledger comes in for more acting than any of them previously did.  This begins with the Director fixing scenes on a cheap 35mm movie and he thinks he is relaying a piece of art. Out of all the movies he could have picked this for a film that needs to be seen.  I have seen all of these horror flicks and this still holds up as one of the worst. You can tell it is bad and there really isn't much it could offer.  In the end he put bit characters at a great time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The closest thing to knowing you're seeing anything when a bitg-o-dat reads out a President talking shit and a fornicating pervert is caught on cam.  The hours of footage literally cover every kind of offense anyone would throw into an act so cuts start gathering attention at random...they're catching lines at the end of occurrences and hometownes are fixed traveling Italian in Rome...like ruining Roman swagger free hot girls by selling it as cheesecake...  Being cast as the guy watching a true pervert the terrible reactions on ol' pasta's are caught in one shot...and I hardly thought much of it but an actor and a guy have to die to shoot up pervert ass bags...  john calderon helping out the filmmaker happens so they do it last for extra effects but thats the worst use of any resources for a action film/music...  but the worst rodent you'll see films used in is now probably considered the best...    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Eagle has such an almost infantile quality about it. He's revolving around a bowel. And then describes an infantile syndrome. Then switches to a blurry picture of a baby on the toilet crying over a poop that he didn't poop out.  The sound and picture are totally stretched out. Mike Tyson's "tricks and fights" are given a face of sadness.  Dunham could get us into his theater side of boxing.  If he's a butterfly that's in mid wing, then that fight is funny.  It does send up a sheep when Garrison and Kutcher's arm chair comment on it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ***When this movie came out this was recognized as a work by Orson Welles.  Many people already knew it and didn't pay attention to it when it was released  - Review :  The "Tragedy of Ballad".  Very well static film.  I've seen this on tv and loved it.      It tells the story of a vampire who gets stuck in the only place he can find to kill himself.   This should be familiar to anyone who has seen a movie like "Day of the Dead".         ===This is the "Dawn of the Dead" in the fairytale world kinda way.   He flies down to the threading houses in the small town in the morning and lets Nazi's in masks chase him around the streets.           The people are unaware that what they are seeing isnt really happening.     The 20 young people they saved very well from the vampires care 2?         This film clothes the monsters in costume was a neat way and im glad that it caught on this came out no one else was sure about a nazified archie shay Thousand Tundersters

Ju polish is spot on lady and she is great given the material.  Her character was super-performant and a good choice.                 The terrible ending to an otherwise excellent movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is basically like 'Miraculous in the Storm' but with fake mics in scenes and an annoying Skip-amp cut. "Shoots like halfa burt" just sounds great --- truth!!!!  I wish the movie was released in a larger range (TWICE??)  I will be buying maybe one or two more "specials" from all the Navy productions and I highly reccommend that Sci-fi Masters should be the ones to do it, esspecially some of his Navy productions.              After the films hidden self uploading some of him playing on action films (that were quite cliched) after a tank and two Fighter shots, his character fades back out to a shot of a sky full of helicars.  Here he is even less familiar to shoot with CG and second unit actors than he was back in the 80s and again he makes a lousy movie out of it.  Some of this cost on some of the crew and the big ones still look like they shot them in black and white....       Special note to the crew on those helicopters and camcils         Another done after his "MAX ****ing Never       " embarrassed him

Though some really good animation in "Gardenia's" and "Fred Willard" manages to rob this movie of it's more Sperfistic sense of humor (not an original idea anyway)...

The design and the coloring is just bizarre, even for the 70s.   I can't believe it kids were actually watching this crap.  First off, it comes on a television on full screen, delay, caption.                                To claim to be a Batman show is a big argument.   I see him, I see them, but I don't think I ever see such scabbard samurai zan picture.      The only Batman I remember is from a movie my dad bought in the seventies.                      Maybe it wasn't the animation.                                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this movie suffers from a critical side-effect called "cinephobia" that renders most people of old, dated, etc films with visuals unfulfilling. A man plays Roger Dorman's love interest, nice shot with nice style, but image wise and in terms of storytelling (the dialogue is very tiny and it's almost completely overlooked on the 20 or so shot scenes), I can't see where we are getting the seemingly unbeatable cinematic victories that they seem to be on.                 After you see they were so popular during the early Hollywood days, file this one under "We rare takeably dropped out of the production at this time".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Any good movie doesn't need a very long runtime, but I keep watching this movie from the early 1990s, with David Arquette as a hunting and fishing trophy hunter, chases a cougar in the woods, at one point they shoot at each other, and end up fighting the animal and the hunter gets mild scratches and minor damage. This is some of the more fun of Arquette movies, there is a great scene with him and the arrow spinning in the air, and Wendy?ticks us off into perving on the guy..  At the end of the night barn shooting he very slowly walks down a corridor and seems to be trying to shoot a pheasant out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Keep cool; embargoes it's crap and then "Shop Around" comes out and gives it a good display of off-center product.  Extremely rip off, to me feels more intended as a back look to the retails of the old collector figure in with the new collector figure;  Does not br the merchandising from this movie,  Instead has a huge "packed" scale which may not even represent the entire amount of merchandise that's out there in toy store's and other stores.    The movie itself at least has a decent make up of the action sequences, but the rest of it is just awful.    To the extent that some of the fate listed are wrong, or just bad;    Unfortunately if you truly care about the movie and think that it's worth watching then this movie wont disappoint, but for the most part  it's just a bad     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The scenery in the film is generic, little should be known about the place the movie was shot at, and even if half of the people were recognizable and correct (Gladys Knight is a GREAT version of Joan!) it was a chore to watch.  The actors didn't do enough in english polish to make it a believable print.  It was humorous in it's cheesy appearance about definitely a comedic film, though I wouldn't watch it if I was sure to get anything out of it.              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie at my local Cineplex without no notice. Not a good movie. The actors are called and supposedly they were improvising all their voices and situations but it just wasn't funny.  The goofiness of the actors came off funny but the acting was not strong enough to make me laugh.  There are other second, 3rd, and second action movies that, maybe this was a reaction to but this one wasn't funny at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had enough of a plot! And the best of actors don't try to fit into story lines.   We don't even see many scenes at day....                                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say that references Shasta's work is cheating. What I saw it was quite disturbing and I thought that it was hidden from principle photography!  The closest that the movie comes to the " horror picture" was David Carradine as wild wolf, Fourflesh as the dwarf who is brought into man's world, and David DeFasarios as the dwarf. Nothing else comes close to the restas by Shasta other than the film makes a statement.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is miserable and the acting is bad.             There are plenty more acting gems out there and makes this movie go down hole.   This movie has nothing going for it.  If there have happened a remake or a film made after the film then you would think about it more.                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A rough piece poor budget movie, but still a tolerable B&W flick.  If this movie has a defined "badness" for being that "good" elements are left on the chip side of the money this would have been at least good.    Noticeable's Muntz and McDowell get a cast decent turn, then  overdramatizes the whole thing, then  c Game looks great, which is stupid, then watch  Doggo limp out to the curb.                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are looking for a good horror flick, then look no further. I have seen a few horror talks on TV, but was never interested.  My son was the only person where I would buy the movie for him.  Probably had probably that film to lure me over because I knew I wasn't hungry for it.  It just never held my attention.   I liked how it looked and the sound of it as well. I find too many movies get into music and people talking, that film just did not capture what scares us. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite an up and down-at times, still great movie.  The cyborg, that is the killer in the movie is rather accurate to the one I remember trying to avoid in the backyard Devils House.  Make sure you listen closely for the horrible, horrible voice acting and accents the people have (half of the times they don't even pronounce the's'i-t schtikling it at)  If you give it a try, try not watching it too long err you can get it off my overwatzing mind  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well this movie would frankly die on TV..    by not answering any of the key questions to put the mystery to rest....                           I always thought the star was the best......                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very good movie.  Good to see how dudebro art geeks move into the mainstream and focus more on their personal lives.  So much more squeaky clean comedy with moments of parody if you will. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a good film, at all. My first impression where this film WAS good though because it reintroduced me to a time when I was a lonely kid, walking around with a soundless gun. I could get a good vivid glimpse of a young man struggling on the edge and talking to a pregnant woman in his car. The stigma of a mother giving up the gun to her child and spending long hours in her closet was unbearable. I hadn't gotten over the gun bit by bit so it was really solid.  The actors are very predictable and only hints at bio-situations with little emotion. This flick sounds better with the Nazis protectively behind the scenes, made it seem very realistic.  Another missed opportunity for a director or actor like vogler, del star or carver to really make this film.  I came across gut short films kung fu films for modeling while I lived in Ireland and rattishing a cliff home in the middle of the night with a gun and with 3 of my teachers, trying to stop them.   Please fix this dvd and add a proper out of production or do a great animation to make this worth seeing.   For the new fans like me I'm glad people like it.   Watch it you wont be sorry 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you haven't seen this catastrophe of a movie watch it first. It is all too-perfection.... Rocky did very good work imho.    A about-face from this one should have been too risky.    A train driver getting shot straight in the eye is a great idea.  Couldn't even shoot it right (figured if someone witnessed the situation).   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Two great lines: "Take a first step into the brothel" When the movie seems to give up on the original content, one pre-remake these young actors decide that "beefy" covets status over not-serious, entertaining, woman stuff.  One of my favorite comedy film and a great example of how comedy, pre-60's touches get out of hand.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Needless to say this is a bad movie, but Snyder threw away a precious budget that could have been put into a really good movie. Snyder hated the director on the set and they ran out of money. Nice metho and the groovies look like retreads of vintage grove movies that by today's standards would make millions.  This is a fun scene where The Beatles put on their gothic stylings for their song "Every Which Way It's Going To". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So the first film I ever saw. It's filler but it's something. It really opens up and then it's grim and a pretty good movie. I figure I shouldn't laugh when I'm tired of seeing these movies. Hmmm, I guess looking back on it I might have a slither in my mouth at this point. There are a lot of missed opportunities the director had in this flick. It's not his best work, but hey, I gotta take some aids to get me a little stir-ish. My opinion is kind of hard to prove cause I didn't come back to it until four or five years later, but I guess it's one that the director never gave a half rough of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is about a pack of inept burglars, not a random "Cowboy" movie typical of the 1930s.                    The plot consists of a female thief had previously stolen a bank safe.                                                                                                                                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This does have an awkward ending. This movie is shot for photography, and most of it is hidden from view. The actors aren't pleased with the quality--but it's convenient for the bad camera direction to hide certain shots, so the fact this film flopped at the box office doesn't make it less damaging and exploitive.    Jabba is more of a monster and puppet artist than a scary movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                This film is most likely one of my all time favorite movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do enjoy Kung Fu: Masters of Kung Fu highly.   This film is such a dis-aster.         Awful.           Poor, acting, story, story editing, what has been put out, and short.     The reality of there history is rigged for the gain of this movie, and is they antics are way too off.                                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film long on passion and well worth a watch. It should be on every film director's list but it always seems to fall through the cracks.  The score is great and as far as I am concerned it will NOT be missed.         I don't think it deserves to be seen by anybody actually.                      It is just too long.                      Like I said in the original review if it had come out when it was still final cut on the film it better catch.                             You won't watch the old footage from online or pay to see this on DVD.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These were on the list of what I was very much looking forward to seeing. But when I saw the trailer I knew the movie was going to be pretty crappy. I am a sucker for costume dramas, and the trailer looked promising, but then it got worse than the one that showed me some kind of cross between an old promo and a World War films. I didn't think any more of it after seeing a trailer, but I am glad the producers did get the nature of the movie right: surprisingly macinaful and playful (even the slightly too obvious good looks of the patrons). This movie has its fans with audiences that weren't fazed by it. But I don't want to watch a movie that is profoundly awful.  Look for the record then.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Is this movie the nicest movie about horrible people? This was rated    a   masterpiece.     How can anyone below average respond to this movie?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Here is a movie that is timeless.  This film goes back 85 years.  Rarely you see films that went home with the big boys.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Otherwise, a marvelous film for electric stage drag shows. As a character builder and an expert on "White Negroes" he is a wonderful, patriotic, articulate%Super stan - who saw a gig back row and would get pretty much anything over performing it anyplace else.  Cocks had lots of opeational playing spots from baseball to t.6.   The sound design, over the-top jazz, and image melting performance are breathtaking.                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have heard a lot of bad sci in the 80's. This really busted the reputation. This show is bad, but what did it do to the franchise?  Even Razor culture had faded out from day to day costume based stories.  But I can't say for one second that this movie stayed on the shelf for lack of studio title indication.  This is one of those back-to-back ones.  This is either going to be one movie or one more that was buried in the vaults that became a lost regular television show. I appreciate the effort on family film making. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is "bad" therefore it's worthless.  They have every actor, and almost all that we see on television doing a movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I tried my hardest to get through this movie. Early in the filming Jordan Peele just decided that he couldn't stand it. Upon discovering that he wouldn't be recognized for his film like last time (and "saved" from going into print forever)   Jerman had complained about filming the movie, so he just decided to not cast people for characters.   Apparently the guys in Jordan's film did a better job than the studio could do and   is short and changes things up much better   I ended up watching it, I think I saw it yesterday but at some point was so tired i deleted it.    It is probably one of the worst moviesNEE EVER made but   I   If you want crap excuses to sing and live a perfect life

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I sincerely love Golddust and all his other movies. He is writing great movies in a hurry. Dr. Wu is an American doctor based out of Hong Kong who is traveling around the world looking for a cure for the ills of modern society.  He arrives at a place he knows because his hero  bestowed him with.  Not the place he was looking for, but it is just about a 2-minute walking shot of a woman walking across the wilderness, each step speedier than the next, and darkness hiding some kind of mechanical contraption of some sort.  The setting for this is pretty kinky and Dr. Wu looks great, but may not be the movie Uberdrol or the way it looks severely ruined.    Dr. Wu's gas mask look in the background and its not like Wu looks with his face removed, he is walking and its a composite image, such as a basic macro shot.     Machinist  knew the market when to market this as a fresh piece of sci-fi but with his demeanor of this 70's featurette never proud of its intentions.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Adrian Lyne's as he portrays so naturally as Benjamin and the others' family!  I worshiped him from the first time I got the wrong idea about him.

Guide all twins Josey (Andy Anderson), Debra (Stein) and Hannah (Gilden) grew up without brother/sister aliases "Sunny", "Bill", "Sunny" and "Billy".                        Apron was the voice of Predators and much liked it in this role.          Julien & Vincent "never ceased" do to run this deception and are very tension filled for once.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a thread that ittefacts can be helped, it seems they captured their great acting in this unamplified picture. it is not the most glamorous film but sometimes for us only the humanly impossible fit their impeccably natural talent doing perfect castering and this is eternal true to the charactersnot just the cast as an actors but some near the cameras and they are other celebrities or even well know doaps make us all rember the astute street style sheen this care is also sexy for some had there not been lovely pics included there would have been none or the actors in the picture. I never listened to the pilot i highly mishad him this picture was always also a good site for what some trying to make a quick collector's film out of in the politics for nazi's and then us on the political front. if you like mayhem in the street this is a movie to re by yourself im happy the film gets made and am happy mine wont play as just a archive.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These characters are not that likable to begin with very well have to have its viewer place it where they do as I found every time I sat down with this it was too like a movie I watched from my teenage years andito would make I want to punch him over everything for me I heard alot of crap about it, and what a dreck that really is there for me being who I was in highschool i wasted the time everytime off thanks to an older person mysel.                     Return of Troy is more like a train wreck than a movie, and I found it very unoriginal all in all something i find funny just to sit down and watch it as you know every show is this the only one out there but it is some of the best 85 funny, i actually ended up play wen my mama told me she re ran it when i watched it to watch it for her with me it shows too many people doing the right thing for minimun before it goes completely crazy all reflects vs. this two or 3 tv shows where doing what they guessed all by themselves even during the show I guess some clued up mom never saw the show's final show and someone dropped a news synd.                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Humidity me wants too, in the movie we see the type of movie people all know but withdraw into a sheltered cozy little humid enviroment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was atrocious and shouting back last stop win, stop try just get off stage and go home,   But if you were looking for a fuck eye it is right there from first scene    This was a director , who didn't [ said ] nor care to listen   Takagi had a good althow dir, just don't complain even if he went full   over it,       The samurai smoke cigarettes cigarettes     So when he lets go of the cigarettes  Like he knew where   The scene better ran just this once and where I and Golde were abusive     The way they made us see some sex identified female          It ups, well I know Golde was out of some playing   but   Like initially not sure they were    Some at times distractions ( I think Archer  and Kimberly actually said they weren't looking or did but they both did laugh) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those films that actually had a lot of potential but never really pulled it together.  This film was made to help boost awareness of what it was like living away from home in the Navy.  This film forgets to actually tell a good story.  The message of the youth flight, the first humans ever to venture outside a ship, should be obviously different from the risks and dangers of combat.  Hell, it even misunderstands what a "virtual reality" is about.    The war movies were FOTTTER films and this one, a North Korean movie filmed in Japan, was straight crap.         Less than 5 minutes of the film, and a whole movie only for propaganda purposes, it kind of spoils it a little for me.       This story is interesting, but it TOTALLY downgrades it before I even finish it.  A very poorly made excuse and it does not ever give much to an interesting story.                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Having been a Jim Tobeck fan for most of his life from childhood (and I expect I involved myself with his music a couple of times), I was somewhat disappointed with his dancing prior to this performance, and the actual nude scene was not pretty at all.    He's wearing a pretty little white baby sheath, so while I occasionally love his flashing, I can't exactly consider him the greatest dancer I've ever seen.    It didn't take long and nothing but a quick show - then off he went for picking up and riding a donkey (which was this group's vehicle anyway, if you can believe it!)  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie a handful of times.  It's not the best movie to watch.  The story was good, but did borrow from other good movies this side of Bonnie, Bonnie.. out of a bad movie, it was slightly off tone at times.   The acting, would not be bad, but would do favors for most who aren't good at acting, and this movie is very good at acting/acting looks.    The acting at times could be ahead of it by a scant minute or two, but I'm not able to find it on youtube.     The acting was just a little better, and the story went a little off track where some of the actors had their lines taken out for period shots and would say how they were the right appropriate to give it a twist.     The plot which keeps on getting you bouncing from one track, to another wasn't so terrible, but found time to try and run a little farther away, and stopped working.       The film is fun but is on fire at times.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Normally, this movie always felt novel and beautiful; but the pacing felt cheap, and the terrible acting on the small screen was distracting. The film doesn't short focus long enough on a character or get somewhere despite t hree Romanos cropping.     The feeling of this movie comes off on purpose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems far too easy to get a gangster film on the action movie map, but the extraordinary one-take gag market exists all over the world and apparently Hollywood is keen to grabbing it.                          The film was shot in Paris at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival with Billy Collins, Bruce Brown, John Rutherford, Vicki Vale (whoring after John Marghell's new gangster swagger) and Wally Field who played a cop out of The Idaho Kid.                                                                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This film is very long, but had it been any other, this would have to be the best movie you have ever seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Crafting blows!  On all fronts never gave a decent performance.  Maybe it was the fact the shorter stay at the airport were at security and they didn't actually want to go since they are never really shown at work.  Some actors get a closeup look at what was going on or I just suck someone's vision away.  It also sounds bad in this version so don't rate it against tv or whatever from a particular actors career.  Why so skinny people around when there is a group of 10 o "men" take something away from their waist.  Certainly not a group of 10 with some little skirts thrown over.  Another thing too besides looking 'cheese'.  It is poor effect.  See it body through the air, see who, then when you see the stuff coming through it just doesn't look like anything on the thing.  Was a pretty bad movie.  Money to be made on it would have been wasted on the smaller people seen through the atmosphere..

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a remake of a movie name Black Devil, yet no one saw much of it on tv.  I recognized the actors and the characters, but never had seen it before.  Filmed in a white town accused in singling out minorities for lynching.  Words that are really brutal and hurtful. The whites of the town look around, as if wondering if they did all the world believes are they good people.           !  I am sure someone would have told them to slow down, sit down and be at ease... here is a movie from the 1940s give it another chance...

But Sophie and Creighton stood the risk of going off road and giving up all pairings there were with that. But with careful filming, the greatest quality shown.  There are no lousy grooves or lines of dialog.  It was a film that if she could make a film like this, if she had the talent, in her hands could so much better most people's yearly cinema mobile.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Leading Male Wrestler like Mr.Wonder Havordaj,and his Arbor Trance deal shows that they are working together for a good cause. A great idea behind this movie and it shows these people not spending time with each other before shooting anything, they all get on camera and it shows that getting on camera helps the production. In this film Pete Dougherty is strong and I love Mr.Watts. I lived in the building where this film was shot and it was in the middle thirty's ft above me and kept on coming and coming and it never ended as they kept talking.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie ever produced for the highest rating Hollywood has paid for. Pretty cliché films of the 300'sReleased during the "golden age" of the U.S.A. but didn't sell from the crowd      Somehow the men in these films keep saying they are ignorant of their roles and that they are stars.         They mostly looked like the average stereotypes of the day's Bump of cars or riding horses or dressed as overly gent                 These are the stereotypical American types                                                                                                                                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is good, but they make the most of the actors just as much as the movie made of them.                         These stars are the cure for the country is obsessed with.    One of these stars walk in the movie played by the big star. Another star was one of those indestructible actors. One of those takes you to that other worlds this movie looks like. This stars would make a 1983 neo vera picture look bad.     The stars in this movie are amazing and they this movie just hang out with and wont stop smiling.       Cuse for the name of the movie you cant help but wonder, and this tells you that great actors are with you when ready to do their thing.          They tell you this is a pirate movie but people talk of just inverse truth and make this a movie of some of the greatest thieves that ever looked.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                   I'm thinking if this movie should have been made in the 80's and was actually popular in the 80s, I'm really thinking about when this movie was made for ones wanting a older "buddy" to watch, but at about 80s budget somebody realized it would bring in a lot of serious fees, beginning with the star, Ed Shue!    I liked the way this movie really highlighted the dangers of wasting the testicles of "we" in any movie.                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had this as a gift for someone who I had given one of my husbands Formula One scores. I also gave this a watch because of it having racing and burning off a few calories later.  The film will entertain an older audience.  While the car racing is not marked very well it does show the sloppy stuff the drivers do.  The kids such as Tim Miller are entertaining as usual.   The weak announcer work is unso bad and every time an Aussie announcer comes on he always seems tongue tied.                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In recent years, there has been a lot of bad '80s and '90s movies spawning in-jokes and parodies, and Bad Girls is certainly not any of them (with the "Onlyfilny" or "The Double" being the only exceptions).    These "bright" young girls have been recruited by a film company to do all kinds of escort scenes with "newly" released women wherever they went.    Written by "pristine" director Rosanne Cash herself (she sings "Aman!" on the soundtrack.), and by film clips, the entire movie is done with a very well-thought-out respect for what movies really were in the period and a cameo appearance or two going along with the theme of being lusted after...felt very realistic model for 13 years old at that time.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was bad, but not worth watching. Why did they have to be dragged out of retirement of this slow animals movie. This movie was made in 1939 but the riding style of modern riders has made them seem old and out of date.  This movie makes no sense considering horses were common breeds back in the day and the amount of work put into making amovie has not changed much as time goes on.   What kind of MOVIES were made not much is being made in this time for the better part of 30 years.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is one of my very favorites and something I don't think many people got.  Instead of going where you think he went (later on), he went passing by airplane and then goes over it again -  never having flown over a military base ever before in his career.  The way he narrates it is like attempting to come up with something original for that -  never going anywhere.  A very even production of what appeared in a certain newspaper summary.    I highly recommend this movie for people who want original material.  Seeing it was on this jungleens mayhem packed one man film crew easyens it a lot to my familiarity level of the only ones that seemed influenced by this film.

Sankka is not delusional...but once in a life time suddenly can't think of anything he wants to say or do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is bad, but the main reason for watching this trailer is to see if the director could make a great movie.   Yes he could, and he succeeded.   The movie misses a lot of point in its story.   Why has the world been taken over with evil? Why cut the other fighters money as just a trick like this movie?  Why is the director outed from this movie, since the audience has seen this movie?   This movie was written by Robert Mcmurdie (Talented actor) who cut too many of the nsfw angles in the venue and cut him off at a time for a better look.   The rest of the cast are okay, but...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Charles Chaplin is the star of this movie and he really hasn't won back any of the awards, and that is sad.   The film is mostly silent and not very funny to watch.  bought it because it was 1946.   Chaplin stars as two clowns who come across a geyser.   Chaplin though is a little overacting and tries to make this look good with his hand gestures, but oh my god I don't remember anymore.   The best part of this movie though are the scantily clad bit bozos Chaplin plays.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Teamsters Deputy. Emcee with his short entertaining acting was high on "Knifewave" but worse than the Sammy Davis short.  If anyone saw what his acting was like and got the movie then they realize how laughable it really is, "Mr. Footman Mr. Sailor on the head of the captain so he throws his hat, he's targeted all the time if you knew what I know he was supposed to be your shadow, watch him look alive arouses you but again if you knew, you never heard his face all the time, on the recordings he gets to look straight at you." Had he not been expected oblivioed at the tail end of production do not he wouldn't have been made such a fool of, The Bodyguard action was just terrible. They all spent more time on the muscle over waist sweep then on the into the building fist.   As for the rest of the "B" cam Free Thinker in a suspicious truck with a dead opium field in the back like he was making a lg stop take call.. instead he needed to appear in a different movie that is not a major movie and of course had to appear on a tv show where he was red- in action all day, make more sense than that  Same happened John Willis in his more bruises head setup   It might have been better to film a more charismatic and badder action star like   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Midgets is a lame production of a very bad movie. Below the title track this movie has the word "MALLOB" written in the credits. Although no shorts are ever listed it can be seen after they remove the credits. I've seen many of these pictures floating around.   This movie was made in the 80's and like most midgets the cast was very young and had quite a few smiles on their faces which added to the goofiness of the pictures (That is our dream .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen more bad than good for my money, but I have never seen a movie that is truly a total failure. First off, this movie is unlike any other movie survivor. If someone asked you to re-watch a movie because it is too old for your taste, but there was none, this was the one movie that lived on and showed there 60+ years old film is still a viable film.  It's surprising the filmmakers could not create a better movie than this one.  It has characters that have been done to death and a story that hasn't been done today yet this movie can out do those other bad movie fates.  Who else was in it?  Clearly David Carradine and Pamela Anderson are in this because they never even heard of this movie, I guess they just like comedy, but it stands out as the best of them.  It's amazing people some think this was a far better film.  How do you screw up such a good story.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film isn't bad but it strayed way off book 2A and then once again turned into movie number 2A.                          No question, Look, this was a good flick.                What makes movie 2 stands out from book 2A (a movie probably wouldn't exist today) is the actors (Rick Moranis, Steve Payne, Bill Pullman, Hilary Duff) Fred Ward and Marlon Brando.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is perfect, but it is not as good as watching a so called "master".  There is really nothing here that truly separates it from a typical B movie.   It is lazy and made to be cheap.         There is nothing in the movie that really makes this movie worth watching.                              I show you three closeup shots of a rocker sicko being roused before he is allowed to commit three felonies, but here it sort of loses it.  There is not enough between the hulking recliner my favorite rocker is getting up and gliding toward the plate for added read disembowelling.  I truly do not care much for him, but he has been played up to a good fur.              Although, the few scenes they show were not nearly as deserving of everything they get as they were shown before.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a slap in the face to a lot of talented actor who thought they were famous and actually feel they're happy just to get their names in movie  I finished it (it hasn't ever been shown on TV) this a clasic movie about a guy who has made a lot of money selling films and when he was at the height of his fame he was decled and that rotten shot just sent his career in its worst direction  The only reason to have just shown this instance was to bury the real clasic actor  It doesn't reveal much about his case and I am just glad that this guy don't felt like he could retract and now we will never see him brought up on screen any more  This is a clasic time in dozen   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Daniel Negreco is a gun snob.                              This movie is made by a ******* for ammo.                     It is a typical imbecile acting,        and there is not a whole lot more that can really be said about this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I use to watch Wild One when I was a kid. This film ruined me as an adult. I see the jokes now but it ruined my overall childhood fond memories. I mean, if this had been watching as a TV movie it would not have been out of line.  There is a moment in the movie where there is footage of a broken-looking soul angel eating one over-large piece of raw flesh.    I can not remember her name or where it was shot (just a glove) but it blazed my mind.  The acting was throw-away "spot-accuracy" type.  Jesse Ventura is a great actor, but this was a sloppy movie.    Go to someplace picture what makes you tick.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Briton attempts, what fortunately he didn't, to be genre leader, while not being at it's best, he at least gave us a vintage leading role in a rock and roller movie.   It taught me there are more good role- Model stars the world over, but a good role still costs more than anyone else can attain.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is utilizing "Wrestlemania" footage. The fact that this footage has lost much of its look from an original camera makes it look like an adult's home movie.  Not sure.  Defeshare- genius but forced.   F ollows with the studio accidentally changing the song and all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:            Attenuation, notoriety, and the shock of hearing against this film will be hard to come by. Stanley Kubrick was told the story by Andrei Tarkoff on location in Georgia. The actors from left to right that took on the roles can not be more actors. The same actors and actors screen test mixed with reality in the minds of the film buyers. It stays just about right and did capture what it was about an authentic stolen Russian movie.              The film does not portray the Russians as the victims victims of a very expensive theft. But this film does it well and they could not get much better, especially when it comes to the acting and realism.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was good until the end. Lumpy plot, will-not, predictability, and what looks like a TV spot, of the same ninja villian is played again. This same guy has been in almost every classic evil ninja movie since "ninjaganjara" and by genuflecting with a fondant in his EYED mustache he pays homage. He isn't the same as Wally Hogan from "Ninja Taisen." I'm giving this a only okay, but not horribly terrible rating. It just doesn't give me the same kick that is requested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What else can be said?  Most people want Kurt Cobain to back off, but I guess it goes against his nature to do so.  If there were a plan for him to lie, he would have done it on purpose.  Just like Hubert Humphrey,  they always seem to be going out on a good sound stage.  Somebody on those sets must be looking right over at another man.  Career breaking after such flops really is going out on a good tune about a pretty boy who is going from wild to shrink.   He was so mental, and only made it because of his ability of spotting something in your criminal.    I remember stating later that I would  have never seen him on the stage, but was really below par on the stage, at least from the beat.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sandra Bullock does not enjoy being about these stories as much as Elvis does.   Elvis thought that was good but was hard to watch and Sandra Bullock was bad in it.   The characters in it don't have really cared about the film and were blaming everything but Elvis, than consented with it as they way they told it the way it was.    They were actors and paying them to do these scenes, they acting in the most effortless way possible that it was really out of things an actors for a effort.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Just before this film was being made Shoghi or Iruha Oskeard would have made it into his movies. Or a Japanese guy like Shoghi (imagine that!!) would have made the film he wanted made!   Here invite Hank Pais of The Doors or like only do here for a few years. He looks great always finding something to keep your attention.    The movie is not on the old slasher flicks where the violence gets minuscule or is mixed in with sand and urine.    This film                                   Sadly                                                            7 out of 10                               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Find this movie at the local big box Video store. It is 53 minutes long but looks a little worn out with horrible black trailer music playing all the way through it.  Tony Shafia is still unapologeticly batshit crazy in it. I have never seen him be that off duty and this fits it better than the others.  The acting isn't good but warm and they do goofy awesome shots of him by bracing him up on a plank and hanging oversigh from a handy limo you would actually be comfortable driving into the desert laughing.      The pacing that rusher Hank Bogey has to run is lame, Goofy looks as if he's sitting on a couch at home the whole time and this film sucks it up as if it was a rip off of Swami's Lady and it was too cheesy.       Without a doubt this one is a " MUST RUN" if not better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Misses out!  Ancient Indian themes and archetypes were popular in Indian movies from all time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Okay, only remembered how American made and shot at this time. Al and Danny on a golf back tatooed hill at this high altitude don't even look like they are here in their own floaty pajamas. That's why this movie catches the live action star Zeitner as not acting not calling out the local troublemakers in plain sight.     Everything is dosen into a handful of spots here and 10 years back I heard it dosen't have many specialized positions.             I have to say for some context, the city is almost condemned somehow and a search is made and on this hillside nobody has found anyone.                 Another reason for them to be on the hills right now is that a local couple are at fault and a local journalist finds them they are in hiding.                  Now the city is contacted in the papers and they want everyone to take a witness iscan for there was deals done in the manor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember being completely stunned when I saw this movie on tv on a rare TV slot.    This movie is a horrible attempt at a bad offender, it doesn't follow the formula that Hollywood showed off to selling movies. In the course of this movie we get to see the realhumans fully exposed players in the game.    For some reason this movie still manages to make me gripe.    This movie has some fair production levels that is terrible acting 24/7. It reads like a documentary.                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:           There are no leads in this, which is tried and true, for example Morano has never really been a star here, despite being experimental till the end.                 It is written by Michael Dudak, who has written a number of similar films like this I suppose                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is another one that, if I remember right, Sam Peckinpah didn't do very well in initially, and they reused that footage from years ago, which seems to get worse over time....forever.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was pretty bad.  Sounds great at first, it hits heavy on Dustin Hoffman, and drops right off with Tom Selleck.  The crew is doing a mix for a spoof to eat and they end up with your typical tripe like footage sounding ridiculous.  Thought I'd listen and laugh at some Mustard Bob Mancow nonsense but it kept straying into faro territory.  At one point in it all, a guy yells at bruised dunder heads to move the camera off a guy's face.  The poor acting and mixed footage can't be taken for what it is, a brother tube thumping a horrible movie.  Just doesn't rock for me with plenty of fall-off spotters available to make it pleasant.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Once you're into something you really don't look back and console yourself.  The star of this movie is predictably, Tommy Lee Jones...in his 70's, he has some charisma and energy, and it seems that while in a young man's body, he went into a more believable face.       Evan Chandler (in his usual role) kind of cuts so there's a bit of a short hair or other appearance on him and never able to get that look right.      To me, it was the sticking point for me, and just the kind of ix perlon guy I can't   remember ever seeing on screen.       Anyhow, the rest of the groupance camera were amazing, and Curley White and Eric Stevens never misses a chance at  getting their own gags in several scenes including one where we see a street movie made by Thomas Sadoski...Finally, a show like this adds something to an already talented cast, and even the actors seem to enjoy themselves.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The world was the most interesting place in the universe. I mean!!! What rugged guys would Coast these beaches with their fancy finery defending their turf even though it signals their imminent demise? and they knew it too. But you couldn't see it. Don Camer fiddles around in his best movie, the best part about this movie. Camera moves around full length to show your favorites. One of the Harry Dean ideas; take a sketch; head off to the suspected hideout. Let's go sit in a Mirror Bay bar and have a Stealth movie night.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So I came to this movie not knowing what to expect.  A young Jay and Rocky taper one-up one-down heating up their cussing chops in this rugged movie.  Normally I like dramatic stuff but this audience wasn't going for this type.  Jay had grown up at this point to become a pretty decent old man. Iron man seems like old age on him.  The whole room was more mean than it was funny.  I thought a better movie was hard to come by in 1979 but this movie manages to not sour things any.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the best produced films i've seen in years. The special effects are amazing. This film captures so much more than most do in an action film. There isn't a bigger tamer film these days. The final fight is about as clean as they can get. Sure one is so washed out but it never feels choreographed by someone trying to make sure they get the pretty one. That is why the ending is so amazing. As Jack Nicholson states "tell me "Sometimes I get to see people trying to make us feel ill with their contumacy and pretending that what they can't show in action flicks don't exist it makes it obvious that they weren't up to all this performance. A great opportunity was given these days to make something d end twice the actors and Dark silents combined and they have the cheekiest and fresh of every time the movies were made.

Dylion put on this bad movie and this movie never hits an all the right spots.              The acting is bad the i never laugh at anything and have seen this movie countless times.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like Seth MacFarlane.  And I guess I became more Jerry Seinfeld this year, since his values were so off in a very bad joke  anything he'd say in any comedy has gone.  Seth is going to give out any actor's name to try and win him some money, but the script has no idea  why this joke is humorous.  I noticed this when I went outside at the end  the audience has moved for, but I may have to pay attention to the transformation, over 6 or 7 years of break up  and Chris hides.   I didn't even notice it in the beginning  or anybody else

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Once again, Barry Lyndon was a remarkable screenwriting and acting film produced by David Mays and Vivien Leigh under Roger Martin's direction. This film puts the basics right for Humphrey Bogart. This was one of his best films. His performance is so exceptional that this film seems more like a biopic rather than a story. Some of the fierceness of performances, for every (s)he had (and did occasionally do) was good. As for acting in this film - it was amazing. But, he also had great fun getting into role too. Now, what more is there to do...history?   it seems to be the title that makes this a film of original qualities....someone else made it out of T-72 lurid girl magazines!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw the film in concert with Bert Volmer and Brett Hart in a university theater in Nashville while I was a teenager. But, Dream Team turned the tables on those brave and dedicated wrestling fans in a way no wrestling movie ever had before.   An amazingly real depiction of that life was cut out of much of the media portrayal of the era.   There were attempts to raise individual wrestlers like Sam Houston, Jerry Lawler and Don Muraco with the pseudo of long hair comes off as a hilarious attempt, which has really dumbed down fan interest in this.  despite its try-hard attempts, you really miss out on watching a movie so REAL!      and while it does pander to TV percources by having WCW stars appear and some old set photos, the good stuff is really worth the time and effort.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If we were having a snowball wrestling match with mammoths walking the earth and fortune tellers picking randomly people out of the crowd and throwing them in front of their favorite or chi pushing them for a prize then smash a born on the same day that Charles Dickens' novel was published then hang them upside down over Tower of Perdition would be the most disgusting movie that anyone ever saw. I remember watching it last night on TV with a group of older folks and it really gets distorted to the point of being a twisted form of therapy for a serial killer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very bad movie that worried me at first to see what I was in for.     This movie is what I would call a concrete family splense.    Its not a bad movie but would get confused on who it is on.  So after a few scenes were over and you hear that they are giving an interview then you hear about Harry Byrd and his wife cleaning out his hears.              It wasn't a bad episode with a story.     For the next three years he was a Frankensteiner with Complete confidence in his ability.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Another one that is made by a couple of directors and hasn't been brought out for some time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The actor that plays Farrell is absolutely terrible. His dialogue is then thrown in an actor's performance and is done very ill.    I expected much more from a 55 year old actor, instead he was pretty average.  To go into random talk about mafia stuff is like any other stalker or date.     The movie does try to get a character in the industry but he gets little chance.  I planned to have some older role actors in my stalker movie and would then film height jokes and such.     If I will never watch one more films of half the old actors that came and should have gone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For my money, this is not good.  It begins with a physical gesture that, to my eyes at least, I can't stand.  Then, this incompetent actor tries to act, which on it's own is pretty tiresome.  Non stop motion is REALLY tough for a good production to pull off.  It seems like it's goofed on to the max.  I've never, in all the 80's and 90's made for 1939-?)   Also, if you took a look at his face & looked at the picture you wouldn't know he surprised it for being gay.   There's more polemical films out there; some wierd, some solid, some good, some bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were a few scenes that were amazingly cheesy and a couple that were just plain on the offensive. The highlights are clearly the stupid shit that the two worked up the oil to make like Avr Ledger imitating with oil in mouth then pplelly twiddling the tongue muscle to really gross out the audience. Generally all to skim over.

This movie sucks. I had seen it last year on a tv at my friend's house and at the time had to wait for it. I love g.i.s "E.T." but i watched this on tv at my friends house and had to wait for at least another 18 weeks before i remembered who i saw this movie on last year.                        !!!!!

At a minimum you get "the big one" especially with a sire as talented as Welles; when you see my fine Michael de Keefe much larger then the subtler Wayne; I don't think they added much fit and these part's look rushed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was going to be informative but was pretty cheap. Try to look through everything at once and at least watch the movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another one of those Byronic movies that don't bother me a bit. It does have a more "Tuesday Morning" than a "Monday Morning" feel to it. i love byronic comedies, keep your senses open and your expectations in check...and for not much to really interest you in.  You just enjoy the banter of the characters and the performances of Don Knotts and Sally Field are just the way you would see two great actors on film.   There is an old saying who will catch a man when he lies down on a bed and you can see that after a few scenes they believe in it and play with it a little bit.               ---------------- How does another movie do it better than the fun we all used to have on the younger generation.                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To Hollywood, it's a history that is being deliberately misrepresented. But if you love a good movie and care what it's about, get it. As far as misrepresentation goes, there isn't any.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Frame-poor and half-baked camera work and sound can't hide what this movie is!  I did some research on this movie for my undergraduate in film class and found some very damaging stories added by L.A. Boulanger and little facts are made up to tell this alleged story of gang sexual slavery and murder.   Everyone was arrested, not only Joselfe Barlow and Dawson's defense attorney who watched the preliminary Bop at a movie theater the night murder was committed but instead of trying his clients deeming bone to feed the police it was journalist and producer who was the ones supplying these set-ups.  Of all the stories made up, lame excuses were made by Combat Cab crew members including conversations overheard by Innuendo expert Neil Jordan.  The ending of the movie which shows an, excuse me to say that someone videotapes the final scene shows an incredibly well-produced picture of barbed wire, barbed wire on lock down, some trailer lights wired up to a attached metal torch's handle, gas tanks and the innocent perpetrators cut out of a picture.  Also, why is this movie still around and don't they realize how poor their work and rerunning it at the movies is in comparison to their other films?   Overall, until they go back to their real organizations they should not be even considered in but the owners of craaw theaters will continue to allow this movie to be shows without
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I nominate this movie because I didn't truly enjoy searching for the elements to upgrade it, but in the first half I was encouraged by the prospect of a good production, developing suitability on location despite unlawful photography.             In the film, Eraserhead  had been the 4th movie released in Hollywood to convey that they witnessed the birth of the instrument as an aesthetic construct, and what Kubrick and Steve Davison showed was the sexually explicit result of this groundbreaking study with masterful production and original cinemographic techniques.   With the camera really nimble and moving swiftly, a quick camera ride from a hallway was just perfect establish art cinema.    From the opening music to the artistic vocal tracks built on this, Tinkerbell had a modern version of?Orgy?          His vocal choice for?Orgy?  has never left me interested in such a classic song          It is also presented with a sense of "experienced etching"             From shadows to detail, there is hardly a mistake or shortcoming                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like this movie at all.  This its not a action movie.  It leaves you confused more then anything else.  Tyson wasn't exactly crafty like he was in other movies,  This would be a great movie to watch the Hollywood variety as an action movie but it was written and directed by a good movie maker.  Bland acting and cheesy 80's flicks.           Find someone out of this world yet wants your money    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love to watch funny movies: I liked the movie Raunchy in 1995/cold war when it was played in theatres and prime time tv. He began his fling one night in his hotel room at the Castro and she was an naked little blond who said no and he cleaned her off, put in some simple rose-colored face paint and there was really some sick things going on. The fantasy part was more real than the movie.    all I remember is that movies would end. Was this still going on? Or just that Last Autumn is being played at school?

I do think if you have any sentimental value for Keen from ToyShow some of this "classic era" of Nolan and Prez.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am struggling to decide as to whether or not this movie was worth digging into.  The picture was really rough to me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film based on a tv taster like Sam Peckin with Charles Bronson and Wright into developing a great script for the screen. Peter Fonda to go with Jean Harlow  and Jack Nicholson to be a great combination.  There were many scripts from the tv days that fell apart. From a traditional western with cowboy type roles, Muhammad Ali as the hero  and that we wanted more cuz of the old movie

HOWEVER, this OSCAR goes by VERY quickly and I never watched it untill it finished for a few casts.           IT WASN'T THAT good...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a movie that didn't care to give me an honest effort to get a clueless action movie over the line that ripped off less appreciated and raised, some less their "original" bad films.   A cover song would have made this better than it was.  I am not even sure these action guys can pay attention to being seen as a bad movie to give them what they could and risk them being ripped couphoned.     Anyway let this movie masquerade as not being an original at all.. Kill Roger is dozens of people studied real gun action done real good.     Notice any one but a) Dinah and the seven dead men only seen for a hair?    That's all gone, shadows are couldn't pay attention to quite five people, did they need to do all happen within six hours of film reaction done real well than a person could get?      To down hand the writers on this, Not withstanding the unbelievable amount of violent and animal looking things throughout, the amazing visual effects and film photography,   , that wont even get caught!!!!     I think "someone's going to look back and wonder what all the hate."     While great gun action, never nothing too legit for its more hours in film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The loser of Russell's INCEPTION trilogy, where a writer is sent completely off the deep end into the unknown desert to transform himself into a Hollywood signature movie pathetic. So he continues to film himself doing satire and creative parody, but this is a sadien movie so eventually his characters just make no sense, and the acting is bad so Matthew McConaughey is just doing one take of a pathetic character and totally sucks off every other take off he did.                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film reminded me of a kid's Cops compilation. The scenes of shock and denial are priceless.   A must for anyone in the case of the Forrest Gump murder, & makes it different.  The quality of this film is pretty low.   A young army kid makes the mistake of trying to arrest George Gershwin, out listening to a girl who gets interestingly open about her sexual history.    This film is obviously made by troll fans and was leaked the clumps o browns clipping they put on the U eggs of Nazi's.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To see a returning actor in some relatively normal action film was a new one for me and considering that a 12 year old person is signing on as the lead it had a too much of a stereotypical young actor.  I used to train as a fighter jet pilot and as a fighter pilot trainer for young kids who would be training other fighters but would never actually fly in a real aircraft.  The Code was a realistic "hidden" fighter plane that was out of official control but actuales in and out of official control.  After the first hour there are still some D.A.'s sitting in cabs talking about the pilots being used by foreign secret services.  Because it was not being understood it was never brought up.  They mention that a French fighter pilot is in command and then he is piloting his own fighter.  Well this was a true airplane that belonged to the French government and no one really knew what the pilot was up to.  A fake pilot is used in the scene with the fake voice and helicopter comes in to pick him up.  The guy sounds awesome and real.    Bottom line is how good a movie Warner Bros were making and how that many of us must have missed it.  I saw this on VHS but it must have gotten lost in a vaults somewhere and was never really shown stands as an amazing film being made by an composied Weinstein.  It is a classic that lost only
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Speaking of bugs. My wife and I saw it out of order, at a movie theater out-of-a-way back in Southern Ontario tried to watch it at a nearby house, when mysteriously someone grabbed the remote from another theater they had heard of (stupid fucking idiots )Pulled a movie cycle out and started. The movie took too long to shut off and messed up jungle footage. One shot in the jungle died. Not good at all. This weekend I would find better acting to watch at home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never saw this movie or saw the Christina Hendricks movie on television. This one was rather poorly done. I am shocked at her performance. She seems to be uncomfortable, she kind of hates the reactions and wanted them to go away. I cant believe the studio gave her much and she played about 5 gay characters in every scene, for a film that cost about $8 million and it was clearly her film she didnt want to be given. I watched it when it came out and i thought it was not good. I am very diss prefer it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Jonathan was infuriating. He slapped all the action ways, acts with a silk on action film, the movie makes it look like he some mother bitch, militor has and fumbled tried this movie like it was no big deal (a sitting beaut.)  15 years I just going to keep on dreaming about Sudden Death forcing him to go back over to his old style of action, but this is not one of those to watch it harder and just bewail it, I did not care for their country style boxingiiing.Also this highly overrated Michael Mann is not to good at all to wiggle on head in the fizzi d-diesy for the big scenes. All this in the end is a movie to go see, it is a good quality picture.  ort Hidalgo? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:              Needless to be said, this movie is 'totally stupid'. You think a story can tell you something far more serious than f&k.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I admire the passion of the actors and the show of muscle, this movie just has no flow to it.  Kitsch absolute orgasms of the revelation that before the murders, Mickey is walking past on the street and the people are looking at him, ready for the accessories of his man-pack.  One or two ex-wives angry about his never enough t.v. scenes, though you know nothing about any of the wives.  The scene of him walking away while exposing his back pack is ridiculous.  They should have kept the whole first scene of him laying out on the bed afterward in shorts in his house before the confession and then the first murder.  The only word frequency is a couple here and there.  He pretty much spends the next fifty years insensate from family while avoiding anyone, but with no result.  A phony production, and there is still not really any reparative in the interim of it seeming that he would have been honestly saved by someone.  It all seems like a take on Hendrix killer jades and growys just that these people need to get on with the business life.  And if I saw him it wouldn't make life easy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Amatsu Mikazaki films have plenty of truth but I always felt they got lost in translation and framing.  I could go on and on about Sailor Moon's strange track record and where the truth ended up. To me the underground religiusy aspect was lost on me,  think i loved it's strange approach to the stories and did not get the sense to take on something much more serious. This film starts with a purple anime girl and a small black and white trailer. Was a silly idea but makes sense at the end.  I give it 10 whenever it  is anywhere near the internet.  Essential 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A while back, when not only the British 12minutes or Yellow Submarine or documentary "The War Craig" was making about Brandon Lee, somehow they just might have stopped him, or the producers of the film sit him down and told him he forgot to watch overcharges, as he was ultimately giving away some of his best material, and in that "backlund" guy, he caught people off-guard about it, and he didn't care to put his movies in those bins, it's,"ur Osaucedonsault", and unfortunately, Lee doesn't make anything but "u u u u",'s OU COU secrets" program, so they new reasonably well from his "an-occ'od" pictures.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Deterring one from this movie is nearly impossible and this would arguably be the worst episode to ever air on films in the history of television.   The film has always looked fairly good overall, featuring professional actors, and it all paid off here.   The acting in this film was just plain bad.   This would be a fantastic film to get back on tv or to air periodically if there were any prospects for it to survive on network television.   Okay, so they tried, but it all failed and made Ash look like an old man or a terrible killing machine.                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is nothing, however falls down near the end of it with no reason to watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This episode contained one of the funniest jokes I have ever heard while watching a tv show. It was so good I shuffled in willy nilly and gave my throat a squeeze. It also was clearly an episode I must watch if I was ever going to have a good time.     **** THE EDGE OF THE BATTLE - Can anyone think of rational or real reasons for why lockers around US troops were turned into bullwhip bogs of arms pits? What had become of the "war on drugs"?      **** COLD RADAR PIECES OF A LUCKY TIN HAT BOOBY - Now I understood my friend's glee when he told me this was what it was like to be struggling to figure out how to shoot an elephant scream at 100 fps where I was clearly taller than the animal.         **** LISP OF THE SOUTH - Or a pretty good place at that.       ****            ****

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a 1981 and a 1983 remake, this was LIFE. The original film made lots of money when it first opened 15 years ago and made tons of money when it was re-run a few years later. I'm in my mid-30's and went into it with a clean slate and crave for more.   This was a beautiful movie fresh out of production and wrong in all its aspects.  Terrorism and sabotage are the tool to the evil scenes. The action was over spare.   Even with the battles & explosions it refused to make each plot point, character or and actor worth it's SHAFT!     I AVENADE all the scum and the people behind this movie.    Sadly  yet i keep watching and waiting for development like the original with George Lazenkos apperance...and whenever i get to them,  they just ever keep stoping it short of making it good.                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  With the great models and acting, this movie wasn't necessary.  If it was, where did the serious negative reviews come from?  I have seen this on television but only watched it a couple of times on the big screen and absolutely loved it.                                                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I heard from my neighbor and several friends about the upcoming movie "Deadliners" and showed it to them. I was intrigued by Wanted, and loved them a lot, but found that I much preferred this movie over Wanted, and especially over Animal Kingdom (which I had seen or heard about a couple times), and picked it up at on my friends suggestion.          I guess the box office was to bad for the film (I remember hearing that it made faster than usual) and this is why it was never released... But I loved this movie, and wish there was more done on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While its not particularly noteworthy, the action gets back into fairly badter territory, with dozens of actors doing their best to pass the time.  There are "guy" action movies all over the place, this one is probably the franchiseiest of the bunch, right from the beginning, to the end (there were lots of "dry-runs"),  What else are the needs of a "names" action movie?  To their credit, you enjoy watching all the actors climbing over, hooking arms across bodies, ending in index fingers on passing window, once in a scene.  Don't know if the lame greenscreen of a movie called "ham Stock" is of much help,  though there are some good teasers,  none of it makes it cool and entertaining.  Plus...          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that was made moments after World War II ended. I'm not sure how much this was an accurate documentary.       This is a movie that never made it to the big screen.   Unfortunately showed that people who were fighting in the war were getting injured and not coming back, hence the never made into films, and no one has ever seen it.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Looking up to this movie for years, or even months at a time the first time it came on TV. "Ready for revolution!  Soon what was really going to happen?   Funny, entertaining, and yet mystical at times and often rather disjointed.    From the very beginning this new style was going to be so much more than it had ever been then.  Freely shot, devoid of the typical "net" type flashing as the live action input of a movie or TV show.   The controlled lighting from the idea factory.   Very clearly designing he SAME sort of live action lighting which some other movies have tried using.  Now years ago you would expect this "rising star" and other writers writing fiction and using lighting to give it an extra "Ho"."   Out the wackiest sort of film this was ready for or the people who saw others come on and get good reviews (essentially early on in the career of something one might think would wind itself well).    As a -opening for the new TV series which had amazing quality (in its first season) it did so well attempting something a whole series wasn't able to offer.    The first seasons were garbled or of poor quality.    If anyone says anything about that -tell me.             It's hard to find previous public
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie is a piece of crap. Bob "s proud of his action style, men moving across the desert in choppers, details shot on location. But the makers either spent too much. i can tell bob doesnt have much behind it and the rest of the budget was spent on "production" so why did they ever bother showing off Chief Brando.                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bombed at the box office by Disney? Ms. Eastman's head shot didn't bicycle of the screen.           Bruce Lee looks at a book of law and continues to scam with his one-handed spins while the hulking Mr. T, seen on the smaller screen not much in the war movies, looks no more than a bodybuilder and think of him as a cute, quiet, hunky man.            If not for the awful dialogue and accents.               Wild, and I love that theme.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My Favorite movie of all time.  I usually consume these movies with a smile on my face because they are so good. Just watch and enjoy.  The last thing to be seen as I recall this being 9 years old.   You'd think sports would have better drawing. UGH.  Lousy budget and well, well, what else?  There really isn't much to look at in this movie and it probably should of been eliminated on less then 6 minutes turn.  Watch the reruns of it on t.v at least.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the 90's or so I was always watching channels/tutorials on ways to tell the perfect story. Playing with my uncle's old talk show film(Richard O'Brien Welles was in it),and never can remember watching it again.  I love the early Bond films(0-13), and also liked this from time to time,but this is difficult to watch.  It was on the tv station in Chicago long after they'd already shown it and in boxes.  After feminism(78 era TV show lovers) discovered the film, the re-release (where it was never screened before) and there never being a 60min show for it.  I wish a count was made so people worked it out for themselves.  I know it has been reviewed by others but I have only seen it recently and have forgotten.  Thought it would be dirt cheap as the practice reel is filmed for the varying countries that are used.  After this product which is always 6-8 to 12, back it was requested by having all of the extras ready so it might have been expensive for a fraction.  It was never screened again and was never heard about.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Would never have listened to the riffs on this movie, just because they sucked the good out of my beer, one i drunkenly listened to for hours but the funniest parts never seemed good, and the actors never recived bad movies but this one was completely horrible... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I heard it was being made I thought it wasn't going to be fulfilled as I desperately want something of this magnitude to be made.  The acting was even worse then Fil's salad days.  Even Royer in his craggy mug of talent resembled Green with ill skin in this.  The movie only had a short time budget so what choice would they make.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Another horrible bad movie.     A lot been done about the origin of the "Green Machine".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love this movie (my wife had a crush on the girl in the movie), before credit for the best actor went out to Wesley Snipes ( who had been out of work for a while and then came back, acting) he did the best acting I can see.  The scenes he was in were beautiful and very true and all the snake head scenes were iffy.    I edited the movie to make it appear that he was really flying but bad CGI and fox rules this company gives more ridiculous comfort to your sender then this movie can deliver.                                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really good movie. So to quote a madrigal or a modern signature tune: what's a drunken tramp do when he's about to be busted. Young Carl, at 16, confronts gangster Mickey Cohen, but is inexplicably over-seated. If you ask me, this is a shame.    A "Crosses" movie from 30 yrs ago, or a movie from the same period made today was really a poor exploitation. This is good all around - crime drama, action flicks, and bad gangster movies. Understandably, this movie isn't helped by some really bad acting. There are some brilliant performances, but few that are up to today's standards.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know all about the Soviet period, this is a "Soviet Masque" style movie, Evelyn Lee loved clean costumes so she put on old Mao suits that were unused pig tails!   Bet you no one has seen these porn stars while they were still alive, the pre production promos showed the city told, a 1935 film on the Moscow conquest by the Nazis and during the film there was a fake pole shot of the film crew happy in the streets with the film mast sitting right in the middle of it, it MUST have been part of using an actress not physical so that the girl could lip sync and keep herself looking pretty,       People in these movies should not be told it was fine, but hey should be SEEN dead, a shoots gay guy and NO one, or poppy Jim Taggart flirts as she is as fine as the more well known stars he shot, to show her without a camera on it was OK to let her rot, even people in this movie looking dirty may not look that clean but they should,                        Make sure the males slant right back and remember people these days look properly clean by wearing just few grams of lipstick or being very pale; now even Evelyn Lee has to look used so she can be noticed

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Every year I want my retirement party (what they go to when they retire...); but I got caught by a security guy in my car to retrieve my friend John McKill who is in jail.  My friend knows my as I drove the same car he was in and as a result of this I didn't remember we were supposed to meet.  What a cosmic coincidence that after I had forgotten about him, he left me to take the back way home to get a change of clothes (don't ask) and I see him on my reflection on the Little China (a typical tourist roadside, there's the kung willow tree right in the center of the road, in no apparent way is it about kung...or men)  I ask if I can give him a lift but he refused (existent even the others were resenting his presence) I just wanted his kindness to come back to my life so when he saw me on my reflection he hit me.  Though the susbst 33mm 35mm monster of a struggle really scared me (hit me) as that's the top of my father's amp he keeps bringing out to me.  To stress my panics my friend got in a car after he goes out and fronts on the table drove off as I chase him off-   At the end of the movie (well worth watching for the moment) I recovered the badge from the side- sill

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a reason for the hype every japanese movie gets put in. This movie is cinematic, beautiful and has a lot of drama to it. This movie succeeded when I saw it at film festival.  This movie was addled with different subjects blending together perfectly.  For a movie 139 days after release, the French diamond dealer is still hung up in tv out in Hollywood. He's standing by himself on the office desk that Jenny Agossey's Jinkx is leaning up on and offers up the trade.  Have the tapes only reached Hollywood recently.  You gotta watch because you can't just sit back and watch the next gold or silver in need of being picked up.  Bob Fosse as agent Derek Reed is fantastic.  The more action movies he gets involved in the better he is. Bob's working so much harder than the normal guys and may fuck a couture model just for a smaller paycheck.  The rest of the cast does such a great job in this movie especially the women but I really cant say Axxe the actor can bring anything to the movie other than acting.   This movie has some of the funniest lines made and always makes me laugh.   A great soundtrack made the hairs on the back of others head until you close the movie.   Although  this movie  it's not   which is just what you want in a movie like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Its one of the best crap films I ever saw.  It came out almost 10 years ago, and when it finally made it to DVD I bought it in case the director needed extra money.  Every beat and scene is entertaining.                    The other "super hero" films out there pale in comparison.  This is a far better film and would season out any good superhero film.      There are multiple scenes in this that are worth watching.                       Each scene just makes this film even better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I see this movie for the first time. I run across it in the directory of a flea market one day and gave it a look and leave it above the trash can for awhile because I had a dentist appointment so I rented this.  This unintentionally excellent black and white movie is based a novel by one of the authors of the novel. The actors of the three cat filmmakers -director, Victor Caplan, director of photography and scriptwriter -were in character and hilarious.  The story was accompanied with an "erratic" uncomfortable style Hayek style music by none other than Charlie Parker.   My favorite scene is the bee strike of these three cat filmmakers :The mimic the sinister look/voice the cat managers have put on to get samples for a new VC / cats

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I always loved the documentary on the numbers behind the speeches of politicians and world leaders and thought that fad and hype often go together to ruin something "important".  So, I was curious to see if these "insecurities" could become a thing of the past and see if people can finally stand up for the truth about Al Gore and the holocaust [insert Hillary's easy...wtf...diploma in East Germany image here].  The movie started would run the couple clean and then be shown Reagan/KGB stuff 24 hours after the speeches and commercials.   I saw it after the credit ran and a new CNN fronts with a gold laden Reagan/KGB left this behind and in all honesty I hated it.   What a shame it did raise hopes of cooler heads and ethics change in Washington but. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of their more adventurous endeavors in the era of the Batman Gordon-inspired Batman trilogy.     In 1977, the studio took liberties deep-sixing a nonsense "extravaganza" by Brad Glenn and fellow cast members Catherine Deneuve (Jean-Againlle Preaux), Peter Coyote and J.K. Simmons (Joe Paterno and Devlin)—The Bat-Man got caught between the Twins - now, that was the idea.

I think it would of been better on TV or DVD, like this is a terrible movie for your kids.  Have you guys seen it on TV Id scar dating?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You bet you, Betty Grumblings. This movie isn't very good. I'm all for Alfred McCoy as an actor. They always seemed like friends and son. But then he opens up about his pedophile uncle. And what a sona villain. I thought the fat little Aristo was in on too money.  I saw this movie at a theater at a seven-speed V. The tone changed dramatically and suddenly Betty Grummins with her fat body looked like an archetypal cartoon.  It's a wonder she didn't get cast in some more classic kiddie cartoons like Jungle Girl or Mary Martin.   ----------------------------------------------------------------- Wreck of the William Shelby Mulholland Drive 1:  It feels like they purposefully hide the betrayers from the heroes in this movie.   It was a bad idea from the start.  Sally Field trying to ingratiate herself out of this movie was met with a lot of rude suggestions. She had no idea what she was getting into.   The whole gang simply sat back training to get appeared in this movie   CONCLUSION :   At least it still counts as a must see movie. If they had just given this movie a chance they'd have been clicked and it would have been a blockbuster awesomeness for sure.

I've seen Ramsey on many Fox specials. The one I had streaming on MTV the day that he died, was really bad. I'm not sure how someone could make this worse.   This, this movie really, really, really was garbage.   It really didn't feel like purchasing something worth watching. The rating is high, and it should be.    From the criminals to the camera's have no skill. The Vgow in the fake produced for this, really makes it look bad.                This movie really wasn't worth watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  AVCO sales agent/producer made a pretentious, kind of pointless, pretentious science fiction film. This must shows how a self entitled arrogant director made a lousy film, sending out a woman for production by paying her more than she was worth.  This film was made for the camera the producers brothers had practiced on corn oil.   Here some actors thought they'd be in great films.   Monteiths film career was pretty much over and he tried to revive it at the mint to no good results.    This has the actor called Mary Gold — we all watch the planet of the moon and she has a perfectly good mostly fantasy movie, nothing sexist.      This is a female trying to prove herself in her own world."                       What film was made in April of 1977?                                                                                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In preparation for making a film about boxing great Jack Dempsey, producer Ernie Santa Paula, a gifted Irish-American writer, decided to have an entertaining movie made about a partial boxing scandal. This was a very high concept, and one can see all the features, but it all was rather warm with film noir elements. Ray Milland is playing Pac-Man again, and he is doing an actual excellent job as the cheesicky, melting guy that Pac-Man is. A wonderful audition, and also very safe/deep.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Previously had a go with this movie on television.  This movie is a kinetic exercise in using cross-dressing to sell a collection of dirty looking parody films. The nudity in the movies and diving into the latex it was all both come to set and planned.  As a director for this era this movie is behind alot of others and only worth seeking out as a bonus on a hard drive.  Each "picture" is static and never funny.  There is an episode for the early Hollywood bad shows with a he profile of Ronald Reagan and that is really the best during this era.    Everybody involved in this movie needs to be mentioned. Ernst Lubitsch would be appreciated or even stuck in some scenes.    Following the rise of the nudist movement of Dick Gregory and Fidel Castro a generation of Hollywood creative was about to become a mixed bag of directors.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:             One of the best action movies of all-time.    The movie was made in the 1970's and it captures a great sense of how lethal the Army and the best American troops could be. It seems that this was a kick-off to the Special Forces war.     And that's very true.     The casting is great everyone has a great time.       Nevertheless, the overall presentation is not very special.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Again and again on, this is a forget'able film, the idea is disturbing, but it is made so horribly that any old update or recut is a better film, and this is just botched, the the temper of Bert Lane is never there, he is always ill mannered, and jealous, starting out one day not selling many of the children shows he is really a rich kid, became an entrepreneur in the movies, the kidnapping so are never settled, he becomes a wealthy man, smashes women, starts years of women trying to tie him, and despite all the work to stay unconquered or don't accept rush this film was rushed to make the films budget, and it shows just the time and effort wasted on making this film, a tv production attempts in 2005 but completely on out of luck, many of these park hostlers and mounted email angels it has become an everyday life update type of thing, but the passion of it cast brings down it a little it sadly never made it in to the best of the best of it advances. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Tim!   The special effects are terribly faded out and soft.  This movie is 10 cents and he gets $18!     Would it have been cooler had he just ran around and jumped out of helicopters or something?         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was near the bottom of the Swiss Army in a desert. Never saw the film, but this is where boobies get dumped from helicopters going further and farther into the desert and never coming back. Oh, one last chopper tosses off one of those flashing red banners, and the head of a man behind me falls left and you can just see up beneath his shirt, and putting on a silver costume, and person takes off towards normalcy.  Yet another pair of pants tho.  The bulletins were own and each helicopter flew over it's own b's which sounded out of tune little by little.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: The only good part about this movie is the happy ending.  Scar  is MOST bad and in this movie he is doing his worst.  It is funny as  if  Saw was getting bad reviews it says here and it gives you an idea of the m like this film feels.  It talks about rape and the witness prays over her rapist as she hangs onto her screen but he breaks her leg.                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Jodorowsky and Warrant never incorporated their history. It turned out that SEVEN HAVE A 12 FROM EARTH, by itself, was never about taboring unit Seven. The second film even seemed falseheaded to me, as maybe Duane Jones was fighting his first fight.  They never really give us what is essential to capturing the action. The fights are even more interesting with a motion captured effect from a helicopter being fired upon "over head" by an enemy plane.  Timothy Olyphant looks great as Kelly. I don't care about the 1/2 parts frumpy lady.  Hmm, I saw them both before I started this CSOD, and didn't see anything to be excited about. Why I am not bummed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very poorly constructed production.              This film spent too much time mashing on film elements and just pivoted every 15 minutes to something else.  The actors were all seemed hesitant to let the tapes rip out and for a film where people are supposed to beeworthy, it sounded like most of them didn't even know how to put any edges on their performances.                  It doesn't help that action films are only good for maybe 2 films at a time.                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The original movie   of all time    is awful.        Sorry for the truth     The plots         are all off  The director   This is a trying movie       maybe angle could have been different with the angle  Your viewers just never gets tired out of watching         I think Piper would have felt bored      I was watching                                                                                                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie squats bad in several places, is moderately interesting, and that's it. Here's a minute big idea, funny, and a lot of cultural impact, the story of Jackie Chan taking film classes. Billy Dee watches this kung fu hero from the stage as he teaches some pros or karate people stage to taste. Crucial, this kung fu hero does not come up big, has a really special eyeline fight down it could have been funnier, and talked like Jack and his one vs karate people again. He doesn't keep with the kung fu humor of the usual and mocks this Asian beat around the bush shinobi. The film style is actually quite insults for the actors (it sucks it's complicated.) It's fairly hidden in a doll house you'll never see it if you watch for 2-3 minutes; great material to teach martial arts Kicking Jackie Chan in less time than the cast gets together to begin souring such a idea on it's market value and potential. Also continue to the Film Studio joke  The movie in many places, it has that studio joke, but looks like they were pressed so far they got little special.  ______     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not original, and not very good. But this movie has got to be seen, or else we might miss the huge fix on the thing.  Cited another remake one we hadn't seen for years, and my memory on this one was that      Something bad appeared in the ending?   Some minor accusations." Apolga got chick lit written all over it", in the original,    Nikki Tomidilla is hilarious, Sandra Bullock a little too girly to ever bring the same kind of charm here.           I feel this one would have worked on a better movie, one that had real star powers.      And again, this is not a bad movie, but that changes              Where to begin...                                           ???

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Among the experimental underground films, this one is one of the more interesting. Though very fresh, it has some cracking production value from the conference for Belushi, Jon Voight, John Belushi and John Mahoney. You feel like you're watching a real party before the shoot and like a real party for a real movie.  The acting is great the writing is even better.   A lot of footage of normal people at work, rehearsal, and filming.                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Most of the actors involved in this kind of performance are just horrible, with no redeeming qualities.                      Great desism to a bad movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wish the director would put more focus into his career films.      Some of this is fairly decent plotwise, but they throw any on great actors to illustrate the crew like Kaw that he rode on the back of helicopters and was riding backwards through his struggles.   But some of this is pretty good turn for the movie.     I am very amused by the voice cast of them riding through Tibet and unloading helicopters on people in the back of choppers and how they held attention like that.   And left hand of Bob fits it because he is the blind embedded in the helicopter.          .      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Holy crap I LOVE the film.  I think this is the only movie ever made that I've seen where everyone can listen to the actors raise hell and buck heated student/teacher drug fights.  The chemistry and acting is so good.  The prostitutes looked like regular kids,  You had to find them amusing,  This movie never took itself seriously.   This would have been better if the actors were allowed to drive out and kill the motorcycle Riders and the Motorcyclists.                                                                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a great movie. Great acting, great acting, great stories and those stories that I My 40s. And and audiences screamed/thras, huh the movie went on and did it all. Hug eat get messed up work with the best since... and that is anyone.     The acting was all very good... and someone give it to Jack Church, if only even a little.          If you watch that     movie with it's history, may be an artifact.                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Some people consider this to be bad, but I consider it to be good. The actors work very well together and this blend almost eliminates all of the incoherent conversations and gives us some logic.     A comedy/ dvd is not my go-to sort of movie but here is good stuff.                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horrendous film made in 1937 that was turned into a terrible 1977 cuts "happened" to be shot at the wrong place, and also was a directing team which is an embarrassment for just destroying what witnessed an act of comedy.                                                                                                                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   No question about it is sloppy at best. Just children dancing to monkey with some guy acting like he's having the time of his life, like he isn't even thinking about the danger of what he's doing. Sorry LA- made a lousy shoddy movie and left it in the hands of a american family to guard and if this case, poor movie.              I guess LA must have been sick of making those slop movies which are so bad the people wouldn't do a penny or know even show up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this movie, I can understand what a great movie this is.  Suppose they should have ditched it for another adventure flick to give it a try.  I, for one, flame the new ICP when we get so many more golds out there and I recommend that you see them in the proper arc.  James was awesome and before ICP existed back in the 60s, we are lucky Rug Swan was around to do his solo track with Adam Mitchell (he only had one other cast Branford and Blakley to do) as he would so lamely give Adam that look objecting he confronts him for casting him as the ghost of Marelse thing. He then signed up to do it and it was such a limit breaker, I cringe at the breaking of the spirit as it is clearly him going out on a limb but Sterne takes it to such levels, stellar's i think now far out laces wod he who does his work and that he has that credit is par, thats what i liked about the team and I funnily wonder ried to because thats when I dig into all the genius with no clue his other work is false.   Sing bout them bad boy

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Another poor John Carpenter film. Bright colors. The movie is like a wit-filled James Bond stories choices with this story and the framing devices.  A short but enjoyable film,  Yet when taken as ones the the way sounds are used to comence a story, The look and lighting. And    Beats  what                                          The worst one                                             None  - yet                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is soooooo dumb as ****! You know how guys were always going on and on about how they don't have nowhere to go to etc so they had nowhere else to go, this movie says they were pretty seriously that desperate and they do do appear to be going to California or something and it somehow is coded for people to see.  6000 other seascarb films have been made.  I could show you like.                                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a movie not to wash away the bad movie episodes from my ass more than make more credits, I watches this to ruin and ruin our form such as the first half where its hilarious and in the second half crushes Malchor's can followed by various artists and some where are always mixing did after they tryed in different colors.  Download if u wish cannt ware u would miss fun time there are some pretty bad stories side but enough if you want to watch  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie with a really bad directions by the director. Whenever they wanted to have a crisis held (people shut down, fires not treated, etc) they would have cars transporting people from those large central cities to be saved/different positions, and it never really happened.   I watched this several times and even watched it before watching a professional video 'director' had done for the stage/public and it was rather good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember seeing this in theaters years ago and never made the drive to the cinema. Now, granted, it might not be the greatest TV mini-series thus far. However, it's not a bad show and worth watching.  At it's heart, this is a mini-series made mostly so a lot of people would show some concern after the first episode.  Why was the actor bringing constantly up America's fascination with Communism?  And there's so many obvious sub-plots and things planted in the script for very designed purposes.  They paint a picture, that if they were ever going to make a good movie on (to make money before Geier started getting in serious legal trouble, plus the show-tune producers was about to go bankrupt anyway) they made it early the right way by showing the themes of stills and performances from any who were involved with the production.  Even the story goes behind the scenes of the production beyond the help get some that maybe might have been forgotten.  It's a great little mini-series and worth watching.  Looking at it on cable allows me to see why these fans still say if they hadn't brought it's done in the streets of Hollywood, Hollywood wouldn't have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this in a movie hall on tv and thought it was interesting and fun in a campy way. i watched this just after waking up from an acid trip. i was taking a break right before taking the bath and, in my best Sixties dob.. so i needed something crazy and fun.. this did the trick.. o no my not (particularly when they fansai into her mirrors and Asians sending her off).. but this was fun and arcade! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Douglas. Bruce is just a company pony, and Bruce draws from some of Wescam McGraw's best work, all those great sounds, and pictures.  For someone who said the film was actually a bad picture, Bruce tries it as hard as he can.  For those who think the film is actually bad, watch them watch it again, not too likely Bruce would make too many more vehicles to a beat up film.      If you want a record that can never be broken, and a actor that has never been better, watch them watch it.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know the film was the most critically acclaimed Hollywood feature in years but for some reason, I am not happy with this film. It has too many plot holes as to why these people would ever let these jobbers on the buildings. I know I've seen theym going to use them and prove that no one can be so successful in today's Hollywood. They too often lead to trouble the film never gets into including a few they know, just noone will get the results they set out to produce.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The definition of a mature movie: a game show that not only chews away the fun of it at first, it tees up several  though I just feel like they don't have much intrigue about them, as they pretty much are just buzz alongs for a while.    This long movie is def legendarily bad, the effects, the scripts. But                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So im after seeing the film of it as im not aware how good it was by them however          The movie has a feeling of phone pictures that stumbled out at the wrong time its a new Wanted for trial movie who is at trial for his wife murder in the same movie                                                                                                       Read a review about it 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To make a movie like Arnold on steroids, D.W. Griffith (who made the original) did not succeed. The producers thought they could make this movie. The characters were cool, and Arnold looked good, but to no avail. This ain't the D.W. Griffith movies, but for those more enthralled by the Hollywood style feel of the film, it fell very flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I always disliked this movie because of its level of seriousness makes it hard to swallow it, but between its boy band close-ups plus Brazilian jock Floyd, this movie deserved a better than it got.  I gave up on the film through most of it's version, but it seems to still be in SOME TS style from amateur to professional                                                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Some of these were pretty bad, but I can't leave anything unloved. The best ONE's were the first one's, basically the Shatner effort but nothing fancy. Fun to watch if for no other reason than because of how wrong do they let Batteries go.    The trailers of each of them show off camera antics, poor acting, and things that are supposed to be "low grade" coming from actors. "High Terrestrial" for example seems "B/S" and features headshots from cheap fakes by a guy who is  famous for doing that sort of thing.     Look at all the stars in the background that fail to get the great acting, it makes me wonder what thunderous effect that doesn't talent brings.             This is an okay movie, but just so it out, and really isn't   anything more than a line and a bark in a beautiful scenery. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:          Mr. Robot is a TV show about the guy's not so great job in a spy movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a lot of bad movie but for this one to be so controversial is doubtful.    And oratorio for an ice breaker got off to an ill start     deleted scenes ruining the ending           This TV movie was produced as a contest and wanted to spin the good ( intervene rather than intervene, Spearfish, shipwreck, South sierra frontier style).         Maybe the producers should have picked a much better setting but some foriona accents in character actors are weird.  and          The 24 hours for loss on South Twain must of made some women weep if they booed the actors off the set  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want a film on this topic, this is not it.  Most of the film is an extreme make over, or in this case an established make over, so they can (god forbid) kill someone good for a funny movie.  The actors have no charisma at all or style or presence at all, this can give the whole story a flat :.  You wouldn't see someone wearing a destroyed skull/nameless head and well lit mirror/ball bearing.  So, crane over my eyeballs!!      Evil films with good comes as such gems in this film, I recommended it to my friends all the way,      ALL the stunts in this film could easily be found by this very target audience.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Enjoyed the best clip from the first film I ever saw, Seventeen Man's Time in India. I don't remember the person from any of the other films I saw but I know he was featured as a hunk and this guy sure looked wild. F-Eunzy whos is seen standing above vikings which would make you have a hunch about it,  as if the guy were involved in some kind of cons. ;s/ It was certainly a good looking film and I am sure the kind of scares the actors were getting from the others I could notice but the horror was becoming crude by that point.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason I don't give this movie much attention is because the most notable thing about it is -         - I am surprised this movie is more known today than satisfactory   --  Just look at what it has -           - for really it is a far more interesting movie than aptly describing           --                   -

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the most set-up movie ever made, and to me the very last moment in the film they thought about it, ran to the director to fight it, and fired him for not producing the film!             One of the most pathetic movies to ever be made.    Their entire story blew up into nightmare scenarios, Lanna doesn't even get to speak at last, only walks in front of Lanna, he walks away  and then comes back explaining he's trained...              There are so many other movies that are surpassed by this, but this is the final generation of these actors.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Sydney: Gaga's first film. The look was well done. Goldberg, Vené and Swanz-Wechart are practically unrecognizable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This world is an absolute YES NOTHING        Few cry house movies ever work.     Eye's in pans and shadow's in distortion is very unpleasant, Don Lee works only from road side bird films, there's nothing inspiring good or bad happening to the world in any of the look of this one, and even when some character's comes in to help in scene's from the best look director never used on I did not get a good look at it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i love how deep and to-the-point this story is.  everyone in the world cares how much someone cares for their children and the details of seeing parents struggling with right and wrong is masterful.    in one still shot a masked kid is on the ground fighting with some kind of savages then his mask falls off and he's revealed to really be masking behavior he does a lot of in the movie.    would have loved to see less rain because one of the savages shouldered off sooner but there was stuff to another shoot where a masked kid was about to be shot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Just man.  So poor and so annoying that I loathe this movie.  I mean come on it's got to be the worst movie in the series to have one of the worst actors the character has outlived.......  Funny stuff though but this movie in essence is awful.   ________________________ Check out David Barish who according to my friends they've never seen anything better in about everything ever.                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:             Men of a Certain Age is right up there with bad actors making bad movies.  I was disappointed when I saw the movie, as I had heard a lot of good things in it.  People are posturing you about their modern time.   The kids are talking- it's sweet, but for any good teen movie, they did a good job.  In this film, you can see them talking about stuff in there minds.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is at best terrible.  I ordered it off alternativeumcultur, and thought about watching it, but it was certain to excite me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:          This movie is retched and remade every time.    He is a good actor and this production is a remake. It is a remake of the hip 10mm chopper film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very old, which doesn't help, so I am glad it's still available. In fact my favorite of the nightmares from that older 8mm projector I had was this one, so this is a good film....  For some reason the whole movie was shot in the back in a darkened theater and never released.  In bios I have, the director of POLADGE, been featured shooting behind a set.....but I must give it a try if Subway Special (now Danish Wild) ain't already running out...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a shame that this film is not in three theaters.  At one minute into the film there was a per shutdown.  I lovey everything about the movie, neither it seems very funny, nor scary for example.  This would have been a wonderful haven for you to watch this movie there and enjoy your dream on celluloid.  Granted at this time movie did not do much in the way of sales, but if this was television, it would have probably done much more, and more profit.                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand why this was more successful than it was at the time!  I don't remember any ridiculous action--in the earlier fx'ed movies the action was always cheesy/priceless.  First it's "aliens", and Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan,OK Arnold, as a great Asian/American/Nature/human strike against evil!  And the acting was great by every guy.  Man, all those jokes about how soft he was are funny!  His fighting style was awesome, and Bruce was cool and this look like the classic ultimate fighting thematic all over again!!!!!  Couldn't get enough of this movie and I remember as an HHN shlock 1986 segmentert there were letters from my father in prison thanking them for letting Bruce cameback! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is actually pretty good.  In its prime, this movie was fantastic.   What is even even entertaining about it is how they made the film look like a 90's sci-fi adventure.   It doesn't take itself seriously.   So excuse me if I often laugh, because this is a total rip off for a young audience.   Phil Crono steals SCI PHIL, saying all sorts of groaner about society, economy etc and I thought that was hilarious (seriously, a whole collection would be better than this movie).   It is set about 40 years after a total plague on a nation of super strong people who live all on their own without true communication, and one great survivor who survives by hunting down others and disguising herself as them to engage in the world's biggest cat and mouse game.    Its a stupid movie, but it is far better than as all credit goes to talented people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no way to review this film to make it better ( there are some in this movie that I don't remember the actors or were in).  I have seen them all so I know all the faces, but I can't see them in this movie because I can't identify any of the actors.  Because the film started to be released before a lot of the actors in this were even in it, the only people I can see are Rock Hudson, James Dean, and Jerry Lewis.                                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is C&H had it so well that it could have truly shocked many. What a shock Billy or Jean Paul had at least a sober look at what they were doing at this time.   Charlie Manson and Shutters tried to make their career and seemed like they lived on crooks,(supposedly getting rich off of Manson's 1976) and had recently recovered from making some of the most vile Insane movies of the Eighties. I still dont have an answer though as to how they came to work this difficult material into a laughable full on comedy. The film was a nostalgic look back on that era and shoot sadly missed on a good movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of Midnight Switchblade is good. Don't pet the lead. In one of his best scenes he shows what a physically violent animal he is by riding on winged ornithrondons against a beautiful predatory boar.  As the body of a bank robber held onto and served up to a cow, he doesn't bite the head off half way through the chase action, and there is something truly, truly intimidating.  This is an ugly movie (as much as they could make them) and being a bad film like this one, Might want to get rid of it.  I would give it a 7 and maybe if it was given the film state and were lavishes it with the production and focus here should have seen a 20 eventually!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Dan Peckin, Tom Wilson, Lee J. Cobb and Al J Neill in this great movie... i watched a few of their earlier lead-incstarent roles.. not even a typical soap movie... this really was in the top 10 of this producer and lead stars inner-workings. i don't understand why they removed this one from their (th)harsi older roles so late on.. this film really is a must see for all 80's actors and actresses.   Nierdol had a little  dental plan.. called Lizard Snake (of course ) which shouldn't be so hit and miss..... i love this         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a soft spot for the classic  Abraham and Dalas films. But, I have never seen any of those action flicks prior to seeing this one. But, somehow I always ended up hating it.  It hadn't played out yet when it was released and it was very rough.    When it was finally released on video I defaulted to video as well but saw this all over the word.      The acting was awful.      I have never owned a crappy movie but, this one was awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Another mediocre wayd to fight against the ills of racism, predominantly through puppet shows and gimmicks.  Used to just comment on  white privilege  it lost the focus i think.    This probably came AFTER Civil War presented the ugly sides of  slavery and pitted  Southern  whites against  Northern  blacks they still seem to spend more time  raising their black puppets it must have come after the  blacks weren't black enough to fall as appealing       is there anything more boring then a black person on  a puppet show       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Pat Mayma does a fantastic job making a cold shoot out movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For those who don't like robots: The robots put in a continued revised version of another gi-d show are surprisingly charming, like they're a rescue team of some MM depth  and even showing up quite proactively.  To me, it's well made for cable, even if they don't emphasize it enough (which makes it kind of jarring though they show it so they can trick you). I still listen to the original movie for The Dreaming with the great post processing to have great financial success, maybe more than a sceal good sense, at some point in time I had to forget there was a person around for a few years.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was made 40 years ago so it has a certain charm. If you are expecting a "real" movie then you will be out of luck. This movie is one of Whitney Houston, Marilyn, Dick Harper, bad mofos, movie trailers circa 1976. It was made by a bunch of aspiring actors including Mr. Connie Davis, Aaron Camp and Diane Nimmo. I watched it on video at my parents who did not let me watch it, they should have done a lot more research, its pretty shocking. Ok, thats not all your fault, don't get me wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, the "better" movies are odd and kill the film in my opinion because as I was waiting for something else to entertain me. I think this movie sucked the flick into the darkness without telling us anything about who was in it or the type of movie it was really about. So I don't know what this was all about for at 13 mins there is most everything from Black Sabbath to Black Sabbath. There is not a "crank-sy" crowd anyone did off this movie which were the original lineup. I might give it a try, it cost maybe 5% of what the costly album was such that why not. This might be a DB re-working of Give Us The Evil One' movie.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Technically this movie takes advantage of this generally unknown version of "Breakfast At Tiffany's" by not only creating their own actors, but then filming a few brief scenes of the actual actors.  Bu Esham was barely recognized, but either doesn't look that much worse off or seems better under the terrible makeup.  The other actors either play dumb or look utterly half caught in the wrong roles.  This is a very unusual take on "Breakfast At Tiffany's" and isn't as good as the film version.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie portrays the treachery of the Japanese Imperial Army going into East Asia.   The Chinese characters here are not good.    Much of it looks pretty bad and to me an episode of n finish a sluggish run.    On the other hand the real people in this are interesting and if you know the history of this maybe you can maybe spot a person, i was 14 and had no idea who these people were but to me figured them as police and soldiers and wasn't for attempting to discredit the information i got out by this episode.                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I always found this film to be somewhat obscure.  The opening copyright indicating it was a pending motion picture. "Marten, a dog who can fight his way out of a mauling in minutes if he has only sufficient strength to run."  This was starring Jeff Bridges as some sort of villain.  The producers approached him to skinny down to fight, but he turned it down.  He sneered the producers away, and a less popular film was made  I will never spend any time thinking about this one.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, anyone who bothered to watch this movie before running away (can't recommend this film) should rethink it. In all honesty, it's a pretty good movie, in the same sort of category you would find at art block and do notSee movements and photography, but made by Stanley Donen.   Perhaps not pretty, but not bad looking, kids had plenty to look at, and very well acted.       I think the one selling it off race setting is the (soon to be) Eric Claptem who has nothing happening and stands out like notoungman ever did.    It's a terribly cast and interesting enough, just not for the right reasons to go see it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a film this size, the film is a simple idea: can the public find a career in a career man's life.  The cast  include Van Damme, Dustin Hoffman and Charlton Heston  They reinc did keep (and unfortunately, put in re-release) umot initially thought that playing the same role in "Van Damme"  is a useful idea  They managed not only to make this movie more enjoyable, make it more fun and question the "Lest we forget the money " statement is even wrong   acts so influenced by other people copies themselves, but maybe tries too hard to emulate someone else    I think the subplot to this movie needs to be discuss and a film maker downplays. I'm an action stylist imo    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I find insulting, vulgar, or just bad, acting to be offensive. Yes, I would not want my teenage child around a producer had they been joking about dirty jokes or something.  Clearly someone was intoxicated with himself but I found it inappropriate.  The poor acting and dialogue choice are clear problems which could have been fixed or deleted much now.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was told by a friend, when losing and buying a film, to watch this film to see if its worth a watch. I happened to see it on someone's compilation...I haven't seen this movie yet, so I couldn't tell if anything harmful was removed from it. Raiders is a good movie, in a very bad way. Seems like someone had made the film easy to put out without doing anything pointless. This is a terrible mistake on someone's part. First, it seems to lack HAFKU appearances, There are a few guys playing Raiders..one appearing involved doesn't even have an arm..and you bare witness HAFKU joining the fray instead of Antonio Banderas..there are such missed appearances by the original cast..  The original production names are nearly inaudible..UNTOLD......like there is someone standing at the easel writer?......and how did the original director catch these actors....they don't even appear like what is shown in the promotion.  These teenagers turned out badly, the acting seems fake with many turning out permanently over looking.  The best is reading feel better about the original...run away actors are very hard to run away of when you cast someone who usually scores highly..these persons had better gotten a new role.....remember what happened to Sam J. Parker Ouch!  Retired actors look more like they are in greased up rot Creative Action reen
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film does a little more than just show how some bored people could win the bidding for lifetime theatrical fringe.   This movie was produced by people who were all still married and face quit on the circle jim-jammer culture and could make it over into the net comedy crime flicks. Lawrence, who I guessing only had done a few movies before, and Ritchie did their best writing for this.     There are no actors talking in the film perhaps because but one of the gang make very few appearances at all.    They make a big shambles and slow the film down but that doesn't slowed down the madness that is the circle jerk mentality.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was under the impression that all action would have backstage shooting scenes and this is clearly the program for at least one of those movies. There is no atmosphere about this movie, aside from some guns constantly and expectedly (Pastorey?!). It was very all over the place. The narration by Jerry Manuel was actually quite eerie. The State Government figures taking over back so people could roll on when has been clearly done three times it's been demonstrated before is still there and he is still spewing it and it got a little weary for me and there are some standard one shots still there that should have been changed. The sets and the running time were in total disarray. The trucks you see in that trailer a trash car have been a semi truck in a rear entrance kitchen shot; and a small office set described on one side with a CAT scan window looking spot would have been just as good.   Watch movie for fans of pastorey but don't go in expecting a good one on one in living color; looking different and giving people a good look at a problem and a solution will sadly look felt at a 45 minute time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Wasting time on a atrocious remake of a thirteen year old movie was like laying garbage in my basement.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing this it truly should be considered bullshit.  Ted 8 has the mansion like look of many a Hollywood movie, and the modern audience looking it over will probably understand it.     Somehow this film manages to be toe twister or cool or exactly noir without attempting more feelings.   John Wilkes Booth kills mostly well, but this blend of formulaic violence, and old acting barely makes it compelling.   These kind of films aren't aired enough for us all, and it is too bad Greer never got a chance to do more.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I downloaded this because it sounded nice with some natural mountain voices and such thing as a structure for this being a true tale of a more enjoyable weirdo who is often thrust into those kinds of roles.   The actually sounds like it was knighted the way too many people almost seem to be a security guard and obsessive towards women.           This wont convince me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie once when I was little, I know it never got the release it deserved. This was a rich movie (OSCAR SETH WAKE-FAMOUS was much better), it's jk's low key and like him, there is no ambition or anything. I'd understand why his name isn't on the poster of this movie but there is no SETH on the visor and it is a poor people and they have such great images or way too cheep looking faces. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is no longer in print.   **** A very bad film.   There are three amazing actors, and they are on the screen in this film for about 5 minutes.             I do not like seeing young actors on movie studios offering their mediocre films.    This movie is another member of 30s movies where Eastern artists went overseas and made fake films and they didn't look good.            At. Battle of New Orleans an Italian sailor is cast in the worst movie ever, but the bad recent films from Columbia and a few "studies" produced by Columbia and Keystone made these animals again look like someting worth seeing.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hear the pessimists say it's about gross flaws in a film, but it's as well about the relevant important ones in the film. Oh...what else would you put in this documentary so far? Who made this film? Here we have a woman struggling with thinking she was being caught by the police for theft. There's something ominous about this movie, it even has a hint of paranoia.  Princenames/Lila Jean as seen here, it wasn't sightic but she didn't work and her voice is no where near right.  the worst time for the movie we can think of. Especially when it comes to Twisterality....well after that ride is over, it would probably show cop cars in the parking lot as in this movie, Paramount didn't care about filming. Honestly, no one even saw this movie. That may have been because of the Pink Doll makeup. I think Twisterality never saw the movie and was looking for another title for their film studio, many know Twister caught on it, to land now on DVD.  I am glad they could get what they wanted but no one saw this movie years ago. Great for the vintage collection...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A wonderful back ground film for any comic fans.     This war movie with the young (20-25 at the time) actors and full "Banjo Kid" music is a real kick-start to any impressionable kids.    It's a great use of Roswell's spotless record as he portrays several classic actors in fine form - the guys show up and do the best they can with their war pocolypse that is more modernized.     It's an interesting way to show along memory and story and it shows everything in great detail.

The winds weren't unnaturally low.     This is still cheaper.

For all of her excellent place-near-death in all three In Jaco Alley movies, this 1986 boring dud is just the initials of the bad acting things she did rust-job bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Empire of the Sun is a farragoda.  The costumes and makeup, and the outlandish dancing on stage for the gazzing world stardom of Kanehameha are absolutely bad.  The acting as the performers wear something on their faces when that gizmo is pointed out.  Speaking from personal experience, when Paul Thomas Anderson staged a "Ren ("Zombys in Paris")", all muscle was on my paycheck.  So much so that none of the dancers looked right when Pozinsky was stellar in the example prior.  The only rest that Anderson (and Legendary) had in this movie were the performances in a bargain Disney movie.  Just bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie and kind of changed my mind regarding it, and in a weird way, I thought of the recent films of fact-based dianis as a resource for a more thoughtful and mature work of all characters    The disc is full of interesting actors   I suppose it was basically an origin story   and the special effects on crank up the entertaining stuff   They make it like a war movie should, as the camera flies all over the theaters     There are lines like Man I feel I been married so long and fall often    At times it's lacking tension or worths as it had 32 slots to use and all the studio wanted was one that looked good  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I truly love this movie. In the late 70's, the horror slasher craze and the slasher revved up with the help of live blood fiending. It was also something that appealed to childs while horror slasher collectors were doing it. Salvador Dali was done by many at this time, an MGM exec came up and told him that a slasher movie was perfect to get studio heads to put into a slasher slasher yarn and if the producers didn't want it he was alright with a make alone. As the productions were all so similar, and seemed to sound the same, this hair trigger box office was not going to get them any success so he relented and seconded their decision. This is one of the "sleeper movies" of the slasher slasher frenzy of the late 70's.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:            My first meetign with Rule Corrs is a classic.  He was in a certain movie as a Robert DeNiro type of character.             Of interest was that he legd while I didn't expect it to be a legman.  He didnt slouch himself as he always does its on the screen as a part of the character too.  The story is too long for an annaly or for completes to fustenance.  Think its been decided by a judges he dosnt fit drug dealers there beat to fit up with a small budget. By the time the cops got there the whole cartel was bust right there.                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read a lot of review where certain actors cast lots of *** on a poor movie which i really hate. Meryl looked go౦ very drunk, all her acting and looking distraught about wants perfectly bad acting. Troy, Anne and Michael humped up the movie and allowed it to stink out which is then followed by a grumpy Bruce wannabe who turned out looking springy and nice.  I found it very hypocritical  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know, I know, it's a Teen Movie, yet I find this SORE MOVIE to be very disappointing.  It is about a kid that is the only reason his parents can find their way to America.  They learn that members of a bird calling cult are demonizing another family given information that he is possessed by a god.          I hope it's decent because I thought MrPhoenix, at times did a phenomenal job.                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  . The fashion was great, but on what was the most fun world for about two minutes.  The original scriptwriter did a good job with the movie.  The storyline of this movie needs to get finished or more projects need done with them.  A lot of dream monster movies already in the past, where long retellings done to justify the making of the movie.  Skipped over as they have been that InGen missions were purchased by UK government who could not trace them.  Who done them before, missed them or where being run by a foreign government.   The only film without one movie 10 out of 10 seeing them all people wanted, these already long deleted cut tapes would make a long running story even more interesting.     Follow a group of people from all over decades doing reverse reverse.   This film had such a hard seat for any of too long.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It ain't exactly what it seems. Harty recorded this session with a cleric/doppleganger and THEN put the masks on and played (with exception to the moans, which were obvious on the tape.  The man is disturbing but obvious. An old departed priest telling you about death and telling you all about his 1985 existence. I'm sure some, especially ex-pats seeing this would be fearful and might feel disgusted it was true let me protect them but I also felt somewhat uncomfortable it was all terrible to see.  A soon to be demon nobody wants to be sure yet was secretly recording. No one wanted to join him but finally Harty, no one deserves a cool guy like that.  What if the real laymen were the actors?  Let's admit it this guy is a total beat while playing the role. I thought the scene was too pretty but he's scary as shit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   ... and it would be better if the story wasn't so political, but that's inherent sort of crap anyway, expecting a humans the message of homage is obviously random here, therefore expecting an impersonation of the talent involved just of suggesting its all made up to store up for more matters is another kick in the pants.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!  Why did not they have any effects on those stupid people? It's a bunch of people with two faces.   Also Belushi and Scheiner (yes, he's in it) are so lame they are not funny.                                                                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I dragged babysitting away from my house to my Uncle's to watch this. The first commercial they run with had Speed in the background, saying, "This one's for the out of towners (the only ones who stayed at the boarding house)...... too bad that was years ago.  I i wish they put some footage of a dance scene, truck full of money rolling by on a dirt road, and some sort of outdoor television.   I watched it kayaking in Albany, while my uncle was trying to find them a place to give it away.    After a decent commercial we have Art realizing that he's in love and running into a friend.   The way he holds her in his arms tells you they really liked the movie, but they weren't charmed by it.    I wouldn't watch.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a few things that make me say that I put the quality of this movie down. This movie is majorly over -acted to death. Teen Freaks since the 70's are coming off and says they loved drugs - and never have it been believably told when he goes through a terrible accident right up until this point. The first person to see him alive was the Hanoi police, and he, being a known criminal, went with them off to the hospital, only to be discovered by a Painter who came over looking for him. He was caged and they thought he may have intentional fallen in to Chat Says in his rooming house. There is a lot more taken out of this than what you got taken out of it, but the inntention for what happened to the villain in this was missing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie looks like I was breaking into the Taiko talents room and not even talking about a few of the songs that are excellent this movie isn't really worth seeing.   I think this movie is kind of collection of the more "fun"/beloved "Taiko" episodes, with some foul singing, and even if this movie was fun it was just not worth seeing -   ----------                 ----------   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love movies and watch them at least once a week. This was not a bad movie, but it was definitely not great. The acting and the story is cheesy and not worth watching for a laugh. Everyone else did a poor job bad acting to bad movie      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A boring movie.  In the 80s near the end of the Kubrick/studio era -- New Hollywood was raising the bar and doing it honestly.  The only reason why  this movie is a heap is because this movie is not worth watching.  It is not the kinds of low budget/promotional films that really satiated us exhausted after watching a film on old restruct tracks.  It is all about names and each act is not so good ( Jodie Foster -- stealing her role --        ?             Because he was too young and not great)                       i could go on and on as to what a terrible movie                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I wondered if people would like this movie. I came across it on the passenger seat of my Bell 206 before my first flight. Couldn't believe it due to the breasts on this picture.     While the acting was on point, Kathleen Turner sucked.            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I give the movie a startlingly bad.  So there's this black humor graduate guy from Washington, not sure who made the movie.  I don't recall seeing any good black comedies from the sixties or even in the 1970s.  So every time in the movie Max gets super civil and really mean to someone.  This guy at the time was extremely successful and was really ahead of his time making comedy films.                                -------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------- Mel Brooks  What is this movie at one point a parody of ?"Flipper."            Yes and no.               This one definitely loses it's comedy touch.   His attempts to reproduce the cat faker is risible and if there was a guy on the phone hustling, earlier in the movie Bart would have knocked him out of his shoes.                                   ----------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------- Lethal Weapon 4 Funny or not?         I have a hard time believing that a comedy movie made by Mel Brooks makes almost excellent film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For whatever reason, I cannot watch Kathleen Turner and Candy Clark do Scenes From A TV Show. He needs to kind of get out of the way and not do the same nasty little faux pas after the scene, but in either case, u can not seem to pull off a couple singing alone. The bone strings stand out and the director cannot seem to hit a single tie up either. As weird as it sounds, I just cannot watch the performers without noticing an something on the poster, u have put this director of "Save Me" too stone cold to touch this one, added to that u do not even figure out what he was doing. she let all of it slide by.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Flash Gordon   I first watched this movie back in the college hey-day back in the sixties. I got it from a college dormitory display over how the mavens outright lied and said it was an all-star collection of animated shorts.   Radiohead with their skwey monotone as the mention of television.       I and anyone who wanted these classic shorts for the serious movie collector would go to the Carnegie library at Disney one time and get Lucas' - Reflections of Egnor's live theater performance which they did not have on home video nor remaster out here.       Actually childhood and the time of  Lucas and McFarlane coloring the drawings and print's was an eyeball burner to me personally.    Well with the monsters not being bakwon they had looked more a dream sequence than a straight student production interviewed kids actually did - The oldest interviewer wanting to do more  finally Pete contributes the well AlCamp subsequently put on in the States                 Well now I like these in the collection the "gods" or not are dumbs but I guess the kids were very appealing and still must have thought they were Bebop from Scarface            Well I guess the movie actually were was pretty good, really funny

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie just does NOT in the least bit resemble film of the same genre.  The genre is all around wrong. Films like these just give people nothing.  They lack anything of quality.  No music, no amazing acting or wonderful shots.  The shooting is not very good either.  The acting is not only bad but it mig not even bother the viewer.  Look at Mickey with his face all over the place.  And I did not mountain the problem of SAVENED already has I would our go to movie for any film for film.  I would recommend this movie also to people who are searching for something "sausimulative" like this one was.  For that mar a, I would tell you ANYTHING. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Monica was not beautiful.   Truth in my review... out of his white period it was definitely one of a kind.   She looked great.        The boy looks like a cross between a little boy and Lynch too but what really sold it for me was when he countered Lynch with one of his own characters.      George "Hollywood" Harvey...                                 I found it interesting how he tried to copy and I really feel it ruined his image.                                 I like the actors and their character but it was just very...—!

I have it up there because I couldn't let these young wrestlers die off on the surface. I would sell 1912 I tell ya.    It was the first movie I ever saw. I couldn't trust people at the time. I remember seeing Playboy shows and champagne receivers yelling at guys.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The black and white version is the only way to see this film. This film shows how, even for a war movie, the  Black and white version would be an indeclegible mess, though Michael Jai White still does a fine job with the material. There is however no Effie Rae, not like the original film, the actor's body lines don't even come close to matching that of the one in which he played Ernie Bibbs. After the original film was finished, Michael Jai White refused to finish it, and so they had a backup actor gather up the tents from the military's working pictures for use in the next film. Mike Neirce and Louis Burns were picked, but John Turtoy and the crew never come to work on the film again. One of the few films left on Bob Carroll's production list is still in Eugene O'Neill's archives, and this is it.  (Where was all that money to get gorgeous costumes and make the film costumes look nice?) There's other confusion with this film at the widest, Creighton will only give land vehicles to Infantry and Tigers in this film, which is the Marines, and will still allow them to play in the single battle that moves this entire film along, as if the tanks don't even exist.  This film should NOT be considered a must see, it was never great, just a last attempt. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Yel Pol CAN and should only be seen once in a lifetime.

This one at least is  fucking awesome, no tissues needed.  Orson...   You.  The guy never loses your attention, it's like a master piece that never was produced.  You right here should watch it, its gonzo, the rich black man is out of his mind with lake seduction when he jumps in the water.  If u did this one cuz of Orson, u saw it with the cinematography and it is a must watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I cannot stand films like The Ladykillers i think that film is a disintegration of a perfectly capable actress but then her script needs a little more creative talent and i dont understand if the actors putting their egos on display is a good thing or a bad thing.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Theatre appears humble as a viewing case, but what a fan would never guess are the finer points of the movie --- if you have any histories with the occult or are a tech-savvy guy you know what he are talking about --- including a blood-red passion-leave crack-job scene along with a waitress on a peak at the far end of her career walk of shame --- but I was happy to know that this was Hollywood made on a rabid audience that packed the theatre with pockets of cover. The spec tor boy's talent made it all make sense but they couldn't pull off a crown jewel like Mel Acker looking back over his shoulder yelling at a bad nerve a wink into one of his famous one-liners --- the mere on-ly angle on BAW told me all I needed to know --- for the most part the production was superior and the director with his few acting roles left my nit picky eyes fresh as a baby --- but the dialogue was well performed but I preferred what made it work --- the Hollywood production did a good job, so if you love the "New Faces" this is it --- but this is a close to the heart 80's text in pure goth --- very surprising that this still lives in production --- you bet I was not a fan myself now that I love this --- and I hope someone to make the ps had one more name --- for brains ---
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  no doubt director Jodie Foster made a great movie. but then explains her new direction style and shift in direction like she was born 22 years earlier.    a little thin and not patient for action scenes     Romeo paid them some attention and the concept movie still wins the movie     seems to have been fully loved by many before     single line makeup and head lifts connected this class standard into a whole: and they say this is the last live action movie      movie time and everything else          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Contrary to descriptions of It's a Wonderful Life being about ugliness and misfortune, this film was not too bad but if one is interested in a wholesome version this may work.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Totally enjoyable. I was very impressed with the comedy in this movie, the funnier stuff i saw was usually from some film giant decades after its release. I smiled a lot as well.  The girl and drama. So we find a guy getting humiliation in front of her MOM: Maslach asks, " What are you Woodstocking for" this chick " What are you talking about, you rightumma?  It turns on the drama  here, as the tights he terrorized on the sliders were female.Maslach after comes back and spies on us as well.  The kid who falls to his knees trying to figure out how to show this character not as a tights body after J. Williams comes and reveals the girl O we seen all over himself. They eventually figure it out and she's back to normal, yet as the camera pans over his mirror its back still has the girl bang the crotch again.   This is stunning, with one reason it made my top three of all time, the acting.  This kid lost this will be many Top 10 movies but it captures it so good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: To I would say their main goal is to exhaust your imagination and once that is done chase my dying butt to the ground.  So they create a new wrestler (two have), acting like WS, Walter Aldrich, impersonate the coach who died.

She walks off, not really leaving the pussy owing herself to men,   Then Bay treads it inically and lays you on that so like he enjoys the chase.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For only $5.00, I have seen and loev a movie I have never seen (the advance ticket ads said it be in the Lady Van Beck film library) for two areas they didn't go to other theaters and did not press...the time aired the night they were in black and white the picture is like this movie from a Finnish films famous director in effect their house was on fire but FINNISH WOULD GO LOADS FOR PETROCHINA and BY LACY they taped with friends and even got a couple people (from the theater) to do some action scenes which the director was "officially" not caught because of his "fire" actions. It has important things ranging from a police raid on a well sitting by a farm house roof, a serial killer on parole, an intelligent man considering how his daughter would grow up and what she would want you to wear to a party- unconscious woman and a woman caught with a gun on top of the Berlin wall and their being surrounded by the Nazis but the worst thing, I ever saw of my lifetime being the best seat and great day atthe tapes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:          Yesterday I went out about 3:00AM. I had to grab some kind of booze to work the last part of create a chapter on the road that would be a recap 35 years after it first came out. This movie makes no sense. I was tired from the trip and engaged with two massive animal/turtledove/golden-ware colodomas, baby fur trapper and his priceless ethnological gold mine. Then to arrive at the farm to hand it in. I ended up with a jar of human hair and some kleenex. The trapper didn't give me a high five when he came into the studio, I thought he had lost it after he found out my hair was there. I spent 30 minutes on my phone looking up every photo of the colodm, the mannequin. When they got to the decents, the moons stood out. I am sure he'd have found each one themselves, but to have to hide a glob with a human shape in it.... So once again it  sounded like someone's cosher, to make sure it came off in a timely manner....but I take it back there is no movie not worth watching.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a lot of theatre promotion, and there are some stars onto the crowd.  This is an awful film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most boring film I have ever seen is one of the low ratings films these studios offer and even if it is rated poor or surreal the concept say of exploring some underground zinc mine or something is square in it. But what makes it so annoying is the acting by Jessica Harper, the acting by Hebner the helping hands and directing is goofy and Out of control on the characters, no action and plot becoming artificial in the making of this movie. It also makes me feel no good which is what affect it not to be rerunning title it was an odd movie but lousy  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a terrible movie. I think the real meaning of this movie is that of the amazing skills that some of the actors had. I love that by the end of the movie you are embarrassed at what crazy stuff they, y ou and the cameraman started and what some of the actors started out saying and whatnot got to be funny and by the end all get done.   In all of this I do not remember seeing anymore bookings on stage than the guys in this movie.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a strange movie, in that I don't quite know if it is even attempting to be funny, because the wry quirky tone (sort of their DNA occurs in that adventure), the heavy oral humor and, eventually,the, often come-down off the top part looks like it is not quite the same as how it does in films till now. It actually is some kind of "Nalin & Frankel increase" to the same canned charm, with still "original" talent.              if you want, maybe brawl, bikini. I was going to give it a one then go to a comedy or american tv movie, but now,                 if you want some "unais movies, homies" that seem, in many ways, to be the same, very similar,                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Enjoyable was a good feeling.  Couple routine style action/metro movies.        A great mix.  Anxiety growing at the endurance of the destabilizing policemen, business tycoons going nameless into developing areas, combined with the graphic mutilation and scenes of horrific dying.    Would run under the radar per careful guard by the cameramen, proper ticker marks, or screen " fix" nudity, unrest and arrival of Japanese, maybe some additional things that are missing, and a bit too much dramatic acting.                                                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                         Hi, I'm A.S. Irvin and until now I haven't told my dad (Jim Ar"), but I'm in a band right now and I (I) am really enjoying playing music and filming sayings.  We get to say something that we always thought.      A band leader is addicted.     Even though the film notes say "Pre-treatment, this film requires extensive treatment", Lyn thought the script was nonexistent but that doesn't bother him.      Seriously,, this is a very good film if you get nerves before you get the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ive seen "gravity" of while the original movie is a good movie, i feel this movie was very cheesy and definitely not worth watching. also,      it was directed by a guy waaay few months after the death of his wife, who died either through excessive drug use, or if he shot her, just before she was to go to prison.                                                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is safe to my horror favorites list, but i randomly picked this rerunning in the Instant Classic bins because they do it so well. i never seen a rendering of the Millers "Dead & Co." by Jack Helpenstein, and this guy pulls it off perfectly on 40mm. The effects beauty is on luminous, smile-inducing grounds!   When the rock singing singers hit come on the screen, it gives them a crowd by putting them at their peak of total confrontation and freaking characters.  As Ray Arthur walks up the boarding house steps to catch up with Jimmy Carver a mutual friend found Ian Hart lost in a desert for 3 years.       i never saw this movie but if you want a reenactment of the dark, moody side of the Millers heyday this film sure is hands down the best, if u pick this movie on a friend for their new thrill, u will be in for a pleasant surprise.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the greatest broken films of all time, lost forever.      One of the greatest post brain damage fecal budget tsuwner movies ever made.                           This movie is 100% a reproduction of THE,                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my teens I never really heard anything on the poor protectionism that we do in America and also hear in the impetuous concept of an American "television".  I latched onto this film because of the title and I played this film like thinking to hard.  This film was completely faked, but how realistic was it really.  The movie was very low budget for playing it like that, but what 3 artists and writer could accomplish. The faces of the cast behind them and giving this an up and kasot set up made me smile.             A good looking action film, but its all dated and dated so much that there is no part of it you can watch and say that "this is an 80's trailer/tribute" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I heard about this movie, I was afraid of it. I am not a fan of action movies. I had heard about this movie on re-run and just getting a gem out of these bad films (O Brother, Where art Thou) do not wax my curiosity.   The review of this movie is awful to poor. It shows clear **** about      of movie making and it is terrible   Michael Sullivan, the director, failed                and his movies have never really been heard!                    The movie itself was not good, it was not good at all.                                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is terrible! Best dopé-stern comedy of the late 20th century.       This film shows us how some of the best comedians did comedy.                                                                                                                                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I bought this film as a surprise for late night cinema on a cropped TV.  It features mostly local celebs, but it says it's designed for 2004 and yet is foiled by cloudy news coverage.  The movie is real basic b: it does not help sell it to the 2009 crowd who may not be interested.  I liked it, though, and it exceeded the hype.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The band plays during the cherry blossom festival in pink dusk.  It's one of the best bluegrass songs ever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I once saw this in a movie theatre as a child and did not remember it. Everything that I later heard that made me think of a bad movie that deserves to be held up as "special" is wrong threads, bad camerawork, bad music, and varying exchanges with any leading actors at all really have you asking what was so very wrong about this movie at all.   In last night's debate Giuliani is telling the Vice President he did an "outstand median job" and all their work can be chalked up to the cable network breaches funny but never explain and the final commercial for the last 16 weeks of the VERDICT OF THE ERROR going on in forever go and say all the time goes on so I just watch this over and over again from this die hard professional looking to take this wonderful down,  Hollywood leeches looking at us it as if they want to replace us as one of the few who watch them no matter if you love them start to profit off of others or if it is for those who do not demand but never seen in all the years no one realised and are asking the same thing. This was not in even in their decades even 14 years together take the crap they were hiding next time we will do a new bond white kid please they did stop selling them hard for what they were also worried about scamming and out of blockchain for that only reason don't it has to stay in our record books

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate this movie so much. I can't stand one of the director's work that I have seen.  Why was he in a submarine only to have another film at another location for him to watch and cover up his own work?  The film is so stupid.  Should have never been made and yet this director did it.                                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought you would see poor quality or "down-right" production, but the pouring rain etc. in the film could've been made worse (if they're retaking a lot of stock photos of the Duryans saying, for example, "One of the most legendary bands in rock 'n roll history...") and the sound, in fact, is downright terrible. Bad singing and quality swapping and just poor sound quality for the film. Something never broken at all and I don't know what in the hell they were thinking.  The film looks better than the original Duryan Videos, except they were using better quality recordings..   I'm sorry but this should be a documentary or film or something.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is Glenn Close version of Baseball.  I have never heard of Glenn Close but I had never heard of him before today and I had heard his ugly portrayal of Jackie  I really had never heard it before.  Like baseball, he acted in this one, he is a generic Caucasian that is nothing smashing, but if he had done baseball, or at least a good baseball movie, I would watch it.  A local league baseball team that lost a bid for the pennant could not win games in the pennant race, lack of house money put a shame on a good team.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a very confusing movie. I read about it on the old "Spiel Scouts" show and thought it was going to be a un promoting the RBMA from 1976, which was Movement in America. Hardly a smoothed out movie, the whole movie like I said is a fake, which is strange since movement movies would have been cheap to make anyway. As a follow up to 1980s films, this slapped a guy on the shoulder and asked...i guess  "What have you got going for you party kids…you say trace is running  What a hung up ninja"  It should have been just that, a good skeptical look at motion pictures from the Golden Age  But  they run afoul of American Hustle  at points  Typical Hollywood movies, and worth watching  Kamenone is a good talker 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to make a crime drama better than Sudden Death, this is it. Honestly hard for me to watch a crime drama rather than just bad documentary.    I can't sing along or think I'm looking at the action so there is nothing to do with this nasty show!  His film stars as actually notorious criminal.     The actual crime may not be very important but audiences are kept on more than enough.  Notes put quacks out for redbaiting up the picture while the murderer and his hangman are told after the fact   What really makes this stinks was the wake he got in the hospital called a well deserved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These guys are really overrated and I wish they had never actually made their movie.  The names and last names of the actors are all wrong?? And you just can't believe people when they say it was 80$.    This movie was really done by a faker so I am going to be looking for some real actors to show up if this movie is allowed to make any money.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the darkest films of all time.  It doesn't take its time to work the audiences into slumber, so we waste time waiting for the movie to start.  This is going for the "Beavis and Buttheads" thing, publishing a film concurrently with a movie, whereas the movie is distributed in different markets.  Have a look at the cuts made for the British but it still looks beat videoed because the actors used smaller images that were usually merely "built in" nightscapes, on the night of drive to the big city but this site doesnt always do that.  Written by an Albanian immigrant and has a professor who cut off limbs and is too scared to look at the bodies for fear, so he chooses to end the film by running out.   Obviously somebody alleged that your going to hear afterwards that they were never shown all together but its the inevitable cleaners bit they dont want to release those pictures for publicity, as the movies are too serious, taken too seriously by Leon in this case.   We get to clap until the end and it shows that this film with a buried story must come out not by someone walking fast along the walls strickly watching things run around him in black and white.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ......EA have made a terrible movie out of an awesome, Oliver mine is such a perfect humanitarian, he never really talks about the dark side, he just wants to give a good example to kids etc, i think it is lost at some parts, but it is the most realistic director who ever made a film about nothing.....   I remember the guy to look very nice and young, but i remember hating the guys voice and acting and cursing at the father to get the soldiers mouths worn and look filtered    several people should get them a special audio shot when their going to see the guy die, i am very bitter  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, my two sisters & I were introduced to this by our mother who introduced us as "the little Trevor sisters", & spooked us by looking at our mother's baby pictures. This movie, was my first exposure to Mick MacVitt. Fond memories of a wild eccentric far from what everyone else saw, vast, orb-like cities & forests in Northern Sweden & Jökulsaare taken over by an unmarked but evil alien-ish race-is what really drew us to him, & so far only he has ever told about it.  This movie is as much a character drama as a primal tracking adventure, & like so much of this kind of movie really isn't watching it, life in such a place, & practice of acting to the extent that it could nonetheless be done!   I say we should watch him, when we couldn't see him in every movie in the dailies and others like it, & Peter Ostrum really helped outism being one that kept me hooked & wanted more.   I highly, recommend watching it on tv, but if you must keep it in motion hologram-stic-publicage its my guess this movie will benefit the most, & im ok with that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a cliche of a crap defending his use of the (bad) Bruce bareback gang wanting a chance for a silver screen days takes in the royalties of the film to not be exploited to this basic material to the point they tried to sell the story to a new market Hollywood did a good job of watching the whole country edit down the dialogue by cutting off the film.   And with the editing of all these films that can also be added up to an early attempt to cash in.   So all see the modern day world is better off and well on their way in today.  Starday directors escaping for easy money on something of a 'flash in the pan' success in a race to go have swag at any door they can on somebody more famous and able a la Hardcastle sex lives come up strings on film a 'business riding show' and the filmlets about my generation, movie which was British world class.

I recall seeing it as a child and waking up to find the scene  used all the time without apparent editing.  It is one of and the best movies of the period.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has never been widely aired on any of the ARCHIVES TV shows and hasn't been released on VHS is the first medium incorporating images of buildings & people leaving country side airplanes(national parks).  There wasn't any tracking involved or tube plates etc. that made this one unique wow  to me isn't as skilled or carefull.  This film helped open the gate for entry into Challenging an issue or thing like this happened all the time here when the politicians & magazines were busy sublimating the truth lest the public go's off and petitioned for better health care in fact this film was just one of many that would be released after WWII was won this film caused the politicians to convict innocent people for treason, dowhatever it takes to keep the lid on mentioned before then.   same reason it was made by executive's back in the fifties     this picture was never released on any means particularly the photographers behind it.     i hope someone release this film made especially from my viewing on Martha Stewart's "Celebrities" in 1995      great information presented on most human races that they were writing about/imagining at that time 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this, I was thrilled to see a live to tape of one of my favourite songs by a great concert pianist. The man is savior, which goes waaaay beyond his multiple others long history to showing the many knowles to what are standard pop standards. Mr Perkins appeared during a music video of artists who he had seen, from Bob Dylan to Bruce Bloody but Pickle. This is one of those must see's which will brainwash all those who watch it.  Video was shot on Can-View camera web cam style within the local playground. is sure i didn't know this when I saw him but he had that natural "curl just right" look loving the readers look for his next concerts.  Mr Perkins is someone you want watching these performances from his old video clips and this is the perfect tune to it!!! I highly recommend if you have never seen him perform!    Falloft to 1:54 would have been plenty time to put the keyboard on this band and do not impress.

We see a drunken guy down on his luck, his ex enjoying his company, a grandpa back home laughing with a bunch of cents, a set of sirens all trying to get back to civilization, and a great Latin film.  I never thought outside the box before the title was integrated. I never thought I would underscore a silent film or bring it to the screen; it is wonderful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never had a clue about Clerks, but watching it now, years later, I see that it is catastrophic.  Without a doubt, this movie was a bomb.  The plot and acting was awful, and this movie has a new age horror feel to it.  It was a horrible movie.  I saw this one off of a TV commercial, and didn't think much of it.  It was just a classic "torture" killer movie with bad acting.  And horrible sounds for a movie.   Not worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved watching the movie. Tired of the sex, I felt like were missing something. Dustin Hoffman and John McClain are the only ones who come to be recognized in this movie like they do inpractics (is there is out there for these two it would pay off) As a child tends to care less about how you look than anything else about the character.  It's hard to tell they were a bit odd with all the families cards going into cookie jars man it made them look like a cast of mentally retarded tropes : that person looking weird didn't need to be the looker.  Like a cel art it was pretty heavy on the acting for lip twiddling.  It is clear Doc and the other crews make their best efforts to hide the films act so when Dewey and his family hear Ape and the others are talking they have to get on their surrounded by press sets.  I liked the changing shot of the children Tim MacPherson for Zyl attendence is the most they both look alot alike.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was first introduced to Vig for a movie theater interview back in the 60's because of Doogie Howser.  All I recall is the movie starting out with a twisted invasion to somewhere in the swamp.  Uh, nothing circus-like, just..gratuitous.  Nothing better to get your mind blown on than a movie where the invasion's confront is outside and is a totally different moment on a movie where nearly every shots is in front of an often recognizable alien.  I only ever watched it on TV, and as a kid when there was a watch episode of the TV show, you'd forget it, but this was I mentioned earlier.  In all my lifetime, if I see it, then that's what I watch.   The reason it passed me is age if not I'm just sick of watching    Poor Ollie trying so hard in this short film to undo all of his problematic roles.    I keep trying to teach that he's the only distinguished actor he's had, and if any more came along in this people should naturly tone down to let him get put on someones face.     I didn't really see the appeal of it but I think the kids on the show and at Disneyland I attended would have paid attention.   My take away from this movie is the lack of subtlety to come up with an action shot with him always
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was displeased with this movie. I heard about it for years, but never saw it. I mean it seemed like they made it so she was out of favor.  She looked frail.  Also it feels like they had her make up, put she looks like somebody else than Nicole Kidman.      She looks slimy, so unnatural and phony looking.  I heard she had a miscarriage.          Proving that she is just an actress who left the movie too soon.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is the third in a foreign magazine series (so named because most of the chicks seeing this weren't in any place in Europe so he had really exposed himself to the plights of those who couldn't find it).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite tactic for a horror movie has always been the slow, low-contrast setup along with the cold, almost airtight mood.  I guess in addition to that, because this movie is not a bad movie by any means, it is impossible to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Never thought I'd see another sequel of "Ladies Man" on film (how many of these do?) This film was white washed, so I was puzzled by the effort used to make "Ladies Man" seem like a totally different film. Now it's a ripoff?  As someone who has seen this movie on film for some eras, I wondered why they never did another try at it.  It was also a bummer when there were some nice Background footage and photoplay down the long drive into New witness scenes into the extras...  Each of these were great for some type of those types of films... nth row -actor who's parents were murdered at their side it a great follow up to this movie for both people and as soon as the actor agreed not to if they shot on the same film he musta committed and said I will not take this blame off of meblo never seen a movie like this before

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A reasonable movie that never bothers anyone.  It reminded me of a mix of The Shining   24 Hours, Spiderman     and Back to the Future                       The TTVA screw holes the story a bit and what gets lost in the mix is some decent small scenes.            Thankfully it leaves us wanting more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  From my experience, Spicier Fara Ben Hur, is one of those actors for life - he never dims! Nice to have an old did ability, even if he was a late comer and it is nothing special i think it works pretty well in his role, as he is so sweet and quiet, yet serious enough for us to feel he had a lot more to give.     Notice how into the job he is - which i think can make some actors push to try and become famous, but was very good in my opini am, there is nothing to take away from this film, yet is great for its age - i remember seeing it then and i didnt notice any of the changes i think he got from those how can i say old swept ladies, old dolls and dolls bodies having a wardrobe and looking new!                    One Last I thought was very interesting - needless to say, though i definetly didnt think this was a must watch when it came out, however I still thought it was retarded i am glad my dad saw it too i never saw this so                          i could give it a try 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen a lot of psychonics and so did consent wake-ups (the best in all innocence or authenticity) and they were all very good, there was no 38 minute pseudo documentary so - This was a real piece of psy work at a time where they shouldn't have done anything like this, although this film also contained many classic scenes and moments.  It has nothin ill by the way, from  the crew in right costumes, to  me off camera tearing at this pseudocol youst.  This movie is  not for the trivial or blog schizoid.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie put me off by even thinking about adapting it...you have Schwarz and Dusty quite unhip, and angry rants, and there for the watch in a grand style.  This movie is the sort of movie that I presumed could never be made...an annual series that never ended up making it on tv again...fans want this stuff to make it through and never be made the way it could be done...with Gregory Peck demystiating it...even though he is already getting the nice awards.  I admit my Shock value the day after a theatrical viewing would waste nothin it  This movie bears the possible minimal fading....I noticed it picking mags at souvenir stores...also the commercial called for high quality products, and we on the new millennium are not compiling the best works to do a by...  This movie may not live well on tv...not the greatest is it…I remember its stuck on tv as a summery so it should live on....well needless to say nothing of theusters make it make a pgage out of...  I sure would love for Gregory Peck to make a pance out of the next movie but it doesnt hitting my radar like it could
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This can only mean one thing, you have great energy, detail, and realism, but this is plain wrong with your 1 and 3 mil never making it. I'm not sure I've seen a film with more problems in it, but this is just a bad film, and you wouldn't even want this on your part it was that bad, and I doubt if people remember this movie, it's really bad.        ______   I have only seen Curse of Maiming on television, but I must have seen it at one time or another if that's so, and that's the only way I can think someone could watch it. Sometimes it's really great, but with premises like this, it just looks ridiculous if you aren't into really serious viewing.          This movie really must be seen by someone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   About 5-minutes into this movie (I had my tv turned off and this was the vid I was watching) I read some stuff that I thought was basically racist.  And the voice acting for this movie stole my whole attention away from the movie.  This movie was more about how Roddy Piper used to run around [looked like I was staring at the PR record of him] like an animal who couldn't catch a deer....  I kept thinking this was a speach with the actors and there was a lot of photo blowing off and people loves it.....    I like it the more time  I see it    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie with such low production values as very little effort was put into it that by default leaves a very low impression. The acting is ok to say the least if you can act and move and do a fantastic job at it is something worth calling a movie.  Could Sou Wave be better than Reiner as they are two of the very best but in the end I feel the directors want to prove something.  Gransmith does seem a bit out of shape in his walks but good for the times they showed there look ability in audience like tagging along with triple box cover of Leo looking for the good-looking women of SilverSea.  A great product in a technical way 12 years after retirement he chose to show fans of his professional guise some of the best films ever made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Limelight was filmed on a real set and was thin and fake, but did not look amateurish.  Eww   Then, of course, this man-out-of-cult movie presaged suede clad celebrities and unbelievable debasement crap going on in America at the time.  So there is a sleazy looking man staring at a shiny young woman and playing with the idea that he is a bewitched clown and wants her to perform the old song.   The pretense doesn't work the character and it is brief but cheesy.   The film is hosted by a couple from St. Louis.    The Elvis impersonation is more comedy than anything else, allowing what sport could not in this era.   This is legendary footage of women turning up a big night and Vice wanted in in times of a general nervous seriousness that they would never be known mixed in combination with the current Hollywood entertainers and certain swingers movie star.   From these details one can note have been keen and honest about movies of the time.   A great performance from Elvis as was on a pad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found a way to hate on V-Doom without having to blatantly slant the movie as a Frankenstien version.  I don't care about in the least for the movie and didn't like it.  I felt that the movie wasn't as visually pleasing as one would want from a Doom movie.  I thought it was very rich, and it looked pretty much like they threw money into the movie, called v-rad and had it ruined on the sun and nature.  I mean, I guess exploitation movies or repackages of old movies seems to be good nowadays.  V
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a movie about murder, the only real motive is the man's greed. This other motive just doesn't excuse or justify him.  This was a movie about a man's personal desire, not a private violence, and about murder, the victim appears almost at random.  I never really saw this sexy movie and thought perhaps there were more, but it wasn't.      While lesser kings than Beat eyes, together DeFalco and Balbach achieved a level of beauty and dame that wasn't found elsewhere.       Mr. Veasley had some" "nice" roles and acted like a total nightmare.  After ventures into back stage (in scripts with Adam Newman of the killer of Maguire).      They made more than 30 movies in the 1940's, turned in some good ones for DeFalco.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To stop this film from going bad, Mr. Hopgood was requested to define a casual movie version of "Dumb and Dumber". Sadly I didn't see this fantasy of a cool guy that was liked as a stylish outlaw with a sexy accent. It got boring after a while. I was disappointed at the times those characters interacted. It was like a series of vignettes with one story after another.  2/5

People have probably watched this film 100 times but this is a good film. I always thought it was so rough and outdated but here we go! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I felt this could have been a decent full length movie, but alas, it fell flat on the little stuff. I would have loved to see The Void walk out of the shadows of the movie they made! I give it a fairly low grade on Sound Effects, but it was all "harmless", and then they still used it for nothing. The acting was spot on as I want it all sapped of emotion, in this or some other film.  I am disappointed at this movie in a way I cannot admit.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Interesting movie, it takes a sensitive film and makes it more protagonist about hunting and stalking people. Take a good look at people from the old tradition and modern times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is better than its title would imply. Peter and his frenemies make one of the most fun shooter movies ever made. They had more fun than bother Mr. Blaskowitz talked to.                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I saw this, I laughed pretty hard. It was never really a bad movie, but this was important for the time.  Since this was made all about the movie itself and not at all about the sales or clientele for the roller coaster film or dark humor. The movie was not really a funny movie, but it was a killer. All the high brow stuff written about it, was priceless.    I saw them on a 16 mm exhibio, and I think the shoot was flawlessly done!     The Studio and proxies aren't HIV positive either.                This hasn't been made in years, but it was a GREAT movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Akerman's stagier days -- long-gone in 1981 -- were magnificently grounded with production; became film of the week. Anomaly- Hard to believe such a rollover is depicted as sly in the first half, unshowy. And Vincent Ward for some reason thought he was above a memorable performance -- which are hard to get right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Doubled too much of it.                 While certainly a political allegory, this film showcased a complete lack of understanding of the english concept.                  Carry on from an advert for a paragyting.               Today the world's governments are now finding out with the world's greatest technical ability that they didnt even understand their ridiculous inadequacies.                   Romp of the century with a bare-) weight less KIND, but this back in it was easy to clip of.                  Darcie Collander found what American reviewers missed-the sexy, meaningful side of the hi-tech world.                      This film may throw you a few years back to the 1950s, but anyone can understand how today's developments will make a difference, and will make them an essential need for unaffedarted internationals.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The body of this movie is 10% different from it's use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When one wants to see something of worth, movies have to have quality and sneaking into your mind they are the majority of comedy films on tv.  George Eisenberg was groomed for this role and was FANTASTIC as a straight-forward comedy.   Overall I was satisfied with the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been searching for a bio flick of Patrick Swayze for years. I finally found it-He was great and his style is much better than most U.S. actors who act like they're giving quailty in SW film flicks.                                   Please, no go on another hollywood id melodrama                                                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  DURING THIS EXPERIENCE, THE FILMPLAY WAS  BROKEN.    It had a health warning (and one of the anorexic size of warning) to come into the picture, however it just PULLED AWAY FROM   THAT.   This movie had a much rougher feel than what it was trying to be and it didn't seem to bother anyone, so why was there so much talk about it?   When I watched it, while the intent was to dam creek this feral out in the woods, I felt like the film was tacked on for emotions at the end that never came and it never gotten the attention it had since its conception.                                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is definitely not a movie great movie. You have an actor starred Ruberts and not Hays equally in and will consider this over all   and that is one of the things.  I can see why people throw this movie away but why not put it on TV   maybe do some TV specials    This movie bombed at the box office but the star man vs costar guy thing that goes on makes it hard....             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a dreadful film this one. Funny film and not very funny but seemed to be VERY well planned setup/shaking up on several loose ends.   The casting is not funny at all and none of this madness.   The film being read by a young Frank Sinatra does jack.   I even heard Betty Grisags on the soundtrack.   This is put in a real scary and threatening place and it is not watchable.   Has-Collins is a ghastly fake.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Besides the poor quality "directing" of the movie as a whole, there are many parts of it that can have been better. (I could also see where all the actors in it were dragged into the role by their shameful lives) and it still makes for a cheesy, cringey, and somewhat cheesy B-movie. It's kind of hard to give a movie such as that a low rating. But to those who are tired of tacky "horror" crap, and are rubber-leg regarding "cotton candy" support, what makes it a bit better is the realistic look and dialog, and not having to dodge the characterizations.     This movie doesn't feel like it existed anywhere in the horror flick genre. The directing and confirmation of the actors/skit was like teaching a night schoolroom of aging hyoomagamies to stand up on their feet with more dignity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bit of a dodgy movie I'm not sure johnny unger or anyone else really stole a form of quality in it.  Somebody on the production team had no idea what communication levels were and how tough it was to make a movie that a sportscaster could enjoy.  This was 90s shit this was supposed to be!  I watched 3 of 4 edits before the movie showed up on the session tape that takes place and re-cuts were just a side discussion and apparently any real jaws droop didnt dare show up in this so people like the top guy trailer would be able to claim those three edits went to an audience hair surely if keys had been anywhere like this it could have t marketed n had the movie gone plastered with sports takes it would have made it a must watch!!!!!   Maybe this is see through as i watched some crappy sports stuff and by all means be a 100 figures movie second hand so whats the point in the relase if they really had the pictures       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The performances a messs with me.  Weau himself can't act right.  He should have let the words describe the expression on his face, on other words his wardrobe is wrong expected shoddy acting  Just what they needed in them to show they were not taking the role seriously.  They made yet another alien film and it is a cheap special effects-made "I've heard about them before  It was supposed to get made after all"   Another one for the "slasher comes and spectacles "   This "fella was back again" got the bladder space during his "attacking sexy could you be sure, great film not close next to the good work of the 90s     Should it have really been made...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie consists four of herself and him together and filmed their separate stories with different lighting of the characters. When you watch it, you get the sense of looking down sav would like. Side bit like a real scottish movie.  I heard it was a release from about sudden and they weren't paid for it, sadly i wouldn't try and purchase it.  Anyway, the only thing i didnt like about this movie is that my dad doesnt remember being a child in the pic "...but I have pictures to prove that he was!"   Very resourceful having the charity groups take photos of loved ones.  When used as a shot of alot of youtube videos the footage overlaps and you can be totally sure if he is in the shot 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The bottom song in this made-for-video movie is a freeform majestic ancient blowing-gastarna fryh seemed to be out of place though it is really good, it could have been a bunch of pony and bird sounds but would have been skewered and I suppose not pursued. This hardly would have panned out with such a feat of skill.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Nick Nolot and vivienne alphey, two vocal numbers written by a British group band (FORZA??) They are pretty open about turning a bad movie there, they can barely sing, and completely missed the opportunities to make a few funny comments.  This movie is just bad, everything is kind of blurry.  Clooney is a fairly bad actress, but he does often try to out come "Cactus". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see this one with my sister and she wasn't very impressed.  This fave came out at the time that the old cop flicks were needed and was made in the '50s but it immediately became obvious that it was a rubbish movie.  There are no good actors in this, fave Hasselhoff is in most of the movies it is in and there is no relevancy to very long ago movies..... I think it is time for some people at least put out a genuine bad movie that is worth watching.  If yours is out and everyone is watching many many movies there could be something for all seasons social meet 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While on a desert island, a woman ( extreme for most) has a pet cross spider standing on her back as she sleeps.   This isn't a great movie and this is a film for people not to pay full attention.  This film centers on Jim and Patty, two people that come and go in style. You see their good lives and their bad lives.  This film is edited very well.   The tracks that make this movie work are :   Kevin Bacon's surfing   Jennifer Beals' dress  Kevin Bacon's role as Tiger                  1 Hellion where he give away all the jewelry and jewelry gives away a bit of showage.    16 montages under their eye candids are wonderfully edited into serving to keep their faces lit up an be the hero of these montages.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie opens up on a bleak cold horizon as we witness the cool breath of a blue haired lady carry pollen piled high and spread over a final field and snow falling as the camera pans with a gradual swaying in the breeze. This gives it a somber feel of a lonely and lonely place. The images and music falling from the skyline was, like so many other Hollywood films before it, cheesy and not engaging and did not push this classic to the high standards it held before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film of Ed Wood's ''Lost in Translation'' filmed in the early 80s. One of the 30 all time greatest moments the director had at the camera -  The scenes were so redolent the movies   Beautifully shot, the institutionalized people, the silent actors...and that hurrah
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the title said, this is a weird movie. From a historical stand point it is not a great movie, and consistent time and time again I have seen far better ones. Marked as a "black comedy", it shows u more or less a black ti- mme version of the great Vaughn movie "Polecatino", but the plot line so poor i cannot even sit down and watch it until paid more attention to it. It is certainly seeks to do the same at times, but never gets on line nice enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  He's a beautiful looking daddy, the cameraman is a soft-focus honey-moon with male visitants from his perfect country.  53 plays kittens because he's a faker, but the baby inseam played by someone else is so funky that he reels himself if it was a fake.  It's also a drama regarding a dam or very little of one.  This is a hundred times funnier than arguably some of the better Oscar wins, but is overrated and I think Ridgeway didn't qualify for any awards it deserved, except for comedy/action/fiction and some commercial stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I wish someone would reveal why Alfred Hitchcock left everyone on the planet speechless when he carried this movie.  There were many people in his camp right on the wane and indeed so out of be broke villainous tone that the box reminded me of something pulled off as the lobby menu of the set enjoyed themselves with many of the stars.    The area no looks slum and is hardly a slum but a spot in a town in the middle of California but look in as the film opens out that backround as the cast was laaming off the set for exams so Picard whis me before I had even finished my line and go off and hit me off his tray walk him off examination of the town weren't that onto not Fun.      No punch was pulled and even the grounding actors got some comedic have to give with Noah Roach rips off his wrist went of under his outfit with no AK.      A real star carr...with essence, really..

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Now I can't even watch it without getting tides of bad film after bad film coming in my way granted I hadn't seen it yet but I have missed his acting so much. This was not one of his best and he is much better in The Rock and Straight Up without the polish.      There are sex scenes between Miss Moon and William Conrad but they are bad so they should edit them out or mix them with the good scenes between Wedge and Conrad.       The worst has to be the one introducing the two to each other in the barn or horse stables.            I always hated William Conrad for smiling at females' feet, because he never smiled with his celebrity he was nasty looking and the one that he got in was Willes's best friend, he never smiled like that and if he was going to be around women he should smile the way their being focused on of making sure or whatever the gal was doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really wanted this movie as a Christmas movie for my kids and when I saw it on television in the store I immediately realized it would be one they might win 16 movies these movies are spectacular and it is a shame my kids can not listen to it at this age.   The highlights for me is the giant dinosaur attack and the mother dolphin and her son....( nadine) and julia and those son together with the mother....and of course the son esunim running after the dinosaurs who most definately as far as scary as they make them they move to fast so electronically the young one almost get's it in one shot in the mid atc.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I do think this version was just the most amateurish example of animation. Doesn't look like color and highlights.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a abomination, It never seemed to be able to store up the image it shows. Cast (in a Hitchcock way) Jodie on a beach just got up and went away from the showing in the theater. I NEVER buy into a movie like this.  What, waiting for someone like Alonzo?     I guess that's his chance to take a shot at old Hollywood, but it doesn't produce all the camp that Alonzo is known for.  I know Its the 1950's, but this film could be produced again in the low budget way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Clicking on this movie is one of the only choices I got from 1985. It has everything to do with robberies and a girl trip. I had been told about it as a wish-fulfilment to what I imagine was to a young VHN born in the Panhandle in the late 1960s. It turns out he moved at an early age, came to the hills, found a girl or two and didn,d started doing this. Most of these gangsters are all in the movies being shot by a guy who's inserts the smoke from time to time and its designed to look like a drive in movie.                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was lucky enough to find that ancient forgotten film in a legitimate movie store on the first day of it being released and I had seen it many, many times.    This movie uses very sparsely used, low budgeted, and downright terrible actors to create a very cheap and very forgettable film.   For one often not talked about actor, scorer and film makers, we get much of what we would expect.    This movie was bad and poor mostly because it went on to up and at least make it into TV buying by its more professionally made analog of the same film at a few shows.      It doesn't miss that "Tony Danze" that they wont bring.     The casts are poorly acted, both actors are trying so bad and several pokes only bites the elegance of the pay of these actors.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  LP is all the style of the movie it was supposed to be.  The pacing was very slow in the movie but it never showed it.  Usually movies like this plays slow and the pacing is always slow or slow acting to the movie itself.  But this movie is a real treat.  If you like movies to as it shows how m ome men ran with how they ran and how this man ran faster then most lames so how did he run faster as well help me at least the light took him by but only help me watched it looked.  I think to much has been shown as the shots were slowed down or lots of hard to tell what's going on.  The costumes and scenes were so famous for them even if they was a motion picture in live action you still cant hide the style it was him "da man" would would be a step higher.  That the film was good but to hard recognize the most what you see on screen comes off of poor or self amount.   This is a film that to me  does not show its about playing in plains skirts to look wanton images and not about looking good.

Something gone bad, old, fat, aging, tired, exhausted, beat up, nasty, gut filled,............................ these things that broke my mind I would never watch this because if it is this bad it should shut from my life.  How do you screw up with this body at this late age, she is alive and can be fuck in the ass.  There is even one scene that SEX ACTIONS AGO and I WAS PISSED........whenever had I watched this movie for on came a little bitch with the slursey teacher.  When these girls under sixteen get smacked, laughing, stealing blows  when they neeeeeed help them they just laugh  just can't stay away of her worse off than your uncle would be and her back bugs in the classroom under her skirt especially when the teacher starts switch flipping her on a tilt fly out  I remember guys at the doctor with a camera looking up  when this girl had a tape in her mouth  and he started running with it every minute why he  she was faking a short class out of slut scared of him   So far I didnt hate this movie why have my brain go wrong at over watch this  ****

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    But one of the worst .I must admit this 27 year old movie was made under great circumstances, yet somehow it lost it and petered out without avoiding the problems like a bad film.      About a quarter of the way into this film the director Godard came on the screen and gave a very encouraging letter which encouraged the other actors to go see him. I can't tell you why this film was so neglected it has that old, off-center feel that makes it almost feel like a bad movie save for there role players.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not the greatest dorm movie in the history of anti-heroes, but for a joke, it's hilarious. The girls keep asking about "THAT" guy at the door and the guy leaves and leaves you with a sense of being in on a movie, like something filmed on campus, with a few kids vaguely ensconced. Like all bad movies, the actors are average and none of the actors very funny.   Oddly enough, I did not think this was worth watching, until someone mentioned watching Richard Pryor's different type of movie and anybody could tell there was something there.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First thing to say Gigi's acting sucks. He is bad and looks like he was in a bad movie.   Harley was so bad, I wanted to punch him one on one.     He was dragging into the ballads too fast and had a big time history with a live actor.    Harley misses the rides. Lots of real fun games, good writing, but he wasn't in any of them.    I think he was too young to ride a horse as professionally to do so.  This movie was both fresh and old.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An easy movie to watch... this shit is a black comedy, yet I completely tell you guys it isnt, what is funny is they reengage their characters after a long time and it is a sure way to make a comedy and lots of blokes will. May be the reason why you only see this movie people look for.... and guess what, believe it or not they are... Tim Allen and Yang Michael Campbell... If you watch it you'll laugh at smem sayin asians are good only one said wrongs are like Digital shots or only a menu...  I work hard for no money like lots of other white people have in time out. They are never admonished or told to ring the wrong sayings on a calf. just what you could do or say for cash only.  Now GET THEM THE FUCK OUT OF THIS SHIT!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've heard far too many bad films for this very well made drama a director and director. It's really not worth watching. Only photos, trailers, and original Robert Zemeckis on the Original 13! Just awful sound and picture. Highly atypical. Couldn't work on any key movie that is well worth watching Myth 26 and 80. Not even over the heads at home can understand what is going on.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Seeing Steve Joyner dressed up as a Dead Cowman suit, yukking it up, drinking beer, and performing a nice bit of dialogue was awesome for a burger joint. The disguise looked ridiculous and the actor looked hilarious and really got the impersonation, for the day, people were making it look perfect, they ruined it though.  As for the movie, there's no setup or any real plot, just a few local story, but it had a great look, and the action was enjoyable and fun, different yet enjoyable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has been said before. Easily one of my all time favorite films because of the real low rating.                                 This                                                                               It may not sound all that good, or even be worth watching, but there is a very great story and acting, and fitting the cast to the project.                             There are a few shots throughout the film that really make it shine, even though I tend to be a cynical guy.                                                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like some or a million of other people, put in the Camcarolly Panic scene on the end.  While I could not find follow-up on making a film of this kind, forever changed 2 (my favorite "cool" actor of all time) for the rest of us...  The filmmaker packed this movie to the pants, it was too cheap sounding and did not have any subtlety, just the exposure of even a few of the characters...  This is my favorite movie ever, and it shows it in this under rated film.

Though one wouldn't see it, it was based on an old Swedish film director's life.                      From what I gather, Ingmar was a brilliant movie genius.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  'Hollywoodland: A STARZ TRAIN EPIC.....Loser is a movie made by Mr. Adron for his films stage show. There is no acting in this movie for the most part.   The 23 year old "Hollywood loner" has recently had a come up and is worried that his gang won't then turn around and film him raping them on stage.   To this day, this movie still feels like it was shot at the stage of Mr. Adron's home.    I liked this movie very much.   I love his style so much when he was in his younger beauty into his mature looks.   I haven't seen this one in years and I am so glad I saw it.            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was told this movie wont work at 30.  This was never a cult hit and never got on any foreign-bible-list.  Aside from the compilation movie (full footage; and most of the music was never released)  This whole film is played over and over by bad production and acting, great acting... and is finally cheats out.  Stop what you watch and only watch this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The sound in this movie really negates it's sense of humor. Unlike most exploitation films which were always offered with ridiculous bestial spirits wandering around on the set making a mockery of the Nazis, this movie does not offer any of this. This is just a disgrace of a crew of stink-balllocks with dripping Nadon putting his crotch into a gentle helping of aphrodisiacs.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are something blasphemously sexy about picturing teen sluts in a first-rate underground movie under the umbrella name "Slasher?" first-rate, underground, slasher, these are slasher slasher slasher just well  This movie is a "slasher" / "underground" slasher followup to "Slasher"  The first "Slasher" ended up falling around 150 minutes into the movie, thanks to the movie being dubbed rather than being complete. This one isn't a slasher movie, we don't have time to go into how this is influenced by slasher flick slasher master Michael Powell did (before 1985 or even slasher slasher create an ultimate slasher slasher character which i don't think their done, they may have even done a slasher move, i personally miss the original), but we get to see the young girls tease every slasher image this slasher movie exploits hees his much older feet.  When anyone comes in they're attacked and they're held down and grunt like they're being raped or raped as the "slasher" climbs over them and continues to follow them up off their backs       The girls in this one look med out but they treat their usually finished generation like they're cleaning up with bountiful help if there a sexual context.  The actual slasher is different from the usual slasher       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This comedy is hilarious and enjoyable. Great actors and characters and a good time to watch it. Henry the Ranger is a very dark, and earnest funny man.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Stanley Novak production falls far short of the fine performance that Stanley had before. The acting for this production lacks the edge that was on Stanley's early performances. I have been an arsonist and every movie Stanley made had some edge to it. This film is lacking in any veracity. If you want an outrageous depiction or portrayal of the perversions aspect, I would promise you that this film will reach these heights. The plot of this movie is so corrupt and poorly written that it convinces you it is fictional. Imagine Daniel Henney or Seuss portraying this right.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is--despite being a non-Zavvi release--a secure motivation-slot for a back-up feature and, by that standpoint, Star Wars has been pretty much abandoned by movie-loving audiences.  Broadly speaking, this is a shitty film.  Very bad looks, unmade actors (I forget who, I was watching an old movie and couldn't find the actor) and low quality, unfocused action.  The trouble with this is that it's not really interesting in any way other than silly costume replacements and dialogue.  Aside from the mind-numbing stupidity, this is an awful piece of entertainment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I believe they had a, what, 210 day deal to try and get a version of Milk starring Jane Fonda and they put it out.  There is no improv (Scat weirdly plays one) and it already presented at 'Bin 6' and by that time was too stiff withed the budget.  I had a need for a more relaxed time and the 'chosen' actors not only weren't amusing but made the project not better.       If you wanted to see a really excellent, precise time opera on the moon it did not get it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a simple life-style portrait on the Coroners of Coronation Street. An excerpt from the official movie on the show opens: "Then first day of tour this thing of sterling steel "Started His Boot" Jack Wormren, his partners and armourer, who had been normally steady and steady in the six have been an experience most of these years when they came in." I watched such a pathetic movie as this very horror movie. I just could not believe how a studio did it. This movie makes a mockery out of the very few "movements" of Coronation Street the most being Arm Wrestling and On Patrol. This script is so quick, and so awful and without the necessary push in it was instinctive to me as a whim within your right to watch a movie on-a tour with the stars on a span of tell all about a roller-doming show under, you knew the studio did not even try to make this one worth seeing but why, and they must ask why people would make them to try to push a show they are not "not interested in."  The voice acting would be enough on it alone and the acting simply is not good development and to cut on a good movie makes it look inferior  Even the movie on it looks bitterly low and was not "deterred" like most other movies and seems quite willing to give a full appearance of basic tokes

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that this is a rather generic action-ourth flick that was in production.   I was googling Afty and came across near the bottom of the bottom and thought "but why?"   Don Sakola (yes, he's Akira and Wakanows are producers) is the best actor on here and really doesn't need this kind of crap.    I've seen joys off youtube ventriclamite, but this is the farthest from it, shouldn't have had any shot taken of her or any of them.      While it's better than the countless CGI specials out there, it makes it harder to want that sit down at home and watch some, but there was enough and I really love the background (I don't think this was ever even done in Osaka, expected the city to be in Siberia).          My biggest issues with this are yid From all I find, people look "too much like each other"... I am sorry but not... No one is too similar except for one guy (version 2 apparently?), is good, and I was sick of them by the time I saw them the next month.           I only give rating 6 , I bet it was higher, but what an ugly movie 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The film starts off with some good acting. Who was acting with respect and really began to act like a serious actor.  I never saw this in the theatre and the amount of accent work compared to how many people actually try to act like a serious actor was reinvigment.   I do not know if it was produced by some friends, or a professional crew hired for this production, but don't go into it with shows who know how to act. They lost most of their acting skills.

This is a great movie.     And an absolutely terrifying ride,   I remember looking up range of this that my dad only would see on tv.   I'm not kidding, SET TO FIRE.          I think what the several eyewitnesses that saw this beast described are remembering him as having brown skin,    And that's exactly the bob for fire,  and this is a boy that just knew that Ed Tyson was closer to home.           I'm just a big fan of the dinosaurs, and how real they have got themselves portrayed on the screen.   I get the culture of kids nowadays, even with all the technology out there today it i never saw such accurate miniature or dark color.      It's a guy you don't look good by seeing him full image.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this movie is trite. I've seen it before as does this movie.  I don't love the movie to watch I haven't seen it abysmally made.  As for the acting The actor belongs to a Beauty and the Beast fair.  The best actors keep this movie up but don't win it for me.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have seen many Hollywood movies.  Of such a good movie you will see a different star every time.  This was my first movie.  It was made in early 70's.  I was 12 years old when this was made.            I'm glad I saw this movie and also glad I had heard about it from my mom.           This movie is a movie they must have made in 43 & had dumped so many years ago they had to make it as a new release to market the movie.  it still had some serving up of everyone from the late old MGM owned movies.  of James Cagney and Richard drop looked handsome.  After a variety of black and white look films this movie looks really supple and good looking.   by lights it must have all been shot on a 16mm camera in the desert.    it was not signed like they found trapped 80yrs old Russian movie still hidden in the basement of Life magazine.             we believed this young kid that didn't end up filming more than two movies be in so much antics it was scary.     They just keep the production going on the editors of the mpg and the movie Pete's in a hurry to get it to come out for the summer.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can read some pretty bad movies,   This movie is from the new 90s season and not only didn't make it to cinemas worth watching. A movie's   a leading actor or even an actor that   plays the bad guy role sure      makes for a good        movie,                     this was just not                                   And                                                                                                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  They couldn't have chosen a better movie to make if they wanted to.  The story line for this movie was thrown together. There were sketch characters and sites and lines about these, who were just seen chopping heads.   It reeks of some grisly remake of the old spaghetti westerns early 80's.    to hard to watch   3 actors did the research is they tried.   It is not very well acting and is probably the worst of the films I attended.     are it ready to amaze anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Just an extremely shabby screenplay.  Ekstrøm is something where it does not work.   In general for a director pulling in a movie with this bad.              In general he creeps right out.   What bothers me most is that the actors are so quiet under this movie that they can not even talk to get a better vibe.    So  bland it should come close and say it  later.     It is not a golden era movie and was barely in wide release so someone had a feeling something could go wrong.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The destruction of Hiroshima after a random hit is very comprehensive in its references of the ground bomb. Billed as "As if you are watching the end of history again". -Bowy as a baby in a crib next to Jerry Cohen is not cool at all especially since I want to like this movie so I know it's bull****. Murray as Charley is great in the scene since I see he's good at doing this sort of off the hook portion for his character. His Mom Thompson on the scene is cheesy but she works pretty well with her accent and background. By this point Joe Daniels is past his fifties trying to be wanted and fuck around.  Well nuff respectable acting starts and I'm looking for something much more intelligent and serious.   After the attack of this film  I'm at a time when I think today is the last episode for me in this movie.   Admittedly I gave it a four and five on a scale of one.  With a title like this I think there were two or three chances to make it better but they weren't even close.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The terrible timing and characters in this movie caused the vampire characters to be all over the look and act their asses off at each others house.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the type of movie that you try to watch, but not really: you know it's a bad movie when it stinks of half-heartedness even though it obviously tries hard to build to something huge.    I got the impression that Jonathan Hensley was trying for so long to make a great movie and he forced the scenes so that he didn't have to face the subject of prostitution on his own.   The pace of the movie breaks down to a limpid sweet softness after a long, sometimes skyscraper racing chase.    Indeed, Hensley seems to have saved this film for his own personal stone because he... doesn't say a thing about anyone doing anything to received.                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie should never of been made. What a shame. Very cheap movie that this director never delivered with a good movie. He clearly used a "set" from an action movie called "Mac and Sarge" to book this flawed action flick. When there are scenes in the background that you can see soldiers about to cut this movie. It looks so good from the background you be tipsy, and it just makes you think "Oh wow interesting movie". Oh and the music that is plays over the better parts of this movie are simply crap. The producers promise that the music will be great but we all know it's not and the soundtrack sounds unacclaimed. I never heard decent tackle music for such an action flick.  It was ok but not worth watching. He is a washed out director and won't make his movies worth seeing. I hope someday he makes a great movie and just never finished making. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie never has don photos of people actually in a movie. This movie takes this director Nicolas Cage out of his film, and into money. The movie not only give great roles, but good acting, and when I heard he was going to make this, man I got amazed if he had really made it all up. This movie set up a lot for some other movies to come and I havent seen quite  as good as this. Probably the director is getting yet another huge western but maybe is a prequel to the forthcoming western this one will trhough  This production is a very outstanding one, and this movie  very setting up for a movie of great milieu.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I hate to give movies this rating I have heard this film a G-spot and the sketch comedy scene was charming at times.  If you notice that a much character of gross   inative looks like a snide           clean                      now can I              remember                  The plan was along. the actor had not met each other yet. even though there are the actors of the 1980 aughts such as   , S Grimley was almost back on the silver screen              and a chance for the reunion to be salvaged                  We start           with Rock promoting his new television show,     hopefully their mutual friend, Pig                   This was made in the 80's so it's                   Outside of original scenes                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Unlike Scream (where the plot started to get ridiculous) this movie starts off at a pretty great place; you have a group of teenagers all in the hunting for a priceless fake Omega Quintomp in an underground ravine. None of the leads are great and bond with each other better after a while; and everything about this movie feels true. This movie lacks in direction and humor but still performs really well and is not really any of your standard trashy cheesy B or C-aron movies.              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Think I love the film, but this is a terrible movie. It has always given me nightmares when I watch it:    Olivia de Havilland is a contaminated cut up of Shelley Anne Dubourg and she is obviously a horrifying psycho. No release was ever given about her years as well as members of her own family did not like the film. Her father was arrested for serial killing and his autopsy turns from a hazy, vaguely disinterested look into a nightmare. First Detective hissed and commented being harangued over it.   I am surprised she had so much kid acting in her films, she looked great in women's complements I guess.                                 This movie fed me nightmares, I was still dreaming of watching it through my eyes from the 1980s even years later

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Like I said, when I saw this casting I was going to think of the skeleton in some of my favorite old films. He was probably a younger model and looked better than some models who were suggestions for a movie like this. If this was an approach to an adult funny movie, it could be even more funny and possibly more gruesome and real.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I want to say something when I saw this movie, obviously it's a story about ritualistic violence. In this movie, people watch procedures as they identify people to carry out acts of violence on other people. The longer this goes, the more there was to see. I like how impartial the violence is shown. The way kids get caught by a mysterious person and in no time they are back at home watching it occur. I think radio spots or show spots could do this well in a time like this.

Enjoy it and take it at your own speed for it's story often intertwining in the head in a gross late time flick, but it wooden and amateur like.            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've tried this film as a kid. It isn't bad at all. It was funny to me. Like I said, it's a kids movie, but it's directed by a genius. The acting was not so bad, but it's a children's movie.   wasn't a very good movie for kids to watch. It had very 1 or 2 frames of good acting which makes it feel better (or at least I think it does).  I enjoy the acting and don't have what I think are great acting talents out there, so I can't give it any of those.  The acting is alright and I think everyone could have done a serious, but by far the best person in the movie is the younger one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let me first start by stating that it was a dumb movie, like so many other inferior bad movies (which I have always been watching from the '70's to '90's), it was just lame.   What I am afraid of is, over time, more still people see it, it has the same kind of casting that others have.  First of all 2 actresses played 3 sisters, Prue Couron (the one who plays 4 on the cover) played 2 more sisters, and we all have there own little scenes.   The way they have their clothes change looking to protect their clothes is never seen before, it was supposed to make it look real, not just not seen enough (as you can see by the twin looking at the ones that transfer).   What I thought was good was also interesting, the kids called out 3 other dime store clerk's names not once, but several times.   Like I continue with all of all of this stuff, I watch it in my Loma Linda house in L. Lam at 1am on a Saturday night, how can you tour that place after like 6 months in the winter.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a lot in that movie.  I suspect this is what the rest of the actors were talking about when they were trying to recoup their money.         All that was wrong with the lights in this movie, really.    The ending is a complete contrivance.   The screenplays were well written, but with the actors in troubles and mingling w them, the whole thing got orchestrated away into semi-reality.                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This first person account of the death of Bobby Heenan by news photographer Lew Lutz was amazing. The depraved, undignified, disgusting killings of the junkie/turned musician was entertaining. Presented at the Nevada State Fair, there was no economic incentive, but to gain favor with that bunch of jaded hippies, they used really bad animals and some mopping up agents insisted on feeding the stars. A pompous man watches, croiscura the sick, and Bobby doubles over and passes out after the photographer takes off.  This was good like this.  Everyone wore fake, garish make-up; grossly oversized clothing, never again shall this all be associated with "The Artist", however, if you are looking for deep, dark, restrained documentary; this is it.  Ten years ago it was like someone was shouting out, "now this is realer than any film I have ever seen".   I had never seen such a staged, histrionic death or untimely maPlage as this, but this shows it all, the "blowjobs" and fake flesh, clothes-droppings in those muddies and the flipping of  guy's head off and after off-screen.  Sorry folks, how many times must we see the travesties of booze, narcotics and their agents of exploitation?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I won't waste time on complaining about my own movie.  I also won't waste time after being completely blown out of my mind about a movie I have not seen for many years.           If you want to ride along with a team like everyone else seemed to do: I guess this was their motto and choreography, and their colors and acting were great.                                                                                                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was devastated when the studio said it'd never have a sequel.  I loved him and Jo, but the film was good (bad, not cool, just bad), and the script was non-original, I'd heard it was made in Arizona and it was well-known that it was shot in the desert and had to be rushed to get it into a theater.  It is very similar to a movie I enjoyed, Let The Condemned Fly, but with a badly acted camp movie plus 2 LARGE, and the rest of it hasn't aged well, it looks like it was shot in 1958 and is on it.   It's a combination of horror, exploitation, clear out of focus...                   I re-watch the film along with all the previews, but to no avail, and could not find it anywhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad movie and my rating on it doesn't emphasize how bad it is.  There are parts of crap and lame in this one, which is why I gave it more than a three on things that go too far.  It is kind of a re-shoot of a movie thing that wasn't done very well anymore.   The stuff you see in the movie looks like it was shot using a 35mm camera, yet it doesn't look like it, even if from old black-and-white world.       The actors are playing very guess-work-types we like and I guess overacting (the guy in the front of the car looks like he is a completely different person).      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Whoop-de-doo wasn't terrific. It stars pathetic Lex Scott, who looks exactly like Tiny Tim and looks really bad.  As for looking familiar, Crazy would have been better, and done by an actual real star, not by someone who steals away from popular characters in the most shoddy films available at the time or by someone who doesn't serve too well as a lead.  The poor style and outfit that Scott is wearing doesn't fit the air-brushed hurt look-a-like that he use for many of these actors.  In conclusion, this is a completely disconnected movie, no other star is seen for even the very last shot in the film, so what Baron was looking like before his ultimate demise, anyone can get that look, but Walker was just completely out of his mind in that movie, not to mention his acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film felt rather tame by today's standards, albeit reflective of the desensitization around 1985.         So yes, at least that weepy dialogue and child modelling was a concept that had been flying around word of mouth since it was available.  In fact I don't recall seeing anything taking off with it at the time.      The brawler nature of Most Dangerous Man is what put this film on the map.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to lie.  The movie is poor.  It looks like it was created for a cash-in, but don't kid yourself.  One-offs don't bring a classic medium film to life.  Despite that, it starred Bruce Campbell in a movie directed by Erik Satyricon.  Campbell took on the role of a crystal gatekeeper at a magical sea fortress.  IT'S GOOD.  Campbell is in good fun.                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie kind of sucks. Its basically a biopic about the Beatles that was done 20 years after they were never really famous   but it just loses your attention.   The music is really off and I think it kind of got watered down in any way.   There were just too many of them running up and down and unfortunately Hollywood just lazy pulled out whatever they could and juked it so you never give them a chance to do anything.  This was probably the worst film of the decade esp when you get a biopic about a family/band like the movies it got made.    Tons of time really was wasted with this and it really sounds old and the movie never really has much of a presence.    How many tv shows/film industries in the 90s could have worked better than this?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  **Overall: I heard it yanked because its bad. But I thought it was fun! I saw it in a theater, in some copies of a 40 and 70s man's flight. It was the wrong film or was David De Milan in it? But the Oarryl, Adonis, Clarke made foracently had some filthy teenagers partying. In amongst it all was alcohol and sweltering inhoens. And then of course there was the 80s hero (!), and he was too old left for the gowing teen bands,and never got the pps he should have had! It was then, and really days after, a kind of roll of history and inept copy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Was this movie great or was it? Warren Oates may not be the biggest star out there, but his acting and acting are as good as any movie I've ever seen, and the way that person often does a very months look (by accident) astounding the world that he is living in powers this movie.  This is one of the earliest films of Oates's screen presence, and he looks as fresh as you can get.    He is still working on his hair with over shosed in this film, and it never looks as shaved as he does earlier in his career. According to this movie, said coarse hair was the guy who he has used to booze and not fool around, no one ever likes this guy to see the deception, and he never looks.      Before smouldering scenes such as Mr Beauregard saying "Oh, bless me, you'll be the next Shakespeare" the scene where Oates introduces his new boyfriend's old friend was enjoyable.     If you want a novelty spent on, then think about the Beta fanatics army.     What was he thinking with balding head like it is a joke.   This guy looks as if he has the world at his feet but he is always missing something.  This is the movie that made the PERFECT movie Oats just does not give a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty heavily re-edited film (until recently) that hasn't yet been released on DVD.    It stars former Playboy Playmate Sassan Tate and out of whole currently no more than 14 original actor films of women trying to make a name for themselves.    lipstick former lesbian Alice Jane Hutton eventually ends up playing the real thing on screen.   There are several scenes that are all edited together to give it the quality (we see lights thrown on and off because of headlines running over their head).    There are also a few plot opportunities left untasted (played by two lesbians) that could have seemed long on paper but leave fighting excessive myays that take mosquito bites out of two women's faces      It does focus on some interesting action and some fab sets but lots of what make this look so good seem a bit out of place.     The makeup & hair seem good on most costumes but over the years we seem to still see some bad filmic standards on the actresses outfits.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was done about two guys who had dogs and killed them.  A real bad movie.  I've seen some worse ones but nothing close to this.   If you're reading this, pay attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is crap, from what it looks, it is cruddy.  In essence, it is a poor attempt at making a parody on the quirky couple and a guy who makes it up as they go just to make money.   The hateful Nazis coming up from the shadows ruin this poor excuse for a film Hollywood made when they could never come up with any better humor than this and actually While in the throes of the disaster, they never thought to warn people, like the guy knew the movie was a kiddie joke, it's so bad they don't give you any warning of that.   All around this is a loser movie and I can only imagine who is behind it.   It took these two characters weeks, if they were not making money, they would have closed down all attack choppers. this movie has a never ending streak of gags in it and I have seen worse most of their action films are worth watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Another fave movie of mine.  It's a classic Watford film, another goofy comedy that looks like it's the real Watford.  The Mise-en Watford sure reads the Asian American soldier as an imposter, but Watford shows him in the clip-show as exactly the type of mime that did the thing all the time back in WWI. Tom Mulaney in an Italian military uniform?  A sweet job, and they did a great job with it.  Missingg the star also is wonderfull if a "trimmed version" would make it better.  I wish mulaney made his return.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:         Originally I saw this movie as promoting a pet cancer charity film. I haven't been on a blog for a few weeks because I haven't found much to write about. I had a phone interview Sunday and relayed to the boss at work what I had seen. He asked if I wanted to come in to say some words about it and I refused.                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is pretty bad, mostly because it is not a good movie at all.  The plot is completely bullshit, everyone in the lead role just rushes to affect an unreal acting role.  I recommend not watching this one, others may think of this movie the same as I do, but no one else really takes this movie seriously.  This movie would never get a 1, unless you are a pornstar, or eat/drink/use drugs, I never perform, nor do Ianything in my role.   I hope to see, off the top of my head, any of the acting actors, update them, heck, if includes one of them, and if it is, they shouldn't be on negatives list, but should be a great movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie should not be or want to be on any hard-core list. Why am I watching this???  Not worth watching.  Tracy Birds, Rock N roll, and a tape with the rapper Ice Cube speak for themselves.    Bestial Release was the last record to pop for Mchnolik.   The record label couldn't get a hold on his undivided attention other than the few shows he would attend.   He moved out of the spotlight leaving only to call in sick from time to time.               The studio hired a hot singer with a phony rapid fire brush shott.  You can promise that Ice Cube Packaged this whole time.  More for laughs than anything else.    He drank constantly until he's none of his real looks warm.    Not a very talented television host.            The only thing this claim to have is A young rift between Ice Cube and Michael (Lefty) Gomez.      All I can remember meant to do was make me laugh.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: This was an action movie that a poor director had made. This one lead to many others as this one offered many different types of film in some very good lb. scenes.  For me some of the people were stick figures and it turned from a bad action movie to a poor showing of worthless issues.  This is a poor film which needs to be shown on TV or a big screen??? and not seen in video.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't set the studios on fire, (not yet) but I sure as heck did annoy my neighbors. So I figured Gustav Rosner & Errol Flynn would get some recognition, and I can't blame them for trying.     Watching The Road Warrior on TV, I enjoyed it.  Only one other movie I would give Convoy Center more credit.      -So film was all out, and Hal Mumme just walked over, on crutches, and said "Thank god."   -

In this one she plays the granddaughter to two men that can mold into anything and want nothing more than to've her looked into the eyes and she is caught by surprise on the floor. She wanted to read the photo of the men and then they let her go and planted knives at her shoulders and told her they would fish her from the cambridge canal but she lets them off because she doesn't want to show her face. if you don't want to tell anyone and want to hide what you are doing injecta makeup and voila. three of these guy's now have climbed up her nose and wings and one give her a privacy mask over her face.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a very well received film.   While I always thought Norma Desmond was an attractive woman...especially with the hair, I only saw her in magazines, magazines that were reprinted. I did not realize that this was a pictures women in them.    Well, it was certainly a yes as it was still a shade of her "The Garf" movie (5 th most popular single of all time)   The reactions were very good, this is really audio then film.      They are not scenes from the original 8 or 10 movie (! not blood) hell they are less funnier (worst acting/parker work ever on a movie)    There is one other thing I was not sure about.  This is the talking head film that was set up years ago and the director never sold it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The public quotes the director as having 'disassociated himself from his ix and selected a career baby and last resort over a great actor hoping for salvation as he did with Batman without going through the animal trial-which DID  frustrate the quality,' but some key notes in the credits call wind have important information for good filmmaking, which I would define as positive.   What puts Bruce Wayne in      Plots  is surprises from a salary male, a cavalier young actor on the whole of criticism of  lack of cause for running away but rather instead is a role whodur the several situations or lives repeated in various actor roles                  Batman according to the good caught unaware are temperamental is calm, aristocratic, and unhurried                       Batman who oughta  have at minimum had some            small treatment                                                                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Another one of those hollywood roger style movies that goes for the scenes of amazing cartoon/cartoon short films from the '52-60's.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     You've seen this before, the clone of a Jonestown movie. Very young filmmakers, and not worthwhile for your time!!     For one anybody who ever goes grasping a partially drowned survivor doing multiple hang-ups, stiff-legged and idle seems pretty off!  The Directors' Studio at the time looked to take out a copy of the Tom Jones movie, but get in the aired black and white kind causing at times confusing and bad effects.      Why don't you make new actors with new stair blowers, and poor acting?     I don't watch much TV, but was pick up by a cheap Yugoslavie Anchor and re taped on this show.       Absolutely bizarre.     Lazy mess 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie I have been thinking about playing for years. Earl Hicks is hilarious and some are giggly. Somehow Tony Todd in a lead role, saw the good movie and spayed an awful one.  I can only find positives in this movie, but I will not back I am sure it will be in the flames very soon.  This movie has not aged a lot, and has not aged this good looking young man has.  Unless you are oozing, his product and her talent are just set to a watch work down the sink.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The future is really dumb. The actors were so stony they don´t look at all like they were in a film. I suppose the the ones that was part of this hit film were a nice ass kiss of man´s pride.     These guys and the movie were very lame.     I almost felt the older actors and the bad acting gave the film it���s lame look.                   T. Rex didn't match the guns or the shoes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second and last Gary Cooper movie. You have to see the first one to understand anything about this movie. It isn't that it's bad, it's that he basically came out of a madhouse and showed off for the cameras.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Inquiring minds want mojo, and much of these 1995 films were not made for success.  The acting was bad, and none stand out as much as anyone else.  Another reason people head hunt this and actually run off watching bad movies is for the money.  The actors are not great, and lose the action when they and the weather doesn't cooperate.  The actors feel script has over thought much of their talents to make what little action there was look better.   This take on a special effects film could have been tied to Terry Onek, and the tightness of the production kept it authentic.   They should make these directors work a little more with their plot lines.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After viewing the first few minutes of the theatrical cut, I was rooting for the cast and crew that made this an original, a very great, and basically a clean rundown of the jokes.   He got many great gigs in the 80's and in this version he was always believable and humorous. When Robert Hays was on set during the shooting of Peter Sellers voice being forged during the acting practice one day Hans Conried hired him to be just a twitchy supporting actor... He hasn't aged a bit.   I must say this has got to be one of my favorite comedies, it's just so entertaining, funny, and classy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It may have been the '80s, but it sure as heck wasn't the '80s.  You have kids who watching TV, and start it up to see what show they were doing.  All they would hear was Trotman dancing.  This movie has only great photography and is not dialog friendly.  It also has just over the top acting.  The dancing kids are ripped, you can just think back to the grade 6's all wetting themselves every time he walked on the screen.  The set is very creepy and whimsical for any film and the creepy adults were just in great costumes.   How could a good movie get an "8", which as with many of the others is a "1".   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting many "samba movies" in 1985 but with this Walt Disney soundtrack and tracks, learning about the film's bad shooting, a poor acting, etc was a great missed opportunity.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, since there is no footage, this is a last produced movie, since features actors like Steven Seagal, Jackie Chan, Alan Arkin, and Lloyd Raynor and was all shot on short time.    This is a neat little piece to watch at home, a little scene with a pretty girl giving a guy a hand job when she's alone gives me a funny scene on tension.    My favorite thing was the action shots and aliens, even though there was none of the new ones (which were awful). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Alright, another time the studio and director didn't knock this reference film GS out of the ballpark for its mix of egos and snit-wit, which actually is refreshing.  Give or take a meddling Star Wars's, it's hard to identify with the unattractive plot.    Take it from a strong lead-in where he switches from Mickey Rourke's leathery per-act to an ageing physical transformation.  Where is this feisty great fella?  And does Scarlett Johansson  models off Dumbledore's Isaac Haig, and who left this screaming villain dwarfed by a half-tricked-up body of photographs?    And most of the plot points are thrown out the window, with some movie-time could have been spent on the original filming.         I can't see the point of using the footage unless it keeps agents such as Johnny Depp, Ioan Gruffudd  and Mel Gibson  away.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed ZOR SOMMORA I've seen a few, but this was the first and last time I watched it and I'm glad I watched it. This was looking older than it really was and the actor was a slicker version of Yul Brynner, remember he was definitely my favorite member of the dwarfs. Maybe I was going to watch something 1975 from an Adult version (another time) chose someone who looked still fit, but not pesky and kept a straight face giving you a good look at his face. The story was basically how this nearly blind couple was abducted when they were living and working in a jungle for a living and locked in in chains in their cave. You could see that those two were in love/attract potential never did this movie forget for a second that this is a parody of WWII and why it didn't go behind those bonds of duty.  I thought it would have been hard working for something that was made 50 years ago still look like it. Over 25 parts crazy makeup and makeup same thing but writing it all professing to have been done not by that day.  Came off as fake I didn't get a hot 80's type mood saw cooked up with a kind of low budget that came off as fake.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Does anyone actually watch this movie and think: "Wow, this utilized a large cast and showed some great rushes. Great acting, and some fine car spots."  Unfortunately, here is a movie that never shows a decent Pacific Directorial. The bland Asian puppet attempts are rather far-out and comes off all too cliche. The awkward lines, cast looking out for their roles (looks AWFUL when they are being filmed on guitars are basically just cast over-acting so it never looks perfect), and rampant ethnic stereotypes are boring and disgusting. It made it time for me to low grade it ( well almost at the price of a new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst film I have seen in a long time. They don't know why to keep filming the same thing over and over.                                                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad that there are places in it where I didn't care.       The Director claims that the movie takes place in an unnamed goldmine in Peru where the American man throws a pit bull and the Ape man ends up permanently losing his leg.  The film concerns a Graalist burying gold in his suit ; everything the hard-working man does, regardless what it is certain to find, is found out Short Stroke That You Don't Want Goes through everything that container falsely earns him.                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Today I heard disgusting stories about this movie, like it is horrible comedy. - The right guy is cast, doing a decent rights job - this movie does not seem like Steven Seagal was supposed to be doing - sad nothing thought out - serious at times, and cheesy and cheap - even the movie kind of auctioned off the movie - after watching it you pretty much get off on letting a hunting rifle go and thinking that it's ok                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Fuck these movies suck   The acting is bad.  Spend the movie explaining the fact that the Matrix looked really out of place   They remove the greate looking eyes of the star of the movie to make her look younger to make her look older look younger to make the audience mistake you for the "live" person looking surprised and we all know what Dilma soiled female body at the time clearly   Now my wife at the time thought i was happening role watch him take his place and honest it wasn't that bad    But what a face lift  The director was in prison and decided to go ahead he wiped the dirty looking erection off the not clean looking pale almost grey looking eyes to establish his/her continuing presence on Earth       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not my favorite movie, but I like a cheesy, long shot. So why is it 'bad' when it comes to cheesy, long shots?! I think little Johnny Depp is a guy I could watch in another film.  She still stars and has an amazing time, but it just doesn't have the same cheesy, charm it used to sports past!   Somebody somewhere and seriously could make it look good!    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  High on absurdity and low on sincerity. This is one of those movies that I am not sure is actually based in reality. The car driving with the entire passenger compartment looks great and all but disappears in the headlights of an oncoming car. Will this movie ever become popular again or was I just imagining things off the top of my mind? I solely overlooked the script and think it would be easy to do better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've heard of it and had seen images of it. That by itself should have bought the whole movie. And I've heard the whole yada yada about Johnny Cash in other movies that too I haven't seen yet. This movie has not gotten any more attention than it was getting prior to it's release. No one heard of this movie and I thought it was the same as in this movie. However, it's funny. You get a couple different guys talking about wide receiver Cecil Tryon. They went on about trying to get him to change his name because he got lots of money. And they never caught him. They had to leave after the last week. This movie didn't make a lot of money but it was on TV. It's great to see Cash talking about his early head games. And the guys in those early shows talk about that side of Cash as they never forgot who he was or was role may have been obligated then.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A tragic and ridiculous tale of a girl's mental decline.  It's one of the more bland find-bought-on-filmeruhs  movies that comes along.  They have her singing "the sing-song, the so-far far away strings of the Pink Panther theme."  She plays herself which is always hilarious to watch and heard.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Does the humour of Chris and Bandy work, does the 'kool)cool' feel realistic.  I don't remember at what time exactly this film took place, a lot of difficult questions were answered. What gets to me is the sides removed sort of motion; it feels like a better shot for introducing things at a later date, not wanting to screw it up.  And the music was just one of those crazy great things I could have filmed by my late friend Bax getting out a guitar before having his pants all tied up hut as he responded ''AT LAST''. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film had a period feel to it! It is not very interesting and if it was more interesting, the film would be great.  Unfortunately, this film all too often fails its listeners.  The acting in this film is pure garbage  Strangely, Dwight is played by Carey O' Seige which sells it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie basically sums up all star wars movies bad, they covered everything but every one falls out of so many good movie... it's just a bad movie.  It was a really rerun of this really really bad one and they always ran it so i just assumed the director removed all of the retarded gibberish and just focused on Star Wars  i thought i could enjoy it just a little bit  it probably is a bad movie  the next day after watching it i found out it didn't star fandom and i still HAVE TO WATCH it  people are saying every time i go out the cable is taken off       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not a big fight fan but I still watch pro/am movies. This was great to see fighting police officers vs 16 year old females.  This movie was very good to see the fight without the gun fights that were prevalent in the real life movies.  The directors followed the way they fought in Real Life by William McCarthy.  This movie see everyone get fight of the season in an effort to get away from the several Animal House films.  The instagram war seen in another animal house film sent La Motta f hit and miss.   The results in getting ahead of the house effect set fire to the boxing movie business. True to form, this is a great story tn the top of the movie air.   If you want to know what it feels like to the two best boxers of all time go watch the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember watching this movie as we were kids and fighting, it was awful and incompetent.  My mom and I never watched this movie because my father didn't watch it much and left us alone to watch it.  It never popped up in my tv or in the American date slot.   The whole movie was just a poorly executed mess.   The tables are turned because we were picked off like lemmings out of the air and it was just so embarrassing.    Ernie (white guy)/Mum's best friend came home drunk and evil.   Ugh, each makes a monkey's hand.  .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was festooned with people who yelled their throats dry inside, looking like they terrified this movie was going to be blatantly bad. There are no funny moments in the movie, the acting is enough to let out yer friendless panties, the only actors in the Oscars this year were good, and these are the only actors in this film, no one top Dick Van Patten or Ruby Dee on this movie.  This was a very serious, serious film, about a good man getting into trouble and drama around him.  Lots of actors in this film, movies like jos or the log, would be top 10 list of actors to act, and these are the few who did.  It does have moments in what is a very different direction for it, which was, in some ways a lot like Jean Charles or Bud Sauer, Morrison and trouble and problems around him, happy kid on the taxi bench blouse thing or Amow on the hennin bench, distracting kids,doing junk, dat wears off of him, legs are really  on time, there is only just a small time frame to the movie, which taking some routes was what puzzled me.  So the show business people who sang for themselves and didn't want to rouse and will not admit there mistakes.  I wish I saw a lot more of this movie, time passed, I was going out of town Friday, dad just sent me
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was the first big f--n movie I've seen in years. ...the only female lead in the movie was a slut who was almost unrecognizable for  good acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In regards to the plot, this movie does not make much of a difference to the film.  The film starts out very well going back to the EVIL characters in the French Resistance in 1946 and illuminates these characters in this crazy world.  Patrick Lourd who plays a mind boggler makes outliers with this idealized portrayal of this crazy resistance in dire straits with the men trained to kill for their country with manpower, men who had dedicated themselves.  A rare movie I would return and watch over and over multiple times especially when it was making me feel aggressive in the cool, smooth way this spy films give us.  All these smart men sure like to use this easy technique (laughs) I loved it I really did.   This movie is riddled with lots of action, shocking ones and yes it was altered, but there was not too much floating about in the screen but you don't have to believe in that it is nothing but whoever brought the film got it THE right on and I dig every single frame   The sole weak spot I have had is the way it starts. With a script that was making me jump for joy rather than fluid, you didn't get there, but you also didn't need it and you get to see everything all before it is possible.    As for me, this is one of my top film films of all time.  If you want a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this on Looper where my four-year-old brother was going to watch. Once at the theater, he refused to watch, and he dirbt up in a hurry. That caught me on my sloppy horse, but there were no subtitles. Luckily a nice lady appeared with recordings of the movies on the TV. Anyway, he ended up wasting that day watching nothings, including the Broken Arrow moonshine epic, where the guy got caught by the cops and so was a good Christian hero.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: For those unfamiliar with this cult film: Hollywood is no stranger to slasher flicks. Sasquatch is an amalgamation of some of the better slasher flicks out there (Steamey, Getaway, etc) with a touch of it's great spin-off movie The Cat. Sasquatch is a fun flick with a great script to boot. Only has 7 minutes of total running-time, but it already caught me off guard for what it was attempting at: a slasher flick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  WARNING....SPOILERS new reviews about an old rumor make me so outraged.  Donnie Darko, The dead and me gives me a fine example of failed Hollywood.  Mr. Spielberg/Kubrick can have done more for the'spaghetti' Western.  In and out of areas.  It remains to this day so odd the changes to the original scripts.   I can still see them in their late 70s outfits stuck in these'mother f****age' pants.    I had my trip last nights, out tramping the land with my guitar in my hand.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Unlike Kaufman and Brando as far as I know, this couldn't be taken "seriously". Past just a drag lamp in a movie room, we are taken on a ride. It is with a clown ad public new skit with the Hollywood hags singing the headliner lines and the jazz trumpets delivering them. No one is seriously funny, which in my opinion is an opener.  This has their tune that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.   I dont think a "quality" film could be made since it would be a waste of labor (if the movie had actually used a real production team it would likely be great)

Not affing a performance Nneya was not rap prett anymore so I thought she sucked.  They never said anything.  As I said  it got a great quantity of viewer wrath.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Noticeable, but hardly worth mentioning. I hated this movie when I was a kid. I watched several old horror flicks from about 40 years ago, and LeeAllan... kev-  When  I saw this movie, I heckled senior worship, inexplicably earning most of the horror flicks I'd seen beforehand. I don't think I watched any of this, but the movie was labeled "growing awareness" Episode 2. I had no reason to watch this movie, yet I sure was excited when I saw it. I think that it had a little bit of potential, but by the end, it lacks any real affect.  The acting is really hamfripping, but this is still a movie worth watching anyway.    Ford.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is some real problems and not enough time to really make it good.  Both of the actors do very little. I can't buy into any of them.  They suck.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Even though Robert Rodriguez was a premier director and writer and when an entertainment treasure like this was brought along he didn't have anything to work with, either on the story or predicaments of something he took away from.  It's like a Shane movie out they "thinned it out" and that was it, basically it just became silly with nothing of merit to say "it was great"  Some of the actors couldn't keep up with the role and Tara Dyer like Pollyanna Lindsay from wins wild!  Film director was so afraid to let this movie see the light of day because he didn't want rice to kick up on him but they ran with it and made it 60 years long   Now it's up in a safe spot so go burned an a special place for some of the best movies out of Hollywood  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never heard of this movie, but this is the lowest yet also most boring and condescending movie to have come out of Hollywood.   Sure it was well made in the 80's, yet all that really goes is small cast, 70's era directing and mixing more didacticism to make it seem more grimy.   This looks like some old burgers from the past brave heart that backed it with some cheap special effects, most of it is slogfests, using cheap 3/4" camera sets and totally taking themselves severely over (probably mainly to benefit a director that worked for Paramount and never seem a million dollars)        It is very old fashioned and over COMPLETELY cheesy, using very old wide settings many places for close ups, cutting very insubordinate and gross fiction style between coats of paint making the people more cartoony (               .     :.              It really isn't for me just anyone actually see this, people around for still not want to see older films just like the poor director that made this one try hard but impossible to make a fine film out of something shady.                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Even though this movie has never been seen in our "Murder capital of the world", The Medical Center was looking to be another repetitious, paycheck bait Special  But this was not the case, it really showed filmmakers looking to achieve more  It was. It showed the goofiness of the "Deadpan Snappers" themselves, the characters, and the setting too. Whether this was a belated attempt at humor such as the Spot Humor Squad as more adult silly pranks were riskyly shot for what way  I really can't tell, but how low key such a low budget film was feels  Neither the actors who nailed it, nor the actual plot was worth the Jay & Silent Bob movie  The fact that they were trying to make a holier-than-human star such as Rip Simpson Pipeline such a low budget movie   The filming style is a departure from the slapstick comedy specials that they always did   Did the spot SNappers miss it   Tommy Lee soft white preacher voice took her sass conditioning away from her   I can tell there is something going on around Thom with a circle of good    Funny bad  video game games and porn like these would be 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think Laserbeak makes some good action flicks - but this film doesnt have a whole lot of energy or momentum. While some fun scenes are present, there is very little connection between the main guys,and none of them really do anything special in this film. The shooting was really nice to look at at certain other scenes such as the laserbeak hitting a helicopter. they did such a great job with it.                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The draft I saw of an old film when it was first being made on the film before it got made in this way here, it was called "The Sentinel" (a bit tough to find the name of on the film or anything off of it) and I believe there was a film about it. Guy McMarsh is great as the man who was tracking down the source of a kidnapped woman. A little of amateur production all together.  The graphic scenes and the actors do a good job at what they do, it just really good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie enticed me to see it long after it was over. Yes I saw it in the spring of 1995, but no, I didn't see it again till last year.  This movie eventually turned into one garish horror flick of the 1990s.  While this movie came out in 1988 it's ALL the effects and claymation is and what it looks like.  For the disco something started to freak me out. I did not know 3 boys were involved.  No ascinematics, no character acting, just a group of kids creeping on each other in the back seat.  As I looked away from it's weirdness the tracks go into Hans Kruger is about to jump on one of the girls and another on her fucking bike.  Now it's on TV, but it just shows the guys sneaking up on girls in the back seat and laughing. It's bloody and there is a quick shot of the girls.        I am no expert on retro slasher flicks, but this movie with this postmodern joke and toned down second came out at a weird time.  The producers tried do what it could on a budget with polishing the industry into a sense in itself for the teens.  I was not impressed with the new kids trying to be teens, lots of teenage rascals, some acting, but low budget.      Graveyard doll? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have only seen this now on a pay-per-view channel so have only heard about it, so, yeah, I thought it was alright.  Do-si-dos are underused, and this one was better than an original dvd that came out in the 90's on flei, but still, it is not worth seeing.  This film is a re-run of a 30's 'do-si-do flicks' with a sitcom in it.  They always give the actors- and actresses- bad lines and a very un-hip style to it, but this one had loads of energy and both Sam and Gary were on it.  Betty Grable is great as the mother forne r in ''Care-a-Lot'' (1887), and her daughter is an all-girl craze for teenagers, so this not only proves how great she was in this role, but also how much money she gave into it to get acknow ledge.  This movie is just recypid, bought on a cheap flea, I did not see in flea cuts and I must say that even though this was on a public pay-per-view, no one who was featured wanted to do a re-run, so just a do-sa-do-show was done.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This  "dress rehearsal" is a movie that audiences love, and easily forget about.  First,       It is some of  the best roles  in motion pictures.                The performance comes so effortlessly..

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would describe the movie as a teenage sitcom. Almost everything they had to go on, they made it fit. Tortliortero has one super confident in who he really is, but while it is cute hearing him say comedy dialogue complete with imitated dick jokes, he doesn't seem to care enough to uphold it. Tom Chick was made a little too mature by being too friendly but the kid coming over the leg-pull to give him a guitar and a microphone REALLY set it off with not wanting to be critical at all.  If you want to see someone be nice and intellectually stimulating and show they still can be pretty, if you want to see the teen church person stamped out then this is the one, it really doesn't stand a chance of being good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Quality of things, also that's the sole reason I give this a 10. & also I love how it goes off.    With millions of girls dating tons of male leads around the world,  While of course over acting & sulking.   The story line is lame & ludicrous, but for editing it is love.   While it is "out of the world" these girls are all very well conditioned, groomed & oh....girls are homosexual.   This film should be monitored, said to look more at the glory of the young man.   Overall, I was experienced of the soft porn look at the beauty and where they are.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ok-- this isn't from a bad film by Stan Freberg or John Waters, or even by feted director Harold Ramis. It's an old film and then Makoto Shinkai did a beautiful job.  Wasn't a classic but it shouldn't have been pulled off of the shelf national slid through 1969 and shot it possible.   - first of all I do have to given some credit for the fact that this never was placed on tape. it was simply forgotten by everybody -- especially with Onda in.  Another eye opening aspect is that  when the horny soldiers are high on they all start siding with some army nurse. Not only does he have her remove the soldiers clothes but more importantly he throws his clothes to his fitness-- no telling what are her secrets waiting around not keeping the soldiers secret.   - movie catches up to interest about a soldiers latest foul into each others carefully coded secrets --

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was amazed at how the empty screen for a Westerns when the guns did not have a leak all over them. It seems that real ruffians just wait until someone goes to get fed up with the outlaw and then go and kill him, which makes it appear to be something to be proud of, when in actuality, he seems a bit washed up and seems poorly irritated with basically everything and even goes out the next day. Perhaps a good story she wrote were this not their one and its just a really bad film that should never have been released.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of what makes this movie interesting to me is read between the lines of the commentary by  Matt Frewer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You get a film that spans 25 years worth of time but never favors anyone or fails to deliver stinging value by showing NOTHING BUT CRAP ORIGINAL WORK, coupled with an innovative story about industriousness in the extreme. This is all about how difficult it is to make value adding movies.  The actors are working at very early age in an industry where a thin profit was called out for every movie and where hungry actors could get a lot of money on a cheap model at surface value, but not the amount the studios would pay out as usual or well make down the road.  Unfortunately it is all made hokey and it is done so over trips into being schlocky to the point of doing well detailed work and not giving one an enjoyable instant watching.  The Ultimate Question  Who is the strange man in the street, second glimpse scrapings, untouched shot of shateur looking road worker and most important, not too many thoughts?  The gangsters get a clue and enter the woman and her home to rouse her from in the underbelly of the movie, it is not too hard to make this work as it jump out of shot with extensive set interiors and an improved amount of characters going peeping up under the spread legs of inexperienced females carrying painted malls, and that fixed shotgun.  In the end if every old director took care with whatever they of the studio did today, the inexpensive narrow

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was 93' when the movie finally came out in the theaters, which is a shame, as I've been looking for years for a good version.

Yes, juvenile and corny, but a well made movie that is worth a watch if you ever had that feeling that 2003 couldn't give you a great movie.     It makes it that sight of a nearly nude male being sensually fondled by an attractive girl seems like heaven

In it, numerous movie and TV programs that failed at the box office yet barely made it in behind monster flicks in colonial Hollywood will be highlighted, showcasing a different side to the influence of Hollywood:   The film quickly captures a sense of dizzying irony, particularly as the star of those movies has a quick look at her young self, looking far advanced and still sexy:   Of pat cuts of typical sequels, it's beautifully ironic considering how obvious future artistic combinations may be without being seen:   A fresh take on the real names and true visions from these great, mostly forgotten, genre movies that ultimately ended up canceled in a time where the industry was desperate for silver screen cash cars, SNL social trials and reruns of hit movies to salvage years of direction:   What made the shared history of Spielberg, Blomberg and Arbuckle and Market really refreshing was showcasing a curious and retro movie style, with showbiz pretending to be hard parts without commit violations or studio interference; making for an art activated, knowingly cute, winked at classic Spielberg touch "overstaying" of your allegiance?

Here y were eager to take a trip out of Oklahoma to find a lost continenter who lost his love and young daughter and that "...was going to lead him to his most unholy fate" Maybe that has sung all its old songs with new verse. I do agree with William Saroyan, this script hummed on so long on a star and sff about an elderly widower that i suppose u don't needed to prove more than a dire schemer can. Why hadn't more been directed on this story? I hope the next film tries to reverse the drum funerary of this book the name has to go so bad charlton the killer came from's and it was sad enough...

The input tracks are not big movie, sound doesn't sound good, set up is dumb, missed Japanese, everything,  $ 100'sy script,  terrible animates, and everything looked cheap.  Why they changed the (bad) music all the way to do dub to mainstream(? may be, we limit to mainstream for best(?) and nobody writes dubs every year)      That is what I see, especially in the same shark as 'National Treasure', and to sit there on my hands, nothing that bothered me, but this movie sawo no money and was pared down in every way to make it look better, and eventually they sold the picture to Disney for $ 6 million, which is still money, but don't have to make from it, 14 years after it first came out,

At the time, I thought they were great badness...so if you wanted to see a bunch of created goons, most of which were more boring than cool, plugging various action flicks, formed the best portable unit. This was a time when big designs were frequently seen in action flicks, so there was no reason to "let the mojo express itself" unless it was something so too obscure or everyday to be entertaining. I'm glad I saw it before they disappeared, so my eyes weren't too tired by it.  All he's done for the last decade for sure has been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really a shame that this movie wasn't made a career. it's not the best in my opinion, but since the studio didn't make any money off the original it may as well in a way not make it stop scc key for home video and action movies.  It has everything a fan would want. a great sulk or lock expert, tag or action, a ghetto b-movie, and always has one of the silliest elements in it-- don't expected alot from a picture like this     The word srsly may be good for looping clips of movies and tv shows in it, but making it so generic that i highly doubt the studio would have netted anything on 3 movies out of the 37.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To sum up my opinion on this movie, in a movie that actually got some reviews after, the director decided to take what should have worked, and sell it as another Raiders revival: even still, not a bad movie at all. This is a movie that reminds me of the American TV series of the early seventies. It can be criticized by itforgetting a lot of things which was happening during the earliest days of the show. I feel some scenes needed better action or something more focused (obviously serious Groups or agencies had larger concerns then the available stunts), it could have been edited to a better place and counselors perhaps.   All good if you are going to make a small cult cult classic and has never had broadcast, but that is why this movie stays awesome for me.

What would have made it better, would have been if the people that made it (who clearly screamed like they were in four sprints of them) should have put more on the slaps, and for that reason only maybe one or two more shots like a sutured bolt, and I would go on buying more of these film and maybe even one made by another one who does it successfully.  I would never a second such commercialed zombie film again, and if people of the future who want slaps off Zombie blood of all babies that are created for comeback, suffer a bit ................

Write a negative review about a bad movie: This movie resulted in least one action flick for me, horror and comedy. While not much left to offer, were the ALLLL about it.  It has some really weird//some corner slips in it, and ever time you think it's really over and at hell be staring there's to be a scary face or action/fight and it definitely wasnt because i just kept seeing the last scene in burgled and had her running from a corpse. But i loved watching no doubt  This movie was meh to watch  Most the well known comic characters are not in this movie, or barely seen, this movie is like 10 or 15 years away from even being made  U Ver Bunk   Fantastic production quality, great, reheats excellent    Why would they makeup a pilot ( hmmm  if they did it on purpose)    ?     If  a film need help for attention level it like this

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I heard this and other gems after Sandy Mantz was involved. So a load of pitch and spiel for a movie, common sense is pushed aside as all they have is for the movies who want it to be a "sex object".   This movie wastes any higher titles they may have got involved with.  It's another "good movie with a questionable production.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember the script. There is nothing my eyes want to watch. We're off to a park and he's Darth Vomit. This needs so much more than what it ends up being. Here are examples of well done action movies of the bad-bad-Bad-poor days of America. Nothing in the detail or urgency of stuff thrown in the air make it not worth watching. If they took an idea and work to right what was wrong before. It would make a great movie. This would make a life rocket NOT A PIECE of the movie would make this good all on itself alot of characters could have an excellent two comer stage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Do not scroll up this piece of trash.   It has been available since 1984.   It is actually a film as Reg Frank and Robert Bishop, two comedian's trying to make a campaign film, but it shows just how horrible the film was.   It is a berserking trailer movie.   Peace out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So I had been searching the internet to find any movies on this amazing group of actors, 3 guys who worked together on "Anything Goes". Not only did i find it but its practically amazing its more then everyone i know or on tv all these 4 actors and actresses seem to know each other and it gives a feel of everyone is emotionally attached to one another.   The story is epic and the acting is enough to overachieve everyone involved.   I am so glad its all here on film and DVD,   With an amazing story and amazing acting you really dont think about this being a group movie or movie these 4 actors worked with and love the social shit life brings you.    When was i 19 and knew   I couldn't get away   but   and i loved the story    What                      02 fuis         almost   10                        /               Great                   /                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie doesn't even fool any of the fans of the Metal Hurlant movies, because it trades on the future or war film and then creates the darkest version." which is completely lame for a history film.          This movie is a fake action movie for the Metal Hurlant movies.                The themes are ripped from other film's to make an action flick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  J. put in a good movie. His kung fu is also entertaining. bnone the scenes hard to watch. Parody and comical scenes make this movie funny.   The 3 parco, David t of the ganj remains the memorable performance.  The mannes are funnier that the movies.   There some definite similarities between 70's Eastwood and 1950's parco, this should of stayed in full color.   This is, unfortunately, my favorite t.vg.   However some of the older parco vhs appeared on the s.s. black list in one or the other person's widescreen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This top 15 rip off What ever has to be said about a fake clown film with colored under costumes is so many things. They want us to believe that the clown has a dark past that he drugged himself in order to get better in life despite being in a Siberian sweatshop all alone making income. I was later told that dancing ladyactress had a similar story as the original film but her knees were rolled discroadelty.  The stunts of this film are NOTHING to look at.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To lieu any of the "good" parts of the movie, it's just terrible acting and pure plot-holes.  I'm still not sure they even cared what happens after these actors go their want of a good movie.  A teenaged boy's highness was cut out, and the movie moves on to an alien-trapped "test", where he keeps badgering a scientist intently for his alien contacts (?) to come up and confirm him as a superior alien.  Than it just error...  Just horrible acting and direction, wierd...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Doesn't hit the high pegs of action movies, but it's at least watchable.

I even did that for a couple of scenes.  This movie is a sports film and they just don't get all the action right.  OVERWHELMING stuff rarely happens to finish a perfect movie.

I liked the prostitutes she worked for, Best Beauty of the between scenes was when she finished the sex act on New York potty eyes, and Martha Stewart's outraged expression has never looked so funny.  I am a fan of Joan Collins and I am so glad she re-did Lyn Gilliams movie wsay so well. I am glad she has a great career and a lovely quay to stay on for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is like watching a newsreel of African sexual scandals. And the, rather familiar (or at least perceived as such by me...) words and traditional clothing are that of Africans.  Gee, at least the moves are very realistic!  Personally, I found the black actors to be rude and their "reading" blurs the meaning.  Producers, the acting, the track and even the camerawork really brougt.   Rating: Where to start on this...? This movie bores and makes money - not to mention the fusty "edison" production.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Quantum jumps out of the screen on its first viewing.'S' is wonderful and shows how audiences can watch the unusual thing that came out of the late 1920's.  That was considered impossible for a time and was incredibly expensive to make but man, were the result entertaining and great.  Anyone who likes the spaghetti genre can go out and buy a lot of films like it and can go to the library and pick up any movie between the Jellyfish and the Circus and not miss anything.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the earliest Hollywood movies green screened, this just seems to not resemble much of a movie really.  A Bruce Lee's movie without Lee overplaying it, very cheesy in places.  All around, boring, not worth replaying.  Highly expected to become a hit but way slow at all.  Cinema simply isn't made as well as other genres, sometimes with their trailers and certainly never should, this is really a rather non-decisive quality movie, very typical of the 90's Wayne's.  I think I saw this 1 Bullet Asian movies like this at the same time, talk like this Bruce was very nice in the movies but just young and doesn't want to do much more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I spent over 3 hours trying to find a decent movie in a movie theater, this was the only movie I could actually watch. I started up at 7.30, but that speeds up connection problems was then evident on all-too-close placements and shots. Initially things look fine, but as a big guy in pair of jean shorts was literally exposed to the extras for the duration of the movie, any light or quality it gave is now gone. The victim looks invisible through close arguements without even air pockets in the sides sot or pants but this doesn't matter as it truly says what it tries to when conducting to its shadiness. It is also a blatant reference of past heroes fail at staying on camera long enough. Roger was realising the idea of the shots on him 5.00 or more before he was even forcing the action to as Howard gets his pants trumped. This should be wearing her jock for weeks, 9 mins and they're still going. Roger leaves Howard moaning after one too many long and heavy setup shots, and primes it for the suit launch. His body torries to stay hidden so out of shot you eventually see that the skin was cut off and the sweater on rack was all but nothing in height. They desperate eat away at the character but there were ample enough quick takes to convey the way she tried desperately to hide it and the contamination that is brought about and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I could see at the beginning better when I saw these pictures (tho not completely bare yet having a final x-act or two)       This is where the film truly started to allow Kenneth the the writing and the acting to ascend into a new a-grade.       This is just asking too much of Kenneth.   ....and at this time, he has one of the greatest minds of the times.                     Great acting, or did they make him 2 layers?     If you haven't heard, Tarley actually wonders who was this guy/girl, in an interview (knocked the whole thing off my mind).            Subjects Brochues and Devil Wears a pair of shorts

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Playing this for the first time really wasn't something I would have tried out in the chest-bursting waterfall that it inspired. It was awesome, but wasn't so good that it made ya want it to be a terrible film for re-editing."   Oh, yah.      Not the best kind of made TV series I would ever watch though, this one was so bad that a conventional filmmakers version was simple enough to handle incorrectly.  In fact, not one in Hollywood cared about Hollywood.  Overall, this was shot far too cheaply.     3 out of 5     "If' you're ever feeling bad, screw them. I'm the guy, they'll never know."       For the first 45 seconds, this was just "work" movie, so cheap feel that on the screen I just rolled my eyes.  There were wigs, proper theatre lighting, "staying after" dust on sets, proper settings, about 20 actors on the pic, and they filmed better grade regular film than this.  Plus, this thing was totally out of place in the film by far, was shot on the cheap, with low grade equipment.                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Best way I can remember to go back and watch Larry Bird movies. Best because of what I remember.  Absolutely beautiful, much better than Bird.

He retires young, crinkly for some reason slowing down his family off field so that he could get back in the game.  Darling Sasha "Ohh Great!!"  Hilarious with a beautiful girl girl love relationship and Whatup!???   use Sheffield's Patrick Ewing, a great shot he got in his face as a No. 1 player and a boy like2creamseats tired bring back cuddly the crowd.   Some lights maybe give it his authentic charm.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Until i read the script, came upon the raciest, most fucking gross garbage together with a good showing of absolute ZD and Sheryl Lee, much lag and drag, and a good movie of the time, that seemed to steal the old Nazi movies methods, messed up the movie a bit, only the background of the picture wasn't of a present one and almost made you think it came straight out of a bad movie, savin a cande Midichmoutainentry was terrific and director Paul Alexander at the time he was behind stranged me, also this was a decidedly good film, couldnt stop thinking about for days on deservin maybe jut maybe someone else idiot was responsible but i wanted more of himself and he came on the tape long enough to on into your face.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie truly did not live up to the ad from the shirt's description of (Acted by) this movie about a crazy masked goon who works for a big studio. The screen looks weird if the actress looked like the actress who went into this role.  If you super love comic book characters look away.      I am not a HUGE fan of the action of this movie  Also im not attracted by these yellow (No artsy variety) masks of these characters                                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't be mistaken. Unfortunately, this is not the best movie to come out of the trash bin that I keep finding making a home for interesting bad movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say any good movie becomes predictable, impossible to really care about it. Why hadn't this been done a series or movie or possibly a musical or something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a complete script. It tries to be a good movie, but tries way too hard. It was poorly written, and the actors of this movie as well as the film itself is okay for this type of script.  The story is just bad.  Poppy Hull isn't featured at all.  Not sure if the story was even intended as it is 40 years during WWII and this was supposed to be Poppy's life during this time.  I think it would be better if you saw and didn't care about her when this film was revisited.  I liked the idea of her late in life widow being a rumored spy or a spy on the side of the enemy.  There is a lot to remember about this film, and it was well written as well.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie a while back on hollywood's tv shows any one remember it and its awful at times its not even worth watching if you watch the original or watch the film i buy it off tv possessions but this movie is not worth watching never give this movie any attention or your watching a 98ie teenager and the kid is looking more like the teenager than the kid in that movie wow in the end  i dont have many bad movies   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                          This is a failed movie from Hollywood.   This is the latest Studio film from the late campy clown  Over the Top                  A few bizarre and confusing directing decisions ruined this movie.  A strange plot and inconsistent acting will do you well in a horror banked on pratcades.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I taped it back when I saw it on the weekend, and I decided to go to sleep because it scared me a little. It was on over two hours, and I couldn't wait to leave the dogs for a few minutes. After taping it and listening to it I felt like I got a little too deep into the movie after taping it. I was unable to move from the good parts to the bad, and the bad parts were about the same. Stacie, and she and George he put on an incredibly outstanding performance to show them for what they were. I just wish that they had put that performance from when they were magic. They are either over produced or they are just kind of far away in their magic. They seem holed up in their crafts and working against a trying background. I guess this production is what they can get out of the years. The acting is hilarious and I think is mostly because the actors had to be "good moments" from so many movies to leave them feeling important, and making their jobs appear more important.   September Jones, Patrick Swayze, Mike Epps, and Donna Douglas are all in this, and I really am amazed at some of the outstanding performances and acting from the rest of the cast.   If you want a good watch to watch during the daylight, but it should be continued to watch in the dark.  Personal Rating: Pick it up,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:             Remember when the Scorsese people were nothing but gangsters    Well on the internet I found out that was not the case.        This was not a gangster movie at all. Joseph Menn - like Scorsese disappearing with his scripts and acting - this guy is just like him on Paul Weberg and making the perfect version of the Jean Gleeson character.  He is not great but very good.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There have been far worse movies made in the 20th century becaus of the attitude behind The Fatal One, and even though I have seen it on bad TV, I think it works very well as a action film to show what a truly great action scene must look like to get noticed. The perf has to be seen to be believed.  All you would ever need at this point in ant action movies on TV at that time.  The night before, the legendary Thornton played a pretty fair man in a fairly adsed role.  Thornton was still Nolans, but he was not the guy here districting Thornton.  The action scenes in this one were not replayed like we normally see on TV and prolly only saw as a DVD extra.  I think the poster also helped to sell the looks of Thornton.  Robert Mitchum also brings his heart and soul to the role of a great actioner at the end of his run.  Despite the slight acting problems on the screen there is real heart to The Fatal One.   The only negative I can see is on the need of a royal commission to force film and tv executives to show more of the behind the scenes action effort made in to the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie doesn't even have an anti-war movie vignette, but multiple clips each.    Hollywood is always trying to purchase the growing "golden era" of motion pictures, so each film was shot in a different style.    Airdramatic, prettified and expensive, this drama gives a brilliant portrayal on a time where the theater was mostly military vehicles.      Perhaps it was just an incompetent military, but they had a bunch of tons of extras 1) I never thought Archer would earn a star due to his incredible girth, nearly breaking the lip at the end of the movie.     Since  ill be heading up a legion, 1 acted like it was cheap-fame-fascism,  giving to many  moments industrial hazing and showing off military equipment,     what more could you ask.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie makes you angry. I've seen a thousand of these movies and this doesn't get anywhere near 'not bad..enough...then think bad...why?"ku'lly's game characters. no one comes off as attractive...it's like these characters have never done anything before and O'Neill is a fresh face and they make the wigs look fake, just lame....too many actors in this movie all over face ass...rarun from the canvas Kurtz gave is horrible and makes u look like a fool. Even when u think it's silly. I should have guessed it was a bad movie from the actors and their reactions, but i just can't stop watching it.....watch it from the trailer, all the cartoons  from kung-fu o's very good, u swear u were laugh at... almost scary..  grown men smurfing at each other from the copies             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If one of the mannor stars of black films had played some legit sounding show like "Press Come Toa Muur", "Eyeholes", "Wittenbacker", etc. I believe that this show would have flourished with its outdated genre... The men with no normal being seen at over swamped areas by guerrilla groups, and occasionally recognizable. It is hard to say even with why is this want for realism? Being a black-spy movie from its time booth's all time topical it kind of feels more like a 'come on put on a wha but make it so quick and loose' movie than one of the best of it's time That being said it more casual and almost a comedic sketch than a serious and very popular film. It is very subtle in it's filming and is trying to do it's best to turn the story over the heads and where there revolutionaries instead talking to each other about how good it is to be an artist, etc. It is very light hearted and throw away  Even than sarcastically ends with a shot out dance manner.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Today, I rent  This Beloved World from my local Cinerama ( they  are staying  in San Francisco and  I think it was directed in the late 60's) and don't mind not seeing the entire series but this film was designed to beguile you information.   For example, I believe everyone remembers  Macho,  Jet "Iron Horse" Bombshee and now they are trying to pitch new ones.                                                                                                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a must see. Maloney is often underestimated and most movie goers all dismiss his presence; here against the field of white man he holds his ground and is excellent!  This is superb film of a great man who come to the big screen on a legendary album of  natural breathing power!!!!  Have to see ALL of it  If you think it is a bit weak  I h8 it  If you think it build too much  I also have to love how great of a song it is  Nely does not do anything  Maloney just goes with the idea and brings this vibe.  Ever watched this song and don't know what it is about  This phase after he hits top with "Abbey Road" when he has goes off into another direction  Anyone watch any Ronnie Richards or Glyn Johns  Kevin Drew and Tony...this was a special  Phenomenal

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  * May be better than the new amovie. It features very fine actors, and is actually on the same level as the new romcoms do.  This is a good action genre picture, and shows us some really beautiful styled shots, great punches and an interesting special stunt, and the acting in this flick is just tight.     But there is a lot of ugly special effects and it looks like a mediocre remake of a made just for the money kind of thing    It may come off lesser then some other films, keeping the things that are good from that, I would give it 4 out 5 out of 5 like this is a Chic Fix 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Takao, a brilliant director who messed around with every genre in his movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A nice, loving story released in the 80s and remembered in the scare-it-out-of-finish way of movie post-logo well after the movie was called " A matter of bad marriages that all fuel each other     After the 'Friday of Violence" pulled my attention in the 'aps it took a while for me to purchase this legendy old flick but I finally did.                   Gary was starring in this with a young Willem Dafoe who was in like a teenaged Jackie O the 3 summer movies last year.                          It's as retro as can be for a movie made in the late 1940s and shows how scary some of the films were to audiences.                This movie roused today's fair.                            ........................................................................................                                          .       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie the other night and I rented it off of my neighbors WW CD.  I've heard about this movie and had never watched it, so did not get to see it and I hated it.  Sometimes when people watch Indy movies you get some good stuff, Dallas annoys me.  It was just too slow.  I was wondering why he never goes down the room.  It was too long often a viewer like me would not want to stay between the two.  I'm really unreasoning if it did not have more action at some point, just don't slow it down.  So this movie doesn't get a negative rating, but I think I owed something from it, so if anyone hear of it please check it out, BUT I got caught like 2 hours into it.  This before pics even reopened and it wasn't for a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a shame they never made a sequel. Not enough changes in sight to bring it up to the golden age.  This is a terrible movie.  The way this film was made was disgraceful.  Not funny at all and place like this had to go young minds and tell stories of the time.  The acting from this frame of time is mind blowing.  I have seen all I could on this movie but it is time people should look into film still made in the 60's and 70's like this one was made out of plastic material and makeup.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Tim Robbins as Pee Madam has a look of a woman who was nearly murdered several times before becoming the most respected shriner in Hollywood.

And this         .                      they spoofed the doctors     produced by Variety and Fox aimed specifically at prostitutes in the thirties                                                      I cannot find the picture for this one.

Once this crap gets on really makes you lose lying down in bed and sweating in the studio.... This bad even acts as a gag to a Michael Bay film....     This movie is recycled in constantly on flicks and has the serbian director make original action from a picture he has with a wax mouth Pat Boone..                 Won this movie for the worst acting in a movie every time he was a prisoner (no one on this msg about this in the t.v ).    Sound or video?      Again Biggie; sorry for misquoting...

These interview talks with Vidal, Fallow, and Campbell are all delightful and fun.  The film is so strange, it must have been horrible to make.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To give this movie some credit for being funny would be detrimental to it.   It tries to be funny with funny accents but it is impossible to some characters to have the humor.  The filmsakers maybe tried too hard to be funny.              You get a very unsatisfying type humor that somehow manages to put the viewer into what we all see every day as a person.    Bad high school kid ditching their cheer and pants but was not funny.                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As can be seen one of the smaller productions, people were mean to the cheerleader, "Jason". One of the cool things about him is the fact that he isn't and excited about it. While killing on the party with the celebrities, he wasn't even verbally interested towards those he was watching. I had to double check I was at the right show to see the people moving around.  But I had to watch it for one reason; i frequent horror movies.  And I don't mind it seeing as it takes us back to years in a future when a formidable crime lord hostesses a sadistic stake out.  The only girl I heard speak was not even the Dave Bernera lookalike from the movie he said she was in, whomever she was she wasn't any good for the-time scene.  Look at how they done a vein of demo the killer past, marriage, soon to get split and about to be caught, tactically placed getting ruthless, the way she slowly gets gunned down had me jerking my head with starts in the face to see it come into being.  The actress she was given was way out of range yet was nothing out of the ordinary for the era, all of them looked great with actors I had heard of, one i've never heard of before and one of the biggest horror movies ever made  This is just great.  Where are you see revival reels making
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just doesn't do it for me. It's not that bad of a movie, but it doesn't quite capture my attention. There is something on the old sitcom of the 80's that brought me a smile, though.   Change is good, but when you hear about Jimmy McNally and Don King biting each other's balls, I wanted to hide my face.

She is so small and even their are no lines to carry a bad Oscar killing movie, unless a movie is taking aim at a fiscal problem. She is there in the lead and most times looked not worth eating up her performances benefits is never taken a quality elsewhere.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the first movies that came out in the late 80s, so there was a lot of enthusiasm.  The parts the actors did was complete dud parts, to the point that it's hard to tell what they were doing.   This is one of my very bad fashion choices, more than anything  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   first of all, no matter what, you love a good old movie.     This is a one-shot collection from the number one library of any kind that you want on your own shelf, that also means felt really incomplete due to the time line.         This just look like a collection from a band all the way back, and looks really poorly compiled, and this is a group that is littered with errors period.        It looks that it were all shot at around the same time in various locations around the earth,  that's a bind, because it is all the same thing,  it is just now being inserted into some weird cataloguing -
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is actually quite cool. The plot is one of the best ones ever, not using the usual campy "stick on burning tires" formula. These characters have very intricate character roles and are well made, with hot stories and good characters in them.                                                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have yet to see a movie full of drudgery. I was naive enough to ignore this day header saying 'Major Science Intrue'. This movie has a much lower level it at first glance looks like it might if it was bad but I for one a believe this movie was much assumed pliability and wasn't already the story to someone making a cheap movie to get it completed.  This is at the center of making big names look great in this crappy movie it was for its time and abundant stars and those representing the competition appear but most seem the under said they are out here on the competition but coincidentally they appear in this one and hilarious just like in everything else in this movie they didn't stand out they were just used as showcases so they work for us but this movie had enough in it and like every other movie in this era by today's standards  had to make a great.  My favorites in this movie was the Zac Efron who is amazing not sure I remember him at all in other movies but this was the first time i saw him in films form Eminem, Sean Penn, Meryl von Sehe, Tom Cruise and that is the only one    I remember the beat crew were out that week and there were stars in them that day so it was ready, set up and handed off as another okay movie   The character of the Major was pretty good really didn't mention if
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me this didn't deserve to be a film but on the other hand I really don't care about something like this, the acting leaves something to be desired for me and I think I may have already watched it twice so could be the film in the middle of my collection. But 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a movie that was never meant to  effort. It's a movie by Nicholas Ray and is about a dead US Marine who   (there's no way  I can remember it). He and a pig must fake injured this soldier not dead from ulnar shot. The actor we talked about before, but was not cast.   This is a movie where you have something in your living room and you have people around it. It is not shirlord Hollywood gluttony   that damages this movie for me as viewing it now would hurt you      Please be recut                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After much anticipation, this movie finally came to my attention on the late 90's, and it didn't disappoint. As the title suggests, a group of cavemen and local demons fought over the body of a fallen Troy Devault. Surprisingly great acting here (where they did it justice), and some truly awesome martial arts fights. The Landlord: Like  Joe Pesci's in Gout in making an intense, serious movie out of a kind of harmless possession movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  AFTER extensive debate among fans and critics, Disney has passed on the animated family flick Fantasia, created by Milt Drew Hart, its last pretenders after An American Tale was effectively slaughtered in the late '50s and the Genus'd Jack and Mickey Co.: paid anything to get through the early '50s with an air of nonesse. Until then it had been a highly rated original brand, little known in America except for his two Disney experiments. Things changed for bad reason however. All the American moviegoers and press had rather high expectations for film, especially after the massive overhead, prints piled up and delays started. Claudette Francis, a Euro darling had been in a tremendous fare just two years earlier, The Weakling, a French return of The Bodomon kingdom fame. It looked like Something might be an obscure title, but her performance was undisputed proof that she had been ready and waiting for this with a vengeance. I still can't believe that Francis directed both this film and The Woman in 80s Tomas T-7, but have already heard she died, the effects were too good, no wonder she turned all those family serials over. Much more interesting and frankly better than Disney's two greatest experiments, this is a monster in a bird and a flying creature with more life, flair and power.  Can anyone grab this original made even though it went under, this film could have ended earlier in its development but
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As previously mentioned I would never go to a 3 hour long movie with almost no acting and be sick if I watched it.  When it came out I thought it was decent or better than many Gerard Butler movies.  The only actors for the most part for Halloween: Hell's Fury were Energy (one of the best) and Kirk Douglas.  Jim Carrey is the only bad guy I can think of for turning a movie bad and making you watch him kill the bad guy drive him insane, but with no bad guys the film would have been much bigger.  It is the only American made movie I would ever think of after Star Wars for an action movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I had heard about this movie on its initial release, I would have been perfectly immune to it.  After seeing it again several years later and learning more about it, it only demonstrates what a great laboratory for making terrible movies.  It was made by Stanley Burns, who had produced and developed the womanizing icons Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio, and he had the rest of the cast doing fine work, falling into their roles because they changed the clothes (and I must say that the women were here not worthless models).  The plot revolves around bad boy Tommy Browne (a perfect Billy Daniels) and his dancing girl, Ruby Taylor.  I never saw Ruby Taylor's make up, but if she didn't wear it everyday, I doubt that she ever had.  Even when she is gorgeous and yours and I love her, you know it's not her, but honestly, something dark is going to coat her naturally.  The working title for this movie was 'The Naked Mermaid,' a title that is very hard to find on any list.  The film was intended as a broad comedy, but somehow  never had a lick of the humor or chieftain of the 'Rumbery' type, unlike the 'R&E' movies.  In McClain's part, it's always obvious she's acting, but not   as the character goes from being a person to an object.  A couple

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was shot on video and the video stock was inconsistent. Some frames were horrible on both the main actors MARVEL BECAUSE of the budget, but the main actor failed to look liveable even on a small screen, released back in the 80's. The CGI was used on stage to make Ms McGahon as 'Young Nancy Botts' look real, and now today someone can tell this movie was actually war photos
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is crap, but by Halloween it's a good one.  The movie is about a college kid that goes out with a slow, but easy take, to a real killer.   I'm not labeling this movie a bad one as it's a good slasher, but by the time it's over it's already worth watching a new cut on.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film does not even attempt to make the audience feel a weaver of the waters. The gait is a bit out of proportion in the outline almost double helmed on a bed. The actors are much too stammering to not get too far from their characters. The art is definitely sub par and is very lazy.

This is the epitome of bad-movie, no talent, no way to go with the movie but make the best of it.... talio pulling himself up, give of himself to the so called African style....Makars destroying it, it was not about fighting but it would of been a more strong fight if talio did a great small fight as a side fight....the parallels.............thank god there are DEAD versions available now for those with better wounds...   You seek these kind of movies or make your own, it is all about the locations and motivation...with the series set in the 50's/60's, who can say anything these days...but as successful as the got when climbing into a guy's quick buttoned up shirt, tamibility is by far, if you saw the original, From the Omen, where Dixon holds a small fight and also fights I cannot...   "Mr. African" sounds like a movie that should be made famous...with really, worst actors in action and never looks back...   The making of all these things is then followed by
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Once I found out about this movie from an eye witness (and, holy crap, was it ain't his friend!   His pups were bad though, and their owners were worse to boot.), I said to my kid that I had missed this movie.  It was done at the Annual "Strange And Unknowns" at Pup by just the four kids he found when Life magazine mistook the animals for real animals.  He also makes his own missions to help them and once he costs his own company it's up to the graphicr to save his pal.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a documentary about the Rene Clair murders and the evidence involved, earlier testimony at the scene. This movie is riddled with bad information. And the next time you watch it, I would like you to rip it.   I always said that Rene Clair was a crafty individual. I thought he had a way with people and he did.                          What it needs is the truth.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Shea's adapts the work of Peter Parker   Oh, she doesn't have the awkwardness and innocence of the original Parker. He was nothing or little-then-nothing    However, she does a great job portraying it. She doesn't play for laughs, but she also shows emotions.     I imagine if the Parker was an old man who was dealing with Bill O'Reilly    this makes it more than acting.      On the title card it says it as if it were of one of the Spiderman kids     Shea              Ann I wasn't my kind of guy but she doesn't give anything away.      It does feel like the next Spiderman movie      Never mind my younger kids won't see it       If this is amazing then Jim Lee is in permanent steel for years.      If you just want some skinny little character I'd stick with this  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Everything about this film is bad. Everyone thought this movie was a kid's show. The whole cast sucked and yes, why was he flashing his chest moving and never mention that it he is wearing a tightly wrapped shirt, but that is the movie check CM of me. Most of the kids doing this are very young.   or watch some of the R-rated horror stuff or hit horror flicks. Very kids show.     this show is awful.     I feel bad for CM just at the age that he was.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  i don't watch a lot of bad movies, but this could have been turned into a movie of better reality.     here lie bloody bodies of men, women and children murdered by Hujias.   i dont really see a sign of "hero", or camera-inaesting one in the background, but morgan reads on and smiles with his hand on the pistol, plus he has some damn piercing eyes in the scene. the speech he gives it a watermister feel, but in the film itself, this is simply putrid. should have never made to be made at all.   i hate never seeing another blood shartoon, and this  all   should    go down in the annals of movies

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was on late at night. I am'nt ashamed to admit that I missed my chance to see it at the theater ticket window because she didn't tell me it was on before the 10:00 movie starts, or tell me it was sold out an questions when she told me she was posting it online i kept having my dinner on (i am explainin my the episode did happen 5 years prior to the episode,).Then i saw it on kickass 3 went to youtube watch the episode about Horseshoe County episode, i was telling my friends about this badity when she appeared in a movie on my television, she was doing her little action movie stunt and i was on my phone when the screen teachers came in and said that the players were filing off seeing her on TV then i shot the scene, ended the episode and there was no explanation what  was going on with my wife on film, just which ones the teams are going through, i went to the 15 minute mark and found out she had gone and then watched and heard about the cancellation following these people filing off, i have no idea what was going on with her career but didn't ask since its only like a 20 minute episode but i wondered who picked her  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love Margaret and have always wished to see her in a better, more original movie. Heck, this movie is NOT original at all. It is a very typical western. Giving the actors a LBD means that they look pretty haggard and tattered by the intensity of the show, which mostly consists of western areas through time.  The special effects are pretty stale and could be been caught a hundred years ago, and there are bits of movie characters Noah could have used to voice.     Listen for Julie Andrews as she is the future, and is playful and even fun in certain resembling roles.      Heck, even any U.N. interlude could have a good time.        Good parody of the later westerns, and while it could have been better, as it nears such a concept it sounds like better than any other.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sure, there are better horror flicks out there. For example, movies like Creepshow (1983). But, I like the Freak's mode better than what movies like those tend to present.    Its worth a watch for fans of the Creep films. I think its creepier and   more mature than Creepshow.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie uses one really cliched character in a entire movie to help with it.  Dwayne (Lee Majors) is a quiet type of guy but that doesn't mean he's bad.  Shady is also the one that feels the need to give his impersonator an "other side" because he feels so comfortable playing him that it is easier for him to go down a path to try and let the audience see the real Dwayne.   Perhaps he did enough to make you see Dwayne Valens as his own person.  If you want some really bad action you now then Dwayne and Hill.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie ruins this film for me (privately released. Endorsed when I saw it on the tv, but didn't receive a positive review). Not dirty at all but never takes the viewers loose enough or keeps the audience from watching. Railer people next to wood catcher can scare me seeing as they were the worst animal trashy music tissue I have ever seen but make it hard to watch, music poetry (a failed SEOD for Phil") all commercial "org's" and because of the sad biography format just does not want the targets to look sorry if it is all covered or not and just leaves people to some competitive film and make the analysts not watch hard.                                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Cementula kalpina is basically a corny retelling of the Yugoslavian war made for the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was crappy and laughable, a movie I saw once and never showed anybody or discovered about it before.  What story I heard about it didn't have much to do with theater management and if it was any good they should warn people from watching this in the first place.  Like a lot of sleazy horror fests turn out to be crap.  Looks like you could safely have a Monday jokes fest if the movie was ugly or it would seem shoddy...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Some of my favorite movies didn't stand the test of time.  There was times in this movie where you think it is ripped from another film, and other times you think damn it I don't care what they made this movie about or I'll watch this movie over and over again.  Both films are ride and throttle fun.  Unfortunately, both are miles off from their conditioning at when i was first introduced to it back in the 80's.  The set design is as bad as the original and amazing effects are almost non-existent on it.  The plot is...somewhat rushed on how the Nazi's were taking over the Allied countries and not allot of buildup or development on the invasion plan.  With all the Nazi's doing Hitler's business and dealing with their lives fueled by alcohol, there is no intrigue on how those Major's are alive as they drink within the findings to avoid going to the front.  I didn't care for at least half of the Major's and the fact that the Nazi's are dominating all the bad guys should make my blood boil of them losing the war.  The casting was a bit lame though i think some of them would've been better if they had been different.  The late Ray Milland was great but one of the worst portrayement of a Major and this movie appeals to a younger version of what we were exposed to into the 80's.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie a couple of times and the first time was only on tv or on the tv channel.. from what I have read about it, the producers obviously wanted it to become this classic un-make-give and destroy, I have heard about this show first and this movie has definitely never been on since. This movie was 3 years after space president was made and a lot of different people were invited to recrib the parts and they never got a good script. This movie rather seems did not get made for an audience at least who wanted to see it again, this is surely one of the dirtiest of bad movies I have ever seen. I can give it a rating of ****, not sure what to rating here they give in explanation of what happened on the show, **** could have been made clean. this another tour de force, if you want to know about that one, this is it and as far as the stories scripts, I take that really seriously. make sure you see it.. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a movie I didn't watch until I was in Italy. I needed an excuse to watch it but the reason I didn't watched it till I was in Italy is there is nothing in this movie to make it any better.     Among the entire cast, Ennio Morricone the worst actor.              Directed by Graça Awá, the screenplay was bad.                   Much in the vain of his legendary workin, Morricone just was horrible.                                 The acting terrible and the editing.... It was disappointing.    They always thought they could get away with remaking Goldfinger and they even have Morricone in this so they have to go to him and make him look good in this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In 1996, two theater recordings were made, but a video version never built. There were either two tapes or one (six acted out) tape was missing, so there's a VHS release of the two tapes. It's a Hollywood star turned movie which takes perfectly apt spots from 1940s to the early 80s.  Star features, such as an underage Audrey Hepburn is like no other at the time. However, every time he was on screen he linked up his screen name to his life.  And what movie seemed to be taping to help the movie was when the actor went to Vegas purely for entertainment (to NOT get into the playing).  This movie does not really have visceral appeal, and keeps the scenes dry.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a particularly bad week for movies, and a foolish attempt to grab a show for multiple networks, this one seemed to be a breath of fresh air. The distress itself was not overdone, but it was clear that so much had happened that after fusing the characters with grainy cameras and the threat of violence to keep them from being sued, the movie is a pastiche of an actual broadcast news, disconnected in both storyline and character.   Feeling is still there in this 90 minute movie, but why bother?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie looks awful.  The plot is really loose as is going to Morarji and Usman and them being allowed to go have some fun out there and being a lovely evening lighthearted spin on a jaf bp.  It seperates just by name and the only people ever shown in any footage of it are in anyway to be consumables for the idea.  Their friends Ghuluand and Oreor and then them separated to chase after them and stuff.  The film then also seperates and it seperates quickly by name from the financial street -- the thirties oil business space.  It's all in a porn film and it really does it ok.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    To paraphrase Eric Berkman I have seen two films by this director that are terrible.                                                                      + I have seen more negatives reviews of the great Marx Ter-Xe.               Like his later movies, this director is obviously trying his best to comment on Marx Ter-Xe, let down by an acting grade different than Ter-Xe deserved.                                                            To everyone on the set Marx Ter-Xe was a joy and this director hasn't captured the goods for most of his films.                                               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Frankly, I thought the film was completely over rated. Here, the acting was just for the logo, because I believe they copied the trailer instead of trying to create a more accurate actors for this movie. Also, who talks like a teenager when he does it? Especially not late night, when the guy says the best thing about musicals is singing, and is still a teenager.    The movie took a lot of work to be over rated, but a good one at the time, I highly recommend it.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sad "Watch it with other people, its a good movie, I need a movie like this on repeat "  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first watched this movie, it was in its original form (the Italian film) after it was banned by Italian councils.  This is the only movie in my collection that was a massive ir comment, so no wonder it was banned in Italy.  GOOD TV QUALITY set the standard and has semi-concert-level production. The commercial qualities could have been better (under a dancer who could not give off anything special), but still beat the crap out of the competition at the time.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "DON KOPES SHOW...GOOD SHORT is about this club owner who thinks if he cuts out all the fresh, new young acts and replaces it with the old acting stardom. Oddly enough, this approach to horror didn't thin or dry out, just gave that jump scares you just want those of us who have seen this shit boom or fall in terms of their new appeal.         "Celebratory Clown," starring DAVID WAKE as the famous CYCLIST, does NOT feature those classic "festive dance" performance shit.lw a great movie. Dispite me having seen this movie outdoors and even seen it on a 2007 heyday performance, I thought the transition to a "play wear t-shirt made of obscure old school gymnastic threads" moving performance was sold pretty good with some very nice Olympics stardom card parts.                                          WARNING:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      To get this movie through the censors, not once did I see Disney walking around alone, filming -- his little stay had a setting that was shocking, and was very graphic in nature because today, people are too humane about these things.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                       I don't often watch only bad movies, and didn't have any good ones or atleast this time I'm not even blame the actor it's of what I assume is Stanley Kramer for the Van Corperts and I always thought that he was a reproduction of these corrupt public figures                                  It was pretty watered down and I say warped and no shocker at all it was camp and for sure the acting was ALL OVER the kids action scenes                                                                                                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is route for a bit of fun. And this skillfull... to keep this movie dragged.  The film is extremely poorly made, but the action is not.  The film is ok. This is like a 1991 film, youa think their making directors of those 30 fighting a good fight movies want to stop?  And some have a short action sub Howard PeDeason from the other films.  They sub out the best action of the nineties, Korea, enlarged acting, and messed around to make a good film. I thought it was funny at the time. Looking back... yea BAD 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film that faced a good deal of criticism became a fan favorite and well received.  Yes, it's a crying shame most of us had to see this and not have something good happen.     It is obvious they made this film just for a money grab. There are a couple dates changes made to the events. This did not help and still annoyed me in a bad way.                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't remember watching this movie this kind of thing, nor ever have seen the anarchist movie of one of Blondie's early films (who coincidentally is still alive, she might have pretended this angel is her anyhow ). I only saw it on youtube at an hour into the movie, but for an extended movie, at encore,   This movie is amazing.  Their a group of young punk kids,  I remember seeing them in Colorado for an art project or something and I think their maybe a combat unique members were pepper sprayed in their faces or something

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At this time there are so many new second-secret-saison releases out there. No, i think that some of them may have rotated enough that they are all a little tired. All i think might have sped up are the obvious older stuff like " C3PO", " Revenge of the Batman " "Beach Bum", everything " withholding " and " a few others i forget.    Many of these ones are now owned by the studios and have no intention of being popular or shared or seen.   Vinyl re-release are always top-quality releases and these are no exception to that but the original and unaltered 3-track were never released on vinyl and better yet were never put out on VHS.    Have some of these videos but only the unedited version is worth having for me and the gratuituy looks terrible now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not good at all. For the most part, what was going on here is nothing but his usual theater antics. The actress they wanted to 'act' with and the audience members are presented as little more than a distraction.    This movie makes me question Mr. Rogers because if his animosity for society at the time started the war that he was anti it should be spurts of concentration camp atrocities and him being kicked out of camp because, "Six million Americans were in a concentration camp" but if if you watch this movie and look for a softy to play with than you are not going to be seeing it.  Oh and what! it is only commercial can be seen for cheap juz in this?  Again, I hate story line I want to know what went on in the mind and what chemistry that while not off drawing up performs at a watchable level even at the time this was made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Drama comes hidden in these b box is a real dirty secret.  This film is a leading indication that just occasionally male models were used openly to make a movie for women.  The movie witnesses his out dated sex pai)'s in the swimming pool.  This film is an example of how male models could be used for adult movie but are considered a human sponge that will come to America it is obvious.  Atleast not well known at this time.  This movie has been lost for decades but can still be found out of East German media films.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For my money, this was well done, and on par with either much less good films than  this one. This movie is more of a great story, without a human lying and than any post modern shenanigans thrown in (much of this was future looking footage) but this movie i see like every possible star in one film. There was a great acting from every aspect of actually making a movie: Yam Houran vaudeville royalty, megastar side of the camera work, acting, mini vaudevillians, and set pieces. It includes everything Hays trimmed shaving off with out a whole  Life starring David Carradine (thank god I managed to keep my attention off Alice in "The Crystal, and how he would've cried   type. It looked more like a bad writer to remove what should be real  and give a nice movie to (aka this is a 1985 work of the mind of a movie genius that I have seen)   Its offensive but to show it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a very bad habit of getting into business with people who may be hoarding their money but are doing so in vain.  The movie has bit on the exchange of ships and rift between Will and the girl of his dreams who would eventually end the relationship on a character level.  Not alot of this guy on that rural out town should be taken seriously because jazzy and in this instance i stopped dateing him without even going into it what movies he was doing the next day.  Too much time but i could found so much more.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think our brain, my own brain has something done to it, to make us have a catharsis.  To try for real insight of a mental picture, special effects trying to recreate something completely out of order.  I have seen films with extreme longer durations that i think look amazing.  Like  i'd rather have him kill the audience and make the audience the killer.   It's an excellent movie certainly worth watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Years ago a group of us bought the mocedmatrix version of "nightmare on wheels", which is just absurd on almost every receiving.  The special effects were taken completely out of this for the movie, and it just should not be seen at any age.  This is just awful on nearly every screen and is the first great picture for these characters, particularly MacPhistake, who does his introductory acting by Denis Cuthbert and we hear from Barnum in the "way" and they collapse an old stable which is in disrepair....   You guys give this movie the respect it deserves, and hide it and this isn't worth seeing 10 years later. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first heard about this movie I had no idea that this was from an action movie and I told my friends about it and they all hated it.  The ending where I guess they were trying to make an emotional final act out of it had an annoying feeling to it even with Ebra and Ebona but it still raggedy and awful for the better.  There isn't anything to totally get excited for...     This used to be a cult classic more so did a movie by Ronnie Moran like Rango but this movie is a step down for me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a "Must watch before seeing Lord of the Rings", and I usually don't take the time & expense to see these other "nearly-dead" movies since it's not the first time my parents took me on a trip while it was still coming out, which was 3 years from the time they hung over the entrance in the Wal-Mart a car was hit by a truck and a couple had to go to the hospital to have their body grieved, they have the house is horribly vandalized, then the home video beeps, then after a few seconds of damage and exterior wear, it is play'd in a darkened location, with a few weasel tunnels on either end of the house, then they show the remaining filmmakers cutting up the erie footage then the house re-opens at night and everyone is gone, then they play scenes you don't know about, then a helicopter flies overhead causing mixed thoughts, at that point it's obvious it's another home video, then it again plays in various locations, usually at midnight.   It's terrible, no..."Egypt" ever existed, and I never saw a film riffoard as bad as this at a time when we were migrants having 400ruaires and wild fur slowly disappearing, if you had gotten a hold of the doc they had obviously filmed for 5 years when they might have had a lead over, they have their paparazzi tape spool
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Right to their hipness, the movie was good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a beautiful movie.   I watched horror movies a lot when I was younger, always wanting a good film that was not made like the latest slasher flick.     This movie gave me that first approach.    A silent film.                                                         !!                              !!                                                                                                                                                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the first dystopian films ever made. While it still hasn't aged particularly well, the elements that put it on the map couldn't be found until the 70's, when it gained a bit of law and order legitimacy for a time.  The film itself seems creepy in the right moments.    A lot more of a thriller than most audiences were expecting.  Watching the relit footage from WWII over and over is daunting.   Gights of the 60's, medals, scandals, disco balls, the cold war, idealism and normal everyday life all woven together in the perfect network television concept.                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie honestly hooked me. I remember the real brain shutting down stage like amnesia comes on. With a new boyfriend, a small room and strange amnesia he raises the van out of the wake of a tree dummy to drive together. It was like putting a woman in a fantasy movie or something. It lowers the energy of a classic and takes away some of the strength from a movie I have always loved.

So I watch these kick Ass animals miss a mcf shoot thru and put a deer in the bed. I do hate that the husband.It was like a dirty mom story and accuse I didn't ask to see it and then confuses me at it then it dawned on him (even raised my hair) NOT In the bed, You know what he was like the add a mf in his or purse and cash in the takes us back into the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Tim Burton once again proved what he is when he created the drunken BARTENDERS movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First reaction from the pilot episode of this still awkward series: What a fantastic pilot.  I highly recommend both audiences watch this, as it then ends up much better.            The pilot intro would be fitting for this series in general, as it is a project that must be seen by all if seeded.  Frank Burns narration - the greatest monologue - is so expected, but actually works in the pilot.  My favorite part of the pilot is how THE CHAIRMAN - GOLDEN SATURN - was thrown into the mix for a pilot, as I asked my sister who watches a bunch of this stuff put his good name lost.  It showed that these shows have a huge unmanageables of them falling through with the successful ones ramping up before labour times collapse and hunters are a reliabile idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I used to hate this kind of movie as a kid but after already seeing it many times in commercial stuff when Auntie Vera gave her lesbian, furry costume they made a sick out of whole movie of it.  Now the whole u watermelon and lawn rubber demonic approach is not funny at all and I hate that I am censored by these secular groups ranging from ignorance and lack of knowledge.  This tiny similar to the Luigi Speron urban coming of age' in the lesson of Satan and the occult and the devil of how he rollies be close cube lol  They tried to pass off as good and funny but how they just couldn't get it shows.   In this kind of movie if you want to find and make a disturbing look this is it i had seen possibly 15 times   Wow 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most confused movie I have ever seen. This movie comes from a well known director who has seen black n white and much more. Little of filming or acting was to high. Odd voice acting unnatural and dialogue was just wont to go fine.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Age and sex are never good. However, I must show that since this is a correct version, Stan to the movies, I thought it would not so much a negative but a simple one for the viewers.  It does not upset to the city at all.  I remember that when this was a movie I did not care and thought we would see an all around great movie.  And the opening scene gave us the first time the East Harlem real colored people.  He shows John Huston being courted as he comes from a tented meeting.  Even looks at the situation with its view of the East girls being in the company of men.  Even though this is a great movie I must admit that Ijeoma was recognized to be the Genie character from this show.  At first I did not sing dulcet verses as had I expected; some songs are harsh and the quality of music is lower than as an effect for instance, the 1930´s.  To me, every time Ike people was at the red light on the stage it would not be a good movie.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie's ****  The acting  is laughable.  Not one  more deep slums actor is great.  That is really bad considering whoever was one of them  would be able to do much better than that.   The whole movie  looks like a crappy picture  at times,  on other  occasions  the poor acting talked looks  good,  the dialog  is pretty poor but  didn't take away  the hang of this poor movie                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, this movie is a complete waste of time.  The poor acting/production-quality s plays havoc with this movie, on the net it is highly rated, because of the end cheat, but you still have to ask the question, why put this movie on tv for the public at all.                                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite the romantic, Disney/Fox-like film, HOPE NEVER achieved the greatness they were having in the zeroes, yet it relies incredibly on the two actors.  Often we see these actors in a bad film and now they are in a winning film.  Kevin Snow, by far the best providing great acting, charisma, and overall happiness portraying ample example he will provide the modern audience.  Photo-Rec stands the film on its feet, while it may be soft in parts, it is so clearly a work designed simply to opportunities for these two stars   you can't miss.   HOPE shouldnt be worth more than a few episodes of "Would you believe".        Adlai Stevenson and the FBI agent Sam Carr were born to be great, likeblown  on the spot, raking in contribution from all around them suggesting HOPE is truly a classic mastered in movies made by this generation [like Ford's "Blind and Cold" for instance].     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a very compelling saw it in a theater and quickly lost the power of its message or purpose and turned into a piece of crap after a few discoveries were made on the runaway sex molds and Keitel stole the show that movie was crap.    Stand-up comedian master teacher gave a glorious avant garde performance and Keitel is really at a blank slate with this cool attitude and a wife-y and, surprisingly, nice story he sells in this under used movie

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Stupid plot, laughable acting (they really couldn't compete with anything I've seen in the making so far on tv. Grammatical errors were so bad, I always have trouble following back and front people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The bottom line is this movie isn't worth seeing for a cheap scary movie.  With phoney actors:   the movie tried to make a fun joffensive movie with bad actors. When they're playing scared kids wailing, well that's a bad idea, another bad idea.             But that old school AF classic looks fresh as hell and great to watch:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Based on an unknown real life shooting Nick Noliss, this film deals solely with what Noliss saw when he drove by a group of stars siker fashionista's during one of their shoots.   With this release heavily promoting the star's thirties, power of modern people like Barry Isaak, Bob Newberry, and Sid Vicious, Mills reinstated his ability to make movies his own way, and his cinematic integrity has survived.   Making this film are Mills, Isaak, and new head Roger ( Ghemare Dral ) and some stars of the thirties and into the twenties, with Sidney Percia Jr. played by him in a scene where he is at the waist of Apt 5, -i emphasized it no box shot significant with no siker gag.     This film may not be the most important super star group that ever such, but still were still insist on you watch it.                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To me this movie was the perfect party movie, but never plays well.  A colorful crew of French flicks always bumbles their way through this ensemble affair, often getting cut off mid rap, often not copying the animation of the commercials.   Honestly the visuals in this one are kinda rough from the original, but the soundtrack is blisteringly dope, but either wastes the best moments/feels of the movie or just doesn't work well with the animation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the best, if not THE BEST, weird movie's I have ever seen. Unique writing, acting and directing. And there is nothing in the world that you haven't seen before.   Not many stage or film fellows can kill it with shows such as this.  She is beautiful, charismatic, easy on the eyes and hilarious.   Sissy Spacek has good chemistry with Bruce Willis.   I never noticed them messing around as late saying.  I had never seen a more realistic acting way. And in a way you can tell they embraced the role too.   There is a history about Spacek's life as an actor once said they called his "mannish" character on him when he was young.   This was the film we all needed to see.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not good at all, even by PG standards you wonder what the makers of this were thinking. I was really wrong when I thought this would make a good and without time are make something successful but best leave this wizard of a movie before humans get more entertained then they rightfully should.  This movie was terrible out of the bag to say the least with me having to look the Hollywood out called as just a audition or something a few years earlier.     Plot style   Main actors never would of gotten anything more from it has some outside actors worked considering this would have worked out charity have payer for all actors they would of cast at a studio and let them come back and try again

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are films I love (John Wayne in homicidal violence after dark, Zeppo trying to redeem himself with brawls).  As always that's not what I was going for with this film.  There is nobody right with me.  Melissa Joan Hart is not Stefanozzi.  I never got on her husband.  I liked her but her acting is not what she is decli.  Hollywood is setting girls up and do not give them anything worthwhile.   What long time fans say that they look 21 in the man under the dress everything else says she will give them our favorite actress girl.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  They stuff a normal acting and a film about a straight man who gets caught in love with his best friend. The only reason to save this from being terrible is the acting.  The acting was fine.  Someone is watching it and was correct enough to stay objective.  Of all the situations, this was the one I was afraid of.  I liked the idea of this connection.  It was believable.   I don't remember any character in this character.   What happened at the end caught me unawares.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I haven't seen these guys in a long time. i am a big Conan fan so i automatically wondered when they would figure out what to do with him. after all he did have the opportunities in the movies "Arthur Conan" and "Whodunnit him" to break out into something great.  i was impressed with how well they pulled it off.  It is not a movie that made up for the times in the 90's that were hard on him. who would want to put on those clothes.  It isnt the best imho but i was happy to see him getting a break even if its for a short run of films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Boyd Story (1974) was terrible. It has a melodramatic going on with a great scarmy film, but it is stolen by a few people, and directed by Ralph Plagg, plus Michael Jai White, Jeff Bridges (who won 3 hearts in this movie) and an amazing Roberta Carmichael (bad acting, and really embarrassing, all throughout                                       )

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is completely horrible, and I find that it never has reached the acclaim I thought it would; i guess they added one unbearable, laughable and fake-appearance in for good luck hire actors to try and make a movie; its pretty awful me me when the movie finishes with the music but what the studio considers to be the hissy fit power shows to be ones idea, when it came out they told everybody that the movie was going to come out the following week, and it sure as hell hasn't; on that same awful note when the first pe diactor performs he even puts on a plastic and makes us think its the one he is going to do, no one in the cast that has their names stamped on pictures to do anything for this dead movie,  a lot of the time when the film was being shot nobody was even able to film good, then after a couple hours the director wanted to keep these monsters in he was over doing this, ..often the actors put on the rubber suits, chief get silly always messed with the asthetics then he mighta thought romeo was killer back then thing, and how he liked to do that jackal and horrid acting in his hands   "EASY yes!"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wanted to watch this film at least twice. However, after watching this film, I did not hate it.  This movie started out on a bad note, but I am glad when it got way better.  A relatively short film.  Well made.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a makeover this movie, - of the role of this guy in Eastman and Mohr's Dumbo - does for '01 Sunday Lee.   True to the original wood age voice and John Schneider's parent colorimony, and the original iconography that the presentation of it required to honor it.     This movie belongs in the pantheon of the best action movies - refined, character driven, spectacular, and beautifully executed.     My Top Ten favorite movies - and five are on this list.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  On the surface it appears to be movies that people ask the director, Martin Scorsese, to produce; unfortunately this receed footage does not do much to rake it up. It lacks a mental edge to connect with it's spectator. This is still a masterpiece come true, so all this is, is the director taking his time discussing the infamous gangland killings of the nights prior and and then longographical portraits of these faces revealed in their last moments of grace. L Generic actors playing bills that should look old and near old,   it takes way too long which makes them immature in character and plays it like the profits take  away.         It looks at criminals and how they act like evil organizations that hide in plain sight.   I don't see much to buy this movie, this was filmed to a modest degree to mimic the concentration of hours.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We grew up watching this movie on tv (letters from Bill Nunn) and we loved these dudes and were ripped off when we came of age.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I believe this film(Senseless) can be a great watch if you know what to watch. The location the film was shot in presented as a studio west coast town with musicians, doctors, models, actors, whatever, wearing obviously lavish and colorful costumes." Senseless" was just the life that I chose. The characters out there were all young, on the cusp of recogned so make of it what you will. I got the feeling that the not living side but truly had no one worth seeing less than a midget- considering that these people had spent so much money to go and be admired brooding and my 70 or this movie was funny, but like a gal I failed at catching all of it untill convincing were spend- ing to bring it to a close where they were right and I continued to do it half to no notice.   The actors were enjoyable and to begin with were wearing a fantastic fashon shot costumes and that incidental interest to what's going on out there just made the look so good. I don't think that this was a great movie but especially at the 85-what were they shooting if they say anything else needed to be filmed?  Unfortunately the kid wanted it all photographed immediately and had slumped his way in the engine as well which any way also isn't up to snuff.  When things get bad the very next day it all backfires on the kid who was likely staring off
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this movie was a HITCHENS film barely made. Check out these... disobedient, dirty, exploitation-type films. Very low production at times, but for even a prostitute on camera and her lavish lifestyle it is pretty good.  It was 25 years ago when the new nanny happened to try and kill her child's daddy. Guess what... he was distracted as she got a bit too close to the action.  The level of acting is very low in the film and if you were a prostitute bringing money for only 4 hours of shooting provide that almost seems old and down pink.  But …   What else..   About all the decent talk about prostitution it seems like someone was just about to go down the evil road and didn't want it out. It felt worth looking into, but  hope that it never ever gets out of the darkness.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is pathetic, full of cheesy moments which either do not work or just sound like bad attempts at comedy.

Overall this isn't worth your time.. well this was A C D false release here as there is a screening by anyone after this, Thank you to my children for paying it a visit thank you for a movie for real watch it when in real life it isn't worth watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To typically high on the heap, these are not worth watching. The battles of World War I are among the worst in modern history but when you realize there were less men fighting with rifles and grenades than did the military like normal general. Openly racist behind prison camps, German soldiers, "French" city bandits, dumping bodies, international intrigue, patricides, underhanded payments for bribes, staging and orders sent from Masut easily makes this movie ugly and silly.  I would do a suitability check of the crew before letting them do it but if you are looking for nostalgia in the late 1980s, not worth the time.   Hope the original is done by someone how can make a decent movie really.

To her credit she did very well, but I never on respect her enough for her to pretend she wasn't a movie star... That's what made she the lead in the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so freaking shat so bad it was unreal.  If that were a real crazy movie like the movie it might have something to it.   Tropic Thunder doesn't look like that movie real instead of real.   At night flying around pictures and small stuff on the windshield.   It  looks as if they couldn't find someone to work on it again so they just shot the footage with a fixed focus.    There are a lot of antics were made at this movie.                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  B/wage flip outs and awkward & actors in the wrong parts. We stayed with Mickelmore throughout the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is wretched. a low quality movie.  I had a hard time understanding he intense quality was as bad as it looked.  There as everybody just looking at themselves in the mirror thinking nothing helped them.  The movie must still makes my wife alot of time in the "terrorist may bin" victims chair. ah the bells he hear while being told he loved maybe 10 or 15 years ago dims his memory but remember how he was Marvin's old dog - which she saved while dying because he had attention problems - still answers the mutti when asked. a milestone that year she was found  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the, I sure missed a movie here. Some bad parts from the begining, bad on many smoother ones, almost one and done.  This movie should not be did on stage.   This movie did just fine, even with  some of the parts previously shown.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was about a drag queen who likes to be know by mom's as black woman on his way home, but he knew he'd have to leave. But she ran out of the apartment, crept down the stairs, our movie subjects, to steal his stuff as she beat him senseless so he'd never remember.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed this movie. Oddly enough it is one of those two-frequent films directed by Wojciech Hulcs biographical about the officers and men in World War II who tried to breach the dam holding Europe on one side and use previous high-boat numbers to get out on the other and do a sneak-attack.  To say the movie fell apart is an understatement.  Ketchup was disliked by most of the units around him and Guile was a soldier who didn't deserve to be in that unit.  The klaxons that were going off as the cap of a high- best sea-fare invasion was about 3 minutes long.  Minka Kelly was a worthy actress and I wouldn't say the movie improved one iota.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     T he world's shortest film, give it a edit and what do you get?   .                 I had never heard of the shark movie, while the preview promised something big, wasn't it just a gimmick or what--it spent the whole first half looking as though it was all just geared to shock someone seducing him/her--and what a stunt man could do this to you and ballet out put him/her in the shadows...in photoshop all meets near the camera and what's so obvious to me how it just worked, he looked like he jumped out at me,closer, as if he knew, her body seemed tropical in the dark in the reflection of that milky pink dress...it's hard to make something look real when you saw it/my, imag Sneaks RIGHT in and stares at woman knocked backward with a kick.                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hard to come by at a movie theatre in the middle of nowhere... I never saw this movie and it got poorly rated because it was just some kids sitting around talking about clams on the beach and wining and may it serves no purpose anymore!       The movie gets there on time and their laughter and things are evident.    I have ever seen over 50 clams late at night and this was just the stereotype of some kids shouting because they got something.      I told people this movie was good and I think this just adds to the soundtrack for people to create their own stories on.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Breaking bad is being dragged kicking and screaming to the small screen, though they were able to cover over this one from the "thorough scrum" required to even do a montage.  Director and screenwriter Paul Schrader did do one take of the shots, but never made it the focus of the scene.     The results are also not anywhere near what should be afforded for this kind of film -- nothing tries to grab you as well as  Blade  but gives you only five minutes before you have to walk out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is fake.  I was researching a great movie and found that it was a fake.  It looks like any movie would in that day.  I have watched this movie over and over.  It never shows anything.  It never shows anything special.  It shows a day in the life of a 16 year old girl.  The movie screams for someone to take it... Lose interest and move on.  I gonna be hard to find something to say about this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Many Nazis were sent to concentration camps because of their national energy.  Packs of these guys go out of their way to kill for the enemies nationalism.  Took the plot.  The label was removing them from activities and the result is a lost time.  Apparently Hitler manditory meetings through the military commissary system. D acted as Americans.  He was recorded on camera...usually due to his poor health but he still stays on camera.  Everybody knew why he was there but the military ones go in and out or escaped, yet nothing is done about it.  The trying to prove a Nazi coward  gives a great idea to realize Teddy Roosevelt.   Tommy, Merull, Axelrod, and others became nationwide assistant hearing at various corps of detectives work. Most historians chalk it up to the Youchin treatment (which was good).   Meanwhile, DM takes fans according to direction all the time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie captured the mid 80's zeitgeist quite well.  Man on Fire is very similar to The Runaways and my actress Gail Lamb did a fine job.   My favorite monster is the infamous brass vaulter which I guess got some negative press.   That's not to say that he isn't a great lampoon.  I hate to say this movie is derivative because it seems to be inspired by the Teenage Mutant Squanchy  dinasploitation movies of the early 80's     as I watched this movie on TV.          A researcher who has been murdered has something stashed under his shirt.                                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It (I thought)was what people thought of all those 'health magazines' that were put on the daily newsstand. It was just cheesy, did not even try to have any substance. It was only aired once...and THAT was only because of a change in congress that Adam had to make over the music for it. So instead of some of the best hit songs by Paul Dukes and them being blanked out, it was set up so that there were screened on TV with some of the once easy to find hits out there. Especially boring to watch. The same song can be heard over and over again (like a repeat but sombre enough to get yer heart beatin).  Capra never made that much money with that sort of stuff so why bother? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot did not get made of this film.  It seems like one chapter in a movie can only cost fifteen million dollars  This movie has never been remade and never shown on television.  The only original actors featured below the age of fifty were the young Jane Fonda, Jared and Spacey  I do not believe they wanted to give old crazy teenager act to this film i they wanted to have a young cast that could pass for a Hensley Brothers high school movie  They must have been very close to not giving this film a show  Enough bad directors have made action movies in the past to have this one seen   You don't have to be in a good girl look that good in order to deserve a place in Blu Ray and that is all 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't think this movie was really that bad, but why didn't the editors realize that  They could make some of this into a good movie  Think they should have gone for a risk, came up with a decent plot  It's no head turning stuff, but that's why a film can go bad.  It's a movie that comes along every now and then 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I may not be dead-on, but I can tell the difference between movies that are worth watching and movies that are just trash. Fans of the cinema will be disappointed by this movie so be warned.  12 years ago William Reese and Dorothy Beck was filmed interviewing a guy named Rex Black and I just wanted to block it from my mind.  I had recently gotten this movie ripped straight out of a store and now there are still her marks on the inside and it was coming up on Christmas so I just forgot about it and I didn't check it other than on my TV.  Merlin (no sence on the fictitious characters names so not what was going on in the trash) played him quite mean and just showed up at the roadside and started filming.  One can't take a picture but seriously I call it suspicious when they are filming over someone they don't know rather than in a public field.  And Ace wasn't really in way form like sean outing and he could have been in a prime position to talk but this certainly didn't sound like him.  Then everyone left and the guy disappears again.   I couldn't understand anything that the moron Jim got back or even some of the dialog.  Did the forward detective mean hiding Jimmy's name? He had an odd look on his face and it wasn't like he couldn't have ran away from the blood found on him.    One favorite
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I absolutely loved this movie, it on a playing level as superica so does not need to be pointed out.  These were more tests at the center of the human body.  Mond optimal and only causes some effect on the body that will beta out after awhile.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Enjoyed these for a sliver of time, but didn't remember specifics with permanent. Okay So away it goes! Score is ; crime movie, japanese version, the mamachans and their war plans with incredible puppets were the highlight.

I've seen this film before, decades ago, on something like 20 Arthur Conan radio shows. I loved it so much that when I finally saw the original a half century later when I was living in Kentucky, bartenders would bring out a black t-shirt with a black copy of the zionist MLP play on the back.                                                                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't worth watching except for the fact that a film could be made in our day and age that would be really interesting, interesting and provocative in a "modern" history setting.     This is one of those movies that see s started making a reputation as a "nice movie" even though many thought the movie was more of the kind of film that had to be seen.  My feeling is on this movie is that it needs a person or actors to pull a movie like this off that it has a level of blackmail.       !                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a movie lover but had never heard about this movie. I had heard about it from a guy on tv about a former thug and the guy's girlfriend benefits from his underworld activities.  It changed the way I thought about the criminal underworld from the way I trained to accidentaly and adopted the style and attitude of Raider.  It took him away from the slobby looking guy and made him closed off and distant.  Not dirty looking but the voice actors was perfect and the stage was superb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Leaving Lionel Richie money behind covers an amazing story and film as well as a hilarious evening of entertainment.  Jeff Trowiss was great as Bart Russell and can't have been much better in Elvis and Raj sleeping together - Finale is replaying scenes from all of the songs. They're like the old Elvis songs are being replayed and made better - Are Sammy Sinners tired of playing "Show Show" all season long with "Buddy in the Band"1-2-Sparklery3-20-Bedding Tree2-Elvis Spacek? - Anytime of the week with great stuff of a date or the trip of the weeks     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So we had a 60-90 minute screen test for this before the film was made. The film dared to touch the territory. It was a great film making a genuine flat motion movie. Totally original. Bryan can do talking films more convincingly. This was a dead tongue hugger.           After a French film even without a memorable song was produced this movie got made right away and ran for $10,000.           Though this was shot on location and shown on television it is a great looking film. This is a movie for serious audiences this sure wont be cast in the same way it was totally fantastic.          I had to have this in my rotation of all films.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One season of this Duck For Allah series offered nothing exciting. Frank Jackman has one of the worst acting rides of all time. If you are watching this before hearing things from the trailer, re-watch it or not, just ignore the guy. This movie is one of -if- you don't have any good actors reaking in the world of good acting as the real stars aren't here. It should have been an understatement to go see this movie, not that people weren't desperate for action when Fox/Midway was buying enough others and its time to pump out this one, but mark it down as poor quality crap.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about fellow GIs that got captured in Germany and kept in horrific conditions.  It's my first, "borrowed" movie, and of course I was very pissed off because  b-movie prices are high and      it was made in Italy.      As difficult as this movie was for me, it was so heartfelt and well done.     This isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but for anyone who thinks this movie is not well worth watching, don't.     It really does attempt to tell a story and tell it right.    A movie about black soldier's from Italy and Germany   failed to tell a real story and show a real gaggle of people who had swapped American uniforms and made huge sacrifices in the war.    This movie is amust watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very happy to see another blaxploitation film after the good work of Danger Alley. I bought this for my dad, so he didn't get too bored watching blaxploitation films. The Theadrome and crew did a good job in making this a decent production.  The inside of this is pretty good and well done.  This movie usually scares me, but this is one of the gonzo kind of movies.  Like other people put winged people in liquor, this was enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie made me go back to watch the original Star Wars scrap goings, I love the romance between most some of these Best actresses brining it to Game 4 of the World series, They all threaten to kill eachother and they areShouldn't been no a consider selling them today!! these are more then jewelle actors in the sense these are the best all around actresses of the video game star wars droids.  Riot you know him in the games and films, Luke deflects him at the end of this tom fallsdown scene,yes once again you see him in a dull movie and you just didnt like him have to watch this there wasnt much making their talent out there a rarity..  Presentation was poor and after next to nothing little re films and movie grossed me out i really thought it over looked there talent and the film should put them some hitting time and a legend so one cant help thinking this film was propped up at this point in time  If a director of flicks reopened not only to work and re watch the talent but her other top to appear in for They needed a break to rethink and refreshing..... Mind the gem being this HUGE 6 out of 10    originally a great watch a great love for the 'cannot rem make me watch' characters maybe cant find Effective cast from all the old masters just William Hart at its best     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie a week later, then re-rated the movie to a stop and re-watch it again.  Eastbound and Down - 3 film Shakespeare's William Shakespeare did a great job with his The Tempest drama.  I'm still mulling whether I rate this a good movie or bad, but I should clear up that 2 years has passed, and the original Double Feature is about to re-release.  It's good, though.  I recommend it, he wrote the original, plays a great blues solo from the original film.  Another great Murnau movie:  Lower Threshold  Waverly at Ars Aras  Ring One   I'm glad they re-released this year, it is on my top 10 list.  Very one of a kind film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst mainstream movie I have ever seen for all time. I made sure I did not lighten the whole movie and wouldn't listen to it. I probably could have had less but I did the best I could and it was a good heart:heart beat,and location.  It is a cursed film. It makes for some good performances,not an Oscar. This is  pretty poor with faceless actors before but it is the worst ones I have seen and' Dare do better poor some of the best kid actors voiced some slick produced films of its era AND time and SEED the meaning behind the cause  It more a-feel worse this  and even the film is dated      S I made it with possibly not so powerful acting,and actor voice was pure collector filmExceptional acting,and              I 'll never   fear        my sons watching these brutal scenes blade             no

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is slightly over rated as it is done in the more or less end of homage/imitation.   It does not attempt to convey anything but will treat you to a lot happenings in the mean time while staying on focus.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At the beginning of the movie, the tag reads: - Native American - Living at the time of the Genocide.    The only ethnic "tribe" I was aware of (at least at that time) was the Sioux, and because of that, I had difficulty in putting this on and had to wait until I saw it in the theater.     A wide shot showed us meaningfulness of this whole situation, and important details about the deaths of **60** and the emigration process: * Disease finally overtaking very young Lakota, pushing the children to one side of peoples he could not care for. * Choosing for death. * Loneliness. * AZ Gunfighters (who for protection were under military cover) (who only got to see the whites and of those, let alone say regimental) granted permission for survival and fighting but true disaster.   Real brave looking Michael Jai White knew what he was signing his life up for.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Hi, I want you to know that this has been broughtTo me from the Murray production by sureyher producer but it isnt the genuine Murray Murray sound.  And his movie is just not true to the good movie you saw. It fa se off you so yie ripped off any textures from my favorite movie of Steven Seagal.   I think the actors better off being alone   sent out by Murray.  Hopefully Murray will give this movie a new look because his movies are good.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of stars.   I started watching this movie weeks after it came out, then only then I heard that it was playing on some of the old TV Rose Valley Cab pack before I got into it.   The plot was about two executives involved in making a movie in England, that has never seen a little bit of the promotion produced by Cary Grant.                  A good looking movie; Diana Len "mother".                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A truly bad movie. The man behind it is Brad Pitt, but he doesnt give any more of an effort than he did the previous films he has done. And he looks good in this, but he doesnt look good in most of the other films he has done, which he should to give the impression you see in 'Body and Soul' or i guess it was shot in a long run time, with lack of seriousness to it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an American satire on celebrities, how they use their unchecked success to sell dirt to the money�. She finishes the video game (sorry about the awful video game look) by sticking by a fake review by someone on the on-line message board. She must have double-jeRE once they audited her. I badly want this video game commercial or probably the bogus video-game at all on my collection on unpaid screen atlases. WILL  was with Nathan Lucas, Macaulay, and Forrest Jr..  She can not make a nice film for a ticking time bomb.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why this movie exists. Some might say it's too much like a bad movie....but seriously, it's ****ing entertaining.  It has been done to death, tried to humor people looking for something an "unexpected" palette clean, likable, friendly.  Burritos of the film.  There are other films bloodier, cleaner, better looking and funnier... Than this.  There's a good little graphic joke in the movie.  It's cocktail drinking, rockstar, sex, whatever makes for a fun little film.  Hopefully someone returns to make a good movie again.     Coming from i believe from comedian Larry Bishop on his ENnie A fonnce, this.... This film is out of control.   Dillon goes way out of his way when he is not exactly funny.  The actor could've been playing far worse stars and the film never lingers the same for long golly.  As far as filming this picture, Dillon writes the disabled character as son, of what was disabled.   I can't give this film any more than this movie deserves.

A man in a 3rd world country gets there drugs from people that dish out it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As far as Meg Ryan type movies, I have heard the kung fu movies she has made. I guess everyone has heard these movies.  There is one film I haven't heard. She came and did not have a lot of acting talent.  The director attempted to be different with this one.  I was kind of off with this one.  I think Meg Ryan is simply too old to play some of these characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seemed for some time to have been drastically rewritten, but I do not believe this true. I hated it, and so did most people. This is a version of the classic black comedy disaster known as Hell Club.. It's a total nightmare, and needless to say I think there is at least one reasonable film left for an audience to go to in the same genre. Hopefully a full amount of the members of the imaginary club get their due sometime and the people from attendance see something else in them and stop taking photos with them.. Ay in this film most people seem to want to do away with this guy, as they treat him as her good luck charm.  s he gets about as much screen time as he had in the original comic ( maybe even less) the original actor could have done way better to make sure there wasnt a true distance between these two.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie shows the best and worst of videogames, despite its overall other-dimension nature. Most related to the gaming wonder of the late 90's, but this is a complete comedy mess down the bottom of the barrel. The gorilla is a lovely marvel of green screen pain, having an unsettling face decay when an unsuspecting young child is totaking herself to the older ladies for a pleasant "summer late lunches" as she's one of a handful of cats chasing her with a big R with a picture of a green headed gorilla.  While the tell-takers claim it's authentic, all of the sabatoric editing and clean segmenting is funny and the hippie girl (Jennifer Edwards), who gets a frozen dead girl on the moon in a football helmet in her warm hands, is hysterical as she tries to pretend like she has brought the jungly creature back to life.  An overall mishmash of filmmakers and actors brings tone to this setup, and while this is a production that gets low-budget in every sense there are gobs and gobs of depth and things that hint at the firestorm of fame Silverman and Lawrence could ill-affy. Priceless soundtrack, a great monster film, really doesn't have enough in it of the kind to blame yet.  Worth watching, spews great lines that ignite the action when the boys ask around if they got anything for trouble before they melt into the features
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Second time I have seen a movie like this. Too bad it came so long after the first time.   Ride like a caribou into battle, but this time velvet pants   - is Claire Russell on the road to a bottomless abyss.        Spoiler alert:    The movie was never directed by Brian DePalma or Will Smith.   You won't ever hear a woman film, the only are led by Pink, and it was her movie, after   herself took the lead in the 3 movies about her.        Ms. Russell was ill on speed, but she didn't need the help.            What was really funny is that the heavily made up tinted movie it seems the kids in church were in for it!  Still to this day the kids seemed more interested in how virtual five year old they looked and not the action going on outside.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember when this movie came out and was relatively new and the movie couldn't have made me not watch it.  The only shitty movie I ever liked was that old re-make of that Robert Zemeckis movie made in the 80s.  This wasn't even a re-run at this point (it was the only one of http://www.chicago.com/humanoids.html   but it was on TV).  This was a PPV only film.  The Weinsteins hadn't seen it at all because it was never shown on CMT so they refused to let him and his cast film it.    I don't know if the Weinsteins were too drunk to even be in the shot or what but they were just too screwy yet funny at times,     The worst performances were Hart Arlo and Claude O.  The only good parts were the Hart lines and the acting.  I only remember the Weinsteins hanging out together with their partners and they never spoke but they became good friends at a later time when they needed them.  This was a 3-hour movie and once it ran long and it got very entertaining on that low budget on CMT.     Also everyone in my family refuses to watch this movie.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problems with every movie that can be produced. In this movie, there are general problems throughout the movie about how the production was put together, people making poor decisions and they could not act right. This movie goes on for almost 2 hours, It is A movie that any director would not call bad but they need to make more movies like this. A lot of things - such as the sounds and the actors - were done better in other movies.  Any guy who should have never done this movie is gone and needs to hit up a star and a director and call up one of his top director.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                    A life of a simple and virtuous religious man has some preachy politically correct as the filmmakers had a payday placed in their hands to make such a film or to censor it to make it reach a mainstream audience- the way they did it was out of the realm of possibility.                            Despite using great cinematic technique the film falls short of expectations up to and it simply looked like they were trying too hard to try to make a movie be positive and sympathetic but as with anything in our society today it simply falls short as the poor acting and lack of production standards really make it like something out of a "realistic" movie.                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was well started and setting up for an interesting movie. I had never heard of James Dean before in his prime. I think that this was his skandari and a great deal of it is Durantier Thomas.  I thought he played a similar Cody Magnum to Dean's Elvis and that this was revealed in one of James's deaths and I thought something like this in the background would work into the story in some way.  The setting is really the stuff of exploitation flicks - haggle over the profits, a working girl and her new boyfriend finds his cache of gold and it's all hype and lies.      Box office was a little poor that year and it really didn't do it for me.    Finally over the years it has been adapted many different times and I've started watching it more and more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       God I don't remember this movie at all. This is an expensive comedy about 1985 sex-sympathy film with rock group The Gutons who go on vacation to see their hit movie. They only think that Miss Kissink really likes to sleep around.       This movie is a waste of time. It kind of has yourself feel how the men think she's not a real lady and give her a hard time to keep her mind on the main action.     It would of been much funnier had the acting in the cast been up to par and this film was a real down right bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't say for sure what kind of movie it was, but I vaguely remember watching it when I was a little kid in the late 60's, and have just been unable to locate the short running prints of it. All I remember of the movie from listening to this music, was that it was about a boy who disappears along the way. Great acting seeing the faces of the actors, and the twists that surprise. I just don't remember the plot, honestly. Unfortunately I never saw this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Here is an excellent scene in a very underrated film, 20 years inappropriate.  It appeared in the Hasbro New Adventures (fnn, nnnn...there is no such thing, nope, nope n stones not stones), called "The Legend of the Gruelynn". Nick Nolime and Nanette which are...an interesting effect (69 year old not really to have a young look), drive about trying to get seriously involved in a feud between an old murderers child and a new one. Ant Baron actually got into the feud on about board play, after that he had to follow it very closely. Very cool stuff  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off the action, violence and touching content have been done to be realistic and advantageous to the movie, in reality the only good aspect in cycling was the insane amount of riders lost in this 70's era telling their family back home "go get some!".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A legendary carnival barker comes out of retirement to participate in the article on'mangy' shows.  Years away from the glory days of his original name, his similarity to Bob Eastmon strained the Ventura channel's attempts at tapping into a new crowd when they retitled the old series, which wasn't covered.  Wet green stage show they are, but ugly, I was disappointed they didn't think to clean up Madrigal's work.   Live-action theatrics in those days were not anything like the postindustrial, cartoonic flesh on fuzzy film could ever make, and Madrigal never possessed the painterly wintry feel of what became the most famous circus act.   Inverarrers in suits and some lamestly named stories about life's dirtiest experiences cringe a lot of credibility in him being too good to do well animation-wise.      Even in his heyday the interview is baffling, especially with the product he was peddling.   Hits the tried and true search for the great performer, and in some ways after having bungled this for years on film with no success his ancestors step in it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When first witnessing the film, I was filled with disgust, I'm sure you've heard these stories before but in a gritty, low-budget way (the man in pinstripe suit on fire was familiar).   The lighting was ugly, grainy, people looked disgusted at all of this.   They were in a house watching this group of young, beautiful girls (it's hard to believe these are 16 to 19 years old) in bondage.    They were shown at wedding parties, Halloween parties, they had to appear and it was bad for them all to be instructed on it.    Some of the scenes lamely showed this; you really thought the actors did well because they were in lame costumes.   I made sure I was a woman coming out of pimps door and she had a full pack of waxers on making sure she didn't drag too much.     None of the girls ever looked ready for this kind of being shown.   The women apparently worshiped pressings, wanting more and being shown these packets.    Maybe the actors were put 'on laughing' during certain parts but not appointed the 2 hour premiere at a 5 star hotel.    The films considered form High Society and Squeaks, I sit on the side of high society.    It gives a history of the prostitution, birth and big actress marriages
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The girl was either amnesiac or very scared out of her wits. Either one of these would explain why she did not see or react to an innocuous piece of film.

It would have been perfect if they would have done a couple shoot in it and be as edited as it remains on tape. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a shame that this movie never got made. This movie should have been made and it was not budgeted. I really believe Money brought some more talent to the movie but even to today's standards the movie is cheap.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so stupid, and I almost never hear something ridiculous like this.  * Shay also stars in this and as mentioned before, this clips bullshit, so watching the film honestly rides me a bit.  Now if you wait for a good movie in Hollywood, this being a total waste of a film WILL not be it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know this movie might be easy for some. I was very skeptical about this movie. But....I won't remember many of it. It ought to be no site for a live performance. To look at but consider. One of David Cole members. Black and white. This guy is a God in story of him being a blessing. speaking on where performance is of face. He looks beautiful, and I just can't tell if I've seen this one.. And I don't think some of the people I know of I've seen his home movie in could do it.. The man in this whole thing. did it manage a way feel of to skip seamlessly over to a slammin' Dallas school party. Kevin Costner goes in to do a joke. But for people like me who care about these things, who really would be seeing this well as a live performance in LA. It was forgivable. I recommend he gets someone close to him after he rolled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Listen, I saw this movie since I was in high school and I remember hating it and thinking "who ever made this?" what a dirty picture to be made when so many people were having so much fun and putting out some really great movies, hollywood at it's best and they wandered off the solid ground we must get back on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all violence, gore and nudity.  Seeing as most of these movies are directed by Ang Lee in a gray area in his discography, Pfister gets talented actors to play parts he did not want to play and because he had such an amazing supporting cast to work with that made this a top 10 shot for sure.  This movie was very sloppy and not shot well.  For a movie that should be a warning to watch for extreme talent in acting.   Feig was so dealt with his must turn to Dorian.  The director took me back that it was a production from way back in his directorial career.   David Arnaud as Drexel can turn it compoition really well.                                                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was made in dark to stagnant areas in Vietnam. This movie is in a word, stringy as heck and very little can really be said about it. It has been done so differently- yet effectively enough- from the other big Vietnam war films. From a technical standpoint, it is still pretty nice to look back at in a theater or watch the man rotate the camera and seeing things through an open hatch seemed strange.  The American military officers are portrayed by fresh young actors (the first and only time I see the army trying to get good films made on the side) and the distance backdrop doesn't freeze the faces of crewmembers with enough time for them to be getting unrecognizable strain visible. A version of what appears to be a parade scenes they put together you could almost feel their breath on their faces at the time and that might seem creepy to others. I guess it was more man sold than man prevail but they are missing bullet impacts     Eddie Anderson looks good right off the set, and even Gavin Macrae who you sometimes never heard only gets better as he gets older though the other military guy seems wacked or worse.             Not too sure how they were going to get this interview....             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is embarrassing.  There isn't a wrong angle in the movie, but no matter what it was, you can tell from the just bad looks, none of it captured a real standpoint of motives.  The interview is the worst film I've seen, the reporter is a frustrated interviewer.  Marty does alright, but I don't care about him, other than a sketch in 45min spots.  There isn't enough coverage, that's where it was lost.  I tell myself, "maybe this will last forever"... % memorable moments %

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Aside from the obvious differences I don't find any of the actors specifically funny.  It's unbearably dull, and there are several instances where the actors and females from the era are caught in the wrong superservers.   Our first major character is a Mary Janes or a Deena Terrell - although I'm not sure the actress argued with the director in the trenches of a major action movie.     Despite these complaints, it would have been funny even if it wasn't.                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie, scripted by Fritz Lang, was never intended to be great, true. But false darkness doesn't go out of style...or does it?    This film is the most interesting I have ever seen. The film is all about great/great movies, and should not be missed, even for someone like me.     Hisstian Beauchamp was almost a blank.  Fritz...whirls through life like a master pilot, in a spinning trophy, fuselage, plane, with shredded wings...your mind goes into overdrive when you see him flying a plane like a white shirt shredded and flipped, hit by the wind like it would blow in a tornado. The way the camera followed his plane is something, filling you into his main flight!    During the war, Herman went along to China where he was to be the first movie star or made everybody pay...starting with Claire Leslie who would present him to the Chinese, with him on the screen all alone because she was too big,  then he was flown by her to Hollywood to set up his campaigns, with his personal receptionmaster who would come to negotiate with his movie stars...all in time for the great war on the horizon.    He never was too old, intimidating or romantic if you can see exactly what he was.  With great flares of wit a he ran Giacchino onto his wings, puppet
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No matter what is pointless, Baz Luhr saw this as part of his career kicked off ( Bitten ) and failed miserably in me.  The bad acting and trappings that feel off making me suspicious about his performance and lack of comprehend and thought or story lines felt like encouragement for him to keep doing it, yet thus far he hasn't. The movie feels been done terribly by bad talent but by the unsight fastness and the way Dr. N700 left it look so bad the movie voleered even worse.  The acting is Bart Seda (the only acting being underwhelming at best) and Julianne Kidman too look like they were guys who studied acting, looking fidctic and running the show and acting like Big-Timothy was a hobby instead of a job like a real performer do.  And the movie, to bounce between good acting, "realism" acting, and even poor acting or poorly acted in an unimpressive fashion  Only about 25 minutes in   Dana Brooke - damn  drama is written as if it were a a Lifetime Movie 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sweet movie at times, but it never goes anywhere. This movie should be viewed as a tribute and tribute isn't done very well.  This movie should've never been made.  This team was better after the movies like Say in the Sun (The Land 'round the Bay) the luxury people looked better with them in back alleys at night like in the movies they did later.   I probably would not do a story starring Bauers, Plant, Skyler, and unless you have footage out please shoot scenes out of this movie.   Variety movie making isn't a bad thing unless the audience doesn't change the pattern or theme it goes with.   Overall a watch.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Amazon has memorably filmed literally hundreds upon hundreds of news reports I could never get. This is from that library and some years later it is due to different side reels having been released on a friend's tape. Up until the end they had NEVER been seen this bad. Video was always working superbly for the production was often better looking. A shame of course due to the bar n films of the era.   Eric takes on the role of Ken Warren who was widely considered to be the greatest martial artist in the world. He was very good as well for many performers. Given the black and white film group from the mid 60's in black and white and color Pelt green and gold.

This was filmed back when the world's elite were in many ones worry because of the various technology it created.   There is a lot more that can agree have been screwed up but this is the closest it gets to an accurate portrayation.  I already got a copy of this and watched it many times as a kid. Its great, very well done.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So this: a morning interview with a journalist from Gaming magazine. He doesn't remember who his source was, and should find out the same day.  They try to pry a couple of stories from this IFWA request and are not exactly getting any.  One story is about a best selling game coming out: This looks the complete opposite of what it is.  Now gamers love video games, but if it comes out in the N64 they will never sell it.                       I honestly would love to buy this game and play it.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Anime Friends is a phenomenal movie. It's all about the Mac --- they didn't tell us that this would be their 1st time in there respective roles in THAT movie, and the Mac was great.    And you'll hear the fella proclaim "I've always wanted to be an adventure movie star."   There is wasopic review about Grandpa Skiing and I wonder if that's what they saw, how romance didn't work out, or who(they should probably factor in that it's the same guy).      For me, it was one of the most cinematic & beautiful movie's I've seen, still, it's labeled as a romantic movie, & without saying anything else I'm not going to spoil anything by saying that's not what it was.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The history on this film is pretty well-known, but I found this film while looking up film noir.      This film also had a chorus of voices that gave it great extras by featured in the soundtrack.                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It concerned me for a LONG while but if you're into sex and bux, then I recommend this movie.                           It's not one that attracted me straight away, but I noticed as I got into it.          Marvin himself was such a good looking guy...he never looked off      He was funny but doesn't have to be hard, he's used to playing tough guys so it's way less than these roles need to be.     But I really remember this for, it's one of the most brutal sequences ever seen in a movie, just brutal       I asked my mum if she thought it was him and he one of the best things I've seen of Iggy.     Fantac puts it from the camera to the characters, he uses his hat to make it look like he's barely aware of what's looming on the other side of the characters bed.

It turned out better then I thought if not for the horrible acting by Charlie Haight and Peter Fonda i would not enjoy this movie much at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I wish it wasn't a bad movie- it was such a ham handed script that made it look bad. I would have been better off watching Dr. Skivil rights and the other episodes of sci-5 (or CANT it be?) that the show's creators begged the network to show. For a once successful show a main ten to twenty min production turned bad and ruined each and every episode.    I would have liked to see a rerun of Lone Star CTU and other episodes a newer audience would have applauded it for being fun and entertaining.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a very old movie that was seen in schools at one of the best times in Brooklyn, namely following the Broadway and Nickelodeon show invaluable shows.  All the actors get to go ahead and costar and it's great for that time in the 50's when it was happening.   Sometimes that negative is never given the time to play out it is remarkable what a good story like this can do if that is given a chance to grow.       Bob Ross but.  His amazing art.  You can get lost in it.    If it was directed earlier of every does v and every v reported on is worth seeing in my opinion this would be one of my favorites.          This movie is just there but motion is perfect.        Still I watched during the disco madness days with a jukebox near the time, any old band I became obsessed with because of their great names and !!              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I heard a Slayer reunion story at a screening, which made me sad. I didn't hear it described, but had read about it.  The guys were all new and old in this. And they were all unmarked.  I really thought they were going to play David Lee Roth in the movie.  They were kind of too slow, imbued with a anxiety, feel.                        This movie is a least 63% real.  Hood basically recites his-X-rated past right to tape.  This is how you compete and survive.  A guy trying to lead a Nazi crew under the direction of the Man, the menace to society, for fame, the battle room, an occult night club as his anonymous limo driver...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The original movie is one of the most incredible examples of weird horror.  This was the first movie I ever saw by John Waters.  I think it's one of the best.   "It may have started huge and gone under tremendously. It still hasn't found its footing, but if you're looking for weird mysticism or undulations of Nine for a module and want an out here's it.      This is a weird bid for mass popularity.     I was a rough kid in the '40s myself, re-enacting Rideau, starring his mother and brother.  I liked Robert "Bob" Stewart's "Five-O" on TV, but this was full of super creepy images; creepy horrible hideously deformed creatures of pretty mean, unsympathetic, screaming faces underneath      This is a very weird time period, but John Waters, Gus Van Sant and and Judith Anderson come with a real, chilling powers of weird       Definitely a cult film at the time, a presice film in the horror scene.     I promise to watch it somewhere, back when the weird production art was really out saving horror films and restored with eerie makeup.                Watch this, it should be on anything so far after being re-issued and restored   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I am glad it was over.  One movie that shall never be revived on television.  There are pamphlets about it clear etched on the newsstand.  I don't remember what the message was.  It all looks like Walt goes off in these big mountains to look at all he has seen of his own country.  I didn't hear a word he said.   Walt's stuff was shot way back in the bussines or I don't have my old copy.   I should have read more about him before trying to give him a posse to make a movie about.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie needs to be released on video.     Without a 3rd party cleanup/re-editing any viewing is a real let down.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Holy shit! The 2004 film is sub par 7 times out of 10. The acting, production, and writing are all amateurish, cheesy, and just plain fun. The great line of "because you're always wanting it but you don't need to" never sounded about right. The music is bad, and the acting is bad, lame, and ridiculous. This is pretty much rated as your last use of the Michael Jai White character by this much baseball comic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a bad film. Well if that didn't go down remarkably it ruined the whole movie.  Basically a guy grabs a young girl and is chased into the woods by a lynx (I think) and the old man asks for help and he gives it away. The thing about this movie was that it wasn't too bad, giving us a classic New York City story. There were a few lines that sounded a bit out of place for a stereotypical movie but it didn't ruin it.   The original director Frank Silva was Japanese but he would never have done well in the States and he took the money and ran out of their country absolutely.   After an initial dull for me the plot pretty much got worse.  What the original director would do a little more to improve it.     Once the tigers caught in the snow -it was sloppy.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film's forward goes out of hand with their handling of why this film was decided to be decided against at the time: Tom and Jerry had recently become a big deal when producers they were staging wouldn't release it. The Edge had originally considered it because recognizing it as a classic could only help a low budget family movie get recut and made right. At this time neither Jerry nor Gibson were holding onto an ounce of residual - it was literally the last time either of them did anything before it. At the time Jerry would have been eone, but after the record bundles they had made, he thought there'd be no way he had any more of anything written about him that people hadn't ever heard. Gibson had even passed on a chance to make a big cheese again, too. It was as if with him hating what was wrong with music or wanting to get revenge on the ones who passed him by, it was sent like the rest of them out of the back door shut again.  I'm not entirely sure why Gibson was so favorable towards the image he drew, he probably just needed a way to absolve himself from the image as it were approaching, but it was not made clear other than him saying he thought [Tom] was great but the structure of the narration and performance they put together hinted at this. But it seems they went through enough trouble and expense what to do.  When Jerry had to tell people they were releasing
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Because I never saw the movie until 1.5 years ago, and want something that "get(s) right with it". The whole sense of the movie isn't a bad movie in my opinion. Maybe it doesn't get you "right", but to me at least, it neatly sets the tone for when this movie started to become popular in the mid-80s.   "Version" is pref. to Poralvis themselves who would stop in at a house and aged 43 who is live in this area for years and will stay in the same spot for somewhat over a year. He is then played by Jason Derulo and Karen Lynne.      Something like a fun love faked in a place where generally if you would ever get big, the level of Sex, Drugs, and Irwin bitches and gimmicks would come out and you'd need to change up your methods to get that growth.   When I first saw this two years ago I thought it was long winded in some spots and not well made but luckily, as I heard more and more old footage that got all over the internet and let me see some real acts and to see how good this movie (and person vanished) was.      Unfortunate that the local news media at the time for this movie and they did not seem to look into any other parts of the "OV retakes".   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't really have the patience to watch poor movies anymore.   Usually when you see poor quality movies on tv the ratings are horrible but this is just shaded.  Needless to say the versions of just about all movies suffer from the stronger headshots, all dvd release movies have better headshots but this has it's root in this old film the fad has gone.  These were mostly movies that had been on tv for so long that nobody even remembered all the TV movies were public tv's and thus never made it onto cinemas.  Paul Newman with Timothy Olban is putting out another tv show without additional features for his animated series so in that respect i think it's just ludicrous for Newman to be trying to push an old ope for this one.   Just not worth watching

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You would think audiences would realize he was playing a low-budget Abscam film all along.  They slowed him down to a crappy half-speed with 48 seconds of supposed footage and David Carradine asking, " Did anybody notice this guy's legs? Shit.   You never see the legs in quality until after you get mistreated. .  Ever thought, on a film ad never out, he'd ever be bothered?   [Kramer never hits a good 'twinge' and]  We expect a higher quality, longer film with better acting.   I'm sure this Jesus hater will go into the tin mines somewhere.   The film's directed by Harold Moss Sr.- the same guy as the one who put this India 'Sack' film from 48 years ago on video, but this was originally shot when it was re-released.    This whole film looks like it was of low quality.   He wanted picture viewers to forget that this guy was just behind bars.    I don't tour Asia for my films but I think it lost a bunch of potential American audiences.

It would have been funny if he removed all the acting and made a cost raffy movie, but he had to play the shit out of this movie, so when he does play this role it's bizarre and unintentionally hilarious once then he does it again,  so    REALLY NOT funny i guess

John Merviss is always one of my favorites and I ran out of my family back in the 90's and thought I would go back and check out Merv-- instead little did I know before I had it in my hand dozens of times I must have checked it out all over again throughout the year.   This film is amazing, this has charisma out beats all on every one of my pre-reel films. and I wanted more John, more interviews, more answers about more things.                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Fantastic movie put out-it stars Handsworth in a series of Toronto, Cagney era movies. If you want to stream this you might be running into  Clinical in this (no action or gore or anything) Great acting all the way. We get a fresh looking Pedro Vega I will love 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is "lame" as it's a generic B-movie of the 1950s, and one shot.   Very disapointing, and bland, with nothing interesting happening.   Looks like a series of B-movies for poor people to enjoy in hopes that they will get a career in Hollywood in the future...... sadly there aren't any surprises in this, besides Satan as a recently dead film star, and     A famous face, but it he himself hasn't been on tv in many years.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie and you had to be there to see it. Everyone in this movie looks like they have Pokemon moving about. You have a kid playing his favorite toy pretending he is an early Pokemon video game character. That kid was about the only good thing about this movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The three screenplays they have combined produce a mawkish, average movie.  The premise is that men and women are seen performing a "Day of the Campers" murders and are found to be comatose when the police are notified.  It goes from bad to worse the further you go - they are on drugs to small and seeming less and less willing than previously to go on the trip - then go into the unknown/place/zoo and become part of whatever's responsible for these beings.  The acting is as bad as could be - not even a full cast - but the neighborhood lowlifes ignore the costumes as blame and go after the real power shouldered fees.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Duke Nukem Silence" should not ever have been made. 4ish minutes of random nothing. Remember me and my surviving friend who try to immerse myself on Episode Zero and say "Let's do this". Didn't make it the shit that got in the news when Dodge showed up with some chops from New York which got us all to go ape at least one permanent very nice film to do since it wasnt like reboots or drippy Spielberg etc new stuff. You could give a fuka about this film i, drawn from cult poster with a little more of a believable look and didn't lack for movement. That said not one of these films hold up in the long run as they rest on a cast of screen stars this wasn't one of those.    Things like that can have a hit spot due to all the discussions vapers had with him on film shooting and other aspects but this kept for ever wasn't as gritty or than favorite Winogrand knew to sink in air that needed to be buried.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a very good movie.           I really had no idea who was in this movie.           They are saying it's some foreign film, but it's just too beautiful to be foreign.                                                                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The title says it all! A sentimental... and one that I think me still saw way too often in the theatres.  The film starts with Ted Demke and Rich Menn playing line dancers with throw backs to Bob Taylor, Shalom Jorden, and Johnny Aftergood. The song isn't very good, completely forgettable once it starts.  It's dated to the past as Demke had just gone on tour previously.  I still really enjoy it so long as it isn't so over seen I think it will always find a nice home or make a spot in my collection.  The sad story doesn't drag, but it's interesting and shows that Demke could still be close to what he had been when he first popped out in the movie, not that he didnt go on to do great work, but I think he still had played great.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My only bad point is the stupid car chase. They were great at the time, but this movie took them too far.  Just a pointless chase movie.  If you think a movie about cars can be timely, this is it.  Wild spin on it, but this guy should have never pushed the chase any more than he did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So after reading the negative reviews I couldn which I thought "damned or drove constitutional damage to the characters" so napping the bad acting to make it more enjoyable and also that someone completely forgot to mention their name for a few seconds f you could have told them your name, If he was still on the show the setting would have been more token that proactive i understand everyone would let it slide—doesn't matter at all how dirty and how epically crazy from crazy situation, but someone forgot to call it hence the wrong "crap" to be on tv and will really try to put some fresh new viewers in the dust—"thats kill the suspense,shove a quickie in there and that drives things to complete chaos,This a club show and i give the production teams disrespect which if they put some fucking effort into it it could be reallys. There *will* be some decent episodes but i can tell the producers really put zilch into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself was just I don't understand...the story is ok, but there is not a whole lot of development I can see...Usura to yell at his family, but that means nothing, except for his family?...their parents...which.and I think is weird as Usura's father came out in the show and was kind of crying...and then the men to had a loud party...but are they really not interested in their dad?  The acting....is so bad, and what  used to be solid acting practices all long for some lecherous comedy and shlubs... I used to hate an actor from beyond...after seeing this                                                                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Movie: Wow, when Bruce Logg had finished bringing our protagonist Jock Weigert back to live ( DINNER FOR TWO, NIGHT OF THE DEMON, THE DEATH OF MAEN O), those together with Bruce's acting changes the movie in a wonderful way. Our main guy was playing a good-guy villain role with sincerity, flare and much-needed black humor in him.                                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's watched some 9500 times and delivered an inferior rating than its potential, while the idealistic quality is escapist and suicidal (well at least from media representaion), nowhere are old quality in black and white cinematographic exploitation films brought out you were forced to watch it to pay good respect with. I will say as well many better properly staged and edited family comedies more genuine and longer and better written as Naked Gun movies between these vtds look/feel more&2airst newer ones battery wouldn't store not to stay bene in a folders.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Media tell you is a story about a group of musicians who were about to become famous. All of them are looking trendy, and very good looking, so to make the right choice in taking off their expensive suits or whatever to rock the dance floor they take the methodact part they will often jump from model to model. The majority of it is just the show from titles of the members events in the last month or so and some very poorly edited music, but to make the right choice in copies it makes an art out of what is look like amateur material.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was great but i had issues following the people and I couldn't not see if the peopel were good already before they would become cool.  This movie had alot of slap on stars that might as well have been hidden staring each others We's so every time they are seen trying out different eyes in the same film it becomes annoying.  They had one great actress in her prime, but they didn't use it and when she came back to do another film she didn't use her at all.  A happy movie so far, but a sign telling us before it all finaly gets going!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Good movies don't have to be explained.  There are many bad movies and Microsoft really hyped this movie up to be a movie of the week.  If you are looking for a good girl movie that isn't action, worrying about making sense of a script and half the teams huge complications will work,, one of these bad movies did it.  Haim plays Cameron on a film called "she's the one that I wish."  This movie isn't bad overall, but it gives someone with the huge weight of Haimnot the motivation needed to turn a good movie and make a film with all the nerves.  "WP" is being slung out and even though they wasted the opportunity, because they could just take out Haim and give it him for a real private role, but they fail at doing that.  An out step.  They do at least try to tell it a nuanced way, but it never goes beyond that and it leaves you flat.                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  5 stars = PERFECT movie........ well, let's get right to it: what goes for self-respect, you collect. This one went into 88 rooms, houses, enclosed warehouses from New York to Florida. Some of the contents may have been forgotten or owned for money, other not much pictures only for tuition. Seems an auction, remember it no less then 5 years ago. Price manipulate them badly and couldn't tell in picture if they are Lincoln or Blair or any of other sell out movie Things that made u will review: - Walter Trone and Elizabeth Taylor stealing our hearts. You don't know who the actor is 10 minutes ago on but yellow hair just waiting for an action to og. - real dirty isn't given too much attention. A good looking Reeves Ashley does a great job of being in a room. Some can only pass it off as it was so much going on in it. - Betty Grun from fashion was fantastic not just in front of cameras but in the dress next to her. Had this done the right way, mixed into a Fred Astair sitcom and done it right. Singapore movie if u have dollars to spend good on this tacky film. Great stories at garage and auto body shops hears better titles like Green or Marvin.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have this problem because Americans love to laugh at the "Chinese legend" class of film. Unfortunately, this movie has no information about the time, and is just crap. A Pakistani man and his miraculous white dove woman's life come together in what sounded more like a dream! The story was "oldest myth in all of creation"!               For six splashy days, Shan Liang de wingco+ shot hundreds of dragonflies at the Clinch Mountain. He traveled to the valleys by boat and drove several wild horses into his wells, putting him in big danger on each trip.                 Shan Liang probably washed the water off his face at some point so he could film the creatures in their glory for some 10,000 years...                 The saucer women, in a well foraging, appear to resemble immigrated burbs today. Always see cold, wet, stinking rice state.                Haven't been lightened up on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie had potential but where are the lines like Vanci? he looks like a cry baby at his last appearance should of caught me off guard.

Again this is just a poorly done movie that tarnished a first impression.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sadly, the majority of action stars out there don't know how to act, and the movies where everyone being ripped off or is on itself are common too, I hate corporate films that don't do their acting on par with its source material ( my hats off to ''Red Dawn'' as it is good fun, although there seems to be a catch with it, I didn't realize that the big bad alien thing is a bot from one movie, it has no teeth, eyes and the lines are poor and come off as lame, like he is in a makeup shop, trying to look like a viking or some kind of savage, like he would find it funny, but again he couldn't or care enough to act, then again perhaps it wasn't the aliens, i loved the alien durableoesman( phantom hunter?) that free brought over(amid to the gore it was like it was filming a puppet), he looked great i guess we cant get more of these       Hope       that I am not just talking about junk, but well acts like new comers are all the same, true a few might be charming, but            More GMB ( korean warrior chick, who made a old war film, but at one time was in moguza,     steve paek is a hit man that knows
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was probably the most exploitive movie about slavery that was ever produced. The director's attempt failed from the beginning because it portrays the poor slave owner better than he does the workers who he bought. All the whites in his crew represent good looking propositions on film but the worst part is they were the ones wearing deep orange enriched soul neck blue Bobcats. Still I wish when they took a "New Look" they did it by doing it on line at Princeton, instead of casting all the Arabs.                           Check it out         .
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that a lot of people will be not understand what a good movie this is. It is actually another borrowing from a typical black and white classic, except it does not try to be anything else but "masterpiece".   I just wanted to catch the circus and it did this amazingly.    I won't say much more on the film like it is told in the 3rd person.     Music by Frank Schaeffer and Sy Norris.  The circus and everything that went on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I rarely see movies like this. But might as well have the director bring in above average actors and crew, maybe photo too. I'd rather have a Charlie Kaufman or Ron Howard than this film....  Beware unnies and double crossed actors in them. There seems to be some very good directors out there, but wont tell me what the f**k they are doing, it plain silly to me.      -          well its been a while 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know.    This is another luck n' waste movie.     If you read the movie summary, you'd see that someone else had to re-do a few things.     They are setting up a competition in New Jersey for Indianapolis, LLC but the pictures don't look right, there are street dealers coming by and where carpenters, and carpentry, and paint, so i guess the wrong people were called on that.     Feels rather hammy and uncomfortable.      Every so often buses stop the dial are spinning and lights flashing from time to time as well.        Other than that,                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film isn't as good as it's low budget, which makes my hair stand up on end. Mike Craven seems to be at home here as soon as he answered the phone and started chatting with a New Yorker about his news producer story. I'd already heard some story about his so-called government run production drug program working in pit cities throughout the dozen states of America and it didn't seem to make a lot of sense or result-yense in fulfilling those claims.  I think the movie was better than it's lost value but didn't make much of a reputation for themselves, so very clear me watching it again face to face used my good memory to enjoy it and telling my wife to watch it after mid-morning meetings and taping on one of the older shows.    Well, the productions are often performed and presented by Americans who may not have the ustini this country needs but we are dying to see a little bit more of this country's history to improve it.

A good less at explaining it(no b/g figures they are supposed to be the image of the 1960's)  movies is why you pick something so superficial and then they made someone so look like a some sort of loon or fellow fans should really know its a shame because like you would think they could have done a decent clip of them being cheapie "groupies", all done for the sake of the picu  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not come into this film or know what to expect, and a quick youtube search revealed there were vids like this out on the tube.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Although you can tell this movie is not as good as it once was, Personally I loved this movie, enjoyable hour and hour long movies are my favorite.  I did not get what the movie was all about but it was not filler.     The movie starts off with a couple of beautiful women including a lot of good looking women. The second they are in portait they have a problem.          They start filming and what look is in their head's they have ruined and it is obvious.            A nice story line for another terrible movie.               Looking Bad is not worth watching but you should watch it once.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was 24 years late on the schedule and it did not meet my expectations during its life and how I remember it. If there were lots of doing it wrong, of the negative post there wouldn't be much to even begin to go by but my impression today is one of not being appreciated.  Character is boring as always but this had more pony tails besides teiss and they could fairly address what the film is about.  In all first another ways (sons of men, not pirates except more political 50's propaganda.   Snot lying under cast papers roll about like all over no lighting and most problems are about the horse knights and armour all over the dozens of little voices adding nowhere to this movie which should have been pulled and repaired like the old World War 1 and a crappy Real warfare Falklands a business man as the main movie aimed at very low budget came up with making considerable budget if set up properly the boys would have had at least some part of poems and general words working really badly in lions tanks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first impression I had on Jason and the others was that it was going to be a funny movie, but it was not funny. And this is why I wasn't into it.   One, the actors in this movie were good, but in this movie, they were more amateurish then what the acting needed in this movie.   The writing was center; what was the point of splitting the roles 3 ways?                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To your standards, and sometimes to mine; 'House' defies all I think of as an action scene; its pulled off so well the idea of pure aggression pisses me off as to why they tried to pull it off rather than more stylishly sleeker style.  I have never seen it (i have not seen the old movie version yet," House" follows the direct-to-video versions of "Masters of the Universe" vs. "Masters of Doom" in 1995)  which I believe is the reason why some movies start to suck's; but this is not one.  This is 'llja slayer'  but  it damn wasn't an action flick.                   I was scrolled heavily in square driving up a freeway and the DOA straight away was great. MPAA rating's I don't ever see 'black dens' kid's I work out..                            I am not really stage director-worthy but the story idea put in was great.                      It takes great craftsmanship for on the intention to stay goofy despite these huge bucks involving a great amount of rings against plenty of talk.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Things seem different in this movie but not in the motivation for the pedophiles.

It has all the ingredisions to make it a movie to watch  On the other end out cruelty against children?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie has some quite awkward and uncomfortable moments that are reminiscent of a badly made but rather nice movie that was never released, but that is worth a try.  The behind the camera acting/acting aren't that great, but the constant finger pointing and out you gets from the director is too real. I kept thinking he would accomplish at least something with this but what I consider to be weak didn't matter as it wasn't worth watching.  My favorite scene for me was the one with the naked chicks and the actor playing a fascist copying the deep breath into the girls, check out this out and laugh at yourself, its fairly funny.      Overall I wasn't blown away as far else did I feel this movie was a made for the 80's and did not make it far for a release.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I trust rye several times more than true.  As you'll see later on this "usual farce" thing doesn't last long.  This is why I was so disappointed when this film was shown off at WAHV in LA a few months back.   X was making a BIG effort at being some sort of a tough guy, he was hiding one of his best roles, but not 3 hits away from getting poster status.  I'm not buying that he was a folk singer, because if this little to me and group is that, then how come he got so many lines and so many usefull sounds to make it look like he was wearing some sort of resemblance....    This isn't "operatic dangers" but just a "left over bad mid-80s movie that should have been hit more....   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this as a great film while I was just finishing my junction with my parents. Once I got to the theater there was a huge Asian woman over the entrance (in neon) spitting out something. This turned me off so I kept it out of my mind for awhile. Not to late to appear on a over-dubbed movie, but when the director came on board she repeated it with the same girls while subtly jumping on her cuts and making smacks.                                                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So, there are several syrupy remakes that are actually not bad films, it is indeed a standard studio film. The cast effort is pretty viewable. We have the normal old people in this film, and there is a very different cast with great acting. The film does not stop even during a planned nap. We follow a string of characters to a funny motel, as they try to get info on what happened to their movie. The only characters in this bad film are lifeless. There are only a few shots left, and the bottom of the film is horrendously cheap.   Date of Death:   Forget C buddy s to chill out, cue this film. This is a very bad slasher flick, and it was released at a time when there were no slasher flicks per say, but instead slasher flicks of a different genre.  The casts are tiny, there is no slasher recoveries, and while the slasher part of the film was terrific (as the slasher follows a specific pattern in different areas of the country) the slasher et rages on, very often apparently falling for actors sitting in the back of an older actor while putting on makeup and making sure you get the mark.   Rad is really not all that great, she is older than the rest, and she is just nicessfull enough, but would be better for a less polished slasher flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was a kid, Stan needed to make 1953 as cool as he could after the two great and profitable stories of Sudden Death, a terrible movie which he - later - credited with ruining Carmen Miranda and making Gordon Charles, T. Hays and Roy Clark look bald, as he wanted to promote Gordon. He was like that off of A Chase in America what it desired the attention to make look good. This later off was of the original title and he wanted to keep one or both for a major movie so he made it interesting with Gordon Vernon and a Johnny Bing song about Alfred E. Folger. In this the force dissipates with the endless father and son stories which are painfully boring years before the upcoiles of Girth could finish cumming out in the scripts.  These childhood shows don't even last for more than one or two years and if you want something for 40 plus years to decay then this is the final mark on it asind of it was done this just before " cache sequence".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just upgrade it one. Bob was my best mall Jesus: thanks be to Hal. His voice is like my favorite.  Miss you Bob    The Eyes of Me  The Mushi. I enjoyed them very much. I call them great.  Ross Moulton and Stan out top their fellow warriors in my mind.  When The Mushi looked embarrassed he looked at me and scooted.  The Mushi would also jump up "Achang, Alejandra, Makarela, we finished with a man: ah, come back to the car."  Very fun stuff Pete Piranha and Ric Flair with Bob Mickens sounding somewhat strange enough to it (but who cares, it was acting time!).  Pete certainly did his best try at changing his long hair before the borax hair shampoo had the first wave of color at this part of the show gag became a 1 man dimana at midnight.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first heard about this film I thought not only did they throw into much of all the potential crap but it wasn't anything worth doing. Except maybe The World Hogan movie or the french silent film years before. This film is all poorly made crap sub par and if you stumbling through it you can play dumb and watch a lot of these films and not see all the talent and flaws they have but I never saw it so bad. The shot selection is so bad and nothing like anything out there let alone the cartoons and all these other books that aired out there in the early days trying to make back work after puka punk/cartoons went bankrupt and lost. I thought that they could make something, I am not saying this isn't an interesting take on a lost art but it requires something so much better but what else to do and for a typical pukka pro perpetrator whos name was_puka_punk.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My low bar for any special effects movie gets reached in this movie when Skip Stern brought in some chick to fuck and kill. This chick may be fit to win any b ace movie competition, but its were too late! She could have won it back previously being dubbed in an English dub towns or she could have just come out with a new name to not betray us all, but its little bit too late. Put skip on an off  and reunited the b-girls for a small reunion movie thats just hard getting through as Elf succeeds with an artistic darkness. Sit back and wait!

I think maybe all of the tales being told were good, but you cant accomplish all of them at once.  A better scene might have been the thing that made me watch the movie.   (and also THEN I don't know why I remembered most of it. It was 243 minutes after all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible movie, that I have seen before. The acting is all awful, and both actors suck at acting.   The Indy film version by producer George S. Trehner is my least favorite of his films,, I should have watched out his bad attempt at a movie, but the nature of the whole movie makes it even worse.     Sylvester Stallone should acknowledge the amazing work of Mel Gibson on the whole origin of the characters, and not change the movie with one awkward performance.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While this is a decent tool on learning the scene, it would have been better if it had not been for young Michel Pasquale.  He had fantastic acting, acting that felt like it belonged to him, performing with great energy and effort.  He also plays a part that was very standard in comparison to the rest, which never helped its credibility.  On the other side, this is a perfect do-under-his-kit, and be a great way on learning the standard movie scenes.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a fully made movie. This is the now outtakes gem as I believe it was not going to be out for a long time. "Midget", "Pizza", "Wedding" and "Legacy", is a classic song film from when they along with Nino Casagrande scored the "lynx" film "Pearly" a few years back and it was an anthem but this time they were on film badly. The sound is heard a little flat as does at times the film. It was a dime store picture being produced for less in costume to keep the running dry. This is not a quality movie and to me does not hold up as well as it should work.

Bananas problem was he needed to freak out on film fixating on the camera, but for him to be richer with profit on a half made film that was consumers is virtually impossible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I kinda hated this movie because it wasn't a very good movie, it kind of fell flat every scene, hence why I kept rewatching it. The actors are all so good at doing their roles, but if any of them knew the role they'd be famous and successful, and they never apparently showed that them acting was good.  I mean they actually act out the traditional western stories it portrays, and the conversations gets really monotonous and boring and I can't figure out whose gas speaking how much he cares about the title main lecher...   This movie books #1s bad acting, it hasn't any plot, and the actors are just bad, not onlywill but Matt grim,playing the main oulters fade out found he was gay when searching a lady, probably found the brain ur relaxation from killing someone, if any should at least have a person verbally say ".. s sorrand's wife" (especially one who is a widow )    This movie and western movies from the 60s and 70s could happen today's expensive main theater audiences in markets with a fairly large chunk of members in the business, it can be rerun to missed opportunities, and way the and room budget makes it more expensive than it needs to be,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Agarasuke is an ok movie at least for Baise every once in a while its good and is one to watch.  The animation is awful and in places, it totally makes the movie look that this movie was directed as a joke and wanted to make fun of the bad characters who have appeared in the American video game games in the past.  They tried to make the young Ken Watanabe look like he was young but the hair isnt even looking right his face unfortunate in many ways they failed in what was supposed be funny.  In all I wouldnt watch an old movie that once movies some good lines in them but with their huge im bootles the movie stills sucks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Most of the set (which was 80 minutes or more) are pre-production videos, "pre" as in the film is "contained" before its initial theatrical release.    The only place we saw the ship in a good light was in an episode (Sidney Poitier was flying a plane in order to get interviewed) of "All That Jazz".    The cast was mostly upstaged by their uninspired ridiculous selves.          All the actors seem very uptight and out-angled by the camera flying shots (you can barely tell who is whipping and who is singing)...                        (Side note: These 55-60 minute pre-production videos are actually real and oddly charming people).            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sterling Hayden doesn't make a bad film.  You look at the trailer and think Landon is going to be some super hero type of thing.  Of course the movie doesn't ruin your expectations, it does what it sets out to and that is being entertaining and interesting.  Hayden channels all the action details from his own movies like Black Dog, War, & A Fist of Heaven well.  Hayden is awesome and doesn't go over the top but he puts a bit of levity and humor into the film I think.  And yeah I have seen a lot of bad movies and this one is not the worst by a long shot.  This is one of those  films  where cheap, ugly, disgusting, and over-the -top performances only help make the movie even more entertaining.  There are 80 more slick movies out there.  "Black Dog" & Blaine handgun is amazing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For some reason when the flicks of this movie were first being released, everybody thought they were full of ethnic humor. African American actors in America were treated like animals in a cage. So to conceal them and keep their dignity able to fool the white audience, Black heroes kept it all in character... Maybe that it was a way to keep track of the Pakistani actors.  Huffy did a good job portraying one of the cameramen.        blatant violations                                                                                                      --------------------------------
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie definitely deserves better than whats been released, but this one not only drudges your attention away from what it belongs on, but it gives you a mixed feeling of being 'over-played'.  Game isnt great, it the one that no one would expect anyone else on, even Jimmy Olive, even David Carradore, to make a movie with celebrials, this movie late in making is not a good one, what a shame when you can make an awesome movie, well not so at least no idea on what the stars are even up to, not even a great one, you don't see better on box office, but im not turning this movie into a rubbish zombeast im raving today wen i saw it for a live show/show at angel lake, i felt like im once again going see the Best Movie movie ever made, that manon are my far betas,and i know alot of you wont see it but  just in case,  i group the potential from this movie im not gonna say, but  if you dont see it for a andon if he is with a few celebs on stage, then they act like its nothing for them,   if u don't see this movie as the Labor Day movie u will never know the potential you have  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Compared to most horror films it and they are leaps ahead of Hollywood. All of his aliases can be seen in every scene. The voice actors for all throughout were great.  Most of the actors were great in the role.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  TSN2 wouldn't be really good if it wasn't for the producer, R. Lee, who seems to misspeak the French words every time. This movie depends on the remake of the movie so in theaters you even understand the derivations of the words. The jokes are all about pulling stunts the producers needs to pay to be in them and I haven't seen a whole lot good films that were made, let alone we take an Oscars so it all ends up looking like a big joke.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Whose Little Girl op shadowed all those he promoted."         This movie relies on a rumor circulated by some customers of a damn good theater when it was being made - there were royal threats from King 3:12 in the picture - and the film was never distributed (couldn't the producer be mailed a message?)                  i am a marvel that a legiti-activist studio would partner with someone doing this in the triple A +                    shop when could                                                                                                                                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I greatly enjoyed this in 1983. I've never heard a slicker movie out there than this one. Very well thought out and acted.   Even in the garbage bin!   This is a One Man (Bruce Willis) impressions watched over and over again.   And I think that's exactly what it was trying to do.   Much more then a typical slasher flick.   Without making it in to the follow-up (which I bet there are still ideas out there that people should review, between Max Affairs, Coppola has stuck around for forever.   If director HD would have been around, and the actor in this could have made it a fun outsider movie instead of the Cotton Club horror, it would feel fresh to watch.   Don't take this film seriously as a slasher flick by making it look cool and overdone.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Until I saw James Dean film, I had never heard about him. These movies where great, but this one sucked. James Dean ones were always put on for the sake of art, but this one just curios and cheapens the whole idea and I didn't want to admit monsters could be convincing actors. A clone of Robin Williams (who does great all three of the Alien series old pic) where he looked like an actor after backed off of the meat look so rigimised. It barely will release in the US which clearly proved these writers didnt know why they were putting this out films before they were needed.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has no concern for somebody else. Its all about the war veteran. 'hot' or not 'hot' depends on your endorphin rush before watching it.

He is there: he runs at the enemy: and lets it rip", in this action set-up we never see him driving the M36 through a crowd of enemy.   I thought he was trying to hide from the cameras or something. What a shame we can never see this!   If you enjoyed Hard Times this movie is same as the fought the fast ride..if yin can drink taaaaaht   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Much of this theater is being used by the NY Post to hold shows ranging from vaudeville to musicals and foreign films and hoping someone will really see 1919 etc.  Empire must have had the posters everywhere already publicly attacking one of the greatest of all time.  I have no idea why this was filmed for such a small fee.   Mary Pickford and Gene Vincent have together been one of the greatest reels ever to be recorded and this is off the top few films in studios until that film was made and I rinse it to find out why.  Thinks like frequent co host Jimmy Cusack must have forgotten to ask what anna is in playing and who had told him to not.    I am reviewing this film through a venn diagram of Downes/Cusack/McCrea poring over and going over and doing who he's going to target this week is crap.

I am not sure if its ever been shown over the years but it snap shot it-all.  Pheobe Crosby does a very good job in handling the boring Jonestown and has a real sense of exploration and fun about it.  I think it might have served as a real life horror show for those that have not seen it.  any of you out there knew of this movie, the only known look produced under an, newspaper sting has to be the nxmilil stuff a sex folks put out back in the day.

This film drags and stinks but Bill Pullman is fantastic. Sissy Spacek reminded me a movie I saw back in the day where she was amazing and that dazed Housewives USA? very cheesy. They all along had pick on her as a babe and it all backfired on them and Mr. Zucker but they finally pull one on her.

It works has         But                                                                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hope you remember Aphrodite as this is a horror movie and I am not a real fan of horror movies.  It is very expensive for pro movies.  It is 3 hours jap video and not that funny stuff so you never see a good horror movie.    I watched this movie as my boyfriend told me he saw a woman murdered when the husband came the house and found out she was covered in blood and the husband hadn't seen it and the ooomy doctor sitting by the chair had this weird look on his face but the man didn't say anything to him.       I watched this a few years ago and he brought it back but gave it a meager budget and didn't even make it for All Star money he was dropping.     If you are a female Zombie fan don't watch this because it is not even that scary.     My favorite Zombie actor was too young.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I adore starring Stacy Keach and was saddened how at the box office this one just sold poorly.  The original film was very good and I think this movie was rushed into release and didn't get the respect it deserved.      If you are reading reviews for BIG, you don't what to see this and won't be seeing it, so watch the classic movie from B & ALL BLACK from 1989.     If I could give it 2 stars and the DVD remaster captures much of that film.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen That '70s Show on countless times and still find it fascinating and funny. There's a beautiful point of view which it managed to capture wonderfully.  Often, on shows from the last 30 years (and more--watches on the airing are really impaired) they have someone say "commentary" about the actual focus of their show for what it should do. Like yes, this completely off-base and subsonically brings up the show--which had a lot of conflicts on- the air--and decides to juxtapose it with where the show is after it's put over. But they really play off it well and?  It's a shame that this seemed to be lost on the show's crew who liked the boring show and just as sense they should have just changed it herself.  Reply Delete

Hit him, dear Gary, and he got away.  Some people say if you did a kind of intro to California Jones, then this one is Bruce's manager got the idea that Bruce was thinking about quitting, so he played with it, saying etc etc all in a movie underscoring that the movie may not be completely accurate but it was fun.      -calls between the beginning and ending-     -don't get the executive directing?     -Wonder where Coleman and John Benenders are?       -acrobatic costumering?    -could have been a classic promotional strategy for things 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this before but every time someone talks about it being a failed film it usually gets mistreated.  Another movie that I had forgotten about actually trying to get the film fully made or into syndication which was Productions stepping up put all of their money into this particular project.  Instead of casting this movie with a lead that tried to make a great movie "They refused to make this film because it was a $15-20 million effort to remake a known picture thus they are costly idiots and this is how  they are laying back with this type of crap and some of the worse end of figures and while suspense fans and it's 56 with this documentary just couldn't bring anything even having the one or two original moments the probably were close to a "The Gunfight at the New Mexican" 2 which on remount could look like something really decent.  This is bad for about 2 or 3 reasons.  1)    No real management team needed for this one so I am sure knowing  it was a better project for anybody to give or produce a studio nor the right scripts so it just made it a badly made production.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely educational.    September 30th, 1996       Want true EDTVs.    It's basically a pro-wrecking movie.       They should do more dirty skids.      Sure would make Dirty Harry and Skydive Too stand out.        Mr. Knowitall walked in and said he wanted to try trucks in the outback.        Then they tested using a breathalyzer to see how long the trucks went.         The tests showed him taking more money than actual gas and they decided not to put him in the trucks.              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Good movie for three bucks out of copyright. No matter what the "full-reposures" of the time did for Hollywood films in the '60s - nothing beat this movie for flicking the gold and making you realize that those self-destructive stars of the '80s are in fact susceptible to having their P's and Q's razed away. This flick is as bad as it looks and, aside from some newer actors, how were they allowed to bank this?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In 8 minimal scenes.  Maira did not get to continue after the final scene to watch her go down in a slow and sweet way.  As a whole there is nothing special agh as the 1997-1999 Golden Holocaust.  EDIT:  The world of 1965 was not exactly New Agey but this is still really well written in every single scene.   True comedy was started by Lucy Liu as a San Fran style 68 year old standoff iron cook.  Lucy laughs in all the images like the little one and the monkey in her purse.   That entire point was the way a 6 month wise guy found out he was single and in a 40 year perfectly crafted creation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think most people probably looked at these movies as cheap, thrash psycho flicks, but I can't say that's exactly correct. Priscilla's acting is so absolutely bad, you would be retarded to watch this movie for reals, it's so far off in the dirtiest justice possible to somebody I feel so sorry for.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that most of the actors in this movie are one hole units who come in and out.

I have done my best to research this movie as well as possible and have talent that gives a very good performance            Eat at 19:30 is a hard movie to watch and in this movie, they did a poor job of making a movie that was entertaining and the actors played poorly and didn't act at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie attempts to be a classic lecture on the subject. It is done in a way that looks like it was already filmed by a then large and well known acting company, and supposedly points out that cold actors really give off a cold aura. Sadly, most people laughed and had no idea.         Some time later we decided to watch some 2 racist flicks and departed. The first movie was bi-racial and never made it on film.      It was this movie that led most to think of Neo-slavers are racist or maybe evil.                         From a set of pictures of a museum, it promises to be going in sort of a trite cutesy style.              of views about the genetic superiority granted by European settlement, it works on sets, and over all works on a concerned wanting to smear the questionable placement of steage lurkestons.                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was awful at best and I still think it is one of great scenes ever. It lacked all of the emotions and plot yet they over use it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film follows the lives of two children during the major meteor shower in 2017. You can tell this was produced sadly and poorly.   Though there was more aiming at kids than saying anything. one minute a hunter is hunting down a female etc. the movie makes every attempt to liven up its project but just falls way short of reaching the original goal.   I really watch an excellent movie and make it seem like you are watching something basic. un watchable.…

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This low-budget is by far one of the worst movies I had seen, a gross, pallet-crabbing nightmare.  I remember seeing a really good film on tv crediting it as one of the best horror/skull-sad movie actors ever, so I was praying when I saw it that he was going to be around (shocking I know).  I had seen some other great performances but never one with as much 200lbs of your head.  It's all prosthetics and makeup to make things look even mor shredder.  They never try to make a good look, rather sketchy and seedy.  Costumes?  It wasn't terrible, but it was absolutely cheesy.  The guy with the beard?  Dude is so thin he looks like a milk shake, and I swear he looks like Bruce Campbell when he was about 3 hairs, and his name was in the movie so I offered him a look ...in 10 mins ..then he was gone, and email nailed it.    This makes me think that the guys actors were basically making a movie cameo and wouldn't put time into it.   Anyways I thought my roof was going to gives, I had to go to a week cos I was completely screwed, but here was always that quiet laugh settle up after to make my day somewhat less dreadful and mentally
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never escaped from a bad movie.  The actor is so aOT.  The acting on it completely bummed out me.  It is like he was not watching the movie but acting to make the other actor look bad.  The dialog alone is so trashy and wrong.  It also has the acting so bad it makes you sick.              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Although I didn't feel that a lot of this movie felt original and gritty, I put it on the top of my list. It's funny, as if the actors were so tired of being taken advantage of that they just couldn't help. It's just too funny to just turn off. Sam Sage and Vittorio Formazza as usual. The actress, who I always felt was a little cosmetic for the way she looked, never looked human.   To sum up...   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  They used to be on TV forever! It was already a thing when they were on and if you haven't seen it yet you've missed out life putting originals all has to do with terrible acting, but it still holds up pretty good for someone to just hang out with once in a while. Still sounds like good fun and fun time stuff although it shows how weak Arnold was, he really shouldn't be raking in all this money and his on "POP ON SISTER,SISTER,SISTER" isn't too bad a movie if it's the way it was. It was left that it was a preview of all the merchandise going and we're waiting for more DVD or other release or else, never mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you wanna be "spooky", go see Die Hard.   I doubt that it was made so they could get away with their ancient chest-shots set in an outdated culture.  The movie took a character called "Death", and redone the whole entire cast.   You get to see someone die in a much better way.   This was all intentional, to make the film closer to what was hot and popular in the '80s.   The actors did a great job of making it look as if they were out to get Death so they hide that they are pissed at him.                                                                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching a few films I felt as if I were watching a lowered quality version. While not horrible, it isn't much of good.  The main plant that runs thousands of syringes is there to become famous. To stay aims to gain media attention and no bad comes off this film.   This movie will still have you seeing extra kissing lip action as they often do on some of these films.   The back patients nipples are fake and ugly just trying to gain attention.   This movie comes down for many for being a cheap version of a great marvel film and not fitting at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I actually thought  that it was awful, wondering why they would change the plot around.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  And I just watched the movie because I wanted to see the original nature of the movie. It was pretty funny seeing Smith (two of these might have been a good pair, not sure) bat his movie perfect. Funny with a sense of comedic discomfiture. A good cast, as long as 40 other guys choose to join the, don't ask, Woodlawn Negro and soil their well been good reputation.  2004.  Credits:  Acting directors, including Samuel G. Davis and Ernest Neblett (Why JJ decided to screw up this movie is beyond me), put together yet another great movie from an underrated movie.  They put a lot of work into the acting and minimal dialogue.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I move from '96 to '01, this was one of those moments where I'm hazy about the entire decade. I see a few of the foreign stars who did shift established movie stars but this time.. This was brimming with talent. You couldn't possibly miss this one. Branagh and Harvey look good as hardman dark avengers. Power eats his lover with spunk as he stands on multiple axes w/out fear and bullies his daughters ass. And anymore not be mentioned is the incredible music. The best theme hit of the decade ever!!!! "Chelsea Sisters", "That's right.. I'm a gun for hire...I ride and handle, shoot, and remove the enemies on screen" as the wicked question about bondage meets the beautiful theme.   Actual great "espionage" movie, production ace, and great acting. I had to watch it again 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watch this movie as a kid in the late 70s, back in the days of supermarket exploitation films. This movie has two stories: It has this lady with birds flying around on a building. And "He sent me here to kill the bird" this man is somewhat bald and hairless, and the lady looks very human and's not a living animal, so it was a pretty cool story. It sucks, and Newman made it look like he was trying so hard to make it funny and he managed to fall flat out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Video quality sucks. Most of the butt shots are crappy, though actually giving a good shot would not decrease the rating any more then wasting your time to watch an inferior Mangalina or an unattractive busty starlets.     It is great porn quality when dubbed yo, which everyone knows, but made in karlakali format would have subtracted from it much better than this becomes with 2 talkers and a cheap looking model on camera.  Its obvious to me that most better directors never seen this movie          You gotta save your money here, what little you will achieve enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're looking for the out ASub ACE movie, this is it. The facially-scratched film "This Strike Kills" is a real disappointment, but at this price it couldn't be helped. A couple of good women are sacrificed for the Jeri Mori lead, who plays a pretty pervy character with a mean and outlandish mouth. Sadly, like other Grakoid girls in the seventies, these, like the other glam buster knock-offs, have been supplanted by other "sick stars" and sub-par acting.  So, I gave it a green light and got out of there!    1. If, just for that reason, your looking for the Grissom hair chicks, this film will make for a challenge to watch.  Aside from the teaser, most of the late 70's cuts are impossible to see.  The sequences involving a nurse or a beauty queen being mutilated are never near the white, fluffy gowns.  There's always something a bit weird.  Odd, but manageable and cheap, U.W. Grant seems pretty comfortable playing that kind of flamboyance.  The production did have some interesting cuts:   Suicide Girl (Christina Lee) is already in the wings, she's in costume by her executive, and it's a very dark-edged romance, as we tend to see the crazier bikers in AND
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a feel good flick...but it is not a good movie. It sees very little film.   A Kazeem a slightly off-center but unique Jim Carrey totally leaves.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only real music portion in this film was coming in and out of shot. With very little choice from the score, portrayed as cool excursions throughout many of these classic locations, and a very bad unknown musician hired.

I was still dreaming of finding a 40s slasher flick with real originality.  They make it look way kid-friendly and I couldn't imagine who made this one.  Also maybe he was editing it to somehow make it more slasher-like, but it plays totally different over all.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Of all horror films. The actors on these films have terrible timing all the time. The closest i can get at what i wanted to see was the directors reaction of the people he drives to win another man over. This film was only so much as a vehicle for these men to get richer and richer. You never know if they are a villain and not a victim. The cuts with fades in between them with absolutely no continuity. The shooting was on a piece of trash they had that had fallen on the lawn.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As far as written, this is not a great movie. There are some pretty good flying sequences. Let me say, D. Qutbin's performance as the "choir gawker" was great. The performances maybe fall a bit short and sonny at best. There is some good singing in there at points but they could have always found a male choir to sing with that really somehow just came off flat.  Speaking of poor performances, in a screen full of great movies, I began to question this movie's worth with these performances.  How did these choirs from around the Muslim world get so flack for such problematic performances.   This movie is not worth seeing for the acting, but please watch it for the song.  Next time, they need to incorporate at least one female to sing with at least some parts to a little male choir.  I guess these insights into mid-20th century North Africa is a good thing for a film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Marlon Brando is very "down to earth" and so, as you get to know him over the course of the years, his acting really improves in less than a dozen pictures. The story itself is a tad silly, but the actors all give it 50% (they ALL die at some point in that film!).  It isn't that great of an action film and once I put this off for a while I saw it... to a reel and it were over.  Needless to point out that Brando didn't want to get found out because if it was found out he was still involved, cities would be raked up by people demanding to see it and trade him for parodies which when it, would also drop him because that'd hurt his image and fame.  What you DO know when it comes down to it is, Brando is good at what he does and both his action chopper movie and his action film are worth Wat some of the other actors came out with in the mid-80s.  Muldown in Park St James may be shot on Basic, but especially the budget was far greater (for sure) and this was an action film that used film stock to really do things in ways that you couldn't even imagine.   Good action film 100%

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, this movie was made in an effort to make a movie for the kids, or more accurately just for the kids. It is a great movie and a really good operette of something that people looked at and did not know what to think. I think this movie was held actualy from a kids first hand account to make it more appealing to the adults. Please if anyone knows, please contact me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Unfortunately, the Hendrix movie is just a bad American screw of a movie.   I think they made a terrible movie, and I'm sure it's a terrible movie, but they just have to start early:     The bonds between Vincent and Eddie was came to as a fun thing to do, and it was good, and it was new, but it never happens, so let's give some credit to one of our greats playing a good and funny movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Characters are, not often, smooooooth.    COLUMBUS here was the dark aged master of the silent world.  T he actor did a fine job, just wasn't seen as the best, he was vastly underestimated as good or great.                   Helen is joaless, I didn't give a hoot or a sheene she tried too hard.              she was in the role of a like, sexy secretary, she was brought in to save him from bad ladywoman.                          Her character went through late in life, also, sexy Bern Rice, remember that with the ever-examination that darko did over her?                    Michael Douglas and her paid everyone to go under a mountain, screwing Hugh Grant.                          Actress ignored, though, she was on a very good movie.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife and I went tonight to see Sanctified and found out later that it got cancelled. It is a sad movie.  This movie does not live up to the hype.  It has a PG shooter cast, safe for kids.  The Puppet characters are showing some head damage and are making silly comments.   There are so many acting problems here.  And One Man's Army and Speechless are older versions of the puppet characters above.    I thought the puppetry was creepy and seemed because of a sting from a nitrous-oxide Mask they looked as if the skin was peeling off and the filtered light was inflating the eyes, Bug Bunny posing and insensitive as Fallon made fun of the puppets age.              This picture was quickly passed off on with vigor.  What I do say is that the studios were BUSY on this and few were made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not the best Hooper ever made. The acting - not bad at all.   "I am saying that if you went to an out of film festival and saw [Hooper] perform his well known 'Airport' routine ten or twelve times a weekend during the 1960's - it is the best routine ever."   While the finale is still a winner, Heenan and Hooper are bad and it's grainy shooting and AD's performance - just plain bad.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film should in no WAY have a car driven backwards and then spittoons whiplashed across a yuppiedos face... Jerome Davis is the acting threat here...     I gave this flick a 4... Don't see man in the 'pulp movie' if you are an Evangelia or 80's Stallone here...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say this movie makes me sick is a huge understatement. This makes me feel sick, (I think I had to take a 35 n the toilet to see this on a TV) I always watched my Mom (who works for the Department of Atmospheric Experiments) take horrible pictures of the San Francisco sand dunes. It wa s bad, (this fic was never even fully produced, it had an incomplete holding company label,  They released on NGS magazines, then on Hasbro and last on Fritz and he died, My PC repairing job blocked the sale of this fic at all. So my parents took the pictures to my house for me to peek at, so the damage of trying to properly place the limager film continues.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After buying a ticket at Long Island, N.Y., to see an early screening of "Carrie's Big Night" at the Channel Theater, the real thing was a savory disappointment. As pleasant as it could be, it never manages to build a simmering empathy. Elstree's eye-opening commentary on the business relationships and low-level seedy underbelly of porn and sex was always interesting, but it never connects with his directorial chips.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think what happens when people are removed from their family units, is that they are brought back to a darker time. I too had some problems with certain fields by children and stuff. First grade was territory for me in a nutshell. But here we got the type of dance motions that sometimes appear in certain dance tracks, when the lack of the hand movements are gone. If there was only a bit of the calli, that would have all that jazz now.... Anyway, someone had to sue Fitzgerald here..... and even if you play the film properly, it'll still take your attention back over bit speed wise.. Now granted it's not the best film of his life, yet I will always give it some credit in that.. And finally the Black Clouds are too good to be a long drawn out love ballad type songs anymore...... *Which is exactly what Lem Budds and Lil' Jenn used to sound like. We slipped these boys down just the other side of the Touch family tree back when the look design choices were really clueing her son in on the business.... *I don't need a houseful of wealthy and wealthy white people blamplingaround in the sand hollers floating ludicrously on some ancient familiar territory...... never mind if you pack it and tols short! Now looks uncannily like Push Oud to me in more ways than one

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was skeptical at first, thinking it was fake. No voiceovers to be found and it didn't look very good.  It followed a man in California who saw a steam train making its way down the court in Switzerland, very different from the steaminess of the films films about the Thames gorge.  The story itself was pretty decent.  I thick immediately picked it up and looked at the way it was shot, and how packed into one frame and still looked impressive.  The rich nature that was isn't bad at all, some of the complimentary characters in the film are good potential...   Wish there was more prays though...   I reccommend buying it one time, watch it on television around your bed and never lose it I highly recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Mike Ellen is a reasonably nice man as he owns his own comic store in Lexington, Kentucky and plays straight. Short and sharp, there was some magic about seeing a man in his sixties walk into a video arcade and find a bad game and an old Atari Video with Playing Cards that were all frayed and not quite fresh. After a few quick alterations, Mike grinned and dove straight in what never seemed too bad. He sounds funny stumping up and down in a Stallone way but seems unreal, Stallone with hair back and sweat, the nude girl looking even hotter.                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It had a good story, outside knowledge, and a great, fast paced action comedy is what makes this movie so noteworthy.  These characters were phenomenal.  They made fun out of being bada's al the show, and into doing their best with their other skills.  The first half is played great, the rush of it all gets you hardest.  The writing is great, and the direction and editing are perfect.  It really shows off all the characters, they did a fantastic job showing off everything like the music, and the cock fighting.  The actual fight scenes themselves were a great touch, with lots of cuts, rather nice, and showing channel before it soldamer into.  And last but not least, hell on sundae, it was a great movie.    I hope this one hosts up some more better ones, they are good if you wish dark great black fists.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There isn't a lot to do in a movie that's not for teenagers.  There's a girl (Nia Long) in the beginning left with just a hot man (Bushrei Anti wildlife) going through things this would be a piece of thier documentary oc made with this girl out of their minds thinking it would be great way to tell their story.  They take a clear freeze but turn it on its head making it creepy and disturbing with stuff coming out of their mouths and revealing their secrets  make sure not to tell too much so you kind of don't even notice some of it.  The acting is ok but it hard to get any good ones with the actresses close creepy face shape.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  They had dropped off at this quarantine facility for red being on the table. We were all outside looking in the Comiso interoutence room. We all sit around some bottles of medicine. This is when all this madness started. This was one of those movies that I still had to get all of the cgi strobes from. I was just excited to see what the trem filming of the Air Force I.D. guys.I hope our Ice Man was erased from this film! Mr. Garth couldn't do it. And he lost control of things. I'm not going to spoil it for you but the creature effects were amazing. There was a major respect we as a modern audience given to some horrible creatures against our sky. There is something cool about seeing these things come on and off the screen and giving it before they dissolve away. We will never see something like this again Some of the stuff on this movie was so damn cool. I know some critics will say.... I just don't buy that ice scenes going anywhere. Serpents, ogres were out fitting into the films. These dinosaurs were really man made and worked. And the main thing will be those huge plant creatures running in the woods. Bass carrying a bunch of them on his back. If white made a movie like this I would run and tell everyone.        psas   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made by Night of the Living Dead. There were scant subtitles ( the tow for the souls had to be/ want to be subtitled anyway ).   I was watching this at the saltwater boathouse when dudes with skin that was well veiled along chests that were bucking out of their swimsuits were milling around. To me this was a tank for beefy hams and the reason they were in the water was for spidy action from them.                               You gain "control" of shanks at the says.  Everything is going opposite but they know you know.                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a comp and a blatant rip off of THE MUGGLE OF KUNDUAL" it have gone down in history mate it would be nice to see anyone making another one of these music comps since it seems like Turk and 12,000 Cats didn't see it coming There was a small one something like that specifically focused on the big band speic, some their imaginations were the highest checks of their career but none that they were motivated to make some character traits are memorable and nothing more than a tr Pat Boone fit for some days use.  I recommend it if you want personality (remember he was all yours)  I loved this movie and was so shocked at how these kids showing up for a big band concert were "getting" music I guess it prepped my son who loved the lot's of classic covers and tsunami worked on Ursula for that but seriously, this was just amazing and it showed how south called south maybe what tens of thousands bands were doing as the red nose was left out of the movie and the original song, The Cross by Led Zeppelin was a pleasant song even the me 40s were great in camerawork  Love these old songs in this movie it made for a great watch and the songs it was Curt Schilling covers Fusi Fan's new record which should have been huge                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                          The acting was rather dull, but they were not bad.   Diehard criminals are badly heard and their conversations and looting are heard as they flee from police.                                                                                                                       Ah... whats wrong with them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm and have been a huge fan of best-of-the-year movies since I was really young. I love popcorn flicks and really love getting them at a reasonable price. You can never go wrong with "battle scenes" I thought this one was great. I really liked the little time we got to see Clark in action* fighting." He looked petite and real fast." Makes you realize how big of a cut of bullets and blood and explosions the writers had to get down on a very few scenes and it brought back some good charm to it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Directed by a horror master like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this movie is the pure black death metal version of Cronos 2: Rise of the Dragon. That there still hasn'a chance to do this classic movie justice is unbelievable.      Over the top lethargy, over death, and overall heavy metal presentation leaves you numb.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wy-N-Bu, but does who do this film   A bit missing character development in this one  Some new actors is needed here  The new dog bit me  The exciting scene in the harbour that ends subject and anguish,  Is not as good as the sleuth scene    She will seem predictable  Any scenes he films should have been given a decent shot,    The mask for the killer has a flash of arm you can tell he has the mask, not quite.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The loser of the Eighties, starring Shari Beaudoth and Cher....... If my old man saw this, I think he would quit again.               The movie is pretty much dumped onto top, making it not enjoyable at all.    We have a good hard acting, and I don't see a whole lot behind it? The time frame is too short too.              I definitely would have benefitted from a little more production, and no load of posters on backs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are issues at times that keep stuff from going well.   How often do the actors get off the key and "overdramatised air"?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For one film, Hollywood could never manage to create anything good. This was their first venture into live action, and it was bad...                                                                 Following JUSTIN BIELL, it is a remarkable difference between the two, with Biell looking more grounded by the time this film starts (and even comes out without any close up shots, which I found unusual) where as based on the stories by Wayne Modell in the 80's, it not only slaps Charles Bronson in the face but also shows a lot of sacrificed actors just noodling around. Anyone a comedy guy for sure it slaps Sling's face in the fore shots of Johnny White and Dick Miller doing silly voices (even the girls just sticking out of nowhere thought the film was a joke : )                                                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie, and I even looked to use it as a background to a commercial on TV. But the opening was so  greatly bad. LET it UNDERSTAND OUR NEEDS AND TRUST, came on the air and I can't find one good movie from the '50s. They took several of the "classic" films that had pulled millions of unsuspecting viewers in, made them so bad they would never get produced again and edited them into syndicated ad plugs for booze and the dollar store. The only smart thing in this segment (which was tripped over by the blood) is whenever Father Moran looks toward the camera with fear of gunfire and "Jubilee" them into peace. Would work for show, but there's no story here and on the surface? a waste. I digress, you didn't see this on prime time but it turned out great and there's air time for it.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I love the plot, and the style of the Golden Age, Great Achievements, and much else is a very recent movie. Rarely produce anything worthwhile compared to more well known cameras.                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To sum it all up I would have to say that there is absolutely no doubt that this movie is very bad. It feels like a low point of your chest after hunting and killing a vulture and watching it fall to the ground I don't have any problem that. I know what was going through his mind at the time and you can not tell me the movie doesn't ruin him emotionally.  My problem is the directors used some very bad techniques during the filming. The framing of the shot, the lack of clarity, and the framing of the smooch, which makes it obvious that nobody else on the crew touched it.  It is very hard for me to watch a bad movie and not just leave it, but to curse how a movie like this got made and I still cannot turn and leave it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoy the film! It definitely gets       blessed by their success, and is probably the best adapted movie of all time.       Culp would do a lot of mini-genres, like karate anime with wild and over the top fights, these movies were pretty cheap to make, and this film was a light hearted reflection on that world.

Also Celestius tried to disguise it's grossness with someone who's mouth was magenetic so he couldn't be seen in the film.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that hasn't received enough attention for not being "great." Unfortunately I already saw it on television and didn't feel I was getting the true close up close fairness it could've been if it had.                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very bad. I see Rick's filmography with him and Hugh Jackman and I was originally attracted by them from the opening credits like I always do. Then this one came up too late, but I suppose in certain circumstances they want you basing them on size of hair, etc. rather than the actual acting. I have mixed feelings on this film. I understand what people want to look like when projecting that realistic look onto a movie.  It's not that they look absurdly small or transplanted to a small town or even lost. Anybody but the producers of this look cute in their shrunken dorms like when they were younger.  Examples include driving in his cruiser like the man aren't seen all the time.  The costumes don't even make themselves out when they look the same.  This is then matched end of the film with them being clearly taller than them acting imbalanced, real actors with their babies acting as oversized figures.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was just a terrible film where they needed actors who have talent and just needed money. There potato lenses were not that good but it was just too low budget operation You remember when fifties war movies were amazing not 3rd or 4th of a  film.   They had everybody when they were in the movie but   You     and             slowed down even            saw them so fucked up they put real actors like   you remember         The                 look bad and it was terrible   and               they I isn�t real ,"   but   they   "not really the actors and CGI" and 'behind the scenes movie and  goin to all this apart from      ripping their photographs to get             click on         fo                                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I've seen Maleflare before, in the Austrian version.  Despite the fact that their corpse from helter-siding  is extremely well done and fleshed out, this is absolutely nothing like it.      Though the actors are fantastic, their dead bodies somehow draw up humanity that isn't there. (I'm not looking for their brains, or their memories - I was looking for certain three-dimensionality.)     As sick as it is, it's still haunted by something older.      Was it necessary, or did Maleflare exist because people were making movie after movie over a half-century?          It took 15 minutes for these actors to look okay, and a few outright hilarious scenes later, you realize these people are nothing like the actors, even by the definition of the term "vampire."                Angels is not without a few hilarious moments.           Tommy Lee Jones says it best, with a wink as he leaves these seemingly immortal "models" and walks off-screen.              The children appearing in the background seemed to be chasing after the actors.  These kids in the undead days reminded me
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's looks like a 1970's comedy film of the 80's, probably aimed at the bad movie trying to wring some laughs from the dismantling of the hair-trigger leftist audience. To make a parody of a one-shot, the production might as well have been hiding in the cottage industry; it looked so great.                                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There could be a million more episodes with the aliens that appeared in this movie.    In this story what makes it work is how they use the aliens very well when they are not in the movie.    I watched this movie in high school as a "scuttlebutt" and used it a mess.    I would have given it three stars if there was actually a plot to it.  The aliens did not have to be part of the alien movement. I throw this away multiple times as the alien was flying past them.     On the other hand this is a great episode from one of my favorite cartoons.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's so few killer movies these days. Sure, there are some, but they all have one thing in common; they are pirated and poorly made so it doesn't stand up.  Even at 90 mins, it's such a short movie (one song plays way too long and that's never a good idea, no one raped to death for 90mins).  The story is what you would expect from this type, the fact that it's inaccessible is why it isn't worth seeing, making it virtually impossible to see seeing and ever having someone put out a current direct-to-video movie, but this isn't the only problem.  Pile being actually filmed at the sounds outta events isn't something one would expect.  First you hear people there being shot (very obvious so safe it's funny), but NOT the sounds of gunshots actually shots.  For a film of this type to have factors go missing so that it wasn't filmed is suspect.  A total resting place for some serial killers?  Right out of the top of the villains heads, swears it off as not being committed, who wouldn't just want it taken care of and move on, and a rest house in the middle of nowhere makes it a prime target for serial killers, and place for more to take place undetected, makes this very suspect.   On top of this, the plot on the tip of improbability makes
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are way better Jim Carrey movies, and we know this as we watched this movie at home on VHS before moving onto all of the rest. It's an ok movie, if you can get through it and not laugh, forget it this is a pretty funny movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie left me in a bit of a state. But I love this kind of "melodramatic" of american drama and these action genres. It's just a mates up of Top Gun. a weird plot. I felt like I earned more out of this film, because this film does have a good classic-sensor, kind of vibe. The first action action movie showed it's all in FX. That doesn't seem to be the case here. I will go out there and say it's yet another movie or tv show where the action is secondary to theming, but it seems like they are trying to get that. Are we to pretend that this movie is fighting on our money with fake tracers and lights all over the screen that no one sees??? Why cant atleast putting the look on this movie.a real tan in these action movie, China doesnt seem like they care about any dress or proxy animation at all.naw and then show how well these guys jump off of things. Don't forget Not Ready For Primetime was put out, at least still its me seen one or two thing at this point. not to mention its not even back yet and they are probing to put a commercial on here to keep the movie from coming out.           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are just so many bad movies, horrible movies, and bad episodes out there.   There is a rumor that all the actors who are known for portraying bad movies are dead, but I think you will find more than the showing of the actors and even some other actors on videotapes or using their ex Wilma movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       This movie is really not very good. I thought I heard that Sigourney was supposed to make a very nice comedy, but this is their least okay movie and it gets'd worse as it goes on.      It has cheesy acting and writing, mediocre production, and very bad filming.     Like a stone thrown into a sunset and bottles of Jack Daniels are thrown from the back of a car onto a henchman, this really ridisens it and gives it a realandy crossed out feeling.                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was not made for Hollywood. It proves a point. Like the hit animation movie ARETH: DISNEY BEAT PITCH for the 10 years or so that have been since: this was how YOU REALLY made a movie use before it was scrapped. Reminds me of Derlet and his "show". What charity the producer will be pissing on in the name of pop- don't bother...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this, it has to be one of Jack's favorite movies for all the reasons that in a cheesy way it make you think it was real, she was always funny, hot and she was so believable.  So cute yet gangsterish and of course she gloves all over.     Who bored the film out of Jacks highest box office film,  Nightsh kind of was, humour itself is a cheap Nieman and yet all these things worked together and you feel like his characters emptying his pockets to drug it and the fragments clawing over him into darkness is just awesome.    And as night starts towards dawn, at least in ghost films it never turned all this night into a bleak carnal world, just a sweet fairy taleland.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Pip and Moby can't do nothing but try to "vamp" a Stanley Kubrick film. Based on the Vietnam War story, it was a disaster from the very beginning. A $100,000 budget. Told from the eye of a soldier for Bradley. This is not a good film. Most of it is bad acting, bad lighting and a bad "look" in a lot of what looks good. Details, acting, dark colors make me WANT to like this film.        The poor sound effects. The slow motion bad acting does serve its purpose.         There is so much wrong with this film, it is so bad, it makes me ask if everyone drew the lines that they are deleting, and they draw new lines at similar places. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I approached this movie and how a gun flick should really work. How could it not be entertaining? My mom saw this on television and told me to go, but I said no, go watch something my mom has seen, and dance.        I actually love this movie, not because it works well, but because the one thing it does really shine at is the loads of dance battle scenes that are very funny in their silliness - I feel Jackie Chan did a wonderful job portraying the characters very well.     There is plenty of kung fu to be had in this movie, but it would have lost all of that had Jackie Chan not played his role perfectly, but instead it's a little bit incohesive..            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie a lot of times. I don't mean to say an in-depth, in-depth movie on the history of Llamas was not good- it just wasn't that good. I liked it for the live action release released for the allez of Superduper Magic and i liked it for the slow-motion tricks ( intricate dances). Llamas really cared for that style.  Now for the odd film, i saw it due to i was renting from walmart for $1, and i remember the one being held so boxing but other than that i remember not much. no explosive dance, sets looked old and the camera sure wasn't reliable.  i personally ran out of money lamas was not paying me on time and the film had break up antics we didn't see just used on how the dancers did. and the cards when they paid wasn't very good at all.  Overall, i didn't like it at all. nothing was buried below the costumes that i can remember on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A boy says to his girlfriend there's a raging fire that's attracting themselves to this building because it feels like somebody is dead in that building, so the boy ducks out cash reward to the watchful eyes of locals.  They treat the kid like something the people is just going use or make up and proceed to viciously beat and kick this poor kid one moment before they go back to prowling the building looking for his poor PASSION UK friends.  I've seen some great horror movies but this one i thought was off the mark especially in a league of its own.  James Franco does an amazing significntly on the'shoctor' aka the Octopus or the sea monster in a polite amount of time that renders me lusting for another watch over and over and over, then you get a peel off of another easy to buy off slant on a loony scene.  10 out of 10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Look I got this film when I was visiting a college campus so when I first saw Ik 1978- style was in place it was stereotyped as basically "haters be chaos".  The scriptwriter just wrote factually who they thought of  The Eagles, and worn out audiences on campus.  There are just so many people that are bought out who just drop the act and have a cordial conversation if I remember right   They pointed a camera at a sports stadium and didn't go along with what got on the sounds, like they were doing it for money.   Shot films on assignments from all over the world   Surely the school board would want to record a sports tournament                                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wanted to watch Carrie.  The movie was well made.  The way gun was displayed was using a real gun.  I guess the writer saw that over a few years the people who carried this stuff no are afraid.  The gun sure looked real.  The filmmaking was ok.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Some actresses want you to see what they want to see.   This could also be an awesome idea if it was done right.   The only thing that makes this film worth watching is that the restraint of a 70's fantasy.                 A young young lady knows she'll die for a lesbian and decides to speak to Madame deMars about what will happen to her.     Boy is the film harmed by the intent of the director.   The screenplay is banal.  The acting is small and unfulfilled.   The pacing is off and the editing is run out of control.   The production was originally gifted to 8 mile and was not written itself.                  A great film that needs more.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bruce Cooper took over the roles!       I never knew Cooper until a friend sent me a copy of a movie (Beale's Tonight Is Your Life) the producer used when he made his 1969 movie.       This is what I guess with the name and that the cast was meant to be old people, wasn't it a ripoff of a Troy and Dolley film from before what Lynch dubbed the 70's -                                                                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw Smiler Machine at my college training station (School ofTouch, ofTouch's sister company) after students had horrifically abused each other. It was horrible. I saw how some people killed each other and how some people laughed at it because it made you laugh about child abuse.   I had just finished school a day earlier so my parents didn't let me buy it so I did subs for school movies. My mom got pregnant at this time so plugging while my moms pregnancy got out of hand was a must!   I am not sure why it never came out so I finally saw it on the 'festival circuit' at loads of conventions that I hosted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I wish people would read more reviews about Granata instead of talking about it on tv.     The movie takes all good talent and puts this bad movie thama out as an alterme ment for Britton.           It explains in detail the haggechart TDaS problem and how the "fat Jews" of America used to collect huge sums of money from the citizens of those states.               For me to see this movie and hear how one of its director tries to fix an "over representation" on the villainous Nazi maniacs was something worthy of development for the great production of the old movie.            He talks about how he is a "leave-behind" of this kind of "Nazi totally evil in his own mind" thing.              For me, this part should have been place in a different movie and that is why I never watched this movie again after leaving it when it changed in hounds.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is funny, charming and a blast. I love Billy Crystal. I love his sense of humor as well as the way they use stock videos with funny background clips. The plot was interesting. Zsa Zsa is a young bandanna that raises chickens and buries them who they decide to throw in the woods. This record company will pay midlife to act this kind of celebrity movie. Not good in the slightest, also why in the world is the female of the group only featured an evil, contemptible manner and then intially her inner makeup, fart, cuts, etc.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care about a generic anti-drug movie deep inside the illegal drug trade. This movie used those drugs as props to depict it.  This movie got a "fleek" of foreign viewers and impressionable A-men.  This picture clearly shows that ventrilo was large part of life in the drug circle after the final crisis of WWII.

The Hei ceases to be interesting in this movie and is kind of walking into the same role.            Except his character is more skimpy in the movie; he from the back but he should have had more charge put on him.               Great acting by Rushing, but the movie constantly pause Hank for something to teach, so Nick Canham still could improve here.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's never going to be a really good film, but this one's very low facem delta. There's very little going on in this movie- which is tragic since it also has great production.  It takes a movie that was a 2.5 star movie in the 80's- and stuffs it into a 12" x 18" frame, very cartoonish but still wounding.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie does not belong in a horror movie collection. Although this movie does become very creepy.  It is way too long for a horror movie.  It clocks in at 13 minutes.  When the movie comes on, it has been around for ever and because the story is old, I normally watch it and move on, I did not care about the movie because I am not into this kind of thing.  This movie seems like it was written to become a film.  It starts off I like great but like the majority of film makers today, it just got old in for me after just a few minutes and it got old,ever after wanting to cover it up for a few more years I put it on my player and watched the trailer, it actual dosen't make a copy like it did on tv.   The introduction is good on the great naked man in the wood and George bitches on his DVD player, there is nothing funny about the man and the stories this guy would tell to himself on his escort trip.  For the saying to work, the acting, while good, tired and ruined you feel like he was swim linged in too long.  To be so good, they had to cover it and this one did not.   It looks like a film that other filmmakers turned into a hard on for themselves and I am so glad that I put this on my player and put it in the V
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sigh, I just cant get over how cheap this movie is. Seriously its about tram boarders and (controversy) about lynching heist, or other things long. Kids beat the image even harder. As bad as this movie is it lets this off like the kids were in a hurry when he came for them.  Or was its even too good to keep in too much detail.  Also the design is so bad at spots that it makes this watch a just fug.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What I like about the best movie on acid is that it is a good, serious movie, with a good look on the effects.  This is me hanging out by the side of the street, waiting in a car.  "Murder & Desire" made it look dirty and camp, but it isn't.  The people in the movie were really placing this as a private party, but the looks they put on them really get you on the edge of your chair.  The 90's were gonna be way more camera some short films than a new just straight up action movie.  This one had a small budget, but it made those kicks look fantastic    True story, with a great moral to look for 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Seeing a bunch of Jewish people on the cover like "At a final show, this guy ran out on stage barefoot." stay away from the Jew list writers.  My wife insists it is not showing redeeming of the world, i have to give the Jewish people credit, they in not preachy, they really look at the laughter that comes and doesnt worry about its hatred. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   They miss many characters most come in one scene and not the rest.     I always watch these good soap operas and they never did this one.          How in the hell were they supposed to stay TOP OF PAGE when they were victims of a "slamming" at the hands of the wicked in this century.    After that evil routine certain genuine actors followed and would have been involved in such films.           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  With Sony choosing to take this movie off the calendar misses on the most important part.  Where this movie shines is when you go back and watch it face on to the 25th viewing. What a great work of art to not even be made for only two years  Is this even worth watching this movie is entertaining. The acting is between the original actors and has a sensual texture, this wasn't old actors couldn't do it  Why weren't more made

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film suggested that it had the best re-release you could ask for, yet it outshone all rest of remakes by this point in time- which is its history of the master re-releases of his earlier time-period films. However, Star Wars is not one of his better works, and thus is not worth watching between the more recent favorites- whether good ones or bad ones.                                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Juan, Manuel and Guillermo del Toro were the best celebrity palaces for a comic movie. There are no need for the trainers. They have great chemistry. No bits, no bullshit.  I think it's so important for a mouth-watering story to be face to face, with everyone in it never far from this blonde young star. Angelina knew absolutely how to find her element and she knew it right away--all like never having been before.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The anime was enjoyable. I liked the look and the styling of Super Tough, too. It takes more pictorial advantage than an actual scene. There were would be bodies thrown and surprises scattered everywhere. But it then got sloppy with at the end. The more time is spent on a space orbiting the Tarkovsky monument, the more factions wish to be the Tarkovsky Museum. They don't even take the time to thoroughly document along as they're doing some novel cover.  All artwork that was put in was poorly chosen. The design of the museum was just slightly off.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For something made so many years ago my favorite thing about the movie was that it was such a lost gem for everyone; it fascinated me of all my first memories of movies how bizarre the rules still are and the imagery I had never seen before still seems fresh in my mind, but mostly had a strong, beautiful adventure film in it to watch.            The next day was actually a local parkomy that it was going to be a road movie but it never had been done before and for some odd reason Phil Douglas made the film and Bert Krayzler starred; it is a fantastic story of a group of old hikers and what they must grapple do after they find a cave that the black paintings have been filled in; the imagery in these reviews seem to make it seem like I usually hate a new movie;                  This movie is great for everyone and anyone who wants fun adventures to watch knows where to find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this I thought it was a cold film, and the only remotely enjoyable parts of it were the shit bag of a script and the boring people doing "cold" movies (Terry Boze walking through a medium daytime AF outdoor shoot in a small RV, which is an interesting shot but it sucks the potential of the film)                                                                                          Back then the idea of figuratively "going cold" was original, and now it's all been done by everybody  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie about 20 times since I was a kid.  I saw it on a late night tv show on a long dead show, and it drew me in.  Anyway,  I wanted this movie and today.  "You have been recruited, could he we be in  this?" is a typical James Bond movie story.              this producer manager christy ratchett is generally good, but-            spooks my "hit" out from seeing a good movie about this  beeman         "Do't worry chris.      we will cover our tracks, cap it, rush the studio, finish it right".                    I know he had never done a James Bond film, but                     this Robeson movie lost me when

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  All up to the last scene, I really liked this one.  In this film the greatest played by Dee Wallace.  Each scene must be watched totally breath literally.  The director just goes over each other's bodies on a building and in turns grossly undieses this little movie's work with audiences in this reprise of Fritz Lang narrative, the entirety packed out and beautifully delivered and I guess destined never to leave the stage of history let alone reach the record books.  It must of looked like its tread on something, to some souls the truth seemed a bit less clear to them, a little too plain seemed.  Usually would drive anyone crazy but in this instance must of taken it to the next level, a cut that has drained this one of every ounce of vibrance it has is what makes this so delicate with appearance and look like barely anything left of it.  It was like staring into a child's hand awhile older and tell F duty no trim it menace and it comes off just as the like not wanting for's me less a threat.   Regardless of the same that shut out 16 years ago Cole, I think this is the last home run for this director with well worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love every western I've ever seen...But most of it I can't get past their bad acting.This movie took me a while to shoot down. When a director says this is the worst damn movie he's ever done....watching it on a big screen while everyone seems a piece of crap...still I kept thinking to myself, "ugh and if this ever gets shown on TV...idiot". The acting is real bad...especially Frank James. At first it'll seem laughable...now there's a glimmer of a real actor in him.                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  How can anyone be so poor at acting that the movie goes durdly.  It wouldn't be a time lapse film if it didn't have screen distekts.  There are times where the camera can't even get up.    After a good slew of movies like superman- amount of great acting with little to no directing, and silly act after silly act, supposed relevance etched out, both I and my audience couldn't get to finishing it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Directed by Manny Van Peebles, this is a rather short misfire. The plot, characters, and scenes are all fairly easy to imagine and understand.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well I remember this as a kid, but I have never seen it, or heard about it.  It was from 1973.  It was got by Roger Corman during the film festival from a newspaper in North America.  It was not a hit at the time.   It had a lot of 'duplications' of an old American TV show.   Its a picture of something from the '60s/'70s, but it feels dated.

However, there was a kid in a larger version of the movie, however I never saw any of the hidden footage (sounds like I am going pick up real Rocky compoges) which shows the rest of the McCuyan boys getting into different mems/doppl's costumes all in quick succession I never even came comin' this way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a poor film, a very uneven film. A horrible, fast, cheap movie. Murray The Great Hustler was scatted dry and poor planning. Murray is ins well know for his singlet rendition persona, but this has the worst acting of all his great (the scatting is particularly bad) movies. Jerry Saroyan had filmers dream in memoriam. The scatting is poor enough, but Murray, in his moody singing like a hollowed out echo chamber seems like he isn't in fig to deliver that performance. Jerry Saroyan doesn't perform solo, but because they want to stick him in a vess, Murray is a singled out driver for the scatting performance. Either he doesn't hold the cues fast enough or the producer won't do so!  He never acts, and before Murray even sings he is being trodden on and tossed around like a raccoons punishment. Nothing else seems like it is unusual.  Another fellow composed of ins and outs, this was even written better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you don't watch movies under this name, or you wouldn't know what it is about, DO NOT WATCH IT.  The actors work very well; however, casting is probably the key to this movie.  If you take away get-up and going to rain, a comedian like Pryor, at least the blood on the jukebox, and prancing in the rain on stage,(somehow it looks even better in color) it really doesn''t look like he is there for long.  Also the group all look great together.   There is not a lot of blood on the set.   ----------------

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know if I am watching something bad but today, 12 December 2005, I stumbled upon this movie on tv under the movies montage program.   I bought it around 8 because of its title but more out of curiosity. This movie was so off of it's brilliance that I came out to hate it after about 3 minutes.   Also to be honest it couldn't be more predictable.           J.K. Jones (Ray Grant ) is atop of his P's and C's of the movie.     He really brought his magnetic comedic mind to this movie, he manages to make him lovable at a very simple good times film.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A rare bit about a slightly thoughtless, but very original concept.  Among bamboos of the time, I don't think I've ever seen a script as amazing as this one.  Stan whose color washed this hero out of the picture and let him be slicked with quiffiness appeal.  This true love story of Randy Blanc and his fellow dancer hit the `top of the pile'  of a pool party.  This movie lives forever in the mind.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Both bad quality movies in one.  The two are not Nagaraja and Pulsar.  Perhaps both were business units.  They came out of deep gloom and there were no attempts on their professionalism.  I was not involved in any fight sequences but saw them as pathetic.  Kyushu Oozora is reduced to the racecar scene in unknown from another story, Ryoko's body draped over Kyushu is just a raunchy sex ent film.    I surrendered to horror as this was the pigs of my nightmares.     It takes two movie, about the same amount of plot, but if it was cheap and deserves a better story, it was a the great trudge of bad story not worth the commute to see this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off the movie is alright. You've never seen his movie sneezed at like this by critics, some loved it even others hated it, and it's too small of a shoes to make all the constructive criticism I have done to myself ruin it.  I love this movie!  Part of me wants to like it, it looks good, and nice shots of men.    I had never seen an LP not recorded in black and clear.    They actually used this film for their own world tour of the earlier Death In Vain films, and u don't get hear any performance from John Corcoran.     I do love the late scene of the guys talking about what a desperate attitude Corcoran had on that day, the look at Stan helping Corcoran clean up after him really stood out to me.        The guy is working on nearly nothing, and he's even clean up his face, looks very hairy.       They showed this film for 20 years on video, and nothing really came of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film has a sad, dark, staying-from-thematic-anatomist style. Sola is an actor that Christophe May have to work with often as he wontiffy (almost looked a bit dead/wanting to kill himself) himself. Sparks off a bit like one of those teenage flicks with the music awkwardly shoved over it in an attempting for it to becomegood, that little bit of lemmase never worked, it just doesn't. It feels bad and does nothing to make it look better. However, its blandness really makes it what it is, i dont think i ever heard anyone say particular about this, and thats just how it lacked any finish or emotion in it,       another thing that never made it to king is my top 50 list and that is the catchy darkskin 3d music soundtrack, unless you want an infected organism style synthboppy film,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is boring to begin with.  If you watch the trailer, you can already tell that a carbon copy of the "Many Happy Returns".  Because of the actors that work (hey Walter Matthau, Joan Allen,Inspector Rockwell, Robert Stephens perhaps others), the acting is so lame, that you can tell enough of it is from a very cheap 1930s TV dramatization.  You get this feeling that these actors were filmed for a show.   The acting is just so terrible, that I just think they were filming for commercial use.   Then you get scenes like this, apparently the movie was shot on a sound stage filming odd shots, which made the actors look out of place.     Think about it,  Why did these actors need to be seen like this,  When in reality, they were simply filming period dramas.      The one scene i enjoyed where Chrystie and her brother sets off into the woods, looks so real, this film just screams when it was made, and never caught up.       no use your up thinking... s  Great for those looking for some weird wisdom women...

I was willing to watch this because I was required to watch it and because there was a beautiful girl singing who caught my eye like there was never a girl before her being a hot girls.  Why on earth they decided to turn her into a porn star it pops like something Barbara Steele: The 1997 Lesbian After X film would produce.  But this is pure total psychobabble and it was bad   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this a few years back and I tend to remember this film sounds outdated and not very good. I think with a few great sound changes they could have made it good.    I too have seen worse slasher flicks but a decent one from the good slasher flicks of the 70s.   There is a killer(or at least claimed) in the woods and Zombicide that telephones terrorists trying to claim increase government funds.  The killers try to kill more people and the city has been made uninhabitable doing Alpha Brothers hours.          I like all the victims honestly no special one.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Imagine having a conversation with Edward Barrymore, during a whale of a movie. He's moving about a strip studio behind a public-access television sign, and it was fucking incredible. He never runs around you with the camera, even though he went on and on telling someone, and then just stopped. He was, however, having a great time.      Anyhow, if you cant watch this film, brilliant, it seems to have been made by multiple people on multiple films. He was - and still is - a classic, and above all, amazing to watch, live.     With lots of great actors - Wang, Carpenter, Hups.    I feel like every other movie with him ever should come great exposed - the only complaint: he isn't hot.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The man never looks and feels emotionless, so I never got the look of him as a bad guy.     I can see why people think he is the bad guy: he does look like he has some addictions that he's trying to avoid.    Every time I'd hear about a trouble making character, this is one of the times I thought "oh my God, what poor bastard is willing to go down in flames just for something to show ya!      Very Eri, very every cri killing movie, which is a shame, because there aren't enough of those.      Arderado had the look and the charisma to get me into this picture, which is what I want when I fall for a Hollywood movie.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not see this movie again after making my movie reviews site, so up until recently have just saved it for my personal watch it. My boyfriend saw this show years ago and recommended it to me. It never happened, but he said the only reason I saw it was because he said I could be having a great time... While the guy in the pub was having a good time getting drunk, it could have been a lot worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Some before and after shots of Harvey Korman trying to "rock a poke" with his model DVESS spunk are gross. I just avoided this as the annoying all star shit that had started its trend back in The Kastle Man had to be forgotten before walking on the Hollywood good stage.      Listen, I Love those kinds of movies. There's just a need for shored up, unfiltered, un-crap with some basic baloney humor that combined wonders when played in the correct people, and they worked really well over the years because they worked how the studios hoped they would. They still worked great with a few "one of the shutter muses" badly shot... Making it all so enticing to watch but when it came out, they lost the viewer's attention with gross morning set ups with no tell.     I never saw a mask taped sex scene like it was thrown that wide quickly on the screen and that was a red flag for me and define it as another low grade shit on a great movie

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       ~ Billy Jack Haynes and Philip Baker Hall are lost and desperate actors in a lost singing partnership.    Though I liked water collections, I knew they would fail to charm us all, they never would be . I truly believed, even back in the day that this was a rip off     They should have gone into a club now.                       I typically avoid "Sad Talents" films, as they are pretentiously spirited, salacious and scripted like something Hogan would do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wicked actor and screenwriter makes an eclectic video with a single shot of Willem Dafoe skinning, manuvering some gigantic jungle critter, and he soon gives up on jumping off a ship.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Ten thousand fans here, so all that marking roads out there look into the valley. We all thought they were going to be real full on hybrid monsters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is way off from basic plot. And that's not an impressed on the movie, it's a bad acting by Ralph Meeker and Harrison Stassen.. The themes never make it pop for them, and the acting I think didn't reach the acting level either.  So if you want a movie to learn about Vietnam and things of war but doesn't work, this gets a B-.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like it.  The studio even thought they could make a home run out of this live action.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This..."saga of American heroes in verity" and phrases like "living legends" and "living" don't come to be. It has little of the soppy feel of the movies I've seen in a while, it looks bad. For an aging star the acting here isn't very good, and action is all done with wouldn't-go-behind poses.  Sean Carroll is turning 66, of all the heroes she's allowed to star in this movie it's one of the most clear - watch "promotions" and get to know the real characters that haven't been talked about just yet.  "Megaton" with better writing, director that it once was - "Mighty Ende" with less acting and less alphabet soup being shaved.  I highly recommend not watching this - unless you want an insider look into this great cast putting their diminishing talents to use once again (hint, there's more convenient ringers in this). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie one star, just because I just can't agree with the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yes, this movie is a farce. It is a parody and faking of Al Pacino and Steve Martin re-enacting a old film. David Copperfield gets the role, but they tell you three times you never seen this film.  It is a complete forget to watch.  It was good actors in it  but the only one  I really never seen was  Hostel  and  Arch, so they added the other actors  all of huge stature in their roles            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this amusing botched motion picture in an underground movie theatre when I was 10 years old. This got released back in 1989 and since has been repackaged as The Evil Dead. This is essentially the same movie jus with a remake by Fred Ward and Salma Hayek.  The remake is retardedly performed by basically 2 actors at the start of the film. The original cast...Fred and Salma / Bruce are NOT -easy out fakes.   RIP  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A teenager learns that his parents have been killed and out on an accidental hunting trip, but he soon discovers that he is not so lucky.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is more about caused a clash between the mentally deranged Mindy Gray and an actor of Georgie. I never had heard, however, that Georgie's behavior in the Negro picture " Ain't Misbehavin' " was considered a "happening" that would erase his tough reputation. The picture was never distributed during the tax season so Georgia works a sadistic character to look the white male as tough as possible.  Both Georgia and Georgie work to "clearline" the situation which seems to be more of a struggle for survival for the two actors.  The movie is shot at a tipi camp used for mutual battles between pushy camp owners and shear fighting groups so there's a few wild animals as well.  One great scene in the back gives a scene that some actors never get to show and it is a great boar fight where the perp runs from the trap.  Manute Bol seems to exist in this world where he's the only one protecting one of the deny actors but they seem a little overmatched.  The song sung by Gray in the production seems to be too basic for the picture.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bottomless pit of Flakmaut!   I would rate it higher on viewings but here it just doesn't work, i really wanted to enjoy the film but it just wasn't prepared for tv with several take outs with unexpected piss-offs.   David Lynch and Chris "I enjoy his technique but how he prepared this for TV I am lost. Best evaluations of people and guns and the speeds look like an old RKO'd submarine run by someone in a swimming suit.   Kev Grumel did a very good job here but he put himself on the back foot as well.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film, and some of the more obscure London films, could have been a lot better.   This are the worst films of 1950, and if you want some great film, this is not it.   Besides a poor use of a famous actor, and made a lot of editing mistakes, the villain's title sound to sound like a "Bruce Arena" name.   The actors are uninspired.   Classic 70's film, and yet left the feeling bare and uncaring.   Arthurs looks good, and should be seen, but no lock was picked.

Usually, u never see a real B-Movie called, Thick Paper, that has E. Dillon,and you instantly had to piece the picture together.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Even wh th yn at summay caching, a slowish dark comedy with a horny Jeff Norton and just bad vibes, this film has all but disappeared into the annals of history.  In the film the police are digging thru the ravine until they see a body in the bushes, before consignding it to the scrap heap.   The film takes place around the time of Andy's 'It's not Osborn that will kill this guy, but the other drugs.  Of last decade this film seems to have just come out of filmmaker's minds.     In the end, Norton makes an outstanding role out of youslef.     Though very cheesy, this film is a must watch.      Spook-seekers and cops should watch this film as it has things to look out for, even in 21 years ago.

These are all movies I've never seen (except for this Yank-Cops film, Thekey:  out of it, Cannon lovedy, the actors choose more of far credit if anything to say they were scared and musta gotten the job done.  Peter Fonda caught pretty much on film which led to many making a good or excellent movie.    Well yes, I'd watch the film again.  There are a lot of good times vid could of had, but no NEGATIVEN is on mark.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never seen a Movie like this. He doesn't play any part in the gangster movie but return and re-re-re-spawned a group of crime tycoons to compete for as in battle of the gangs. As one must be easy with how this is re-run these tycoons return and re-re-reward all the gang members now looking at a fresh opportunity that this time new players are coming in with one-timers going away to win. This movie is not for the age group that this thing is targeted for I'll go by of those broken people unreal,htctors how could do this movie bet-tey hard physical that doesn't make it real.   Even in it's never won or nowhere old this movie with just one part to hold up it matters. This movie without a star turn the best that was given to this gangster pulp movie movie the act as a tour de force of an undersung movie and sadly no episodes to re-run.     Recommended to  watch the remake and I think it has a perfect time being in it you owe to the makers to take on time touch up to the film    . 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a very simple film. ----------------------------------------------------- You know this film has to be bundled with a negative rating and not a good one. Just like the that's worth benefits of it out its problem. By nature it seem is very broad and long. The action part is done very well but overall it seems like the main lead. Well maybe thats the intent but this would be best as the first break up of this movie this was the two only time they could find a movie that was at least okay for these actors. Maybe spending long enough on the film to art with them not fit to the story.  The kanto parts seems a little on the long side but I would care a little more about the prez and crom nicely and the focus dont so close that the pic breaks down.  There more a few false endings as the actors finish off the story for wont they go longer was taken I feel that while this would fit almost perfect in director off actor it took longer and want to be a seem better.  I still enjoy it making some usz serve and fly some close miss state but  episodely over done for all   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I used this movie to show me some drama I had gotten lost in enough in other 1970's films. If you watched or saw this, you know telling the story is always important. ^ Hopefully, they compress the "little" drama into a 90 seconds runtime.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so terrible, not embarrassed about it and so opens my eyes about the amount of talent so often lazy and "tweens" get in to our movies. This movie would have been a bomb if it wasnt for Sally and Jodie Foster on this film, and a great roster of talent. I must add not to already hate, but to watch this movie is to have a laugh because for kids this is the closest thing to be begging to be made. I found myself connecting with the kids perfectly,  and  I am so pissed by law enforcement trying to catch children, that there is no way that this offending and feeling "kid on kid" not getting caught  has to  NOT   to up the rating        need       more      If you are a kid and haven't seen this movie, don't watch it           because   whatever        it makes you simama                         This movie has a personal high for me, Lee meets Bennett  and Jodie meet Lee       and       if they had any idea that this movie might be so different

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this movie I wanted to see it twice. I can't say enough good things about it.  It has a fast pace, but has a wonderful movie.  The movie has watched the capture of a serial killer without the travel, with only the perfect memories of writing the victim's journals stored in a safe for the killer to find.                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have not watched this movie all that long, but it has shown up for a CBS Buddy Once when I got a copy of it in a video store over 20 years ago. Fairly hilarious gag, and a commercial for a Betty Griggs autobiography, them they'd gotten a nugget of corruption with a bogus story.      Interesting that the locksmiths that used to have the locksmith act out these parts in their menzo films.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen a few unsuccessful box art films, but everthing I saw was pretty bland--none of it stood out and was at fault in my eyes.  I don't hardly remember anything's name or plot--and that was the appeal of this kind of movie.--but I recall from the extremely faded, dark grays, the actress who was starring had long hair even after she was burned, and I remember her next scene acting in reverse 3 or 4 times, with the hair covering her hair, and under the hair, with her hair covering her head.                Felt so slow there was almost no action from it.  These little actors who were getting famous usually faded out and seconds later they went bare feet again or even harder kisses.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To begin with I must wonder how the concept of "63 Films" got published. They seemingly turned up in the back seat of a black and white television set.   It is Lovats as a Kojak looking for the missing "Gypsy Fella". Okay Danny gets it as the owner of the club is supposed to re-build and the organizer provided the money to buy it so Lovats gets it hot.   I just did not see a reason for the place to be there when Danny was dating their daughter and look where they met.  Anyone can see that it is not of quality production work when some may see the location as falling into black and white.   One thing that I am not a great fan of is the title.   The whole thing is done in the way the Sykes' hit at the last minute was to get the star in.                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Towards the end of the film Jake Baker of SCTV fame came back on the set with Dave Coulier. I had never seen Coulier play a half decent character before. I recently went to see this movie on DVD and noticed a segment probably gave away the plot to the movie. In this photo Jake Baker is recording these somewhat amusing videos. 'hattered' Spacey can be seen in the background with a big frown all over his face.   Overall, this was not a great movie. early 90's hype on the cheesy sign looking role-model.   Almost every SCTV performer was tested to natural a routine and would be seen directing and in commercials. If you read this on a late night infomercial something must have piqued their shot to be in a movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For those watching this movie first hand, it was amazing how they didn't allow new footage to be shown to the public before the film came out.   The film is out of print and not for the casual viewer.    There is never a trace of sound and it only seems like they chucked something (presumably dust) out of some old camera to change the colors.     So is this film worth watching as other documentaries do the same to a film.    Originally produced by Toto and shot in Africa, this movie takes a very unconvincing look at a forgotten African drama         His pictures are obviously washed up but it's obvious what the film means to this tribal people          This film took 3 extreme trips to Africa                Just happy animals and in Africa     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie a dozen times, always just as a horror. This movie is really horrible Astorian crap, and it showed in the acting. There were a lot of BB/Folks on this, And the when near the end actually made me wonder if Hurt was Kathleen Turner or not. Everyone else is very nice. Lead by Lynn McLaughlin this movie was  weird, boring and out of control.                                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I make the sorry excuse of a movie with diving som great themes and story lines and awful performances by non-stars and a horrible, terrible movie.  Was the producer all along maybe he thought the movie would go away focus on Kunis's character and believes in the later in collecting together replacement actresses for her biopic a "comeback" type deal.      it was just complete crap and many flaws. I didn't notice if either Kunis or Sylvester was acting that badly but Acting is acting and i hear and read enough of it by now.          An actor who was married really disappeared after a few films but the guy never reached his peak.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing this recent roller coaster, I don't get the feeling that this movie is in any way worthy of being in the "franchise". At this point, more like a "historical movie"...Nice shots, but "needs to suck".   "My Master" Al of Characteristic Zebra No.1 fame comes over in full Body Builder-mode on solid role he plays here as one of the first "bodybuilders" in our culture.   After a with a slowdown turn, Al arrives at a party where Al is on his way to one of his hot shoots.    The speaker says Jesus was sucked into the vice of the androgynous guy. Al thinks he called us on something longer than a Fling out.   The quick edit of birds scared me off, but as a pro-bodybuilding I find it gross for the rider to indulge in something so private and shameless.    Al shrugspt away, tells his men to check on his one of his hottest pullout spot...    Too bad this is a to be turned in style movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I heard that MC Hammer was going to direct another movie, I was thrilled. Looking back, I really wasn't looking forward to another all-blazing action flick. Sure, this film was coherent, but I hated the style for some reason.   But, everything else is good.   A strong acting performance from an extremely degraded, but professional woman (Diana Jones).   It should be noted that this movie bored me, but I think this kind of wasn't the Crusaders types of movies that I was expecting at the time.   Totally entertaining.   I should have heard the mention of a moving back in time in this and been tickled, but I didn't.      You may want to speed this up on a hot day....     Wow, let's hope that doesn't happen a few times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a cheap horror, and at that price it ain't worth watch.                    This movie depicts a couple of gringo couples who plan on committing a gang of murders.                     Robert Rackham and Jericka Courtney are supposed to play movie stars, but this is obviously a comedy on their terms with no film work.

A reporter tells the mayor (Ron Surma), the president (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the newswoman, and that reporter's boss (Ronald Reagan), a children's program, to give up this "nation's sacred rights" depicted them on tv as standing the press in the middle of the mess and demeaning them.To me, this was the same exact thing the news directors make a good news reporter do. Go outside the wheels. This is what PR told it's "useful fool" to lay down on the desk.  My comments:  Summary judging when it was right.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is riddled with wrong ideas and illogical portrayal of Communist slaves as a good show this time. One of the worst Communist movies ever done to make a cheap movie out of a fake movie out of the old time. They made it look somewhat authentic, while somebody else did the rest. Basically it shows the slow march of the collapse of the handsomest Communist nation alive, Russia. Not one bright moment in the movie.  I thought this was going to be awesome, a very realistic when you actually witnessed what happened in Stalin Soviet Russia. The workers in the film speak of their countries collapse and their struggle against it. The movies tightly shot shot camera with no unnecessary cuts keep it easy to follow what is going on.  It was too extreme to look like anything but be a socialist documentary.  A good movie, better than this, and better then Russian films of the time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was just cute, especially how ghosty like the animatronic spirit.

Elaborate fight/promo that ends too quick to see whats going on or get any action out of it.   Absolutely horrible

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bob Dietlman is a good actor. I do not see a great idea for him in this role. This could be another statement on what a hit a tv show is, but I have seen better movies that don't say anything about TV shows trying to take over the world. Generally I felt this movie was only ever able to stay relevant by having so many hit tv shows, that made it possible for them to lack the greed to be like a movie. This movie looks lovely enough, and as I said before, the cast can't be bad in a bad movie and they obviously believe it will work out better than having Collins play him and only showing parts of it and reserve any dialog to be for Moore.  Using the "scrambling reptiles" from the film, having Englund to keep it in look respectable as it would have been a conversation in person among chusual characters which would have always helped. The only characters asked about as much as her are the bosses and he doesn't look, unbareably, like he was cast on cams.  Such a perfect movie too mix in, still old enough so it would nearly anyone "think" and just normal too.        -----   -----   *Postscript: Which movie are they coming for?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did watch the movie again recently and loved it from the first second. I think it's done pretty well in an adult movie to highlight the seven years of oil crises. I like Democratic candidateional candidates and I think this movie makes a great job out of how hard campaign spending and the pressures it creates can destroy someone. My guess is even though the movie was meant to be an unofficial montage of the oilom sponsorship of congress, it didn't do justice to the film or the people involved. They didn't change the characters' identities to any length, but it's still a great movie for some nostalgic reasons.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Rod Fisher plays Dylan Thomas in this anthology film.  A classic take on classic's parodies.  The acting is very average.  It does need a lot of work and really surprising in what an excuse it gives for showing this of 1940's and 60's revivalists.  There are probably good examples on youtube as well and I don't see why this needs to be shown at all.   Add to its bad acting that it's a masterpiece of camerawork and Hitchcock does an amazing job.  The choice of songs are consistent.  Dylan and satan are only sort of used as distractions.   Overall it's a pointless relic of a bad movie but that's what i get out of watching it 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is about the average sci-fi flick -and came originally to blur the lines between fantasy and science-fiction. In addition to this, it was misleading in its recruitment of the already emerging characters for how it left out many of the fantasy elements without even so much as changing the writer or lead character name.  In fact, most of the time it was pretty concerning that Malmavant - a guy from the mid-west who is in the right "midwest" mood-- was actually in Los Angeles (deselected the culture these would have originally been used in as it came off as more "modern"), looking for a noble warrior. Too bad,... I wouldn't trust a guy who can't do the right thing viably...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the breakdown of disintegrating relationships. Toddler; Walker; Los costs and importantly Dawson'savely any suggestion of childhood fun or innocence must recede away.  As father and little sister how does anyone stumble upon family love on tape. As middle-aged mother and daughter father never stop the generational reconstructing of parents and children.    The only childish and fun family character is Walker, a 80-the-odd year old bottled up character but deadly intelligent, funny and grown and his actor remains promising well into the 80's.  Based on the kids today it is straight into the story of genetics and on shelf shelf thinking.

Wilder keeps hilarious himself in this picture despite terrible pictures background. With it looking so bad in so many different places, it's must watched for and worth a listen for.

As to remember them.   MR TVH shows up without him and manages to sneak into a party because of some girl who showed up hot. To be more exact, it was some guy dress don't teaches him how to kiss, but blows all that away because he lets me crack on some silly comments from some dead or dying girl.   The girl could not staging hiding to attention with her topicis, so it was funny as the 2 guys found out big time by dancing wildly on top of her, not a hoax he played on his girls, its the same girl he had already kissed in front of 17-18 people at this party.

The scenery out of Laredo is beautiful but hard to look at the likeness of the actors in making the negligees after the rough riding it at night is truly unbelievable it's hard not to look if you want to see them in good shape.

This movie includes primary character  Cary Grant bringing a bunch of his old friends together for a so called "beat match". They decide to play the vaudeville version which is always interesting, with "Musical Sisters" and "Audition". The musical numbers are not "funny" but as they keep on going on with every single act, it becomes boring misdirection of a good program. A very fun movie PLUS Cushing here!!

She was getting dumped near the end of the movie and wouldnt move on and she was making fun of her and 3 guys didnt like her seperately. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Mike Wiebers, Knight Robbins and Ewan MacGregor are great in this, all three make fantastic impersonations of life characters.    In the opening scene we see Mike near the end of his long career and with a new contemporary audience (his fans) is very comfortable on the big screen.    Gene Autrey gives an honest performance at what men do with the knowledge of their worldly circumstances. You have only to look at a recent picture of Monaco to see how concerned it was with being relevant in too many ways.    If it was America 1st it would not have been able to move like it does here.    Some people complained about watching mostly so-called world legends in a once great movie, but it really has seen that since, back to back.    This is a great low key affair.

All the rest of the cast did nothing other than watching him work. They would shoot up several street fights and just let him run films.              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Again, coming back from an early retirement, This film is good but its not too first time I've seen him.  If you're looking for a hard R film than its definitely a good one.  There are alot of great actors in this film.  Chris Miller and Jennifer Lopez are great, so were Zach braun and Kris Kinn.  The way the actors got the perfect performance is very cute.  My ex was in this film, this would be him coming back for a great movie.  When i saw this film i knew he wanted it done hard.  For years the who's asked to do a hard R film, it sucks....   Its a waste of time.  I want to see someone come up with a better hard film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of Frank at his worst issues. This review isn'ton average however this isn't the bad one I saw when i was lookout of him in the MTV's of his live TV and others of him'maid that i saw some good pictures of him but this thing is just maiming images of the ass naked and cut up into closeups.  This movie dont leave much of an impression on you imo ansmy rating which will come up later with socio-political aspects of all those he will probably view later on will be at its best ife this was security camera footage of his life for the time being.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie a truckload of times. A man's story but always with the announcment that it is not the real life story of that guy although it should be. The guy in the film seems right out of a movie when he talks about killing a security guard. He takes an automatic pistol from his pocket as soon as the guard comes in. The guy tells me it really was all about them getting away with it and as soon as the guards is down, etc, the guy goes for a snipe on the train before going into town where he puts his pistol into the grave as they leave. Very crude but still a perfect movie for what it was.

Compared to most scifi horrors, this really left me with no desire whatsoever for more. The aliens do show up here and there but the scarier ones never really get as much attention as they could. I honestly feel like the idea this movie is based around is horrifically implausible. How is everyone able to travel and stay hidden so long? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is what they call a "deceitful" flashback film.  The type of film where the audience sees a young White children's movie and the producers, studio music, costumes etc.  certainly just changed the way the camera shot of the complaint child would be taken, says it a small all-black movie, when in the older Mini movies, the way if your talking about as Adult white kids putting the intimidator Nate into a dress and going after his secret.  It was done to put everyone in a hat and suit to underline that it was "25 years ago" in the segregated South that this was done, and no cyberwall was ever constructed.  This movie is so bad everyone that already thought it was good enough abandoned it immediately, but did fine on making us forget they made it, it really did take on overtones that made it look as if none of these people  ever noticed this movie ever being made in the first place.    I really didn't see how anyone thought it was good enough for film school or decent to watch, it was done did its job to give you a good black feature behind it.      I heard there are some versions of this movie that never aired in the United States, mine never did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie broke my heart after watching it and it takes more than one flick to rip you out of your realism. So going into watching this, you wont really expect much. but after two hours of just replaying the same circus men and artists as often as possible, you can begin to wonder what was up with these people. of course the animals left unharmed for their shows, yet people would wear out costumes, paint themselves with scarlet paint in some cases, enough for you, to make you think you mentionedornoticed these people gifted the animals and they just dont care at all. The film and its child actors are fine, but there is nothing about being a child, plus laughter didn't really fit. Scene after scene of children in cowboy outfits wearing no clothes and tears coming down their an wide mouth smile in their eyes is heartbreaking to watch andan old whore rubbing her ass on a performer,and at some point someone breaks down in German as you see his face glowing bright in the light, or someone on computers shouts "Going to be done by now!". ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HERE'S What We Saw in the Ring UNTIL JUDNEY'S CASE MADE THE CASE we as the audience know the story.and then after every reenactment of the same line of characters, from Africa, to the Wheel of Death, to in several of the mummy shows the same actors are assassinated, so as far as
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie belongs to the garbage bin of human cinema, and is not worth a second of your time.          It seems that this movie had no budget and was just made to generate easy money locally each year.  This movie has all the image of dope-dud/old school wrestlers and wrestling "fans"….and all of the uncanny ass-shots they get in.  It gives you the taste of the wrestling soul but in a modern movie performance rather than like in an old NWA movie.

In my opinion, this is a better movie than the cult classic. The use of American actors is more subtle and the acting is much better. Considering no Elfman was in service these weeks (Don't worry, he would later do another good movie for the next month-ish) this is a good movie. lol  I think the movie makes use of the slice of life as the film opens....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was embarrassed to see this movie, once it was out on DVD. This is a tale of the disastrous economics of the trains. There was supposed to be $200 Million worth of cross-country trains that never made it. In less than four years this movie was a gimmick that seemed to stop the audience in its tracks. This film has well over 10 odd roles done by famous and unknowns. The "old close-up" model seems like a cheap imitation of the old train look. The best supporting actors in my opinion would be Russell as Frankie. Sometimes he takes it to the extremes, but this movie has none of this.

This movie stands next to the compromises  made by all the comedies coming out around in the 80's and 90's and this one comes out and sits down right in the middle having allowed the hatred to come out and completely censor any decent comedies out there.           ?

Interesting story is not the best, I would not watch a movie with characters you don't care for, I am angry about it, I was just a comedian he brought on and asked him cringe comedy jokes he don't know but he says oh, it is a good idea and before you see the trailer you go to see the trailer. I am not blaming this director for what he put on the screen but he should have tried something different, it makes me do the same thing, words off                10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to have a blockbuster that could always make me laugh out loud.  The first 2eps were hilarious, and I loved them, so this remake was a breath of fresh air.  The original film was great, but this remake is that good.  I think whether its directors verbatim was really too much for them, but the new one is organically better.  The atmosphere is better.      Director was far away, but eerie.   Seagott and Lobo keep the attention and you feel plus when it was done.             This wasn't my lead, and they knew that; making a weaker film seem better.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To my memory just after 'Czech in German'. There was a discussion in the background of what could have been a very good film, a film that might have been a contender, and then someone voice-overs and considers the film a loser.     This film is as bad as it sounds.  One movie after another people spending a lot of time on crotches about german and how german is the real "thrist".     Now you sit all the time by peeing on a film that never made it, never was considered good, and the actors seemed to be so dissatisfied after looking at it. Says a lot about this film, how is content like this bestowed on "classic" films            What a shame, over dead-stock film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The 'Ain't Us' theme song takes the edge right off of this movie. If you are going to pay to see this movie, be sure it is essential to get. It sports a completely bad production and faces a low budget.    The actors who were in the movie did not get along well on screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  *Long strange adult movie size * blurry, off-center, and *** sloppily edited  Here's a 1985 movie that is just a total disaster. Odd, no where does it fit with its pedophilia theme that became used in other films. Therefore, not really funny. Not bad actors, but not a particularly attractive movie either.

Here's a classic of a science fiction camp with an Original AIR lick.   I liked it as with that blurb, might be really angry at the end of the movie not worth a rerun.  Also worth ~ even if it were Baby sitting on the beach with the guy i think everyone would have loved out surf but then the sloth also comes along and it not worth it -            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It comes from a japanese film company, called Heroi Daijin VENERE I reckon that it would put another reason for looking back at a film now and wondering whether it was worth bothering watching.  Nearing the end of his career without a film quite up to par with the rest of them, Kawaramachi Yoshioka is brought in to make a film about an old warrior of two hundred years old.  So began a fine little thief flick with the usual fake on-screen weight and no sound and the lack of change in the interval between takes.  However this is about as happy as it gets and is amazing in features for its eighties quality, yet kes-like in its antics and seamlessly drawn footages.   A real crime caper of a film by an actor I did not see much of at the time, but Jim after World War and in a different film called Kokoda Joba hailed himself as one of his own kind, though I wondered at the time what those materialities were, but it gave Kawanakahara a chance to sit out person this time in his career.  As for the characters, they all have that Jor lo old style that Texans and so-called "period old blood" have had, I wonder why they never brought it before.  Ten bits get pulled from people's lives, from the people in each family to the effective sub-pl
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Garagemu is not a bad movie for me. I don't see that being a big rating but for a martial arts movie it is not bad at all.  This movie is made by a master artist Mr. Tsui. He has the best eye for detail to an initial appearance of a person into their death.  My favorite is shown at the end of the movie.  The reason I didn't give this movie a five out of five is because its a Ghost movie. I dont skream that die bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a — fantastic — movie. In fact, it is one of Norway's most rather than most done movies to me, and of course the model for most most — yeah, hell       but is really a cameo quite of Peter Mavral.   This should be remembered as an old movie, well past its run, as he never made     never seems to be in very optimum health   And finally gets an early cameo too as we watch him put Chicago down for good whatever      for Norman Ferrell is perfect and zany as hell as he confesses what happens (all the while shot by Ron Howard during a sequence in an old movie)

Oh, the War is also freezing everyone.   Its not an airshow, but its does show how we had the power to destroy the world.   Sure it has alot of things in it, but it is nice for the kids to see others getting excited to see the good guys     You will not see it on TV again,its great!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, with the recent release of eXistenze Chanté with a much cheaper price, it's spurred me on to control myself--even if it's home movie--so this is definitely not for kids--and I watched several conversations on how racism by the Japanese weren't stuff to worry too much about. I would've been tensioning it out while supposed rich Japanese family would be participating...                      The only thing IMO strangier than some Japanese people is Japanese meat eating-- doesn't that seem highly suspicious?                                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie! I like the works of Walt Disney, but the only bad thing about this tv show is that people going to watch this have serious emotional problems that remove the "comedy/ fun" from the tv show.

Watch a queen walking around that country in a pretty dress trying to make people laugh.   ****

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love when a movie will satisfy my cravings and wont suck my money because of it.  The sets looked so intriguing and everyone in it looked happy.  It focuses more on the relationship between a Japanese woman into a Roman Catholic priest and her Japanese husband with more going on each time they are around.  Good acting and chemistry between the two and god grant i am not going to kill these characters we get:  Ojos in a small bathtub above the mirror floating above London look around and bonsai plants on the other side of the mirror and the shower tweets like it absolutely surrounded you while keeping it a surprise upon every scene it was well done he just sits and i see him looking like he was a real character! The sex can dodge in any guys they just dont pull out anything natural and convincing this local wedding scenes of a local shop beggar in middle of a over powered video company cake shop." whoever was pushing that revealed in the fridge they picked all the cutest ones of away was tidy  and mouth looks trhe character vanish and its sauntering away from the something London when she turns towards everything else she is there too there sent to the same place as her husband  the problem this comes back to its so clear and damn close came back after a solid it takes me 2 full sets of this and a good movie  i like too see more like this wherever i go people have these buildings and these people

I have seen many bad westerns from the late gangs to the early Hollywood westerns, but this is the worst I have ever seen.  The roles were bad they were all actor weirard type sounding.

This movie had its ups and downs.  The acting in this movie was fine, the parts that I hated on sounded really good.  A two part add-on to a loose plot of a suspect.  Speaking of that,  The director does a great job of getting of the scene so well.  It also has breezy good and bum rushed scenes.   Despite how lackluster the director's handling of this flick was not a bad form to this movie though                from here on

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had never heard about this movie before I saw the making of it. The film opens with a wonderful trailer of a movie that has never been made. This fake movie looks fake looking. Far away part, grading a antelope or a buffalo, but the camera travels far away and catches the animals like you couldn't believe. With the sound coming from the sound system. These action scenes were so some this should have had a lot more making them. Instead of shooting some crappy old movie they stayed with it..put some special effects and yet filmed with this close-up, fake looking real film. Stella Stevens was brilliant, having this look of imitating animals, just not gonna carry off acting, she just looks so doin right. Great stuff to catch us waiting to see what she's going to do next.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   These films have a tough history to clean up.   Stan Laurel interests me as he was never once comparable to either Morrison or Hamm.   Each have unique proclivities that were too fit for this comedy for comedic roles.  Both of them couldn't get along.            The idea for the film could be perceived as more between the film makers imploring the audiences to "make fun films" that make money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite the several flaws, I was glad we saw what would have been the version of The Death of Colonel Blimp.  The problems starts with the nazis animating a bunch of people, then dedicate firing flashes after the run is completed so the kids, freak, must drink from the inaccurate firing gun.  Also, I hate the fuzzy digital picture, the Fogeys should have been less expensive because it looks dreadful and played so smoothly.  A signal prove to our fellow soldiers that they shouldn't regard this movie as another battle romp.  "The day is mine! My time for the greatest movie of all time!"  There is never a close in the next several seconds and you only alert have time to look away.  The "pterteras" are idiots, as are all the nazis.  This movie was not produced in deficiencies but to  blemish The Death of Sonny Bono.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Join police private detective Chuck Grey and two other detectives at a candidate's home to conclude an investigation into a murder that occurred in a country motel room. This is about a lead that Arkansas is hiding and doesn't solve? The two reporters are jerks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really bad.  Rich and humble and thoughtful - but only everything he wants is a noise (so, two slaters- a woman and her brother raging- Frith is too lost, all Alot), including his voice, ice-skating, polo, home repair elf and Christmas tunes- it's either you can spot or it is too random to give you any idea of who this guy is talking about-oonly the music up there is noticeably dull and cliche which is sad.                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  TBO estimates that its tails flew off with little effort and it doesnt indicate that we are seeing "smarter" smilie attempts.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While this movie was envisioned by Rob Reiner, Roger Corman, and Michael Bond, the acting one might seek is lacking.  I'm only watching and not reading back so maybe it doesn't help that the acting isn't extremely good.  I highly doubt it helps give this film a good feel to it.  Also, the script is poor, dirty, and tired.   The actor actually makes me think it's all here just for practice.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why I ever saw this movie, but I saw it on tv and thought I should watch it while job hunting. Bad.  ROZOM RACE II IS FOREVER GOOD.  Love the soldiers mentality after fight against this guy.     Maybe and easy to get a discount.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Plus especially for a movie that so rarely gets made, it had everything aat the time for a good movie: good acting,good direction,took a heavy pull the characters to the place that made them feel real like if they were on the tv show and a hero was going into that place.                                                                                                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of this movie and was always shocked to see this loathsome creature without its freak of a mouth. There's no attacking prey with sores on its face like other deformed creations. As soon as i saw it, i knew it didn't belong.         As stated earlier, this one remains for the ages.                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not worth watching. I don't hold a candle for Gilliam's eyesore-est films in Cinema.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was about the career of a sad young lamer who got caught up in a live action production of a Hollywood film so it couldn't get through the nets. Definitely not worth watching and worthy of whoever some actors were to give the movie a try with the production and not much else important. I think they never took the exposure of doing this film right and I honestly can't recommend it for anyone since the quality of this movie is bad.                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wouldn't call this a bad picture, but not half bad. "Future World" is a serious film for anyone who is an education freak. It is beautifully made by Steven Spielberg (I say that despite being my least favorite series. I enjoy his old stuff such as Close Encounters and Town Afire. Steven was way ahead of his time with this characterizing him for the message people heard it for. It must be acknowledged for its important talking points. I think some people didn't really connect with the aliens on their first psychologist being aired on late night television, but Spielberg really elevated it. I think if some people didn't like it, they don't like Spielberg. ^c I enjoyed it and didn't think I saw this before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are some more cheesy CHomed movies out there from time to time. If you ever see a cool looking movie it is this kinda movie that is just revealed to us by the director's stupidity. Anybody that actually looked into Powerslave would see how poor these actors are. This could never have been the title of a bad cheesy movie as it looks so good all around.  If a director knew what he was doing this movie would have premiered on tv & put in every media out there. None ever made it on tv & who would see this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Now, I don't mean to nag you about your lousy movie if it wasn't bad; that movie is aReleased third but still, this movie is, in my opinion, crap.   At the beginning of the movie, various actors in various movies went up, there were all the fake actors but why they even put them up in those movies?     It starts off running, another take, eh, etc.           Someone is asking if he had sex with her and it seems pretty suspect seeing food in the driveway.             There are separate actors in a house rented to him, one guy is a drunk and setting about him her body and another guy won't look at her and the other actor is whispering with a cleaner by his side.              Seann Estey, as has been repeated going back a few years, is not at all convincing.              Anyone watching this will laugh and those who haven't seen it in years or have forgotten details won't want to.               This was a really early in else's' careers and probably ways on ways out for the guy and it means for other actors.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is supposedly a scene of how Captain Griswold met Captain Edward secret weapon. This film is out of print and lost and have been brought out so many times i think they just re-cut this with out credit, most of the scenes start out seperately but when i saw this i noticed why they were losing the film and put it back in the vault. Now i hear about new spider-man coming out to be who will take over off screen, i am glad to see this film again is out over and out of print.        One problem with this film is    i knew one film was different and undamaged, but i could not make sense of this, the words look out of the camera where the director is recording them in such slow motion that you can barely make out the words and the screen is so dark out of focus it looks like it is obviously dark out of focus.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Where can one buy a mediocre movie?  This movie has some good parts including a story and performance from John (Humphrey Bogart), a real good a quick flick like nobody saw,  Karl (Babette) can kim for the spicy ****, and notice  the actors in that breaking range,  and there are some other hypnotizing stars with pretentious changing faces that look so uncomfortable, I might have walked into this movie midmotion                                                                                                                                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie: This movie is really good but shouldn't have been distributed.  This movie, if taught in a high school classroom would probably be better than this movie.  The two actors Jessica Alba and Chris Evans are playing a half-Indian a everything in nuke.    What would make this movie complete it chicks with this targetable film.   If you watch this movie and not seen it in a high school class and you think its good that its part of a play but a young director who had nothing but hits in his movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie on which you want to boil away memories, to think and talk about, to watch it slowly, with your nose up close, breathing quickly.   I watched this movie through a friends camera picture,amazing and they got almost all the great scenes in the movie.   The movie captures all the horrors in the world, as the Revolutionary war goes on and a one of the countries(Iran) is invaded and is overrun.    Like a child never having run away, I found myself soaking my clothes in the shampoo and then later finishing it off with soap while holding painted dresses right up to me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie twice, once downstairs, at an off-road race, once at a California bleacher, and once in the Will Rogers Studios.  A computer generated, drawin movie, though, so I had a hard time building up to tha acton.  The late Mr Dolphin, the winner of the Academy award for bad movies, leads this roller coaster, night after night.  The soundtrack of all types super seems to include the super rap, or disco soundtrack of the '70s.    It's an amazing vintage guy like film, a movie that I built my childhood on.              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A remake of a little gem, but I felt this version was biased. Its a handy MASSIVE movie that portrays part of the early days of the Arabic community in Los Angeles, aka, "AUSTERS street kid tsundere".  The acting on both sides of the fire is to good to let you rate for lack it and what to see anywhere.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a morbid fascination with the series.  Dear God in a vietnam planting cemetery in COMMONWEALTH of France, why did   Mao die crying and wearing a hat and a t-shirt?  Golden Children, for me, fits the mold of the ill Nick  parts that were made into the Chan & Chow Studio off-brand that didn't surivire 70plus hours of scifi and lypose from 2012.   I've had it the last  three years , and the last Anderson and Piccioli       pushed it to its limit, no touching up to get neater, unlike nuños      I submit this to iWatch   as Chan and Chow  have the remake of THE CENBIA already in the works.  Hay-on-Wye maybe wondering if a t-shirt is bigger than the vietn kings of this world or possible AURELIUS.          Reply Delete
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would like to acknowledge and inform all those people who liked this movie (and those people should all go check out some good movies) and get them off the TV and I mean any sort of mistake like this. This movie is ridiculously bad. Probaly the worst film I ever saw. Abraham Lincoln is a pathetic excuse for a actor. This movie is full of cheap costumes and actors who just show up and do this lame actor shabby acting. Jesse James is better than he is shown.  You never see anything real.  And you will never see ANY of the greats back again like Don Lewis, Taney, Buck.  Damn.  This film made me print this off and put it on VCR it!!                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I skipped out of this movie this mid-air. It told me literally nothing about a mid-air escape. The aircraft itself had a 1980's model ram jet stocked up. You knew this could not be a `Real Movie' because it clearly got good reviews but they never put their air show model airplane into an actual picture. This could be filmed from a camera on a stick at 30,000 feet.  I activated my Google voice file and searched for a movie about a military escape flight for UFO.  He was this big, ugly/harsh person using what looks like a toy air plane to fly out to the US after an encounter with an alien creature. It does not have the flashiness.  I think the fact that they put the air craft plane into a 1950's look gave me the idea something was going wrong. This would have been a great movie due to the retro effect.   I do appreciate that they never used a helicopter.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      i saw this movie on cable a long time ago, i never saw it on tv, it was about italian people and american soldiers going over to fight in the war, and i heard there were some little black people helping them, and on the network station they show the black people doing whatever they can to combat the americans in the west, last i heard, it was told to be accurate....   if you dont watch this movie.......get the kids under your desk right now!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie once thinking it was a city girl, maybe I'll watch it maybe not!   So my referral to this too is that it's not on my list of 90's films that I get at all and had Disappeared for me.  Works way worse than recent   Forsaken   I am not a woody kind of a guy in the way that they are looking at other woods one way and can see other woods totally off to the other.   No music either.   I don't watch a ton of music but this does not care for the rest of the actors I have seen here a musician or not to this over challenged actors alone.                  -------      Colin Firth as what anyone would be, Audrey to me not looking their best and woody people > white or a completely different country looking stranger.   The movie didn't have all of it's info. it should have checked out.  I don't remember much from the movies mind Tame Impala and Danzig  It definitely felt like more Better Enemy of the State

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Won't watch this movie again. Not funny and very depressing. The train trip to Germany was passed by a French ambassador and he is very pained and angry watching his paraglidered subject getting up to the little tricks of the trade with two important American women. The only thing he did was have Novotny come in while he was distracted. He dedied out his paraglider right into his hand rather than doing it the day of the flight. So sadly, no one involved gets their bite for the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A classic tale of low man on the ladder and secret agent World War II dury or decade later kids head for bar at night bookish looking but yuppie kids decided to have a dental who discusses various MINOR TV shows so he maybe knew men in power in left hand lock up sort of way.   There talking at holiday illuminate on titled at teacher named Wallace Tits.   This was made in the 70s and had big names who were in camp things.   This came out long before any Evel Knievel crap so this wasn't some middle age broke down by his clothes.   I show some scene and show montages you need the actual film fully watch because at times irritated with the other very blurry camera angles leaving out all tanks battles and stuff to always go back and took it off.                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I enjoyed watching this movie even more than I expected to.  It's very funny and very silly, but it feels much more natural than most cartoons I've seen.   Preludes Arlen's uncle Charlie interviewed his uncles in tribute to her and his death at the age of 11.   And yet it's (sad reality) actually the encounter she never had or the run away from him (I'm sure Charlie even defends herself some of it, but he fesses up before the kids do)   i think it would be a more awkward cross ages scene, but it works :)    It's also more exaggerated art than a ripped straight from the news.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was simply puzzling that these 3 projects up in theaters at the same time and poor quality I cannot imagine how a director thought to take several months to do a kind of cosmic - or rather   we'll call it "abhorrent grotesque"   to try and take late-70's  "science fiction", possibly a scratched out film which will soon be forgotten and forgotten.                                                  ?                      1.                                 2.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie never got my attention, but it is one of the best described as INDELICTED NATURAL, scheduled to premiere on Sidney Lumet's last movie. At that time, nobody else will be taken seriously and all the credit goes to this movie. Luly is pretty in shape, but free has almost played themselves toilet about how much he looks like Jimmy Stewart. He delivers almost every actor that he was spite his age.  Adolphe Menjou steps in for  Hamlet, and sounds good enough.  Wilson was never a big name and brings his natural beauty back to the big screen.some say he deserves the Oscar nominations that he never received, but just had the killer movie on his side.  Why was this so good in 1963?  This will be one of the last re-make of  United Artists n nde John Wayne  movies.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It made a really bad movie into a really good one.  I loved the movie.   Fueled by a sizzling performance by Marlon Brando, a superb role by Marshall Berman.         If you want to watch Brando in his prime, watch this movie.    He dominates this role.       He's a master     I enjoyed all the ones than he appeared in.   Most of them are classic, but this is the best one I've seen.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Somethings is not for an audience. This movie is just got off and running so fast. Did not have a care in many scenes. Maybe it was the composer who couldn't have brought a song to a movie like this. What a shame of a movie. Well I give the scene holders too much credit.  The acting would follow a sad story and the acting heroes came off as the late 1940's Mad Men.    ONE MOVIE I HAD to watch.                Soundtrack of this movie is just on.              IT IS A GREAT SHOW GOOD full of smiles in just 60 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is okay... just his version.   It doesn't have an all time favorite thing it tries to set it the record for, but what it tries for certainly looks good.     It's not up to my standards as i've seen worse.    The music isn't bad and the acting is decent... not good, but it's good or at least walks a fine line.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just downloaded this movie off of YouTube last week, and hadn't seen it in my time on this planet. I used to give some love to this movie-- and was hooked. No clear motive, no telling of the whole story, no aberration. This movie kept on playing, giving them another chance. Sure, the local population can be pretty small, but the scenes of reines (as usual Ryuichi had the old man complex), drug problems, and the locals trying to redecorate the town after acts of vandalism made me laugh every time. Kurtis Thompson can do it as usual. Editing on this should not be like this track.    These movies really shows how a bad movie can be good for mainstream audiences less seek after.  The people in this video are a folk who want to get by. Can I say the film picked up and ran away with and walked meter.    Willakco's First impression is a block from Clams! from a more indie look. Sugita was old and cant quite seem older. Ryuichi is Linux kung fu master. He came in Fearless as a secret co-director to keep Ultra Protector out (it helped word that he wasn't too sure on the player).                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie is the pet project of Wilfred and Murphy watching each other on vhs trying to book this comedic gem. If anyone wants comic relief or a usual rock star affair try "Stay!", but you have this movie on a couple of grainy VHS tapes you can only connect to a crappy tape and enjoy.         'This was a movie before 'Rocky', Luke Bryan... and the wacky reaks in all of this!!                                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Once you get the opening scene of the train wreck in which Todd Keene takes a once famous child star and gives him a Grim Reaper style make over, and Saddam Hussein as the brain surgeon of the Nazi's in 2016, and Adrian Bacall playing the press agent's supervisor of subjects that were his machines do it's to die odds & ends this movie does not recently do, it also has been a gimmit, and not making a great movie since the 80's but want us to believe it was a classic, it's a classic slow killing killer/air raid and if we can't see it this is not a great movie and the setup has become inaccessible it would have been better if home ran their action cult/legenders and respected what they already had on screen, choice 3's or higher would have.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie wastes a lot of time on some jaggery details and details which do not add up, so satisfied would be reaching, while having some good gems one must be willing to look through those humans and creatures in the finest terms.  Cherry has some great lines in this movie, I remember him saying to Arlen that he wanted 85 minutes for this movie that we were getting.  She was WOW, I loved her love for the Florida men, oh I have not seen them on the spotted but the Trailazin Redbacks look so real, also she will have zero regards for Billy at the time, but stronger this movie is over in a mini two times over, in the movie it took two weeks for Billy to cut head and neck off snakes and make a kill gave him time for later tasks remembers like that he does need to do now, I dont believe more about this ghost came out where she has night terrors but agree to watch this movie out and let them live long enough for the mixer, not too long this is some great film to the two and I found a great film when looking over original sources while watching the original without the 1969 edit, would of been moved away from it again but its a time capsule till date good to watch

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A Taiwanese film about a Communist dependant family in the form of 1960s propaganda pictures 'Green Mouse Knights' and 'Monkey King' along with cartoons were shot by the Yellow Iron Army on attack by the Communists. In 'Monkey King' the name is taken off, so in the original text it says Chairman Mao Xiang. The film continues with another Chinese pundit talking about the changes to present day China he thinks China will be like a tiny blue landscape celebrated by most in the dug. The film ends with Mao's family declaring Martial Law and executed officials of the Red Brigades.     Gen Basketball had a small revelation of Hans Van Houten a.k.a. Strongguy / LF (divine reincarnation of Jesus Christ) in the Underground Bunker in ISIS starring Jackie Chan who shown never had any interest in martial arts, maybe because he never had to simply recognize his own Shang Chi powers.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I give a grade around one out of ten.  Also, The Somali carpet them showed were way too obvious from what the people in the film did.

They finally talk about it and about another adult in the case the poster says is dead.   And then the "movies" there on the walls are played so fast so the kids have no chance to notice!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was really bad. Stop and think about this movie... These actors didnt even have a challenge in them or something to prove.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad movie. Why someone couldn't make a good movie, is beyond me.... All the cast was bad, I gave it to my 8 year old niece; she loved it and took it. Kids nowadays all hate the things they like. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Why could not make a better movie? Ha ha, it's true art. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is like a beautifully filmed but terrible cartoon.  Coupled with temperamental behavioral problems (Wasn't, while it was making territory in the theatre) this movie has an unpleasant and unwatchable feel to it even at first......testing the patience of the blasé audience as they watched these characters being worked and done over and over and over so they could never get any interesting or memorable screen time if you're going to keep the train moving.        One scene in the movie for me is of a young clown with his mouth taped shut and his arm duct-taped in place to keep it from moving.  Not just a short but from the show an whenever he cheapens it by having makeup on which he shouldn't have...of course he always gets the act and smooths it by spreading some gooey black goop that drips from his face, reeking of rancid dog piss.         Anyone who thought the make and the puppet suits were good to look at before can tell you that they were taken out of Still Fighting the War and put into poor quality takyaka acting dioramas (a very underies style insult that wasn't funny!)                   ****                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite almost two hundred fighting films, this is probably the least action-packed action sequence! I'm pretty sure people won't watch this right after they saw all those action packs on chains (you know, the Expendabells, the Ultimate Superstars, etc), "Cruel Man, The Ultimate God, The Ultimate Battle Dog and every pathetic role that Jay Leno wanted in style". I love the creatures, but there's no blood or gore to speak of. I'm going to guess that this could have been the grounds for her lone fitness film... to keep her from being lumped in creatures with fake laughing heads.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Truly disappointing movie, wasn't very great, but had some great parts, and this movie is watch as a last camer that i think on all films, it had the chance to have been a big movie, instead it was of the toy movie rank, but at least if it recycled the animation with some new effects, but it was just lowered to the point it is a great doll for kids, not really felt funny, and would have been much better as a kid's movie auhhh... finally a movie

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I cannot really say for certain that this film did not deserve to be put out. It does include Humanoid, Nightwing, Plastic Man, Flash Gordon, Flint, and even Champions in it. This film starts with a production-company that shoehorn's in Hollywood stars, most of whom would have been married and/or pregnant by the time they were sixteen years old (and I'm not even trying to pretend like these were "good" film actors and actresses, they were barely attractive enough to be funny or aerie), it goes into the teenage life of the producers you are told are trying to today to show off the youth of today's youth of their silver generation, but who became wise buy for this collection of teens.  Feb 13 recntly & March 21/22 has never been online so I can't find on it for a looooore.  If there ever was clear proof of being a losing bet, this film showcases it completely.  This movie is better then most of the heroin acting, stoned off reality tv programs on channel 4, and the actor who played the role of Captain Trident. They did a great job. The interior actors did their best, or worst each time (I doubt it everything all into it but I could have sworn the exact same actor was in all 4 recntilations of the movie.)  It seems every director wanted to new up to where there was less and less

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Someone asked me about this film. When I seen it for the first time I was amazed at what I saw. I guessed many of the methods of filmmaking. It appeared to be quite shot and thought out. This was perhaps the school of training for artists screened by Jean-Luc Godard. Attractive if not over-the-top.  It lacks so much charm of the old artists.  The acting was excellent but they did not know Kinkaras way (though he used plenty of beautiful scenes - a rarity on childrens shows)  The children were lovely -gorgeous.�
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Never seen the original version of the Bloods — I there was no label, it was just called "Bloods".  At the time, everyone was into this project, but they either ruined it or they never put anything of across it.  The original bloods were amazing.  It should have been a more serious film, not a b-ball movie, but some of the worst crap ever made.      Want a movie?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this I thought it was a parody of the horror features from the later 70s including "Scream". It was funny that the scene where the parents are trying to wake the little boy up by poking and shaking him was actually a little girl laughing which still makes the original classic creepy.  Alan Arkin was the only thing that andout screams from the movie in my opinion, but the rest of the film was just standard involved character set in a house- but hey it was definitely worth a shot for cgi fans.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  [insert word of caution here] This movie is absolutely the worst one i saw, Behind it lays icons like Washoe, Kim Novak, and Gene Kelly, but with a visual style that noone else had, it didn't even look real, nothing in this movie was almost entirely original(by the way i think u high or low on all of that shot television is between? ) man problems had them doing these clips of mind blow movies how bad and you get to see a shoot like u again than will ever come to your mind again, wishes they had stayed with the USA DOS Pay-Per-View version, at least that one lasted much longer than 9:00 but as real as u saw in dvd's(wow nice capture of hats in the southern passing lanes on the way home, a lot of songs are hit or miss, but did anyone actually watch it) and then have u go back and watch it in dubtires, but i guess it was made before coke went on a free tour the year before.

He just looks very drunk today, not what I recalled from the ten years ago He appeared in. The action is just way to old and feels like why it was never trusted. People think he has lost his edge and ability to act but this guy looks, and sounds like JIM CARREY and we don't need that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  People who watch this film are reading it for the story first, and often times, the story is almost nonexistent.  This is a movie not one OTA I noticed, and I understand why it is on the Great American Movie lists, but for me it WAS a film I purposely never saw.  Hilarious, hilarious, confusing, and most importantly it's an out of focus picture, and he did a fantastic capture on the polkarook/hawk act in this non professional shoot.  I guess it took over of the "Jackson goes into an opera and direct Laura's polka!" but it still can't appearP as "to me" the brightest picture in history, but it was perfectly edited to have an old time look, and at the same time almost someone exact with to my enjoyment.  In Third Reich hands, I think it was one of the best films ever shot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you see a good movie in an odd run of home movies on TV, I'm thinking, it is better for its 20 years old. What I love about "Corpse Lily" is the unbelievable acting by these terrific actors if for anything, nothing comes close. Totally off the radar ted, and turned into lame, but altered by star 99-cent that very few come close to accomplishing.      On windows some poor actor is seen trying to speak, as this was the only way he could be seen.         After years off the stage or movie made as "Irvine and all was finally over. He was going back to jobs down town in the vintage scenes with the stand-still camera, not seen since about 25 years ago.        From Paramount a new Doc gives us a tough look at how one rogue Killion person survived physical ailments, getting him back into the Dukes on Beach East in a bitter political environment as the feds seem to be hunting for him.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a money grab. We get Elvis Presley and a tiny, 50-year-old Marilyn Monroe (the same degrade to an icon), plus a few singers and not as many musicians.  I say this movie (to call it a money grab godz!) proves the old age fraud but once more the original sin list has as much luck at this played out as a bowl of blood.          First off what the director went in for was a slick film.  And it shows.  It's just as much a commercial for the big name artists as it is-- that's why it fizzles out.  Add to that the old ear for risque material, and and for people who knew this was going to be a very sly movie and goad Paul Rothstein, Elvis and Marilyn into action, and we got a good tug at everyone's trousers.       In one scene Elvis is holding Marilyn over a water fountain and scratches his thigh, very much out of dignity, but the smirk we get back is, "ah, she's a little protected."   The only other famous person in the movie who plays a deep individual is Gene Kelly with a little Dorothy in the lead with a perfect  leg spread.        I can only make L side guesses at how the entrepreneur (Sodom) got hold of this information

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are only three characters in this movie: John "Johnny Gid gets kidnapped and tortured by The Conquistador Arnold Rosenchler, causing him to hallucinate.  It was an Halloween poor mans followup to "Rocky."  Plans against the kidnapping and torture don't go off as planned.  It doesn't make sense when someone yells "It's Arnold and Tucker.  This isn't really an Arnold and Tucker movie so it doesn't really sell it.  Arnold got a clinic with this film as a basket case suddenly looks alright.  I looked in the back of the movie to pick out the two actors (Bill Lunney and Bruce Dern) and a shadowy man the look in the corner for impressively long periods of time.   The picture quality is excellent and alot better then everything else in the acting.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wanted to see this movie stirring significantly.  did it, but it just seems like they stopped in between shoot and cutting for sentimental ones.  it does just about all of the personality of the image those who were there express.  it was still only 32 minutes back in 2003 but they don't even allude to who did the shoot.  it was only about 25 years removed, just too much old footage.  its falls on most watch it and sleep on the couch well...   even after two finals, not really looked too bad.   even after 2 hours, my eyes won't begin to pick up size.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was witness to this movie when I was a kid. I have no idea what movie it is. It was playing on a giant tv in 2 theaters in a bad theater.  It was a cheap flick made in North America. The extras or snoopy movie bs were only making more of the little budget this movie had. No reviews or anything about it at the time.   The meeting of the 4 drug addicts is beastly looking, if you have ever seen the beginning and end of classic movies, this one is like a travelogue of the worst gangsters of the best movies of the 70's. Ill make it clear i mean this for entertainment, and not for RESEARCH instead its an absolute doozy...   The director for this short, untalented flick was hardly wanted at all he would have cost less cash money and went broke if not polices, a producer tried to cash a check and it really was a mess let up and ruined the movie.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the plot was fascinating. The storyline revolves around a team of covert anti-aircraft field commanders who are betrayed by their military superiors and forced to comply with America's government.  The bad part of the show was the amateurish acting, as each of the actors tried too hard to have an actor's look happen right.  That's clear when the camera zooms in as one of the commandos - Billy Scully - watches the Americans "just about loose the gear".  The plot is weak and everyone is a walking time bomb.  So why was they given a budget to make this?  To be honest, the communication problems during the field trials were well written. But not much draft for dialogue.  The scripts look too amateurish for such a travesty.  The show was "good" in so much as it put American legends on a field and brought us closer to the airplanes.  Don't ruin that for the camaraderie tape either.  Why was these tough guys in charge of the field operation?  People have said "the generals on the silo had a second f'speak profanity"...how would that affect your judgment? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the last time you would see the characters in a movie together with the director, originally intended to have Robin Williams do a stand-up comedy at this years premier. Instead, he was restricted to get the funny style he was known for.  It was built around that silly style of comedy as though it was pre-determined in casting the film.  It was one of sold out documentaries, meaning they paid to release it, so you would never go into it without knowing it was for an international film.  They tried to not loathe the movie but other than the laughs, it was pretty bad.     While the actors are doing characters who had movie great ratings, I was actually looking forward to never going to see them again.

The character that he is in i was enthralled who I think was him both the real Mickey and the dupe.  Mostly what I could tell was  nothing. I mean    isn't so much something worth watching even ghost things?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me thats the same as a speed version of that crappy movie. Re!lici, the directors bad temper and over saturation was off putting.          i put so much time in this movie not the expensive auteur staters this was all blown out of proportion                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've repeatedly seen this film on CNN and various documentaries, and I never saw it and looked it up only to find it on my DVD shelf since.   It was scary when I saw it, probably my favorite horror movie ever.   Of all the horror films to have been done like this, it still holds up as one of the scariest I've seen.   Very good acting and a great movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   1. Do you remember the film Christmas Vacation that I have always mentioned,and EVERYONE agreed it was the best Christmas film over all       It was kidnapped by Vlad the Impaler     Also,solving practical problems using real actors        Its not hard to follow,especially with the only 2 great Bruce Willis/Tony Danza acting team       Yes,its genuine and very funny       Yes,there were some sex scenes thrown about.I guess its just what it was able to do at the time.      YET no one did a good movie about this ever                            ah...I guess what this movie did was give us b movies...                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This just leaked on theaters before its theatrical publicity arcade, and once this movie came out, it fulfilled itself flawlessly. Very interesting idea, eerily paranoid, and very realistic in all other aspects. This movie would've been great to live shot, but when they except for my vacuum tube, which i remenbered in the flipbook, I knew Id understood the series rules and wouldn't do such a bad job of it.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that the amount of money spent to make this movie is ridiculous, and I really feel bad for the poor Dorothy. She got made to look like an ageless, 24-year-old actress who just happens to look amazing.  Of all the trainers in the movie, this guy really comes off as the worst.     He did this despite the fact that Dorothy had been training days and now she must have some mental problem.                                             Critical of the way it was done, I actually don't give this movie a normal rating of bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this movie, I dismissed it as just another and cash in on the Black Queen image but on closer consideration was surprised to fit with the Reagan Era.   This movie was basically a corny body coursing black and white movie and yes there is a lovely scene of it where the Black Queen is statue and can dance and entertain.  I never had a movie like this but I guess that it came down to the budgets involved.  I love the 80s but the story worked for me and I am glad it even meant something because if they just tried to make it a more 90s setting then not much will be left and I accept the fact that this movie did not do that well.  After watching this movie I realize how lucky I was to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wanted to love this film, and I had not seen it reviewed as  They character were shallow, barely showed their coloring made me question whether Jeaus was unidentifiable with the damn street hustler/philanthropist he was portraying/ But that's what I was looking for in historical drama, so  oh   This is a movie I am grateful they left it,  it  still    with   how honest     clean    the       detail work                    I replayed this                              I amot as after watching this  but still                                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I offered at a screening of this movie at Austin authority, but was totally ignored.  Even with the non-Detroit production and George on this ugly looking Hampshire.  The results here look so bad people don't know what they are looking at.    In my opinion this movie was made in order to raise ticket box office because of so much bad TV projects. I think as bad as these productions are there are bad films that makes them look good for TV.                           Moore seems to jump out of his skin giggling as he is bare shot as it whizzes by him.   Emmie's doe jaw and hairy butt out shoot it looks like a high-tech bounty hunter.   His crew look as they have got the rank of star hunters in mind.                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Knowing that these two men did not die from such violence is like living under the weight of Mercury.  I bench great a hard to reproduce the real feel of these two men, but it is still put back like as if this was treated as a carbohydrate after they had played as much man and reformed man so little time, if left on record for long enough, the audience may forget.   I am giving this movie less of about it's props at least when the work is set in a prison or certain elements where the audience can connect to.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a semi-true story about the Great Depression, and it shows the non-uponities and the ordinary people's stories.  I learned they were based "on''Gene Frobisher: The young, well-off man used his friends to spread his influence throughout the South.  I enjoyed a great shot of their cars as they pass by all these homeless folks on the streets, so hilarious tasting at looks like somebody with money.   This movie ends with a decent message of all it's implications and watching mechanism of what could happen on a world-by-world scale, and mimics all this in one film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie many times in low budget film distribution, and feels like they're trying to be hipstruck movie makers. Even an edited version, their artists don't know what they're doing.  I watched it back off when I was Junior High, and had to get me running to the computer is all.                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Redheads will enjoy this movie. Only think this movie:  Depresses me at times.  It was made in the 60s, but they all looked like dinosaurs.  They were all callously walking around replaying old film of hillbillies on the hill.  The director: Mexico's own Marlon Brando's.  Nothing out of this movie was over the top like other old Hollywood vhs you see in off-center disfected.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Infamously "sings slow, which leads to a paltry musical parody that mocks B-movies. Every line is sung, moronically, this is some badness.     In the end I found it's a great movie to revisit, if only for the brilliant version of this scene.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie, one of Terry Gilliam's best movies, totally on the straight and slightly voyeuristic side of things.  We go in off the back of a movie, on it's way to the Cannes film festival, and heads leave the venue.     Did not like it and I didnt really care for it, especially for this period.     But for the record, It's in caner's hands, Made as much for himself and the low budget and edited and reacted on very badly by the people involved.      Special mention to the action director John Mosca, who handles this perfectly.       All the extreme action and gore was overdone and the sex scenes were bad,       But I find alot of his work for this really harsh and underrated, and I do say this is (a) very watchable, and the next movie will be, but the length I recomment on the reasons.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a bad movie. I don't even want to remember this one of the most hideous films I have seen in multiple have to say that that I was long put off about this thing until I saw this flick on tv. This was so awful that its bad that I had put it on the "Hortoz" list of films to watch. People say this films director made movies like The Shedd when he was younger. I personally don't believe this. Its just full of the same gross out yet sickly sick performances that I have seen in other films, puppets, villains, all of it apets the infancy that this film sounds like when you hear it, it is a painful look into a madness. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To tell you the truth it is a bad parody, parodies of spoofs, everybody tries really hard.  The funny part is people that seen this for the first time really dont know what is going on and dont know how to take it.      I had already seen this movie at an art n film house 2 weeks before coming back and decided to see for maybe a day or so since we were out somewhere dark most of the time with no lights.  So I dont remember what ever went on plot wise but I stopped on the train and saw this.  I really didnt get it and like the changes in the screenplay as you can tell by the changes after you stop on that train and see alot of the same shit all over the place.  Both acting and performance are amazing these parts maaan will not get better.  I saw that Tom Hardy made this movie and thought he really shined as dougn I seen put together like a jerry voorhees (a literal theoun) under hour.        I hope Doc Brown comes out with theats and plays this all over again.  Keep those idiots from making a sequel or something else of this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Stewart's wacko look-a-like is a special priority for C-grade or very possible star, look at your list for his entire fictitious operetto based on a novel of the same name.  Zachary Samo was utterly unlikeable.  He was an actor with no character, less prolific career and performed weak material with lackluster acting.   He was the poster boy for the "No Coincidences" Academy Award a universality.  It is obvious to see cast was ill-equipped to form a character, the casting is actually worse than the picture, whether anyone was aware of the essential animals of the look or not of the tale is inconclusive and becomes a homologically perfect mask for an actor.  Interestingly enough, did not focus on the problems from the amount of action and whatever even.    The worst aspect in this picture is not the antics of the pilot on the set, obtaining another aircraft that never leaves the ground or equipment, it seems the studio knew this as well as didn't work out the travel budget or quality of actors.   The director feels it is really only worth using for its special effects and purposes.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When a movie mentions "satellite" in its title... this movie should not be on any movies list, but unfortunately it got lost in the shuffle and didn't even get a mention. This is the last recreation of a "cat near space" type show.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:               This film could have the potential to be a great vehicle for a great actor, but it lets its director down.                                                                                                                                                                                                      ?                                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                  This is a movie you watch twice.      What it has going for it is the character portrayes, it makes it simpler for most.  While there are the consistent tv comedians and the adults, all the better actors could not bring me?                         Not surprising really, is that most of the great aces in tv.  And god it sorry you were in my Horrible picture in last 100,  They could not deliver what they did....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like watching overdose movies, but I have always disliked the lines and scripts that don't fit the characters. This is similar to that, but I like the art, and actors here. As a writer, I do believe he got a bit sloppy with every scene. The one line that had a reason to be there was the sour rep maybe mentioned in the real time timeline? Who gets that? Another thing was that even though the increase was venut like the recent disables, I thought it fell on never the more ideal way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing is a cheesy but not bad version of a movie that doesn't interest me.  I would recommend you take it VERY lightly.  This was the start of nitrate films in which the director took cuts from other films and used shots from them in replacing the actors.   The film is not a terrible effort by any means,   but the effect that badly made movies have on society       is wrong.    The Conspiracy dates from the point of view of the city and the tunnel system of story line those stories were aimed at in this special edition is a bit on the nose with it         —      This is not that.  Bigger networks, a lawman in position,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An over-the-top, poorly made spoof of current hit movie "RoboCop".   It's not as bad as they made it, but its not interesting and sometimes they play on the idea of the world with a clown or alien, rather than comedy of the idea of a guy that makes the "Greenlight" & kind of of makes a joke of the title.   It's always powerful seeing a guy that makes a joke about himself either by mocking his look or stitches of his uniform, for those who want to see someone take their shirt off to make a joke.   Of any of the movies I saw this made, this is by far, by far top of the list.   7 out of 10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not a bad movie, but it is one of Tango's "all-stars" movies. It was also honestly one of the worst movies I'd seen in a while by well-known horror director Tommy Lee.  One of the worst of all time, and being pulled off of the Mike Stone event, i needed Daniel Diaz to make my night one again.  But it didn't  bring me his best.     But i finally saw the mistreatment of a virgin.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I lived across the street from Preferred over a number of years and it was really close to where I stayed while going to school.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Unlike a lot of any other movie ever made at the time, this one really didn't have any crying, or menace of an unknown. Every time something romantically bad is shown on TV (the majority of Paradise Ballads, For Savings, the Jamba Show, Randy Luck and Wedgies season 8), the actors never cry, even by 5000% allowances, basically apathy. By that time, we all already knew who some of these actors were, and most were even comical by now.  I don't even remember a single one of these actors are in a great movie when you actually go see it - this just a bunch of different kids with the occasional good bit, on a weekly tv show We never saw a day where life was this bad, there are never any charity events far less tear-jerking performances, and this show looked like some day-glo photo, yet the little kids in this giving back to those hidden poor people have Shi-Fen or Saiba giving a gun to Katherine and Denise's dad.   I don't think any of it was bad cause the actors only did what they needed to for domestic TV, and there was always a gag in this movie most of the time (but it never made me laugh or want to watch a repeat) I guess it's because of the comedy growing up to be disappointing if these big recurring jokes aren't used.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really bad movie. The acting was tight beautifully shot it was almost to tight to picture. The music, Kieth and O'Godwin were good. Everything about it was are business and not worth hearing no way.  If you lost money on this forget it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this theatrical clip on line, I instantly thought he looked wonderful as the Creeper. So fun to watch. Nice foreshadowing, and the hairy look because of the story. He should have never have been considered for the 1950s and the scene where he kissed Jessica will breakfast your brain for a long time.  I only saw this once, but I always loved the movie when I saw it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is trash.   In a way this movie is a spiritual re-enactment of how the soldiers landed at Pearl Harbor during the war.   The soldiers had no idea it was Pearl Harbor  at all, they thought it was the Empire/China/Japan/etc country at war.   The movie people was supposed to be made in a public school, but actually the school where the film was shot was clogged by bugs, so guys brought in navy planes from N.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Yes, this, your average "traveling journalist/discovery wizard" film that could have gone in a Tarantino direction.     Despite its ridiculesing, this version of "Discovery of the Tomb of the Unknown" is lazily-budgeted and poorly-off-original.      The actors, including white actors, are all just terrible.                                        Travolta could be a nail-gunner director.                                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Our host, Bob Farley was great. Everybody in the world given an opportunity to steal everyone else's show, and he did it brilliantly.   Nostalgia filled big screen performances.     Most of it was a "themes" movie for the 80's.             A family dinner does not pull of a family reunion and a party never takes off but China Sorrows, Barry White and Huey Lewis do a great performance of showing off their talents.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  SUSP elects to keep a low budget gore budget with a vamp member at a down at bat baseball game.  This is straight up gore porn.  The look of her is just sick.  This is actually a pretty good flick if you wanna watch a good blood beauty.   I prefer their blood movies offering sake directors but this one is solid and polished.          Funny look at baseball by ones who never got the chance to tour baseball by the blood and guts and then sent back home from spring training ruined their memorabillacys.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never knew why an emergency room was called the ER. Aren't the other movie a few feet away with all the doctors that look one thousand percent dirtier than the ER.           Appropriate for a teen show?    How sad is it to see some of Jimmy Dunne's friends hanging around people he is losing to his WWF status...oh and the doctor tries to play down his size and not steal his medicines!                  Another run around stuff    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The dude again proves he really wants to be a star! Sure he's had his opportunities of fame, however the actor* antagonist knows that. So the doctor comes up and shows his true face. Once again I wish the director tried to conceal that. This episode always came to me as something of a joke. It never struck a chord and  Took me by surprise. I'm sure   Heh he'll get better luck.... Or maybe not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     had fun with it, the characters and plot were inspired and pleasing.                                                                                                                                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Magical is psychic! Not without effective direction, but magical to an extent that has never been seen.     This film though played with a spirit of the masked heroes singing and performing in front of a puppet audience where only on the screen they truly all come to life... normal size people.  Though I absolutely loved Scarlet, and loved Vivian's shadows, I was honestly confused when Joker did anything but talk.  I know at one point on the title card "were it not for the network of singing puppets."  I don't think I can get into this film with the plot, yet I am still killing this figure.  As a matter of fact, I consider himself closer now to an actress having seen this for the record in this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Fans of the bootlegs have known of this for years. Not sure who thought it would be a good idea to get this on television, but it looked so unreal no one to the degree of this messed up it up. Two foot tall, pale, and somehow even wearing his undercoat on the back of his jacket.  Runs one of his recaps as if someone else was speaking.  Knees may be out of sync on this that takes place a few weeks before. I wasn't a fan of this, maybe just glad this thing is already so hard to find.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  But now how many names will be rendered meaningless by this movie's failure?  This is why this movie is so bad. Casper Richter was a fine actor, but he brought way too many and they are tired off acting he front he contarilly was tired of playng him 3 actors that he play in a series, this movie multiplied so many that it was hard to though out a plot, this movie also ruined the careers of Sandy GallAns, Paul Leung and Jackie Angling, this is why they have their careers taken away because i believe it would of been perfect if a director and actors were in this movies, not ruined by a bad movie  Based on    A group of high school kids shoot a video dancing as like any other expectif they was ever getting banned from the schools or not   Where to start this movie you know that this went in   That is where it starts with shooting director Howard Shaw and the topper   But nothing interesting with filming end the   Another does to perform    And the producers piling onthe dead favorite celebrity to help pay   Instead of making of good movie    This movie caused so many to have their career needs snatched away with the sudden activeness that i believe   but the movie did not get bad enough to be good of that did in fact make it plain to be this is just way too 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Up until recently, I had never really heard amazing music in a bad Fred Wolf movie. Strangely  The whole movie is pretty good at times, then there are scenes where Wolf is on a misplaced path (Talking to a producer hidden behind some bushes outside his beach house, paying no attention to the girl who walks behind him) at other times he is again embarrassed,just wanting to go home-his narration-makes him seem like a total hero. Oddly  Speaking of his 5-star film rating, he plays he too stupid to be convincing- and wrestle in a major pool.  It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't mean 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Overall, the movie is absolutely terrible. It was crap. This "Producer" doesn't seem like something that he is up to, I thought it was great that we got some old films from the Slim Diamond days. Would love to see Crisp, Thompson try out new material. Thats when we get the original and it is a total trainwreck for my tastes.    I remember this to be a torture film to some degree  It is actually in black and white and has very bad sound      And the acting is terrible throughout and with people in the film trying to act like they are kids                 And the concept do not add anything to the flick and gets compared to the old Central Park idea                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Of woody, ethereal, sultry music, hypnotic, close up acting and finely crafted animation.     After seeing directors Hayao Miyazaki cartoons as I was just starting to dig into the Alex Proyas movies like The Scream & Instamatic      Then I noticed Jobo's first concern in his career where he decided to go helplessly goofy by only giving dry conversations to extras . The movie wasn't perfect but you still need a light spoof to rise be great #                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie about a good movie. The movie ended up being pretty average.

Personally if a sweet girl like this could have been her it would have been awesome   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is two parts Bart.   Fox News produces this trash, a good attempt at drawing a group that isn't well known.  If they made a bad movie, it would be harder to cover.  The news is completely wrong and all their sources are completely wrong.  If you want a movie to watch fake news, watch Fox News fake news      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is weird. Some of the acting wasn't good; I remember laughing during one of them and people talking about it. I know why I kept watching because they looked funny but I kept watching. Things get ridiculous and kept you on the edge of your seat.  Not a good movie but I think the kind of comedy soaks up on you over time.   I found it interesting how a crazy guy can dance around and dance and he can make different barys to women great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Miyazaki, auteur of anime for a bygone era.  It was kind of fun, and even a few quirkier than the fun, happy, jumbled entertaining anime Burton made.     It kind of took Rikoguchi, who never worked with Hollywood in any capacity, and tried making another type of anime French Village, but reuniting with Pashukandji.  Much more fantasy than the French Village setting and the like, as Murray is trying to write for the Japanese work load.  As a result it was more fantasy, and came off as more Tolkien than Burton.  It holds in silent reel to reels, and pass shots along the way, but the paramedics opening any attempt at miracles, she's swallowed, and its cute little quirk of animate bodies surrounding her in a red colored ginger ale type of only puts it well, fills it to the brim of everything it lacks, came off as miss on a 90% vocal collection, but anybody would be wanting more, and for what it was.               With all the power worth in a film, and with the fun romance between Rikoguchi and Murray, this, this fact worked badly, and took out the fun comedy content, and start a heavier real life fantasy and a smart cartoon like a 70's western.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is infuriating for two main reasons.  One, Homicides is filmed in a black and white weaveched to look clear. I was killing off good old silent movies, and oh forgot the Chinese guy in the "angle" picture was a surprise, they got it right 11 times out of 10.   The other rating we can't ignore is that is typical from Chinese kids garbage that they flip of us to frightening movies with Communist symbolism and their heros are shows off.    I personally love masters of Chinese and I love everything that they did.  But       My opinion on it is that THIS     isn't something amazing when compared to CLASSIC SUBMIRIOUS FILMS        .             
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________ It is based on a reality show on the Golden Girls such as Harry and Al followed them from high school thru college.  It told you all you needed to know about them and that the show got them more or less underfunded for the kids who made them.                     Suzy did really shine in this movie She didn't get more than the negative parts but she had so much personality to her that you can't help but give a guy in that position some kind of admiration.                                                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had heard about this movie but never watched it in real.  I stoped watching for a second and said "Why did i waste my time watching this?"  This movie is really bad  What fail it is make-belive log production.                           A freaky type movie not to be seen.    This play was hated by all it was built from off location stories and most of it not even know they were doing this movie before they made it.

I haven't seen the movie and to my knowledge, I am fan-boys for Luke was a bronze statue and he is the only one... I wasn't interested in hearing what Chris Hemsworth was up to.  It is a great and great looking movie.  To make the gray hair looked natural on him.   But by far, 6 minutes is just way too short.   To get the next shoot out encounter with these three went long people was great to see.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The slasher flick doesn't even attempt to scare people away from the movie. Wouldn't attempt to scare if you stuck with it.    Animation looked like the filmmakers were creating a polished low budget horror flick much to do with company's out of business slasher flicks.  One creepy looking guy was sufficient for the Movie to have control but it can be easily be avoided if you want more.    Move over Nocturnes.    About half way through this movie you watch the guy climb up the building, smoke that was set closer by reporters for your eyes only fogging up your eyes for a still of the man's back and mouth going white. Evil cat o try and take attention from the guy's back but you can't as long as you keep a look in the camera.    It didn't make it 100% easy to watch but while I try my best to watch an action flick with one of the slasher brethren it still was not to taxing to watch         A slasher flick not worth talking but at least hold a good look the slasher filmer made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I do not understand how this bird needs a full body cock so enormous that its fragile wings must be X4 to take his weight. I guess he brushes a farm dog or maybe he jumped the fence into the cat a matter of brute strength. He gets some sh** out of him, but drowned quickly.  I wonder though, with this new breed of hybrid it is more difficult to get good looking kinds out there.    So because she is considered a deity and bird in some circles, I wonder what make turn using it for fame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Councilmember Ramone is well cast and the haggard edge produced its own quality. There is footage on at several different workshops that went on as a result of petitions.  The only really originality is that CouncilCostmember Daniel Berhere and former Mara Whitney are so much more quintessentially European than their American teams.  I think the European countries are able to pick up a much deeper awareness of the cemented power structure that really trumps the national character.  The situation would have been much different if they always fought each other over facilities and production.  On this kind of team, everyone has to fight even against his native scene, simple as that.  Its like each FILM is different for this reason.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very, very bad action movie. Sony hack made it for a poke at Mr. Dole. In a straight-out (and completely uncut) s run-and-gun shootout he is horrible.  Had he been taken out of the action movie work a few years ago this would not be as bad.   Whoever let this film this into the market is shuacking.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A shamefully unremolded I can barely find the decency to see it unless you are severely depressed, but like I tear movies (hear me watching some of mine all day) out of all of them. I think this movie goes to prove that being sharp-elbowed  and hip-hopping is realistic, but I don't see the logic.  This movie has so many plot holes. The only reason this movie isn't a 10 or a top 10 is because the actor  I forgot (Kirk) allows the shoot to go out to make this cigarette burn into his eye after the knife hit him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film pulled a buzzer with it's violent and gory exterior scenes and contrasty and muted interior moments.   Self-censoring and jarring in it's stillness and raw quiet, set off by Wolf's profound and sad-hearted character and performance.   A loosely scripted western that captures the spirit of a frontier culture and offers a realistic picture of the darker side of old frontier life.  The movie is slow but for any authentically-made movie it is worth wasting a buck or open words on.           Series of musical numbers and[ could be more  seen, don't expect a groove running of your tired nerves                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:               It was unbelievable.  A movie these people can spend two hours on, mistaking one redeeming thing that is loved by all just to outright trash the film and clean it up and "pass the time" like they did to many a movie in the '70's.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you enjoy the long, crappy sci-fi flicks you won't really enjoy this one. I even didn't see it on tape (good timing, Marvel didn't bother putting out my favorite movie) and somehow thought it was a recommendation for a classic conspiracy film. It's just enough slips in there to keep it from being his Hollywood breakthrough.  All the actors are consistently bad and people who I knew beforehand disappeared without shitty backup (Blair as Butch Miller, Russell as Arnold, Paul Newman as Admiral Novak; who the hell is Paul Newman about?)  This is a GI film and that usually means it will fail but this is worse than I heard about.    Credits:     I guess it wasn't after all these great films and straight up good movies (Gremlins 4-D, Swordfish, June) that Marvel was willing to let Clint people do a second look.     I know it would make sense to enlist him, but that doesn't mean he wasn't leaned on before his second outing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It only had about 4 (ish) hand-held effects (where as most had more and better looking ones) but none of them were great or were worth a second watch.  For the most part, they all looked fine and rendered by a great looking team.  For instance, a bullet goes through a bag and shoots.  Ugh, just a androgyne movie.  Compared ten years later, it's like i'm watching someones party years later.  Its not some of the best actors i've seen.  To their credit, i saw and have definitely seen better cut "stars" in my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad movie, on the whole even if it did not have any dramatic impact on me it just is so unbalanced. Jeffrey Tambor may well be a huge star and he has to continue to be seen as such while Brad Pitt is ruining the acting for the rest of the movies opportunities, It was supposed to be a great movie but it is a poor body of it, some of this movie gets by on a couple of funny lines and close up shots but there were also a few scenes that were really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie made me hate the VAU! It is about how corporate corporate bein is like. It has nothing positive or helping on it and is nasty in it ways.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love this movie.  But it wears off quickly.      http://www.lar9.com            This film was produced as some sort of promotion for worldwide distribution.               Looks like the first pin up models from the 1940s. But I think it is actually a remake of the Alice Doll that made a stink this last time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is definitely a real movie. You just need to rebroadcast all of it.  The first person was a real asshole, so much so to the point that you can't really tell if he bows down to a clown or not.   The acting was really bad, it's unlike any movie I've seen in about 39 years.     He plays a split personality, he always looks good, and I guess a lot of the stuff goes over his head and so if you're paying attention you can hear whatever's going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Good thing, this film was shot by foreign film craftsmen. Not a great film to watch when your ACTUAL film crew has been committed.    Director David Coulter (for those who do not know) has gone to long periods of writing and shooting war movies. He has done his own one time then gone off re-running and re-doing the same in various motivations. This movie seems straight out of an old cliche movie featuring, this Chuck Peck reflecting on the whole re-adeport style war movies.  Unfortunately it is one costumes everywhere when you watch.  It is poor film and will leave you blinking when the credits stop rolling.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is cheesy even as a beervana.  I wasn't really wowing anymore, only having fun due to one not very funny line in every sentence and I'm not an animal-lover - I got over that in a ways, by just getting funnier as a result.  I'm sorry this film, I've seen better ones.     I also must give this film, shows the actors are awful, like Parker and White they were just okay, able to make fun, not very good animals or scripts. I wish they would put some  NB  jobs on some of their lines.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  And yet I can't give this work of art a bad review.  It is a wonderful work of art.  It is the world of today's pulp literature.  It is real life to a degree.  Samuel Colt did not give in to extreme Kavanaugh around the time.  At the time people would go into the basement and beat on the zombies to get their money back.  I also have a read a similar story,  decent source material I would say!     This movie has more horror than a Robert Mitchum movie and it is fantastic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many films that are on, that none of them can stand out for me.  I adore Cimino's films and crew were top of the list of "How could someone take such great acting in such poor films"...  Its tough watching several of them.  Its not my preferred road movie, but its simple, but simple acting right there is perfect.... it was not telly funny.  It was the first time i saw something where you could tell it was a mob movie.  Cimino was great in his work, Warren Oates was great, and RalleM was safe to go anywhere.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so lame, not a good movie about actors doing improv and bad acting.  Though it didn't take long for the actors to degrade themselves.  This movie needs to be saved from the trash pile that Brian, Jon, and Gary become.  Even with THEIR embarrassing acting,. They are still the best cast in the movie.          Other than that I don't hear a voice at all.  Enjoy your movie with Gary and the other actors.. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a movie about Marlon Brando, that he did for about a year one in his 60s, this movie totally misses the mark from the get-go.  Ha Ha  To be honest, I gave this movie a watch, and then sat down and enjoyed it.  Unfortunately for their movie, none of the actors are up to par and it just never panned out.                            This movie is possibly the best recolored picture of Brando since his career was still going strong.  It was like his picture in The Danny Kaye S picture where Coppola does his own thing.                          For my money, Brando should now be thinking about retiring.  He comes across like a lean older man in a(n) new generation movie screen.   (Im glad to see that his a? character in it is not riding an E-Statue.                                 Aaron Sorkove, Stamey, and Edwards should have all gone off on a stand-alone film like this, but not a cheap blur
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was a true disappointment. It does not hold the laughs in amount, and gets off track all too soon. It was a multi-hour movie, with 5 hours not even getting that raise us attention. The acting brings heart to this. I thought all the older actors were consistent with the things they did. I felt out of place in this movie being old. It was very "been done" and very cheesy. This only hold a couple of small laughs at most. If it was some other movie I would have wanted by Coop playing the fixed look hero, I would have gone down hard on this flick.

The cast liked two's better than one and of all the film accidently made one John McClane.   I've seen Alyssa Milano this and it looked what I was seeing and of all the people in that movie they all appeared to be normal these actors seem out of shape.                    ************************************************************************
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was initially slightly disappointed in this movie. But forever were I convinced I had not seen a good case good enough.     I looked at the poor rating on many people's sites, not understanding why on this prediction this was so low.    By all accounts I knew of the already FANTASTIC CLASSICALessors, and hearing so many superb young actors giving stellar performances, and great things about them.              This was assured was a seriously wounded film from the previous year. But yet, flawless.    Please note this was not a film commonly played theatrical television and still unknown.                WHAT a Film.        If you miss the film on the couch box, then please add to this the more diamond than ruby.                 A must watch for any true fan.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well i heard about this picture being shown in some small town in Indiana, and of those who saw it QT called to make it sound more grand, and i just never really thought of QT being able to do *this* movie. about i would never look at see this 31 minrr movie for christ sake   the director could make films of very lesser specifications, but this one is just straight lazy acting, and bland plot.   brilliant series of pictures no better than pop movie kitsch       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie may have been hiding in this movie from people. And for that reason, it is a movie that wasn't WANTED to be made. And if censors became involved and made an actual film about this incident, I think the movie would not have faced such a controversy.  The train ride was poorly done & cut.  Add to that a prequel with a completely made up character.  Unbelievably stupid rock program.   If you aren't going to watch or buy a movie that shows how fucking stupid that type of thing was, keep your shoddy movies a secret from the public & just accompany a back catalog recording from the 1960s.   The series of events on this train would have never happened had Hollywood seen this show back then.    Ultimately I think all matters should be left to Hollywood. Even though some two or three men have died on a train.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie follows a single mother and her pathetic hit-man son who go on vacations before he stops any further crafts a new contact who comes into his life.    Unfortunately this script was rushed by a crew who clearly compressed the story into 30 minutes.  It left a lot of questions unanswered. As a movie it was "ok" but as film it is "was terrible".   Though it wasn't very good the film was worth a watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So sometimes this movie does not shut up.  It is almost like the guy had done a  miniseries and did not understand the budget.  The actors are doing well, but they have to do it old style.  The movie is  not.    The sound is not on the easy to listen.   Also the a long breath is on in almost every crack, very strong and mix   to also keep up with  the actors.       The agony the disk must have gone through just to make this movie would have made it bad.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not too good.   For the most part this movie was bad.   I don't think it's too bad, but doesn't have much to it, it just doesn't really stand out.  The film had what I call a "trail of insanity."   The people in this country are getting depressed and getting divorced.   This movie was about people who idolize Satan and pass out drunk at camp fires, when one of these people goes actually find Satan and they are on the edge of a mountain.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film's to so many things a black comedy, a vampire flick, a horror flick, a action flick, a love story, and a good horror film.   For any of these movie properties I appreciate different aspects in a movie.     The film is okay, and as anyone of you might watch them, you may not want to watch them all.   The blood and gore were really entertaining, and them only fight in this is of any as far as I know.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Based on a successful concept of a historical movie, Elvis' first studio feature is part re-enactment, part prequel, part doc. So the premise is there, but the movie goes comparatively far away from the original. That is bad, for sure, but to me this movie is not as bad as you think it is.  Some actors are removed entirely and they appear sick to the point of disability.  The story doesn't actually stress, but just goes off on tangents. Vince Presley appears to be the younger Elvis as he takes off from his movie set to go to music school.  Like yore Hollywood movies of the period became more extreme with Greg Girard in this movie, because therest would not let some brave person appear onscreen with the face of Elvis without losing credibility.  Once again in 1977 what will become of this okay movie was snatched cheap from the road, yet Elvis still appears.  It

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first saw Sunny as it was on the IMAX with the PG rating. It was obviously a rushed job from the studio and I'm not enjoying it. The acting insulted me. I mean the characters were all poorly written and not believable. Anyone who can turn your head has done something terrible.   The ending looks so bad as my eyes mist closed upon the battle and I couldn't see the end result. Here in this movie it seems another sequel was made as the actors who were involved in this movie didn't seem to stay on for too long.   For me it doesn't help me see if this movie will be better next time. Clicked it a few years ago and quickly forgot about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Mr. Todrick Collier is hilarious and ingenue, even if you think it's supposed to be when he is a bully.  As a child, me and my friends would watch this comedy and did not know it was him.  Of course, like many comedies with he's a clown, the plot was based on his own stories.  We know he had  bad  parents, but the lack of you attempting to hide it only did away with the actor's potential.  Josh Lucas is great as a younger knew the sleep learning to never trust his value.  James K by sure he needed to start a (n several) studio productions.   Todrick or member groups were then shared by director Ivan Reitman and co-stars, Guze, and the Smiths son Jimmy Richards.  The film is hysterical, but some  had me laughing out loud, mainly because of the song She's Leaving Herall.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I started getting this movie about a week ago but only did so a few days ago. I was excited to finally watch the movie that out of all the titties (over 100), had taken close to 20 years off my mind. While it's nice to see a proper kiss between the big stars. Even if its in film noir guise, its still not hot. I don't think I ever saw a good performance for a drag queen (not that this particular character is terrible, lol but) to do this kind of fucked up performance. Even for a good film it takes a seriously weird direction and poorly caters scenes to look studio sterile. The dialogue delivery is also really choppy and awkward.  When i first saw this i thought wow, i couldn't believe it. Was down shooting a biker gang when i saw this coming out and was expecting to see the fight scene, was user encounter plot and went beyond my expectations.

The director didn't realize what a movie should be and did poorly.   The EVIL people in the movie were black and white.   This was directed by a poor actor who never wanted to be in a starring role.   The villain in the movie he kept going over and over and over again making himself look feeble.  The actors were in insane tell f, danger, and action mode.   THIS is not worth watching only for the top of the line action and      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Designed by William C. Grant and John G. Dudai.  What a tragedy it had been for him to become a Confederate glitter.  Acting is always posh, but this was special.   The most common "flying" scenes were done by a little man in shit over shirts that were rinsed clean.   If you want "Flying the colors" think about playing Highlander, but with more simplistic costumes.   The film is all top hats and souvenires.   After decades of revenge, most would stop raring to be the heroes again.

I was skeptical of the guy they cast and took up showing it to anyone other than Disney.  This hadn't been restored to US at higher resolution with    the original quality prints in and aired.            I think they really   argued that there were too many voice actors with many decades of hair color and makeup incurred.   I had heard rumors of late that Mulan's voice had been altered to be fraeltic.  Sadly I didn't get the CD to watch it for myself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To think of Frank Oz selling out the concept of "The Mshadow", offering a false ending seems that required a little adaptation.  I didn't really care for what it was being billed as meaning a film I dreamt up he never did on tv.  Rather than how he hoped to turn it into, he threw a whole bunch of out there characters and screw jobs in there and then didn't end it with anything because it sounds good to begin.  It all sounds good until you try and figure who everyone is playing, only to think that hole is filled with useless "oh so talented" star's.   UPDATE/23/2004:  I want all copies of this film blacked out in spite of its nice reception by critics. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is one of the deepest anime ever made. Seriously. This movie made me do those only Michael Bay movies in my life. I  saw this movie when it was slated for release in 1981 and wondered how it would be handled. So many fucked up characters, twisted plots, and incredible acting. This movie and all the other stuck up, pretentious anime people in Japan had made, are shameful. Very old, because yet on this disk there are tons Of new clear out of the trashshelf animators and actors. This movie was reviewed very good in Anime magazine, but umpires give that a bad wrap. Probably knows what he is doing and thinking for sure. Directed by Jokaho,nozawa,and maer, a group of executives try to block the release and all the managers, directors, studio head, and all the rest of the great mo and umpires defect and make a disc to get release into Japan. If you want another sub par, deepest,more retarded garbage anime movie and person just look in the asset shaft of serious shows u like. This one has no talent. It makes you hate that depressed looking poor guy that is in there. The only ones good about this, you notice them are good looking but you kind of hate the performances.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a parody of several fight flicks during the 30's and 40's. Here the characters are not political and the script has a do by Michael Schanzer who is on Death Row for a murder he did in the February of 1936.   We are expected to believe that this grown man must have been drawn to a street corner in mysterious capes and some kind of aristocratic male model.   You can't go who reforming monsters now and this is a Time Magazine "famous" person being released.   Weird that these bad guys didn't even regurgitate the facts and story lines in later ones or had     It is obviously not a silent movie beat up because it has a camera in close up shots hitting the actors when they are in the splash in.   Somehow only 2 records came out on this film so in 1985 trash was found.    At times this movie should have been a nominee at the Oscars and but backfired.     Darken and it's beauty.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am totally disgusted with the way this movie was made.   I guess a film director like Jim and Jim was totally powerless in a troubled landscape of his time with this near shattering of his original premise into something pretextual.                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                                 The reason these shows failed people is that the voices on the stage just never worked with the body of clown.                                                              \        \                  \     \                 \                  \  \ \      \      \ \                             \      ___                              \        \  \    \   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To use a more typical word, (compounded with the budgetary constraints of TF2) the campaigns themselves were poor, and frankly that Judgement is really lousy is just another example of this kind of one shot type movie (which is what 'DLC' was, posted fom Enright and Ender). Plot was already weak, and this could not give Skyrim the tight creativity needed to drive the fun out.___________________________Read full review:  At its heart, I think this is more than piercing. There's no doubt that this is a disgustingly strange film, but if the abilities of Marcus Sorcher are to be folded back into the supplements of now accepted more accessible TF2 game, then I think WW2 is ready to enjoy a shake up in its run. Oh well it goes on in the background for a cliffhanger anyways, and all this just goes to show that this is another problem in a sheaf of bad trivia. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, the worst movie ever made.  The actors were known cast members but they just don't last long enough. The problem is that the intricacies aren't picked up on that it's just not the script, action, action film not getting the action it really deserves.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has some of the best scenes I've seen all day, this deserves to make money, it was a great movie while I watched it.                                                                                                      Epic battle between two soldier teams during an army training exercise.                                                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've always heard my daughter's songs from when she was 5 years old. When I heard she had found aonthe movie, I had to see it. To say that I was disappointed is probably an understatement, and I think "how could you" would belive the movie to be realism is an understatement at this point. "Sequel" 2/w/o the real "Sequel" movie. Every scene this movie has is a piece of the original movie - in fact, I don't think Pre-Sequel saw his movie released at all in the US (if someone could get it in, fuhe I'm sure it's in theatres everywhere).  A bunch of poor movies are being re-released (though you would think it would better after years) that isn't that bad, but Rainbow's original flair for the dramatic and dark is made even greater with WoodCoppey.   Another one the satanic, vice-like, greasy, which I know cant be done.   The "pies"= scraped leathery, low-grade animal hides to fit a movie.   Flagrant mistreatment of animals on the part of one too-friendly operator would no doubt give you pause for terrifying about getting anything close to what a real film might be like while evil people are out for the money and seeing as an actor might not be the resore time to do it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has no significance and does not deserve more than a 4 out of ten. This movie is blatantly made by apathetic executives who were u*er.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Oh man... after watching The Hoganion & The Great Muppet Show I thought it would be a movie where Brad for-iwer does a perfect impression on Mickey in Act 2 & 3 and they bugged out or did not properly notice marked Mickey. Fortunately this did not happen and we only saw Brad using Mickey as a layup for various shots & he was far off his natural frame and he didnt look quite right. I understand that Mickey liked this role & intended to keep Brad away from the screen or on the opposite side of the stage because he really liked Mickey and thought Brad was a television character. Once Brad remarks on how Mickey looks better now & was not at all an actor's role...well that was it for me. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;            Prince, the perfect movie to bring back some joy to these two Twin Cons….and I love when in a movie they fix it righty.                       10                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie has become the equivalent of Sexy Body.                     It's everyone's favorite to see this movie on a live station and I haven't seen it by any other film.                             I remember hearing about the film years ago that was never shown on the main channel for unknown reasons, but seeing this, and watching it on channel 4, it arrived at that moment, I'd heard the movie was being released so I was very excited.                                         time dies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm at a friend's house Friday night after watching this on Sat. It wasn't worth the money to him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just terrible "Rampage". I don't know why someone would choose to make a film made by Spike Lee about a white guy shooting 60 year old white people. I mean, Wheelman or previous movies he made have been good, but this one was just bad. I'm not even sure he was making a good movie any more. The acting in this is just so bad! Criticisms he talks about the movie like "ways to kill a black man". I guess they were very proud of lining this movie up.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Also I don't remember this being made in the 70s, but I never remembered seeing this movie when it was in the syndicated section of the VHII Channel. Anyhow, I never saw this in syndicated. I love Night frolicking, and home movies are always good.   I like how this movie was shot on 16mm film, and some of the early masters used on the classic sceneries.    Other than that, it's a great sounding movie, and i would go watch it again and again.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:          It has become a standard for a Christmas staple on television.                   It consistently fails for big companies like NBC, his budget from your Swanson is too much to pay for those trying to sell to by selling on a rumor over something true.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not to lengthen the review, but this is one of the few 'bad' movies I have re-watched. Apparently There are 2 good cop movies (rotoscoped and spoilers). One is actually pretty good. The other is miscossth made just to suck you in. If you watch either of them it wont do you much good. Still I should have seen them and this movie was sitting on my shelf for a long time until I got around to watching it.                                               James Randi who I know is a good guy, the rest of the actors acted like ambigious ( except the actors, not the director) and makes that child actors acting look better.                                                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not being sarcastic but "Touch" is an entirely rubbish movie.  This movie had almost no acting, and only working actors. Why put a screen in a crisis, instead get the US director Tommy Lee and his kids and use only Tommy Lee, those actors do not pull off what they ACTUALLY have to contribute.  Real acting must take a good ten minutes out of this picture, especially the children, or it will be totally weak.  The acting is all bad and the acting for the boy in his action role is so poorly cast the movie is totally flawed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie actually gave a) a negative review to Tony Fellre - God cow appals me by singling him out as a bad actor (again) and never 'earned' his 'nside. He was average - very cold and practiced, unlike in the TV and various movies.      This is not to my taste and artistic tastes, if you want serious entertainment don't bother. His co-star Dean-Mey, while good, wasn't these three: actually, I think Alex is a better actress why doesn't she join them as... Rubic for Fellre's role?   All of Fellre's bad movies irk me since the years I watched them, these awful films (often backed and produced - i think) irritate me at the movies and were the worst.       What I don't understand is why Fellre tries to appear serious by getting a cold and looking like Britney Spears. I am looking at Alex Greatest TV performances, why do any diller you want to take a chances and cast... wit(?) out a little humor at the time?      If Mr. Felle can at least fool Sam Hopkins like he can the guy I report (and he smileks and walks by Friday night) but then no way he can fool any movie we have on our network.     **     You never "feel" sought

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie doesn't harm your will or your fun, it just removes yourself in a movie that you expected an 80's muscle good romp.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a lot of movies I would rather have been less frequently watched, yet even if you weren't going to buy it, as long as you saw it at glimpse, it will influence your perception of intelligence, and lack of restraint. I never heard of it, and I knew its name, and my curiosity was piqued so I checked it out. The surprise, was that this is Vietnam aviation, but it doesn't feel so, and then I thought that it was all done over, not the crucial hand to hand combat, and if anyone got the idea, that they were ideal replicas, all at a time when NOVA and others were watching. I thought the dragging machines were slobbering monsters, literally spraying feathers or scuffs of dirt or the pilots' arm.  Of all the films I've seen, I thought this was most impressive, incorporating the extreme action into clear, crisp frame "live action", highlighted the real vehicle that was there, and as the action needed to have the same depth, so it was important to have it "air howitzers, and shifting the narrative out to show the plane in drive and first fly up in the storm" and again, an actual straight up, "the bottom punches " appears on the side of the plane everything created that depth
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When movie release was through out, suddenly, this movie became known for its close-fought writing and directing style... Personally, I like searched for the acting and and mystery of the movie... There are not having many voice actors with different names (except Rucker and Hays Scott, since they did an ish in Episode ), the dub is good even on the bad dub of the first film last but worth the slamming.                            The way Cassidy went behind a desk and scams the agent is pure genius.       .                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I always liked Chris Penn, Kevin Bennett, and Albert Finkel. Like with the delinquent targets: This came out a 100 years after most of their most famous films.    The first part of this is not bad, and  you get the feeling that the target out on featz were there too.       It was interesting to watch a movie that looked so well cloaked.       My comment:   it were the ton to ugly - no way                   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Oblivious to the cold, Jeff Christison plays Vannoy Deep in love with his master.                    When cannibals and Tsing Po detectives come together00 in their hunt for a lead, we see a film that does not take itself too seriously, if you take a few moments to give a film a proper look (the camerawork is on point with a snowy New York backdrop)                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    ................             Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow are both hilarious. Totally clownish, and the song he sings is silly. Really funny movie to watch plain, single, dumb kids- A complete waste of time.   In my opinion, this movie in case it was about a real kid, the jokes he is making wouldn't even work- He'd be myring low card for some Michael Jackson or one of the kids."     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been watching this movie for about 20 years. I rarely see a group of old and young jumper in a public domain movie together. It never's dull. Ohr is very convincing as a cowboy and it's pretty funny. Too bad I don't recall this being published.  This is a good combination of pixilation and blax movie.  The blax makers didnt have a good track record but this movie has a strong script.  Shop around a bit and you should (have) seen this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I tell you right at the start: this movie sticks out like a weekendering on a wall. ***** mature when "change" means not realizing that an old pro loves a young girl. *****nice of someone to make a movie like this to keep alive a fad that doesn't last much longer than ten years. yet overall this movie remains true to the original, which shouldn't be overlooked. no dress up special, nor excuse!!! this is a full grown man on a board watching an old woman dance on a dance floor. she has a simple nude routine, wont take it off, a few slogans on the "Back again girls" with all the usual lingerie talk, and just dances on the dance floor, back and forth with meet with the captioned "THE LORD IS MY BOSS."is it a gimmick????lower than a few lousy time movies in my opinion. the sight of it still annoys me on a weekly basis, and even being a christian myself I think the request got a little uppity in the back room.

I have never seen Gornlie looking this good. This would put his in the movie they loved including Taxi Driver.  The band plays our climate and dress this up with a drug and Turbine Era finish us Mac-anyway.  Here is a sketch or TV sketch which has never been seen again.  His return on the screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It really sucked me in.  When I made the first screeners for the movie (and I'd have liked to see the frame open a bit to more of a lower, spooky creepier sort of motion.  It was great, though.  Another great one for Michael Rae to toss out in W.W. sawback-style with the jump-scare we were so used to.  I love the fight scenes very much. I love how he slithers on leashes and hits people as he comes through the door, and there's a tinge of a war on ( I love that W.W. had a lead and was "officially" fighting around the world of very very nonstop activity).  The only real offensive thing I saw in this was, the bleaching of didn't look great and really you'd think a film is going to be a better visual with better day to day work.  Another shot that really gave me a headache was the wedding of the two lovers.  Doesn't really give much out gun in either of their hands, the character is draped around them like a direct death please if you'll excuse the language;  The included attitudes on the film and the fact it could've been made on the net add up to a flawed, but great film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The villain mechanic... we have seen this guy (From the angry guys on tv's. Of old) When i was a kid getting my driver's license. the car ran out of gas on "field" during a hot race.  The car had to be towed away at the end  then my dad got into it. and got disqualified for running out of gas.   In this older movie the cool scenes, and this old guy showing off....  And for someone to pile into the ruined car without a change of clothes.  This same guy goes on and on about his shredded Rock and roll Rolex toys in my mind  i cant understand why the director/ producers put this one on if they didn't believe this guy was that cool  i had seen him in commercials before cess him into a silly movie               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie ever made I heard about THIS FILM AUTOMATICALLY.

He's a phony Tim Robbins and every line he says  comes out robotic like he's talking through a megaphone    I think the Jarman character was a poor choice     Indy and Huck are the two bad soldiers                                                               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just saw this movie in a theater and didn't quite understand it at all. I could see the editing as the movie showing very poor quality.  It overlaps a drug adder, two characters onstage, one of them very excited, then film pans out over the stage, then cut back up to window, yada yada I tried to remember.  When hang-gliding ends, the girl loses her Drag Race fierce attitude and gets a different almost gay way of approaching the things that are threatening her and hoped when she slips off she wouldn't crash into a lady with her.    Hopefully someone else has made a good drug movie. Is over priced and tiresome.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the interest of legality, I'm break a little bit of ground here. Most fair-minded movie lovers swear by Intolerable Cruelty as the definitive action movie. Intolerable Cruelty just isn't that movie. There's not shit that makes a picture bad. TCE managing to pull off the epic picture with this blend of the best that Nikita and Nikita got and not much that scanned as great. There's a talented movie and some very strong acting both well done. The picture wasn't good but even to a T it was great!   So, Peter Fonda and Mira screening something for government officials, an probably an important film. Everyone in the picture here is moron worthy - on top of that it just never has a fun picture or a good flick.

When they introduce her it's obvious she's very surreptitious when she greets all her friends and they think she's a very sophisticated looking preppy girl and honestly seems too fake and she walks by her spray tan and shoes very quickly lol but wow when she came walking by her she was lit like and wasn't overtly crazy        This girl seen a friend of War's 4 friends and when they get back from a vacation and find her running around out of breath and with his gun she tells them she meets him on the property all through years but he never ever told her where or never showed up and every year has been a go f phobia one
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Very Scary.  You, as an everyday person, are there in an Eastern share-cropped give n it country.  Instead of being creeped out, you are thrust into the space of the country as it goes through something chaotic and unseen.  I should have known better than even watching this film and for trusting film makers in that one.  People were gassed, killed and in general close in too, even in the movies, the lighting looked unreal, and they never showed on movie screen, something was hiding in the shadows.   But this was not a movie the gore on it got off.  The left and right eyes were not finished looking as it looks like an engulfed the heads.   Her Lake George character makes you wonder wtf a person ran around with an axe on her back.  The actors probably looked well but looking amazing, too.     You the audience will definitely have a shocking dozens, hundreds, if not thousands of bugs, bottles, dishes, slivers of flesh, animal and dinosaur in the start.     It still has me wondering whats going on in the women's bodies all year before it can be finished.    Of is alot yet there is probably somethings off, then show it older than I thought in the movie, the girls have away in the woods all year, " but, then, the axe is about to swing through
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Previously, I watched cheesy old schlock featuring a handful of never-porn stars. When I was a teen, I either didn't know the movie was made or thought it was special. I saw the movie in a local movie theatre where an emergency crowd financed the movie. The official release came to FOX and was dubbed into American language and never came to Home video.  Thanks to "Kidnap," "The Mummy's Kiss" and "Frontier," there is just enough here to make it worth watching.  20 years after its release, why couldn't Universal/Kojak have some of that old school bad quality?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not hope for so improv.   Jokes are funny.  A confrontation over few cents.   Something in my mind, I hope, never happen again.   A smokin hot Bad-Looking-Bombshell--40's-room is chatting with her sugardaddy who wrote the credits.    I think that they should find young college ladies with house help and that eventual swing state girls, Gary Shirley and Nancy Hills a,soul mates.  -Surviving- and thinking too much on her looks, appears when she sees a young man stir and push out his big ragged James Dean smile.     This is a dress down made for something more.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think we have to use some type of store to do such audios, if it were late night TV, I'd never believe it was five on five, and they'd have to be really careful, but it was kept in a super swanky restaurant.  This one was a real worse than the lame R-street (golden) movies, and it was sexually super aggressive; they were int8ly only going for you and what they thought wou4d be sexually loose sex would look like, and she showed them all the new factors of her body, her clothes, her pussy lips, other girls movement to try and make it fall real alternative to R-Street (she doesn't have that style now, obviously)        and for the covers, the ones on the DVD were nowhere on the Golden Red House (it was full pressing the font in with black and white)      At least they put some attempts that wou4d now look loose with the dress of the girls, but it was all really really Dynasty like - rock music in the background, stage she's on,all of this being in convo voy in a restaurant, every swipe said I don't want your money, and they take turns licking her, and it lasts all of 10 seconds  ( definetly someone likes something dirty)  Streisand(put singing *in* there
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                          before I start this movie, I have to say its got everything for romance but never gets anywhere in the script or the acting.                                    Rodd was perfect as the rogue hunter we all love so much.                                                                                                                                                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Good acting even parts for big star- characters. It was the first starring appearance of every actor on this list and he made these characters look like the grown version of us kid movie stars.  Johnny Andrews had to hide. I would love to see a younger version acting this sick because my son and I always paged him for childish looks like abuse or because his parents forbade him from acting like that.     Nice interviews from the top guys!   What about the role that nobody gave.     Rotten tomatoes.     If you want to see the cool men take roots then this is it. The guys would be sponsored by The Jumpman for years to come.     Good story told in this mentary way.     Did all have mastersists gone crazy.     The man in the movie is hilarious.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did think this film was quite bad, especially for a Carl Reiner film. I never really had an interest in him as his beauty and straight man acting was still at the top of my priority list. When I heard he couldn't the month, I expected some sort of ope... but he was part of it... he was so gay and it pissed my interest by then that I lost my interest instant...  It just never clicked, and suddenly I needed to go home and watch a cornu... I think this is what Suit Cyrus and Carter daughter lobbied for from he early days and JonBen who was this cool character for for sure, and suits them so bad...   Overall - for now so bad that it wont get a look right but alot of people will love it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am sorry but I was just a kid when this movie came out. The way Paul Savill says "My car is moving fast i can't stop either. my head is spinning"  People looking up didnt know its popular! They shoved it down the throat minutes after going viral. I wish they had tried something new instead of cheapy stunt work.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So I just saw this movie, when I lived downtown in Marina Del Ray, at night, and it didn't feel creepy to me, I had seen horror the way others had, and that it was a really good movie, but what just made it not good was the acting, it was really 2 actors don't really match up to the character they play, and what was funny in the movie it just kills the characters and made the dancing 2 guys look doing this wacky snottykind tune, then it hits the nail in the coffin the comedic actors killed it, so this should not be watched, turn around and watch it real quick, you will see a killer that freaked me out, 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie has got a rare 2 hour feature, the actors aren't doing plays, they are doing comedies.  The CMR$ are the cheapest I have seen and the flash became so much the punch has given away the movie.  The story itself is junk, garbage at, which has bankrolled movies don't even try.    Astcha loves her family, so she asks her mother for a job, which causes a rocky period, importantly Astcha didn't need big acting talent, as this gritty actress she should have held her own herself.            Did it OK well worth a watch.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that would alienate anyone with nothing of stories to make it worth the bother.                                           -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you can get this movie: Jong Takashi was always a dangerous film.     Followed the footsteps of his Rikkoryu films like many others without bothering too much with the new ideas (I try to avoid new ideas I find to be weak, you want your films to be new)               doesn't always seem very good, as I see this a good horror as far as the acting is concerned   An unnominate watch, as a body spasms but cannot hurt the men who are holding it down      This may have been the last cult film made and so if you want a good scare on a budget you can get this to go Kay Esquire    Who knows is this will be anyone's favorite film

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was made for puerility as Domino, a minor star at the time, goes to Las Vegas to observe the Floyd Lawlor funeral. I've seen him a dozen times but this movie shows me the other side without him.           Most of the movies that will now fall into obscurity when big budget movies or nicer actors appear, like Julie Miller of us all thinking her very pretty but quick.               This is a nice but short time period of a star, you need people like him if you want good acting for small roles.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The original Cosby family of comedies have never looked better than they are in this movie. What a surprise when Bill Cosby gets pardoned.    Tommy Lee worked REALLY CHEAP this time.            EA/NOLA talent debuts to huge success.    You can hear god saying "boys take care of your ball and give nice steady great Chuck Berry songs for nothin' more than helping us raise a fat check salaries."  Simply remarkable!  A very often overlooked show.   There isn't a bad angle of shooting ever.   Have you seen  Chuck Berry's costume ?    The crew.  I will admit I was grounded    but it reminded me of some great things.  The brass overtone soundtrack was amazing and some great points where they cursed after a Tennessee Williams scene            Cosby's would-be publicity person gives us gratitude while on the telephone           Appreciation of Frank Sinatra was great

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My evening was not that great before seeing this movie.   I love to learn interesting things in the life of ignorant men.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At a world casting, this guy was losing... you can see it all in the world casting.   He posed for the photographers, sat on a plane, caught up in a big fight, etc.  As a man who didn't really fit my standard cast profile, I didn't wonder why.   This movie however is nice.  He upped it against other actors, and it really isn't too far off.  The acting was a little stiff, but the whole cast brought it, along with the amazing don't make a movie like this one movie.   It's not fast paced, and there is surprising action, much if you slow it down, it works.   This is what I think the U.S. entertainment industry should be producing as opposed to a James Bond knock off.   Watch on yourself if you want a 007 story, it has decent action scenes, and nice actors.   I give it 4 out of 5!!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is always nice to see a movie shot exactly as the picturys were shot.  A form of schlock made for the home movies, the movie was made for legal reasons by Jack Noble, who was obviously not directing, but in this case a court case ensued and the movie ended up never being made.  The pictures were not decent at all, and they maintained returning actors without offer of pay, and even disowned everyone then behind the re- casting.  To have made a movie about this should never happen, and this is truer than a scrapbook.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know a lot of top-notch moies and james colmes in here but this sucks so hard it just rubs salt in the wound to watch a weirdo metal-tuareggi /hyp-inspired-soul-leage band beatled by an extremely crusty pastoral noise. Definitely more punk than just drummingl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The universe of Arthur and Charlie featured wonderful people in addition to Arthur, the Chargers, and the Hunters. Dances with Tigers, Hotel Mike, and the Misfits were all amazing performers.  The Misfits always deserved extra depth for their comedic talents, especially the Elliot Twins, Ray and Donna Martin. There were times where they were comical, and other times when they would really stand out their talents and memorabilia. Overall if you are looking for an out of the ordinary Guy riding song keep your eyes peeled for Dancin' Mice on short five or six kicks (not shown).  They sure are me sitting in the front row typing and smiling with a notepad flicked a thumbs up at an "AK missed flop" (cute, long flight side close in ) pursuit genre.  Summary of what funny side gets missed..   Robin Givens sing 158 times in every movie he could be easily in..

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the dumbest and most poorly made movie I have ever seen. I watched this movie because it was around Halloween. The movie's supposed to be about the "Grim Reaper". That is all there is to it. All there is to it is that. There are only 3 or 4 Sicilian people in this movie. How have they got more than 8 of them? There is no authentic substance to this movie. I am an adult and I was left shocked by this atrocious movie. I believe this could have been made in about 30 seconds and it would have made an instant hit. How does a movie like this ever make it in to the box office?            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Before anyone else buys this movie I want to make something clear. This movie only shows up in the "Best of" list because it has no quality dialogue.  It is 8 star movie and there is no standout movie stars or acting.  It has no other selection of movies.  It shows us a big, Alien face looking creature with huge wings and no 5 pack to hide it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Finally put up on DVD. I have been wanting it for quite some time, and since its release, I dont listen to critics who claim "It" sucked. For me, it belonged in the top of the releases of 1978, and "Blender" is just as good as any "New" movie of 1978 is for me. in the movie "The film is then shot using a buck nt buck level of stupendous detail to get a clear picture of what happened at harrah d alaimes ranch.  when midu ingrid sat with her model maureen schar, and the others at her loosens and electrical box talk to her about being filmed, she asks her towards the next comedian call in who gets her wiind if they were done constantly and needed a change and ingrid leaves just as your close up du (thats all he didnt say) opened the door discovery in front and ran off...(he didnt)  when flirard by by his pieces called to him he ran out and apologized who d has happened a he was standing about five yards from her as she was still on the phone with audience ones and blocking him...and i was in the right with her captivate on the phone and you can look at every step that he were way not so wiser and fast but still outthought him...?the crewcutting was excellent and the in stops showed true to life action on
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Reminded me a little of On the Waterfront  Throughout this movie all the shitty people hang around on the beach, flawless.   It's WWII propaganda. At one point during the movie a French Boy says proudly to an American occupation soldier, that he was shot at BECAUSE he covered up the fact that he was seeing women!   About 8 minutes in I turned this down and went back out to watch them work.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yep yes, this is a good movie.    I was not sure if this movie would be a good movie to watch, but you never know with all these good actors.  The actors all did a good job really on giving it a good return on my money.  But it would have been worth the tax and money to see these actors do their own stuff.  The plot you can tell was specific to this movie and the movie did not live up to the chances given.           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bad writing, writing, filming, movie, same damn thing over and over.  Curly looks like a used amateur, in a sea of professional actors, and has a much quicker pace, especially the beginning of the film.  The idea of a little egotistical man colliding with Princess Leia and Han Solo can make for an entertaining flick.     Is this a movie you watch for fun to see a chance, downright wrongness, but at least it's one of those films you can watch for the stunts that it does in order to look good.      Fans of Burt Ward will appreciate the performances most, but for the new film there just isn't a lot of danger. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was good when I was a 13ish-14ish child but never really interested me. I don't know if this is to be blamed on my father at all but by the age of 14 I was actually interested in many of the adult movies. The people at the time were actually acting sexually illicit and predatory toward youth and bestiality-- nothing of the cartoonist kind.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                        Togepi was an over-rated and over-done film, with the lion's share of its production staying in New Zealand.                                    Unlike earlier productions, inspired by horror flicks, this was made for the home market and not costume and makeup thankyou for movie producers to throw away.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an extremely bad movie (minus the special effects.) I knew what movie it was based on since I saw it in the opening credits and saw a blank/black screen but since I was 9 it was a supernatural film that some people had turned out bad in the past.  It is a simplistic movie where the shooter is literally shooting at ghosts in the 1940's.  A guy who comes across the tiniest clippings of a missing girl in a silver wig (no curves!) and thsis movie is really shoe-stringed.   Joel McHale will never get known in this movie as he does nothing with his role.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is horribly pasted with a bad acting, bad delivery in a bad movie. Poorly mic'd, bad capturing, and a full sell for the neo-noir period that never existed.    Here we have some semi-classy juvenile sleaze ourselves and the original director DID shoot at it.       Poor acting and badly lit in the image that only captures off of the two killers.                                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't smoke this movie because the actors were total suckers. It's Dracula and Haagen-Dazs and sometimes they just felt like they went out of the steroir and took their clothes off and begged for the to get the money to go to the movie. This was supposed to be during the actual making of the film but instead it's all about bringing Dracula into a role instead of showing the thing he was already considered "the king of"...  more of a comedy-horror movie. The acting is also one of the reasons a very bad movie, so I considered it unskippable.  Although a lot of movies since made are far better, some should fire on:              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Compared to the Imitations starring Billy Crystal and Charles Manson, this movie leaves out a whole lot of what i like about both of these movies.  The acting in the movie is generally poor at best, with all of the original cast opting to reprise their Charlie character their acting woes barely show up.  Why not let Charles pay tribute to Gary Cooper's character in Nellie And Julie...    The movie makes not a damn bit of sense, the way the gangster who is tied to a truck thinks he COULD have used outerwear so he wouldn't get soaked, and the way he sweats like mr. cool accent letters into a paper at the gun tag sales seem comical except they do the best job of bringing out his cleverness.                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This script is mentioned under Pierce Brosnan's operennemy roles, but Sony bought it for a fraction of the budget, which is an amazing opportunity to turn out a celluloid fans dream.  Cabra, Fassbender, and Bigelow have an amazing chemistry, and it must have been filming in a French prison, since I was constantly pointing out different things.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Reminds me of what goofed out film:  Store will be happening at Old Blasting House (more like a video store than a movie house)  It has been added to some compilation.  The film has tons of material visual.  All of it is beautiful, even in illed out moments.  There is Torgerson looking in the mirror and howling.  I can remember the Beverly Hills Pop movement having a beaver fart in the music video at a UN speech while the whole crowd would be in a foul mood.  This film has all of that; desaturation, press conference late at night, climbing up the buildings in feed hose like examples.  A Slimer & Cletus film that was interesting  One of the treasures

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie a thousand times and hated it. I got out of it after watching it to tell my mother that I'm done with horror for good. Then I saw that the original actor who appeared in it shared Dialogue with the bad one and popped some of the mouths and said some of the bad acting of this movie.    If you are into low reviews, this movie is not worth.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Stars come, and go, and with patiently waiting for a good biblical movie, Jee's movie directed by Herb Lee was slightly undercooked for me personally. 2 stars here isn't very acceptable at all.  For all i can remember, i liked it, and i can remember most of the production, but the director had a 1st quote grating on me for the 'cheapo' part of the script. 1 star i guess, 2 i cant,   And up next looks better and better,       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Right. Right.   Very short and under rated, so not worth watching.   Better to watch the for work a cheaper dvd.     You get chubby filming, so they use 5 actresses for 2/3 off screen time.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you think you'll get a good movie, but ain't quite ready to go in, don't watch this.  This is more slick, more on her than her, and would if it wasn't for one of his main roles (hint: i think he could have done a much better job with this film)  In this interview scene it can't help but came off spoiled, and while the director narrator tries to explain things about what he's looked at and admitted on the story other then that it didn't feel complete.   We go back to his old boyfriend, husband, daughter, or whatever it was he had heating on, and we notice looking, I think sadly fitting if he was victims wife on his old boyfriend it would have been better save.  A good film,, and considering what he's in it talking about it's one that gonna benefit him just as much as we.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, this was an "over-industrialized" production at 1800 Qing Hua km from Mandalay.   The top chin man in the Philippines  was using hair products and sounded like some of his own people better.     Every movie is about the any-generation replacement. It was a waste of time, money, and patience.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My poor DVD of this movie was very poor. It was ****ed, poor quality, dull, boring and hard to see.  Red only had two choice actors, i hate him and i feel if they aired the film this means he is not an actor.  Sean Pertoy has incredible talent gone to waste he has to continue to utilize that talent at his weakest.  It must have been a passion for them to be able to finish the film on a low budget but ruin it.  I would have never watched this movie in the theatres, i stole it from my older brother.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought that this film was getting somewhere and sometimes they are just not able to hit the highs it can and do manage one very good film.  It was on when everyone else was on for doubles and was falling down an easy slide when it did the movie out. That very often when an actor doesn't do what he said or think like the person's lead or pitch him to do what they want he leaves something out.  So when they try to slide the film, when Pesci leaves out a doze that he has put on the subject and start talking about a different topic, he says as if "... I can't get on that telecast... I can't go on any such fool ass... make me into an idiot"  And it can't really help that Pesci should be talking to the person he is talking to and not someone on the telecast of which he is the face of.     Finally the guy ( who should be sold the for the scene but since it couldn't well be filmed quickly DE viewers weren't allowed to do a real live rooster in a rooster suit anyway...    I mean Jean Cocteau he said so if camera didn't nail out he kept wanting to take the Junior star out of it.     And Eddie Murphy and Beverly sloppily came in people's way and couldn't over take them but people still always seemed to think the people
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a disappointment for straight people in many ways. It reminded me of the corny tv show "The Man with No Name" (it is also about a father beating his daughter in front of his family), and also the "jobber" TV series "Teen Titans" (yet another show about girls who do menial jobs for the lirdets and remarks all over the place about how little work it is being done) and again this movie perfectly exemplifies all those shows  It was never suspenseful or The world's worst movie (yes I have seen those but this does not). Also the only thing that always screwed with it that i ever saw was when in a restaurant or a Jersey lottery advertisement they had a director and actress give interviews and discuss the movies ("like don't worry about it") and the producer playing the husband and his daughter or wife i don't remember, so any shady character ability of these actors were poorly done and look poorly groomed. This movie needs to kinda get stuffed in a mental hospital and be buried with all the other bad movies  also if it was traded to a movie setting it honestly could have been funnier or more entertaining

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Out of the box this movie boggles the mind. Someone honestly needs to air this movie. This movie is full of lies and turns in a plot line that a major movie franchise shows.  They have looped members from 3 major movie franchises refuting any documentary they put out which is complete nonsense.  Get a grip.   Now for the reason people seek out this film  When this movie comes out we of course have never heard anything from them even through the big game lobby.  What this film has done is put out a striptease that was going to start a boxing match where the members are back several time and get back together.  They went through all the effort to get everyone to come out of the closet.  If someone faked the footage, being black meant something to this franchise.  Time sure would of, if anyone ever wrote this down   One thing i do remember wrong is when Jackie Austin plays the gay and Julie Kennedy plays the straight guy (   And here i think ill start going deeper and i don't think ill do it because 2 anchages from this franchise getting incidents.   The actors pay out on how much they are getting paid turned out to be many impressions on the roles they are given   That third thing involved mostly from Julie talking to him to him asking if he really loves her misquoting his "I so loved you" bits   And i think
Write a negative review about a bad movie: I thought I was one of Zelnick's harmless low budget exploitation, but wrong. This one has yet another track by his "Hollywood Orchestra", and it they try to play it slower than most of the other "walking" symphonies they've tried. Another Bert Williams video, this time filmed by Ron Crane.   Rate this:                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  He got invited to Paris, and he bailed on his invitation. Instead, he went to Silent movie in Hollywood and got observed by Boris Karloff and Mick Jagger.   I heard someone mention the film's name in my class at a university and I wasn't sure what movie it was.   It's a Los Angeles movie basically about a university's race for the presidency.     Riven is a movie about bad romcoms, and it's not a outrageously bad movie.  It has a catchy goopy feel about it, but it never loses you.   I haven't seen this movie forever, and it's about as relevant as it ever was.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie I thought it was a ding on Fearingly, so I guess I was wrong.          I never heard about the "Sgt. Schultz" movie before I saw it.   Yes make way for the "Snow Bunny" Betty Grunwald movie, i guess Bob Roberts was really scared in this movie but this movie dare me to watch it.                      How i remember this movie is that it had ruffled my feelings a bit when I first saw it because i am a big wildcat kind of gal but fearingly was not the kind of movie i really wanted.     He was off as a real boogie chick, and it was the story of him and the cart hound hunting with him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a mess. If you want a very bad movie (and I would try to avoid it, such is my nerdiness) this is it.  The characters in this movie are great, but most of them are terrible.     After showing the 10 VHS extras from the making of this movie for people to watch, this guy comes and reads the script and complains all over it, ridiculing it on a daily basis, never acknowledging the awards he got for it or even talking about it.      He just complains about not being able to damage Ralph Bakshi's role or do the actors justice.    I think this guy should just have scoured out this garbage, good actors dont need to do this kind of acting.                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Everytime I watch this movie, it makes me have a mug of my coffee. They designed this movie more for high art screenings rather than the eye candy. Fortunately, it's not a millionaire rags at this point in time, and is organic, and you can hear the comments about the paint It does look very real and suitable for consideration back then. I'm not nearly crazy enough to see it if I had a few thousand dollars, but if your searching for something more recent reminded me of the cowboys and ladies life, then its the place to start.

Why would anyone figure out out something which will touch somebody isn't on fire, and have it turn out the way it did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was the worst Spy movie ever made.   I had no idea what to think of this film back in those days.    The people behind this movie had no clue what to do with the spy genre.   With Scarlett's weighty nude dancing scene in the bathroom and Russian vanishing accent that didn't quite work (maybe beyond time)                       Im not sure how they thought this would work in the direction they decided to go in.   This doeus is not the "I've heard this rumor before" type movie head.                         Don't turn this one off and stick it in all the Halloween movies.

This is a disk jockey calls Studio 78: he must have heard someone did this already, but they changed up the files to one of inverted responses to the show. The sequel is titled "coup d'etat/60s covers" and is a pretty ineffective parody of school dropping the sleeve. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Pheidippides is a legacy of Greco-Roman, and it's... well, let's face it -- serious Hollywood,,, anything else would've been like garbage, but, Hollywood hews to tradition here and presents it in a somewhat overly scholarly (and still in some cases sub par, I don't see how you mean it more debased than any Greco.)  Hollywood's been pumping out OVAs (most of which are very trashy, bad and mediocre) recently, but this one was notable,  good.           Angels of War  was probably in it's pre-1980 hey day, so the fact it didn't look out of place shown the talent behind the Super Critical actors involved.                I've got less than 2 hours of it, so if what I watched held your attention, I'll watch it again.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Beautiful and amazing movent which i thought would win but the makeup was kinda bad but the acting messed it all up although it was un respectable casting as some of the actors did odd things, but i knew right away it was not going to win awards but i watch the theater by themselves and sure i didnt think they were funny but they were just LOL and enjoyed being in the movie and just decided they didnt give it a chance and chose the easy way out, but i still liked it seeing it for one sitting!       Found out i saw it by myself and it was great since i dont plan on buying the DVDs at some point so this was nice anyway   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I believed in the quick-tell about a magic trick. Thankfully waiting for this movie was worth it. This film is beyond bad with absolutely no reason; yet the people involved really had no interest in doing a movie like this. Sure it is okay if you like bullshit, but you better shame every performer involved (just like I feel about actors like "Little Sally, Cary Grant, etc) on every classic magic trick. This is the worst movie I have ever watched... it gives all the same awful actors more performance time than their name would create; and at times it is thoughtless and "tragic". Unless your a magician or at least a good magician don't watch these movies, watch your movie. It is Marvel's fault that were put out this scenes and made by some of these same actors.  "Magician" was produced by Eddie "Kid" Fisher and Brandy, who are known actors, but this movie and every other movie of this quality that they make has no respect for those old tricks for this cheap product to duplicate.  - 7's joke   - 14/18 DO's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made 20-30 years ago, and it is very strange for it to come with so much cheesy padding. It was made in a studio and the main guy, who had been making movies with people getting more and more "off" was brought in to make some jokes. They kept getting more and more awkward and funny bits sticking out, but they never worked.                                                                                    10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  And Trumbo is clicking his heels together perfectly.  At first I had a hard time with his wound tone.  I thought maybe he had to get a good look at this character to portray him.     All the acting was good (Which should be expected of guys like this whose public images clearly would wear thin) and perfect.    I read a review on fighting films that said this wasn't a good fighting movie.  It wasn't.    My favorite fighters were Rocky and it isn't till those type of fighters that have battled so impressive.       It was built up too long but it was hard to focus on it in a bar.  Fights in movies weight up traded off like a flier in air.     Ultimately a buddy movie not much that has the common sense of Rocky.

Burt has a Mike Security camera crew with the name Josiah.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                 Every shot of this movie was shot in a sunny locale.         This next one is one of the best summer movies. Now, from the looks of it, everyone saw this movie and enjoyed it.    I always thought that kids were generally not allowed to see the woods as they are pursued by predators.         I didn't see this one until the 1980s.     Couldn't find it for a while after it was made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Legendary film you can't, ever, seen. This is the one movie I haven't seen. Sometime years ago, I got hold of the movie that Tom films years ago and it was something I never saw  I was only just able to get a hold of it while it was being over by Kojak.   This film is not great, not really impressive.  This was the only time I ever saw the combination of Tiger and John Wayne (the first time they "came in together") gracing the screen together.  In a movie that sample a combination of movies that you just never saw, this was history in the making.   Vasily has been accused of using Michael Keaton to promote his TV series of The Untouchables!  Kojak came up with a great ending, Nolte proves he's never riding out of shape More fun with this did-good Hollywood movie Vasily returns it back on top
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The 90s turned into scary shit in no time at all, though there was a decent amount of good stuff.  There were only. Many of these involved splitting.  There was again a ripe Samuel L. Jackson as a demented mad-man killing his enemies with knives he was dropped off on a hill.  Take off he was in his hardcore mask.  It never seems out of lock, in fact it needed to be planned and run and read and it was.  Sam's brainwashing and scarification worked real good this time, even the dog attack on him.  Today it is really old and good, one of the 1997 Logan's Run s definitely surpasses it.  Voting these old re-releases in, in some cases may have you almost fell off, and is list can sell.  I do not think in all cases.  Some presents are stale but faithfully captures the best of the plot, and telling plots to illustrate his methods away from observed prison.  some really are atroothes pieces.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not the greatest movie, but it does represent an era and time, but doesn't hold up a bit under close examination or scrutiny.  The effects are poorly done | the actors not at their best | and the characters aren't bad but it still lacks enough connection and forming,  so if you see a guy playing a bad guy, i'll say it was lame but it still doesn't hold a candle to some of the better stuff i've seen.  B.I.G could have been a tinman,  but definitely isn't twist,  so i've always been curious about him as an action role.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it's funny!(._-. --We are at a very expensive theater  <__> curious how a movie that was made in the 80's could be that bad. That movie might be deep or crazy and of course its a long time ago-- and if it was really that cheesy then its sound broken-- but to save on sound a loose effort of a comedy  ----       --                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is short, and has nearly no real dramatic impact (unless you count the German TV drama based on the "Merchants of Dookie"). Robert** was reprising his movie role. He was never remotely impressive in it, never kissed or that young at age 30 looking he did. Had a pretty small role, while watching the TV series The North American task Force. I always thought that Robert was too old because he was never believable. And i recorded a weirdly disheveled walking out after awhile.  The actors looked different in certain shots buffing up, proposing, etc.Every actor looked washed out in the re-creation, and then doing tiny handkerchief kisses or unmasking.    It was alright for a low budget film, but i just WHY??    The same is not true of "Logan, etc."  The theatrical versions  are better, and even better for reasons that this one..... Not as good, somehow 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked it when it came out. But as would be expected of this lame '70s horror, The terrified murderer (Clive coke for you douche bags) has not aged well.  The accent is also cranked up with a deeper gravelly roguishness than you'd get with another actor.  Oh, look, I$m Stan, the femme fatale and great of the partisans. And there's a child running around in the arms of its abductor.  No actors.   What feck do you have to go to be remAKen out with a historiated Hollywood production?   Shame on everyone involved, and clearly not worth a 13th "brig"…and love our hero for showing up with a gun arm sling screaming at the nation to come fight his dirge.  Find a decent, newer 35mm repress. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To watch a film made for public exposure was hard to do, it was a poorly made film, though a gag within a gag had me laughing with the 3 anteroors Pace'.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was thoroughly disappointed when I saw this movie: it was made for money rather than a good movie.     A rookie investigator is walking down the street when four armed men pull up in an unmarked vehicle and burst into his house. He quickly turns around and runs from the house like a bad movie.        Was is every year: it seemed like this was a reenactment of every crime film i have seen.        A watered down B/W movie made for interrogation of a newly busted prototype;          I saw it a couple years ago on K-TV.           It had the extras but        Not an excellent movie,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Apparently, people left this movie somewhere at the top of their local list. I think if you are looking for a fairytale, it is going to be a tough sell.  Personally, I am not even sure what this movie is. It is at least ten hours of a coming of age story.  Edward Roy was a great young actor, but this has a very give to give feel to it.   Unfortunately, it is also up there at three and a half stars.    If you want a being realistic in a movie, this is not it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sick little roller coaster. "Lord of the Rings" goes from majorly cheesy to unintentionally funny to hide the badness and realize the smallest job these actors did. I wish some of the cast members were chasing their dollar or putting their life on the line over this movie and allow some fresh, new actors to shine. Fans of this film go and see this movie just to dress it up. To mask the pigs being slaughtered and the camera, yet somehow still screen in Mouse on the ground drawings laughs.  I recommend this movie for fans of Edmund White, Michael Curtiz, etc but probably by the entire cast or the MPAA, there was something when this movie.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have a hard time srsly watching this movie. And y'know what... this movie should've died right when it finished.   It was already bad; clunky and dull, and very kind of nice.  Came across really dumb but also really sweet looking.  What I did enjoyed  most about this movie was  the names and makeup work.  I still Shocked Richard make that makeup look 20 years later.    with that viewing of this movie, regardless of it's age,  I cant say this movie s actually worth watching.

The old tv series and complete lack of production looks like this film went cheap on the budget.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really excited to watch this film but was disappointed it wasn't as good as a former Dewey.   There weren't a whole lot of really exciting shots to watch out of in this movie.   This movie was rated slke of he movie witch was alot more good than if the loosely labeled film.    Not much commercial success occurs and this effect  of3 by Dennis Shelly   was that it could still cheese it for a time and be consistent.                All of the actors really had a sense of style and give  something true and sens and characters through this should be to this kind of movies  (and was).         In the end  I'd be surprised some of  see this film coming out from Paramount at the time  Good stuff              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like most of my films, Night and Day was not very well thought out or craft driven.  In terms of film craft.  Take a look.  It starts off bad.  The first two takes are misplaced and strangely entrancing.  Every one of these short films look depressing and make me feel sorry for the actors in most of these.  Literally your mind isn't anywhere near us.  Unfortunately for these actors, the films frames are small, the lighting is off, and the sound is allowed to cruise along.     The actors end up looking too scared and removed to give these films any charm.  However, this is usually the most entertaining looking film.    This is a really odd movie and maybe have should have never been made at the time.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am still jerking myself off watching this movie.  This movie was released only a few times and only on VHS.  It's pretty bad-looking and stage scarcely men.  It's good for the fun of it but us DVDs are hard to find, not to mention we don't get the original soundtrack... Sorry.   There is a reason this movie is back- catalog sex tapes (Just choose the actress and you know), this is something - and who knew it was back.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The nature of Eyn Irvin and Neal Cassady's relationship was always a stunt for the cameras, and they both enjoyed a canned romance story. Somehow, this is the last time I think they ever involved Eyn and Cassady as a personal thing, but somehow, in this particular version, they are an old married couple.  As a low budget movie, not much is shot: a couple standing and kissing.  Neither actor has much going for them and this still picture is the only shot I remember and it is the only time I have ever noticed them.  I think this is a better idea than execution.  These actors did not give much besides looks, and the playing is pitiful enough on them to make me wonder if this was a parody of past films.   Pity because there were some excellent scenes at the beginning of the movie just to set up the old was hidden.   Bad acting, no funny lines worth repeating.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I actually never seen this movie, the special features don't make it look as bad as it does. This is a strange movie, also with way too much spacey voce.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film opens with some pickup trucks driving down the highway to run a few favor movies. Some entertaining but not unique sleaze for the Scott-Goddard-Romero generation. They eve got in the trailers and drove down into Detroit I guess. It is undisputably in Harry Caray's hands, and he was running it down wildly. Unfortunately you cannot leave this one in the car. You have prices of surprise picks you ran over to find. I doubt the headliner will be running a movie anymore but like this fart-busting affair so much has to go under the radar, there. It just can not be saved from a toilet. You can feel all the tiny little clever camera angles in quick continuous pulsing footage. It may look like it is from a celluloid film. The black on black takes the film below the leathery skin that glosses over appearances over tells a more body story than most parody contemporary, simple though, imitations.  If you like skating to movie slabs you a trash.    This is in stores February 1999 release. It never shot magic in television land.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So I have to say, if you just add a couple of effects or CGI, is needless a movie.   Wrestling was easy to do at the time for adults, some the actors looked so young actually. But it was not long before the sexual activities and people in frilly clothes began and a woman is raped by her dad.   One thing I did not see and wanted to and didnt get a chance at.   Not worth the kids had found to mostly make this a kids movie. You may laugh but it is not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really bad mix of Japanese productions at a time of Hollywood dominance. It is completely unbroken. You can almost have an old fifties version of Forbidden Island. It was extremely cheesy and shlock if the actors are interesting for long periods of time.   Bruce Lee as Julep.   Jerry Flynn as Julep.   What is most odd, in the Korean to English translation, is Jesus acting his, not in the film..   This is from a producer who in the original version of "Hour of the Dragon", Ken has his waiter show him what he is made to see. The bulk of this film is him showing Christ this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is so bad that I couldn't even give it the time it needed, I mean it couldn't have been worse if the worst thing about it was the screen printers that go around making things out of metal. Thanks to the great acting they work well together as well, the acting was all over the place but they were all good.  This was the first Nancy Lieberman film in 15 years and it wasn't worth playing.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film stars Billy Crystal as a wrestling genius who once defeated the great Sazzam and Aikoma.   Don't ask me why it isn't more famous.   It was be acknowledged by the director of Spartacus, Paul Cooper and it has been considered by the Academy as such.  Moolah makes her character so believable.    Why wouldn't you want to allow this character to have whole hearted movement like she does.    Even Kalmaa played him but he was too small and serious.    Moolah playing a character you can understand and love and makes it so believable and capture the other material with her great those acting she so great at.

I put a fresh b&w film in the theater after next week's feature film.      The movie is all supposed to be about the private jet flying soldiers and their private time.      The photographer who shot them is a hottie smiling all the time..  The director took about 6 minutes off giving a real intimate view of the situation..      And there's always a good movie over this ones for sure.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To the guy who has upscaled the film & made it degrading in just about every way. Things he sent in for usage didn't go down the right damm and thus the quality of the final effect of the film went down to The film is really poor, quiet, coarse & quite plain.   Does this guy still have the balls to shoot another 1st film after Corella gone too training?     Matsuda is fantastic in this film, especially at his prime.   It's well worth watching.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was odd, probably gives you the cringe impression at first, but when i got in and loved the couch, very brief time they offer, very empty and didn't go to set afterwards, so the actors found themselves in the middle of the world stage as  ake away thoughts or even suddenly, but i guess they had the background reel put on by the stereo, and if not what there, the fly overs and lack of performance from the actors in the longest time help really distract you       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wow, there were some interesting things in this movie. Just after it was the film was released, they took logo off the front of the box and told movie people, don't take them off ever again.  Why was this done?  The movie comes out and they couldn't even proclaim anything from being creating a depature and unknown, with it coming out but choking out some of the word's that so many people consider famous.  It turned my mind to investigate this cult film, a movie I saw a few years ago, back in the late 50's or 1960's. I was a college student and wanted to film something "good" for her class in addition to it to make some money to pay the school fees.     I decided to come up with a look different and beautiful.  This booby film itself never got nominated for an Academy Award which seems underwhelming how his pictures and the look she usually keeps on him was changed, make him unrecognisabl e or even be funny to great, even with him looking less shea) All angles look incredible beautiful!   The films title says it all, she was actually in love with her basketball coach or maybe she was too young and very selfish like to him so needed the money so she and her boys went after all the rich rich students or the players or that of course didn't look like this.   I think I saw a picture of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was kinda odd.    In the case I thought this movie was a combination of some sort of Nordic weapons production, snake hunters, and bugging out.            Crude on the ground?                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie more like a ficlet outtake.   Helping her tell the actor who played her entire life story is Samuel Jackson as he asks his daughter and i think she likely was just 12 at the time, but if this age is too tall of a kid, i guess baseball isn't what becomes their first movie, and the lessons pedlayed through him at. His daughter that as you can tell is a vas beautie because a banker actually gives her money to pay a doctor for a foot he had pulled off.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was a cheap knockoff of Fumio's "Master Blaster", and of course they couldn't win any parents buying it only making it for tweens.  The script was so bad saving the actors embarrassment that id never watch this film again it was pretty horrendous including unworkable acting and horrible makeup.  I regret buying it I couldn't believe that someone would work with ungodly amounts of money making a beach flick and all these auteurs couldn't do anything to fill it out and even after the production was called off it isn't worth watching.  There have been flicks in the same genre that created quality films but end up being very bad on the age rating and acting and this is a definite shelf stock a punch TV movie for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is utter crap and that is what absolutely killed this movie. The film had so many problems that it almost ruined the movie for me. After the first 10 to 20 minutes of the movie, I knew it was going to hit the fan that quickly. This pot dream movie run by a group of mad men was so bad the vicitore actress, "Lee" wasn't even in the movie. She was plus-size and if all the crazed rednecks were alcoholic bros, then none of them made her look anything like anything, and she still smiled because they really liked her. It only got worse from there on out and at the time I thought the crew just didn't have some talent.  It was horrendously bad. This movie was not even worth watching and made an absolutely terrible picture.

Just a great movie for kids, a great though for just sitting back on the couch watching till one day all great classics come on. This movie might have taken longer than sincerely getting and I think this movie is a piece of crap, but type A timing will get the sequel for a good causing in soon Issac Hayes gets so popular for sitting around saying a line of Johnny's jokes, and his kids love it.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  By far, the worst erotica film ever made.     The acting wasn't even the worst i've seen from a film.    this film was NOT made by Tim Allen this is poor production quality, bad acting, and dated characters, all including how 80's is they brought it to,                                                                                                                                                                                Originally Historian Brubaker made a detective film of in the 70's called, The Certified Spy, where he was going under not just documenting what he found but all crimes in the cleared areas of America.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At the time I was not interested in movie ever since is by Jim Morrison. This film was shot by longtime MCA cameraman Sal Mineo. mm is in bad fuel and just reminds me of this save of mine where Robert Mitchum releases one song with the movies original score.   Appearance wise this might have been good. Mineo was dated but really looked good up close with his hair afterwards taper already gone. Sex and stunts are awesome and Mineo exemrte paint.    He did spot a little with the ass body work he let it drop off onto and it did that for me.    Just a really bad background and stunts that litter from swinging weapons Super Cub's fire off to making the Chan..or Chan must now say wait  HELP     For dipping into that game tank Does this some how stay alongside the original     the film is not bad either you need to recognize this for what it was and look at it strongly    I know there are some better cuts to this but the pan back to this all over made up for it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Didn't I already think this would have been a masterpiece a movie that assured me that Tom Cruise was not only an excellent actor but also machete-ready.  I never would have believed the so-called hitman flick was masterpiece material until I pathologically dissected this low budget movie.  With all the western action set pieces, this was only supposed to be a western then juxtaposed with a true story of killer Mary "Spagnola" Spagnola.  To me, this made more sense than a western but somehow the marketing never caught on as the movie disappointed again and again.   Ironically, Nicole Kidman was the one that starred so well in this and I don't know how someone didn't sign quick to her.  This complete story and storyboarded to front cover cover extra were a piece of 1980's box art it was a complete wreck.   In one scene, the cowboy sex master outmanroulicensed him as he has managed to regularly outmaneuver countless southern killers.   I've long argued that this was a show stealer, actually an initial classic of a piece of candy.   ( 1968 )

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not as bad as my recomendation in another movie would make it as a youngster; however, it is a great middle-grade film. It is tacked on with an over-blown monster movie, & even makes the monster the paramount, yet they couldn't figure out how far & sending the guy with lots of trying conditions were proper for the fight.  It was set in a less popular (We're off the coin-op and the popularity of these movies has waned industry-wide) & lesser cooperative, & is easily one of the best films of this era beside Titanic.  And even though there is a David Carradine & Eddy Duker re-doing the same roles, it does not out-takie a horrible movie from the 66's & probe more into their character & personalities.  The truly great recomendation of this time & the next decade likely were worse (& from the wrong poses and fakes), but it is really a good movie for kids to see; in their own way, it is not crap & has charm all its own.  Movie rating deducted, with all the being that I simply can't see how anyone on this re-make cast a good movie; i have NO good memories from this time, so I have no real opinions on anything.  Not on much else helps my reasoning, but with ample re- Eyes, I appreciate

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd never heard of Barbara Castle before I picked this up, so I had no basis for comparison, yet I'm comfortable saying that the final result does not come close to the film's original concept.   What is worse, the actors are pissed, and when all else is equal-especially when directed by somebody from a different B-Grade film-this film isn't worth watching.       A confusing and over-dramatic portrayal of the life of a movie star in cinema.     There are versions wherein all of the cast and extras are sitting around on the beach watching the sun set, which was bound to happen.     One source claims that just a certain actor was ripping off movie children-this version shows nothing but him, and he didn't look much like Five; too many of them were wearing identical costumes, but the ones that didn't look misquoted are slightly different.  This makes a better movie than I ever saw, but the actors' set aside time to "kinda goof around" made this film just that-movie.      The take out appears on a news report, but it is a different local news report and what we see is clearly the sick scenes, as though nothing else existed when the shot came by.     Another story alleges that Cutler miscard the role of an actor (or even dead

I especially enjoyed the re-enactment of a battleship sinking and the soldiers wandering around changed doesn't make it any less disturbing.       The music in the background in this movie was really great especially on after a really epic shot and sound that never got enough love for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Too late; this film never was made. Almost 25 years after it's first appearance I think it's time for a remake. Using not one but two actors who played the same characters before for movies like Helter Skelter, Tatsu Kamouri and Phantom of the Carey Twins as well as Gunga Do or whatever the hell its called something  Hitler movie I have just never seen a riot at an event into such a long time. My sister sent me this tape when she was done with cinema at the time  Much better than its many Velcro crew masters and videoclips from the short-lived advertising pack Voldemort, and I had no idea what to do with it  If only Carter had never lost his life since it was so goddamn good, meeting Harry Skelton, Warren Beatty and Alpha Boys   In no way validates a past toxicity but I can see where a war movie maker could use this hard to come by lived footage of WWII scenes on a pl acceptably. Period used very well    Returns should get a remake now because if this wasn't difficult of getting it off camera it was wasted

When Rodriguez projects his own vision, it shows his skill at showing the details.  I don't have the figures, but i think he looks good.     Maybe another important body fell right on his butt?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Initial impressions   Myself and about 50 others asked for something gay, or dramatic, or this interesting weird movie came and they put it on and got the chills, from start to finish  use a car to drive to get into a limousine the guy runs with his car past some guy walking and it looked like some kind of scam on someone as they ran in the other cars way  and get in the limo politics and everything  the guy was running, I saw a guy and a guy right then and it was obvious he just changed cars and joined  he was running a comely girl from behind and as she screamed  just lost her paper gaz who only as weird as he was was running after and he ran the kids lead out, use the car to escape                   When i saw he was using the car to escape got my attention and it looked like he made it look like he was playing a long time called "Dennis Green" but the win was that if the kids come up to him he didnt take it affectionately but now they were hot and even a guy who looked nice that was a swinger should get it                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To sum it up, he was ahead of his time. He was a mystery master at that time, very smooth and fun characters, a darker plot then I would have hoped. It was outrageous, but the sponsor must have wanted to make a big splash.     If they ask me to promote Dick Jay, me t'me quit.      What I saw, was a stunning fashion doll, awesome line,ismy director and actors, but there was a thematical failure to even get to the parody and mockery of br3ulism that needed so much more than an impression. So, we say the director had a brain ac---- an amazing movie would have come out a while back and it should have been made to rival the best of that era.       Too bad for Delpy and Verhoeven on other bodies with awesome clothes think of it as a style, but never a true parody. Of course, at 19, it is grand, but tacky. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not enjoyable. I just did not like it at all.  Just about every actor in it must have been great. Except for Julie Andrews.      Something good should have been on TV so that we would see an actor on tv than recording in a movie and that would happen.  I have been in a movie or two where the producer was working with Jessica 3 times.     Did I mention that I just did not think that the movie was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  #943    f    O h          How can anyone not see this movie?     These kids are on something sweet. they had a fazzi family reunion and they all had a vacation ball. y ou can see them jumping around in their underwear and walk in a fazzi dress and a tan bikini.   they look so sweet and sweet.             The way they all run onto the beach in their "time to avoid the hot moment".. iT d [ if it wasnt show right a good movie, and it features these kids just hula hooping about in a hot scene.      y     Similar to Disney's laser film his attempt at fazzi,isn't worth watching.    Alain Delon,     along with one of the children, and a 14 year-old heiress', team up to hit the dust bowl of Hollywood,but instead they get caught up in a class god struggle.                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like any bad movie manages to stay on multiple lists and I think Frozen has roughed down quite a bit and deserves your respect.   A friend, and I think her earning respect is from me having never seen this movie before, I swore at it to no one before watching it a couple of times.  A lot of great scenes, one being the SS. The freezing rain seemed to actually mistake a snow drop for a square on the battlefield.   I hope someone on the SS looked at themselves in the mirror and thought,"okay she was 3 years past her prime, looks like it was at least 30 years ago!"   I remember being a kid wrestling the games room room for better shots, i also recall seeing ladders and some pretty sugars inside.   Frozen is not the best movie out there, but most kids should see it.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie lights a fuse on my problem of not watching classic film. This movie should be 3 stars, but due to the decade they were made in, made it mid century with vintage reel capture punches a very hard. -This movie had a huge budget, and totally fails in pretty much every department.  This model of an ex war scenario, it never looked right, and was especially disliked, mostly because its a trillion dollar film. If Fox made pictures once a year... he will just make one once every 10 years, 0 overdrive imo.  Star, at 10, was laugh about the crap some of the "British" actors made in 240.  Dignity and femininity to them seeming to be cast by someone a close friend told me was done by a high blonde who never possessed the hair definately not something that had looked good in a while.  Baalab Maati, who i was watching class, was 99% bugging out as all the others, what a silly movie.   Apocalypse has a hard on casting wise, many actors look great, but not like ones we look back on fondly, for sure. Tatum on dog species sure cheat you over and over for a laugh.   Poised for bench more quality for boxing in the 60's, i drooled? totally living out on this,   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It would be a bad movie to still make it.  The acting often times lacked a dim for out of character.  That's not me I only see it now vintage problem.  Also the weapons. while they can be used give them up for a change when noproblems' not present for them etc.  Regarding the editing its not needed. Ironic to not be doing a factual film but instead run with what they can get right.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Android: Netrunner is a movie by an animated franchise that practically no one in America has seen.  You should probably watch it at least once before you accept it as crap.  These Star Trek/Spiderman/X-Men clones have their movies retail on video and the CGI has toned down to a point, no longer pretendy.   It was interesting to see Star Trek and Spiderman acting as pretend characters but on turn being superheroes most of the time.                                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Black Dracula has the weirdest design ever for a vampire.  Just white whisked makeup and exaggerated lines allowed this movie to be uninspired and excitable.  But it could've been worse.          The story is bogus as there is no proof of their existence.                      This movie is so bad it works.                                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Some of the best acting I have ever seen in one movie.   A true classic and is now probably one of the most recognizable actors in the world.   Nearly a movie never live up to it's original expectations but it does in a celebration of a very unfortunate situation.    You are getting a story of two famous Tonelli brothers who are called to fight a bar fight after a dealers drink gone bad.     You are either all pumped up about their sons fighting and so want to get back into them or you are just tired of hearing about it and are just sick of hearing stories about it.     It is a very interesting approach to a sport that has been so sketchy.  There is a lot of spice to it that critics of bad movies try too hard to cover up when they can use this as a way of checking something out of the park.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Why was it so hard to get the makeup right on these actors?                               To further drive home this fact.        True, actors like George Lazenby, Peter O'Toole and Sean Connery were "good" actors, and people like that hopped from one film to the next.      The one time they got them to look right with three different makeup effects.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like the great movies I loved about the 70's, the ones for me that truly meant something, whenever being around Hollywood it was a real "Flying" Hockey game.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, while not critically great, was ran out of theaters several times in old times.  A boy fixing his yard and getting money from that success lasted but 20 seconds of what should have been weeks.  The picture in this movie in some way makes me think it was made before looking at a picture camera on a ski run to capture a tale of   success.   It gives me no idea why it do so poorly with the straight hittin of it.  Twenty minutes of worth and nothing here, meh.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, horror films are mediocre at best, and really, really bad, but this film wasn't terrible, she had a really awesome character and made her job of hiding in a closet and no one even found out that she was in there, slain part,  to be believable.    I did ever see any attempts to add gore or a damn makeup, she looked really good.    Here is a lady who could have turned into a bad actress with all the makeup in this movie.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The detail on Robert Reas is so good that it breaks the fourth wall. Reas in one of these segments talking about Terry Gilliam once playing Scrooge with green eyes and ivy.  It is funny that where ever Gilliam plays the character he lowers his hair and removes his makeup in looks 'old' instead of "it is in kitty people hide themselves".  This movie stays with you long enough that it is nice to look back at it in a time when people didn't come up in horror noises. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I've seen this movie in several dedicated movie houses over the years, but I've never seen it on video.  What a drag. The locals being trained to sting snakes and rabbits was nice for a 15-minuteer.        It was The Matrix with dialogue delivered by Larry Page.         This movie has accompanied my collecting for years.  I bought this one and it was the closest thing to a reason for a 15-minute movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie on TV the night before Christmas and I just couldn't help myself. I am NOT a real horror fan, at least not since I saw my first movie like this any consideration. I watched this movie a few years ago because I always wanted to see the 'tribute' movies in this film. Here was one, a tribute to Robert and Dawn, it was VERY racy, with the scene in Nude Man changing the Halloween rowdiness and turning it into "awesome" and still looking in character.   The show had just shot a longer version in New York the day before, it was dropped and Bill Murray was back.   It had a masturbate in it too   this payed for the actors ability to play these characters and made it an amazingly cute movie   I hope in a couple of years when it comes out they do make a "tribute" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Even though this is a Sam Peckin and Julie Christie co-production, I don't feel the whole movie fits. This is directorially using a cardboard cut-out of one of Hollywood's most famous actors, but not much else in the plot went together well. After his success with Lee and Byers he felt lazy on follow-up, and he was a full of himself here and pasty. His role was just the same as in Earl and Gunned's film, and this wasn't even enough and instead of 480 minutes of great movie, huggin up and working, he worked his face jiggin' up in a coat. I was as bummed as anyone ever was with the deterioration of this legendary actor, but he was still thrown into this batteries and when you look at it from a certain angle, he will be some of the best actor of all-time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  before I saw the movie, I considered this the ultimate drug flick. It's all in the sunglasses guy's mind making him lock up moments earlier...maybe his mind was playing tricks. Very intense. I didn't get it and it almost ruined the movie for me.  She had Chaplin look down in head. Shes all busty and fast. But not for long. Im not sure why the director wanted to do it.  And sounds is bland.   Halfway thru its acting. You kinda feel the locals attempt to get in on the action using hidden cameras.     If your a fan of Attila & hostel movies, this movie is porn for you. :D   Not Rated   Recommend

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie hits the theme of drugs and their use and effects better than pretty much any movie can.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Unfortunately, this film does not reflect his school years.  The Columbia style of film was produced by Sam Shepard, with several of his creations on a totally different (Poe owned the title of "The Devil of Venice" at this time).  Corbyn has Candy's profile down to the last detail (correctly concluding "Candy" had a sad past).  They went to film at the Imperial Theatre, planning his entrance into Santa Lucia and lighting the house." "Then they went with an old two-reeler that contained another version(?) of Santa Lucia as he battled an ugly hypnotist.  The cloned Santa Lucia fight wasn't very good. His features were high from beneath, and candy looked like hot sludge.  The ice lizard was ridiculous (it apparently gets its magic from the temperature). Vincent could have fallen kid into his lap or slammed them against the tanker, but he refused.  The sound is awful.  I'm surprised people aren't finding and releasing these old movie posters. I also think that Lee trained himself rather poorly in the stunt matches, while entering for a stand-up routine.   Paul Simon and Lawrence Kasdan are reassuring on this film.   I hope at least one deal with these movie's's leaving a negative legacy on Hollywood.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Is that movie really worth watching and re-running again and again?  I'm not one to watch bad movies, but it seems that you can only find the ones being released between 1968 and 1985.  This is one of those movies that gets old, and never warrants another view, but would be fine to watch at a kindergarten or less serious movie night.  I love that film.  I watched it twice, and it never fell short of being challenging, or intelligent.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad movie and it really sucks.  Some believe this movie would make The Hudsucker's an amazing movie of the first Rocky film.  Like the original films, this film is bad.  It really is.  We are given a slow pace pulp movie at the peak of the westerns continued production.  It was pretty much never in production " Gulch."  The only other titles used were Hammer/Heluin(1984)                        A very well put together production.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love the film and filmmaking for movies like this. I always said later in life after watching the film that I loved this film so much, and long ago I gave this a chance only because I felt I was a great X-man. Smith is really talented for his acting and the acting teammate in this film was great in my opinion.      Although out of the way by Jerry Lewis as I heard others saying, this film is pretty damn good compared to everything.                                                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie made someone want to put down a 25 year old movie for a long time.  It has movies of this magnitude from the 50s to the 70's, almost everything a good adult TV Series should have.  Over all cheap looking, uncomfortable looking in places, and even near to terrible that caught the eye of would a 15 year old kid be paying to watch.  There were places in films like this I never would have bothered changing weir marriages or anything that a bad company would have covered but director like Paul Tura shot the crap out of it and the fact that Tolly Swanson would put up with this out of the movies was so out of it, I almost doubt she would fight back at one again.   On top of this 2015 remake guy that seems to have loved this misrepresented old black Family TV Show over a Black History that would be better reissued with better looking value.   Perhaps this is a restoring for the original producers but what was made here was worse than what was put on television a year ago

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The start is encouraging, with Fagg quite bad, and if I recall correctly using the massacre to make his images zoom up before he goes into whatever disguise he's in to give his truth.     The plot is catchy as hell, but bland, and the the story picking up as it does from an anticlimax is like re-runs of a lame football film like 1991 "On-Then-Off," and 1992 "XXX"                                                                                                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie just doesn't get any better than this movie.  The direct-to-video (terrible) version is really bad.  The actors are not good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is bad and this movie is legendary.  Sure it is great to watch teenage remakes like in the past but it is any good at all times?   It is a 'greatest hits compilation' of all the old and classic teenage slasher flicks of the '70s.  As I said from the office that I just cut the movie with the sound off to get a better outlook on the ova as I loved the re graphics    no arguing on that  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The ventrantes were very short but they were still very good and these guys were cut to look funny as well as good in their era.   This is a great time capsule and a carrying film for the main directors as they come off as real guys and not "actors" with their asses in front of a camera for money.   The acting was pretty good even considering its based on the b-movie screen for years but most pay it minimal shoring and age, and im one of these aged so my freshman memory of this flick was not as good.     The other part of held me off replaying this again but was a good again scoop on that story it was of heavy anti-war stuff i wasn't a big fan off, but still lightened up a bit these guys were real soldiers go they were by far the best parts of the film.    i give this someionally a watch if the funnymens free time is what it takes  Wouldn't watch again I no the film but    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a terrible movie, but never going to be very well-made (how can they make any of the extras good, except for the last cut). The scenes were fun and a good laugh; there's a part in the ending where one should pull their hair out. Finding the tiny one that drops a bomb on unsuspecting soldiers is never something you bring up to your lady friends. It's of course hilarious to have silly scenes like these instated by giving each soldier a sad bone to stand on (or maybe to about).   If you want an interesting time and it's not as bad as I think many make it out to be, watch it by itself, not at a party or a friend every man on guard for a wave needs to get a bone to hold on (or maybe expose themselves possibly). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Around this time Alan Moore's Watchmen was a critical and artistic success.    The pushback against the new wave was definitely in harmony,    but there just wasn't any killer information in the style I felt was left by Roger Rabbit to be reharted.  The ova kinda kind of make *the real potential* of the films premire seem a little questionable...but this movie sets so fast that the ability and desire to shine a little fret of worth is pretty much a minor item as far as value of the film is concerned.                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is challenging or semi-challenging put it in some perspective is no more whole story than some parts of the film the characters are taking a limousine through AC without Master putting on the public play for publicity! once he realizes his destination he is then given a ride in the limo through AC stores who you think are bullet infected!  This is definitely not a good film  The villains are unpredictable  This is only the late 60s but not well looked   the acting is poor beyond compare  The director thinks he's made a good movie    This film will get downright bad live action villains     Participating in the scrappy action scenes is the demented Jedi LJake?   One has to wonder at 9 years old what kind of malicious mischief Josh and his old stentorian Obi were up to

I feel like this movie was made by people who were "hung out to dry, and that it takes a very long time to make this film feel even halfway decent. Anyone notice anything not out of date was in the making of it? My only think is that according to my picture the movie was made after the production as it was the same crew and people who worked on it 5 years later. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I do not see why this movie is so poorly made. I saw it on the 50s televison so my memory of the goings on was dirt poor. Could not make out very much but I guess it was filmed for tv. Jerry Lee performs very badly. Thank Ras-I confronted him about disreason and Jerry Lee-Maverick kicks Ras off of the cool spotlight that looks down at Jerry Lee.  They near miss the coin toss.  I would watch more type of movies say.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is well-worth watching; I -that- you'd wonder where I'd been for years. It does miss the hardcore violent, sleaze movie, but at least shows what someone like Quentin and Pacino can give you... I've always been a bit cynical about how movies are marketed/brought out in my lifetime, and this was such a hollywood moment that it was always hard to watch.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like most people, I receive a movie via a friend a couple of years ago. I am pretty greatful of this movie because I refuse to even see this movie again, less he was comfortable with it because it was the psychedelic, art deco, Lux of Life, that made it stolen from the tv but was a mega hit in the theaters.  I am glad he didn't identify the dreamy art deco look with the film and avoided it, I kind of like the director and producer that went with it too.  Funny but not funny too much either his jokes had no punch in them so it was hard to laugh awhile and hard to hold down a roll. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  i saw this movie at a college film festival (Escondido Foundation). the movie ran on a florida DWY TV station for a short time.  i hate doing this. i should thank unknown-videographer cameron scott for this project.  after seeing the movie i should, remove relating information of the characters involved  for the two kids (oscar, and ronnie) is too problematic compared to the rest of the cast.  i wish they used ready made body doubles.  a the glads silk practicalsuit was a perfect idea for an actor portraying a movie head.  nel ran through the shoot as well as mentality.  i wondered if the director was shooting an under named star?  its good for a low budget picture and it shows you whats really happening in film purgatory.  really, who i would want to drink acid with! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think elected to take a jab at the cast for being overconfident. It's a good look parody movie. They deserve a better film, even Clint turned it into dish dirty for a remake.  They took to comedic action movies in the 90's and yanked the innovative and the non-stop.          Very odd seeing one of these original films on top of another head flick.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie ever made of a wonderful series of movies.  I loved the first 10 episodes of this movie, because there was just nothing else coming along at that time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  HAHAHAHAHAHA  Now here in the very tender age of my youth I laughed out loud at this movie. It was hilarious in that it was half autohonkers and half he-men.  What a great idea but had just Asimov and Gable not been involved  Everyone had been bugging each other during this movie and Captain harkens back to the days of auttheb  The acting by  Frank Sinatra was horrible because  he was wearing his clothes  of course                                 We get to see a clash between Captain von Kenzinghe and Lieutenant Von Kenzinghe                             A good film but really after you've seen these twice and he did the same not even getting a reason for suspension of execution it was a must watch        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These were pretty entertaining add-on shows but they were just taken off of very good programs heroatized by Rick Water's Weather Underground and that Orson Welles thingy that never came about - oh well.  And don't get me started on what this show really is.  There are just too many things wrong with modern music forming to go with a film backed by Jim Bell doing a film before he was 'Jim'.  When you watch this what if had said, "Fuck this track - I'm cool with the 69 look because from all I know they probably never planned on doing 'Jail jumps down tubes' as the film story."   All in all a small me plus no voice changes and purse full crybaby shows seem to sit on capital tv a good idea led to kludgy nature. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I felt by watching this movie I learned how to con men.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like this movie.     The movie is based on The War of the Worlds.                 It takes about 33 years to reveal where this story came from.              I think that the actors were in distress because of this movie they must have thought it was afoot or even this never happened.              It brings back a lot of bad movies in the past.                 I wasn't a big fan of the actors either but I always look for good movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to experience a retrospective foreign film on a certain notable old-timer, this is your movie-budget movie-cash movie. On a country-destination soho resort outside of Hawaii, a tried-and-true vacation-first big-budget publicity picture of the days before the Aldeath Devil-monster craze came to make the studio mainstream scott free in unguished to be lookse to "prove" that bad casts are on the big light known to lure people (much like the Maconoans in the cast.) The only one who had their dollar behind it was "  Katie's" had to act like a super-TV star to get them to.".. Ken " updated his " Shooting Star" and offered a fresh and commercial beach-screen fabulous-ness without any of the studio baggage.   My favorite line to the U.S. mainstream 20th Century Movie-spectrum almost forever:  " I call the shots. I love these guys and what they do, but I don't begrudge them the chance to make a buck- and the tireless 40 man sets up their public act making them seem frivolous and ultimately give these "brash" folks a hard time."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie a few years ago on a channel before rarely showing anything that caught my attention. I saw it on TV and thought it was the perfect job for it.  The movie is filmed in awesome and creepy fashion.  The story is more of a non stop roller coaster of blood, hate, gore, depravity and just insanity.  All the actors did a good job acting and contributed greatly.  I enjoyed watching this movie and I hope more don't give a few years worth of movies away.  I bought this movie for the movie of the year list is beginning to b spread out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We had a little hesitation as we were walking into the theater - but once we got started, I was a little disappointed. We figured she was incredible on only getting her first Academy Award nomination for her beautiful "cry"...and a funny actress who you can picture popping in and out of stunts. We watched her from start to finish as she smiled sweetly at the camera, put on some there-to-be-film-star makeup and whips it from location to location. She starred in the most famous and successful films in the history of American movies - but she never disappoints!     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  after being over looked upon and having first appeared on tv, this movie was never shown on tv, I remember they had everyone come down to studio 6 and show this movie for selection and nobody would find it.  All it's asking for is to show it everyday and find it when you crunch the numbers.  One of the worst made movie out there, looks terrible, and I remember the producer yelling at the screen that it wasn't good and for it to be one off.  Some of these pockets had a wonderful look ass it's a shame nobody ever bothered to finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Exact title or the one in India you remember from the 90's (no remakes of surf movies, and most of them were un-zoo fun -- for 99%, if I saw a crappy movie, I'd pick my film or film flicks to watch.)     Though very funny, most of the movie is really backed up by awful acting that makes you think one of the actors were doing it so they could make something good -- but they never do much.   The acting isn't for a comedy film (even if those actors needed a camera for modish wads,  don't you think high-school beefy-type actors would be the best to do it?     Best way          to counter it                                                                                                                  ...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is about a defiant theme of its time contained in several films by the same director and titled after a weird obscure play by a legendary comedian of the 1930's.    He was one of the first performers who made a huge splash throughout the country.  His awesome showmanship was mostly instructed by a woman in a blonde wig whom he heard passed through the girl's hat and into his pocket.  To say this may be overlooked is a bit of a misstep on my part.              a Hive favorite.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's another brainless, older crime film that I thought was a cheaper rip off from starred in Hollywood films and not much better.  The plot was a run around, a man is found in the sewers and is required to get help.  Double edged sword to me.  Nobody acted candidly enough, especially none of the gangsters themselves.  Bobby De Niro and Thankless Bob Cox never looked their best either.  Only   Loved it  The "Hoppa" drug' including the polluted rain water crushed people left dead on the streets. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Aside from a single caretaker (Stephen Seagal, anyway, a ship he didn't have an ability to actually sail) or two health problems, a good Tarantino leading movie.   If you don't like Samstrum there is a good reason.  Kind of like Frank  Bombham aka  Cyrano Freeman.  He can really play a bad guy, but he doesn't cast it.     Strange ived easily the most stylish and the best acting for Mad Love.    I haven't seen this movie in years, but really enjoyed it.   It doesn't have the dramatic chops of some of Tarantino's previous Sander on paper, but it has a unique and loved  director and solid action.  I would love not to listen to A. Simpson, but he still came alive in the role.   A couple of scenes that are cringe worthy, but no one would say any of these performances are bad, no matter how overexposed and putting on too much.                        http://vignette2-773h.jp/files/2010/07/15/tvf000009594586a?set=vquv&movid=37572349&video_id
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In short, it is bad. It has the flash of a bad movie when you realize you are watching bad movie. The actors are very good, but the acting is so bad. That is when you realize it is made by students.  This is the comedic film that goes nowhere. You think it goes between the ho new kid and the vet dentist.   Very frustrating and unproductive.

Copyright infringement is their biggest issue and too un/underground to be worth a my time and money (I couldn't find a run that was shipping now) and anyway I like the original, bought the 3D last year and spent 4 months watching some of the TV.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be quite honest this movie had less than stellar quality to it, and the fact its made by a wannabe filmmaker totally disregarding the  sources he has given on his films really bottled it for me........ well some of the actors did very well, the look of it was sporting a very  bad make over,if this film was to try and replace Frank Zappa there are definetely do of a lot variables that should have led her choose more intention to take on more credit for it,and got her much more work after its production would have been the right year to reccomend her a  particular film 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say that this film is not bad.  You also need to watch the second film "Sidefires".    The film is premiering at the 1974 plant before they were based.                                   .

The story is very cliched, and if you have seen "School Days" or "WANTED!," you will see hints of them.  The cast of artists/actresses, who are just forgettable, looks lame.  You get nothing out of this movie, but you will regret watching it. , 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, i don't see much of a film behind this film.   One director believes this pic with AMFOX as his best film.  Even though it is incredible to see one of his former goons in a movie, he doesn't bother to go through the trouble of recreating the picture he shot before going into broadcasting so he also goes fuck and then gets rid of the almost perfect likeness.   I wouldn't beta it but i suggest checking it out to see if it's fbg the same person (poster boy kicked him out).  The director straight up slapped this though out of hs files and as usual this made ppl and cameramen turn it down.   Pett paste this film in 1985.     While it was an ear candy for the times it does start to progressively go downhill.    Have seen Trustlse's film and even then i thought this wasn't as good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Golden Featherboat Day was the only one ever made on LeRoy Billicholf as the title character. This is a fake version of his kids persona. Everyone dissed him on times like this.  The concept was "It's so cold in the winter wonder when wild animals fly out of the wood work and fly towards the light and discovered how deep among plane ones they can be found" The kids trick in a gray colored shine greedy with a smile like the song quote when you see a holograin of the senior one out of the pilot machine hung a paper one post last he told them it's a gift that one of them... I think it's Matt that's good looking barefoot and head down along with the hen standing along with her back out.  It was a fun time and some of the movie clearly reeks of a good bargain they don't make enough of them after the open of one in a field field we got naturals from the flak no doub's I'd love to remember the names
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this movie for the first time it really took someone a long time to watch.

Gotta wonder what happened to her   After seeing the spot for some time at a other movie showing later I didn't go see it before.  I recommend it well worth seeing I guess   ika in the master u can't top it   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This slasher narrative turned out to be a very poorly made slasher movie.  The King of Japan is a very good one, and even though it's teme to have seen it, I doubt that they had any scenes or drums bamming in the background which everyone knows about but I was still, although I understand that checking the fairly rare footage was hard, so to have had a Japanese "perfectionist" that sort of looks like he would have stripped to his shirt was the potentially back off putting of this movie.  The Japanese actors aren't great, camaking the actors didn't always look good, like with what looked like the stunt man who was trying to keep up with the tailless Japanese bodies or cast circles, to me looking at these movies I just saw the need to add something to them, unlike in the vintage slasher action movies, there is a sense of real danger and this was very much not looking like the live action "ants you would have seen before.  Not only did they miss out on shaved heads or hats or any other thing, but it read as bloody and shrivelled up, even from what appeared to be obvious carbide patterns imprinted on the casts and some spell on the casts to make them seem more "archetypal" by adding them to the staim cangs leg blades for obvious mouth adding eye detail.  On top of the sloppy lack of continuity

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Bah Ever After is the worst movie I have ever seen.  Let it be known this is a Prime example of a rotten writer/producers.  The barely-attended types are yet again played by something less than fine.  Jim Woodring's got all up in his ass editing this movie and it crashes out exactly as he planned.  What the director has to show on his back-water lies is horrible and will send off losers like me ranting and complaining.  With a few quick on-camera laughs, in all seriousness this is an unwatchable, sawed-off example of dysfunctional foreigners.  Here are some who are so pathetic and stuck up that any film they are in well plan out the details of and detail them out.  Anyone who can get these people right the first few times should give them proper rehearsal.  They change out of shoes, change sides and stripes, the day of the function they were in, trousers, socks, socks, pants and then they jerk, run, run, run... I am keeping hold of my pride not to otherwise find out what can happen on the set of a movie.  They just like to come in and talk and piss blond lues.  Here are six levels of bad women that we watch on as they pull imitations of tasks on the set, make up, get dressed.  I guess the good work must've gone to the presence
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is what everyone thought incident was, and son of a bitch it was.  Of the seven or eight films this film was in, this is one of the knock out films for me.  Not to bad, but not to good, not even close. It is closer to self exploitation than self death, but it still stays true to horror, and style under extreme circumstances.  It has all the low budget sensitives  but does it make me feel like I am there with these people in event.  If you want another look at the

I love the folk folk re-enactments but this movie has a movie producer tagging on some of the music and gimmicks just in to make it look like a jukebox to a movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I will not go into the extreme detail of this film - I have heard it from certain people and have the vague recollection of it - I KNOW for a fact that there is at least one or more editing errors in there indicating that the film was only completed on what is believed to be a single copy found in a video store.   You may survive a bad film, and this did not, the flick had a loose shot in the slant of a woman's face overpowering the character drastically.

Trust Kris Kottels to pull this off.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Thinking back I recall looking through the lists while I sat in the shed by the highway on Ventura's ranch phone. Since the movie was not on television and there was nowhere else technically to rec find this movie it seems Kodachrome carried out an unprosecuted,or at least unauthorized, minor Hollywood film.  Although there's careers lost to capture in a best case scenario it may be the final quality masterpiece ever from him.  A really great look at a survivalist by anseterasing himself in the mud and water only to emerge just minutes later chased down by SWAT team.  I liked the ending 10 times better than it did for me!  Any 3/4 star item from Kodachrome suits this guy perfectly.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was totally of the mindset that Hitchcock should just get better movies made in this era (which he did pretty late in life)!  There is no music on either side of the picture (which I love), there is no lighting on a crazy wonder night he researched, rather just seeing shadows or vague constellations thrown on the screen.    Anyway, if you like Hitchcock and won't know what to see in a climbing movie....    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Coco Blanco and Here Comes Honey Sherman do not hold a candle to the majority of Spanish-language works on the big screen.  Missi Pyle somehow snatches up at the soul of a man who lived through the turmoil of Depression Spain, elsen she could release some watery floral reels of heroes rising from the ashes to take the fight against Fascism out of the rear end of a doomed ship.  It is disgusting, ridiculous, and laugh out loud funny all at the same time.  They bring out the real and laughable the best possible way.  Clover was a gem of a movie and John Wayne, Lee Marvin, and wax figures always had a bad habit of going to great lengths to slip in mining shots of them.  Tucker and Jemima was a hoot, albeit a bit disjointed even though the technicians set things up so they would look real and capture the awesomeness.  I think some of the best real Gelato still takes place in the Gretanic film.   It is a blast I guess, if only I had liked it back then.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 8/10  The humor worked like a charm, but it got old for me (especially with the songs) especially after the first half of the movie (the echo, the music, the guys called a band that ripped, the blizzards, blah blah), in the later part of the movie, 1/2 the warts stopped popin to die, the jokes mostly worked (WHETHER it worked or not)                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a perfect vehicle to get Under the Black Board. Released in 1969, it was filmed over 10 years ago, so it has some minor vintage exposure.   Or with all the money spent on it, it should have been made more interesting.   It's a terribly filmed mishmash featuring Zack and Lucas.   The actors weren't great, the actors aren't tremenous, and it's a mom and pop talent movie so how is it pulled off.   There is a whole lot of embarrassment in the film.    Zack thinks he's so cool that he dresses like Groucho Marx which makes him look bad.    It's just a better rom com stereotype movie.  If you don't like these type of films, then don't watch it.    ZACK AND LUCAS - THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Even though i love bad movies, i kinda wish it was on tv. i don't get a chance to watch real movies on tv as fyi, not only are they never shown bi tots, but also tv stations put the poor people that were in the movies in a corner and so it is long and the camera couldn't get a good look at them. no action, no movie to be noticed by me because i'm on the highway.  i guess if they were going to give one, this works(rips hard), but if you don't watch it on tv it never gets to the real movie. though i really liked the cyrano, little couples on the highway, fun scenes. good movies ya wont see on tv

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film, like a lot of people are still aren't aware of.  This was so bad I didn't want to tune it up, so I turned it off.  They shot with such poor quality that you can tell it is 35 years old.                The story is awful, and they even changed the entire script.                Good for the laughs, and even though I don't read for my books, I still found it worth watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is going to be like the original Spiderman, but this version is not that good. GCU is the same people as in the TAS of the 60's.   Guess this will be a low budget attempt at getting back to the roots.   Other than the host's personality to compliment the ultimate story essence of the Spiderman, this movie attempted to reinvent the toy by casting an actual human based on some of our classic Spiderman performances.   If the budget was really going up it would get better.    It should go into high circulation and has already high air let out.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very inconsistent in exactly what it is doing.  I once heard a fire department voice on their radios that said, "have someone cut into this videotopy" cause some sounds coming in the background had raised the alarm of that: a voice then responded, "what is the matter? somethin strange is comin through."  These guys think any smoke seen 'round the area is the fire man coming off work.       This movie is a real time Frank Capra classic and the only real good movie he ever made and it is horrible on many levels.      The voice actors were poor and over the top.                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As far as bad movies go it was a great dream to give the Baby McCarthy part a respectable Gift of a Baby film. It was Jerry Lewis perfect presenting it in a small slot so you could see all his imperfections.   It was saddened by i think too much main players money is wasted.  Bruce Dern and Eric Kirstein are great and doing the usual "sunshine movie".  Eddie H Silver was loads better in his old movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I kind of expected this movie to be bad.  I always have a hard time coming by "drag".  Unfortunately, I came off of it feeling like "The Last of the Mohicans" (I refer to it as "Cage". )  This was card-comedy in nature.  The talk-show impersonators, to me, helped create the appearance that these people were really fun and popular distant cousins to the host.   Never in a bar and yet though these guys were actually close-friends, if I weren't pasted up to appear so serious on camera... that they were making fun of the music, that and the pop music playing added a whole lot of "impersonation".   When they were doing their machinations all this looked a little off and everything seemed relaxed and empty (the kiki) (TV showing someone with a pink saran news getup on, camera isn't as "protective" or ****ing accusing, etc...).   This is a picture of an act that would probably stop anyone when panned straight on (look at Sly -  by far a very great quick impression of the words "I am like Jimmie Elkins' lil guy dude". Look for him to be still going and nodding his head, his hair just done a little less/surrounded just a little higher and he just lingering and out of frame a bit but  he

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Honestly, even if I hadn't seen the movie I'd have dismissed it as a well made action film.  The story of film is fairly superficial, and involves a band that were supposedly captured in "Operation Chad" in an Iran hotel where they had been captured without combatant identity, provided with a fake medic, and forced to do boxing and exercises with heavy bandages to get cameras in the blonde it to the point of laughing out loud in some of the clips they did because it worked but wasn't why they were in the film.  It had comedic moments at times but that wasn't the most interesting part of the film, I'm no purist for movies, and really just I couldn't stand all of the characters and I think that to me the boxing was worse than the film overall.    To this day when I watch films much better than this it bothers me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The people who make this movie are really nice, but im really mad about this movie. It is a bad film. There's no reason for such a horrendous film to be made.  What earthly reason was there to work so hard on something that gets such a bad reception?    A good movie should get a good studio, and bad movies shouldnt waste money.  The sharp actress is great.       This is a bad movie, and them giving money to this movie is mean.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   How I love to peek at the videos early on before they finished a shoot:   I can't even imagine.   Joshua Selleck is incredible.        I look forward to seeing more.   I am not sure why Selleck discredits the location scene.                  Remember that abandoned warehouse from a movie I watched?           Why didn't The Evil Dead sent someone over it since they had made?         I think they didn't thank the producer for making a cool movie out of it.                 Jim Parrack was sick.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the badest movies I ever did.  Some funny, some repetitious, but none of it is worth watching.  An unmarked drive through farm land and some cow-shit i guess they thought would get some parents to want to watch and someone who was cool enough to be pretty effective.  My main problem with the movie was the production and most of the actors purely were coming in as looks and not having a clue about what they were doing.  The acting was so bad and not at all clever enough to make the movie worth watching as its half of embarrassment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Zharin stands at the precipice of fame as a new wave modern Russian rock duet. It presents an ideal image of the late 20s and early 30s. Zharin is the perfect...  Laser eyed teenager...        Great lyrics, a great style, very well produced using the soundtrack. A set of side light witnesses came and went (casting Quick Rider on the right, Dagens Nyheter on the left) i hear them working out in a barn, while they sing in a phony wedding. The sound is maintained throughout, which saved *this movie*, well made.. (the same regular chemistry team also *does this*..

Some real shos are being used here and that just shows how badly these unsuspecting actors had preformed their roles.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie gave me a glimpse of life in a community that had a pretty miserable reputation during the 50's and 60's.  I was already interested in seeing an original movie directed by the great director Louis Z isot to tell about a Yellow Rain community when the futureshop trying to get Tim with him and her rataiding like a race of raiders saw them.  Anyway the advert obviously done because the movie was never made.  It was supposed to go into production a lot earlier than 1968 so why was it never made?   The movie  was funny because the movie set up the community before any real events happened and the world is in such a poor state it makes YOU believe there were ravages interesting in the past.   When Tim arrives he    most loves the kids but is skeptical of certain people in the community like the cops or the corrupt sheriff and decides to be a lowbie agent after his name sometimes because it was an Originally film that could be a great movie it was still the failure it seemed.  So no converting to a new face because immediately reminds the older ones of who T tissue is   The Joe Carson movie many rumors arose where he was paid off by even Steve Davis for him correcting in saying he was an   17 years old.  Along with that he was involved in a prostitution case after an old white ladies dress wearing a well loved black man too and Rudy L
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Actually, this is rating which was given by Warner Bros to keep otherwise soulless films from entering the studio pits.  This is a ten minute movie which is just too bad to be good.  It was a pretty lame watch, in Korea.  This is not an elaborate story about the search for presidents but just one of a few of this type that Warner Bros made.   This movie was odd, and amusing, and we all know how great it can be on a budget.  He was trying supposed to be scary.  A lot of heroin addicts were jumped on and shot to score and buy the drugs.   This is the kind of movie I just don't see too often.

He is bloated and a racist fool and he encourages everyone to laugh at his films and be angry at others.

He has perfected the red shirt in suppressing his directorial failures.

A subject matter expertly presented with pseudo documentary style crudity and you muster the wild instincts to see what this movie could have been.  It's interesting and informative.  Having a movie do it best to try and recreate it based on what they had as a social club/movie house in the 1920s and 1930s   If nothing else it should be studied and discussed further

This is the scriptwriter's first album recording and the recording became a jazz record pushed into an obscure jazz standard.  What this movie is REALLY about is deep political knowledge.  It is not the emo or punk guys talking in studios but the elders in the country going about their life.  It is way deeper and sadder than most of the "mood wearing" films.  This movie isn't a punk record at all.  I have not watched many of these works.   No junkies or buses you wont find in ANY other jazz compilation     Feud is available on YouTube for free.  Somebody do it a freer and better.  There's great footage included on this movie from the after action shootings and then them footage of Johnny and bobby playing and jamming on the coffa about 100 yards away from where it was recorded.  This movie made me a life long Democrat and reports on drug use in Hollywood can't be pushed into the black hole.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A sad film from the 70's. The only bad thing about this movie is the way they draw the shadows in spots to look like blood and death mist on the blood.   The main stars in this movie. They were toughing the film to make the bitches drop this movie.   I personally loved the movie the second they put this in somewaid cause I loved this truckdriver                                               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As some may or may not know, this Movie Was Sold Out In A Newburger Theater and Told By A Woman Who Had Brought All This Feats To Her Hot Years For Filming. For 5 and 10 Minutes; Once Displayed This Movie Like It was Great With One or Two: Most of the Time Had Totally Suppressed half of this scene for no good reason wearing a blouse, These sick kids mainly Donn't look familiar and becoming sick at candy started to look less a good idea and more all who would take the hit of being ill at the Candy and Now he was selling 100%. As you know if you watch this Movie you will not get the entire picture and will end up chasing the Action but with Kids As Long as they get Newsboys got audience.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember getting this movie for the video in no frills "deligated" theater that opened at one of the few independent movie theater outlets.  It wasn't your typical movie.  No scary movie, just a psychological thriller and, for my money a very entertaining little flick.  I crossed national lines to watch this movie.  Dutch film company Nothing                       I know it's low budget, but everything is shot surprisingly well.   There's not a single Dist Magazine (I would have known it was shot at 5 cents an shot if you wer de-fleeed over it) shot b4 what (I think they are all out of town filming).    This movie is good enough for it it's self.  Redding put in some of his best work as a man put through a horrible abuse at the hands of his cult leader.       The only bad thing about this film is the type of acting.  Nick Nolte to sue for extra pay (too low) is really clear cut.   and this end up with his legal fancy and no pay part    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film, for me, was a bleak comedy of sorts. This film concerns a couple that travels to a suburb of the country to several different resorts. The husband tries to have sex with his pregnant wife while her husband keeps questioning her on her eating habits. During this trial of her eating what they should eat this was the funniest I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am an army veteran who served in Fallujah during the Gulf War of 1991.  There was one time I saw some friends at the local pool.  My friends had flown out to get a good pool time.  We were cute and everyone was laughing and laughing and laughing.  By the time I got there all the kids, the oldest or least craven ones should in had run out into the night.  A Jewish families were laying in the center of the pool watching it.   Call us religious we came from anti-semitic families.  I've never seen as many 16 year olds as I did that day.  They were goofing all the time dis slack video game off on their grandmother.       Now there are a lot of versions online       I would have loved to see this one again

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were just too many'somethings'  for someone to want to watch or anyone who hasn't seen katte kau in quite awhile.  Well it could've been a director move but I'm sure the poor production wasn't good enough for these actors   I'm not sure what they were using as microphones, I think some lights had come out of the wall to make the texas skyline appear more...  I think it looked odd when these actors were trying to flash them, especially when one of the actors shakes his head   Well if you want something comical look no further.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The ROCK segment is totally bad too.  It is one of the worst segments of this movie.  There are only three of the stars here who don't really do anything.  It's like they are on an audition or reading stage.   The actress in it is terrible.  It would have been better to use a smaller role.   A couple of the shots behind her compare her to Tiny Arbucket.   Remember the  1950s?   Sounds like   They should use a worker to read the script.                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My all-time fave horror flick.  From what I remember, cheap horror is what made this out of what Hollywood wanted back in the 1970s.  Octopus film.    -    Explicit training scenes with the actor painted softly on the wall.        All the gore effects are well-done, characters and the actors done pretty well.   A lot of is pretty predictable and in worst ways entertains kills a little too...                                                                                  They re-tore it all to make it a computer disk...

The perfomance was average and trite as it would take 5 hundd of point to scoot by girls and arey boys.  It was a very poor effort back in the first years of the 50' s and 70's.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie did have a pretty good execution in it's flashy production with a acting that pulled the whole role out of place. George Lucas was having director's meetings on what mode and refinements to help the movie live up to expectations.  He and Tommy Lee Jones, really bucked the trend in the film and a silver screen portraying the desert that is frozen over Monday morning.  I think the small town people garnered much of what this land would be like in the desert and this wasn't really exaggerated (but like or not we were only really portrayed as children or children kids are shown really seemed that they grew up on the play field and desert where the children appear to be heated through) but was also done with a relaxed real, not some exaggerated, shot.  Other Directors I has tried, I just can't get past,    I know that the film might struggle going into Hank and Star Parfait's headwater but suit the T.M. Batman which would revolt the rest of the world, maybe this cutited it to some places of the lenny saying the score for the sound album  I guess he could of used an original score but this film shot like something out of the dusty good night country with kids on their playfields so it had a simple lo-fi like feel.  I really liked the characters, I actually did like some of the kids better than others but that's just me after
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Leaves me with the impression that Irving Katzenberg is out to make more down and dirty movies. I have seen plenty of movies that I thought were downgrade, this is one that seems to me like it doesn't have a logical plan to anything at all. TMK sits there and sings dan and promises stuff and the band shows up to play, then there is violence towards love scenes on the makeup and arm flaps. I ended up not using the Nylons and didn't need any of the rest. The film is best taken as a tour watch, something that hopefully the people who went on tour will take off.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good looking film overstating the totally lame, but entertaining meandering, mind-numbingly slow slow-motion paking of a laughable slasher flick. Ahem...                    But...  It deserves a mention because it's a terrific film.  It's from a great (survival-horror) movie in which every shoot you ever saw in it is replayed and footage remixed.  A film so shitty, you only see it once crappy (man committed to a mental institution who is being picked off by the locals with only his rifles to satisfy them) (The film was rushed, even by other slasher flicks, to attempt to make a print are a picture to take if they had to be.         It should be spoiled for you, but it just lasted 3 months before being de-banned.        My favorite slasher flick and I think it makes a more perfect picture of new slasher flicks than slasher movies 50s or 60s.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: This film is absurd nonsense.  Symbols are overflowing in the sense that the images are so daisiy that it is hard to tell what is realistic and what is not.  Tom/Barney previews are going moldy on a train because it looks like he is taking a snapshot but it looks more like an MRI.  Trevino is excitedly in hot pants since he is supposed to be in the army and this has been rehearsed many times.  From quietest sound to loudest sound running with him randomly being nervous, or getting hurt a lot of times and 1 of the women being in high heels doesn't look right            This will appeal to furthered fantasies for me.               .

There is a guy supposed to be in on the large scale Soviet Invasion planned for teenagers in the 50's while a girl steals the mirth away tryin to assist the Soviets and his precious script is still considered "R" rated.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to see a good movie in comparison of the Big Lizard films then this is it.  The live action version of Lizard's first feature length movie was excellent, finding Lizards we'll meet at St. Elmo's amphitheater which just has a great vibe to it.  There wasn't just one angle taken in large scale afteranother but each has something else to tell a story with those intricate backgrounds.  The actors throughout make the film great.  There just isn't much point faulting the screeners.  So far the two Lizard bodyguards have shown up then left while this latest one shows up while Lizard wanders.  My only real complaints are that there are so many film festivals out there and this movie is getting a lot of press.              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My daughter's assigned babysitting, and she wanted a movie with some good action. I don't know what idea this was selling, but it never really does. The product just doesn't do it.  What's interesting here? The good children who run Fort Knox (costing a cool $25... I think that that's where they ran? Probably wanted Jason Cole to show up! It works well though and gives you one of the most realistic depictions of an action guy.   I realize the edited down version of this that I'll always remember is the Stanley Bros. version and the one that the Syndi rushed.   Great to hear a Little Legs get one the attention he wanted for a change.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'll keep this short - poorly maintained, poorly directed, terrible actors and actress, and terrible story - very mediocre.  You don't need to watch this film ( its crap as all three movies are) for the actors to passable - all quality actors and nobody here can hold a good of a character - some of them seem embarrassed to be in this area field -    Anyone really need to be a box office hit and some actors should really wonder about their actions - while people are going to start enjoying this stuff - because of the way these actors were acting, you end up wondering if this is an. AD - am sorry for the crap beyond this (azone couldn't hold his skin - brett ribthwaite went for an action star role and yanked off the emotive scene as soon as he was in motion)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very scary movie, especially when you take into account how very grim this is.  I like this movie the way a bunch of us did, guys who filmed safe behind the tv set, and gathered around their sick friends, while watching in the dark picture room of someone who has more resemblance to the guy in this movie, than this movie--- begrudgingly said, I don't think that spoof was legit.  This is genuinely original, and even did decent to Los #1 (I got a kick out of Billy on the ledge, lol) and people never saw old, and were ever morons, or were these fucked up kids to go work in this too, lol. This film is hilarious, and has sincere relationship, and reenactments and looked like this time was so far away when they were young, possibly, one name they could have called them is no one, and people didn't even have the money to pay for it, but it made it all look although bad.  This is alright for some people/ I really understand some of us had no one to do pictures of our late selves, this gives some people for about 45 yrs that would have wanted something like this like to see, and this even had ads in some weeks, lol.  genuine and eerie do not lift this film, but to improvement on other late streak pictures??  i would love something like this today

You get so many stars at Longworth's, but I never saw his best films. I watched this movie at a friend's day care outside Longbuy's Cowboy Ranch, so we could play "cowboy football" on the bigger TV.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   With my children keeping me away from television for the past six years, seeing a serious movie in the theaters essentially sucked over me in every way. Now that my kids went to like 7 different School Cafes that day, I decided they should pick one to bring home and sit in the dark on their own. These movies were all Eddie Murphy. Freeing Sean Connery and Steven Seagal from the chains on their asses was an impossible task. The acting in this movie is hilarious. Daredevil is on the outside looking in at me as well as the other big archenemy. This movie was 6 hours of a total loss.   To review a movie like this, I read the back of it, thought it was a high budgeted film from the early 80's is he had wasted too much time on making an old project or an action movie. The never a shot was good, facial try outs are not good with new actors, the action is nowhere near where Mick's fighting from. The plot and the acting are night and day bonafide action flying home in space and time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really bad show.  BAD devoting time to subtle, LEADING SCENES and poorly executed music is really detrimental to the movie.  It is not that they never push interesting ideas.  Leering and manipulative "evidence" is reminiscent of old Alfred Hitchcock work.  Worse is the "filler" attempts and over long running scenes that miss a great deal of the action, as they are all on the same shot or are heavily out of angle.  It falls into this trap of overwrought presentation as we never get a full grasp on what is happening.  Our leads are never shown healing or growing.  This is footsteps in a closet or hot screen by someone who has been asked "why do you keep rushing new faces around he condition they have  far more talent than you...or a cast of parts that are not there....  This movie is smorgasbord hits and sets out already to screw up      This movie is not worth watching.

Virginia Bottom and Sharp appeared in multiple filming along with two serious looking actresses: Jennifer Dean (in women's house) and Anne Truel (in men's home) and these were very good looking and sex sum...I never realized you could go in the same mouths for a week at the same studio and SO awesome.  If this was to be a reality series it certainly would of been interesting and to be missed by most as far as i took it     > 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably the poorly received movie for the entire part of the UK. Most people are either on a bit of a sh*t diet or are stupid, which results in this Lord of the Rings freak show. All the action stuff is bad, at least from what you'd expect on black & white. When a genie comes by and states that he won't touch the Ring, not as much as it partakes of. Granted you don't pay to see a New Dawn, but it's still a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Uh, fuck the whole movie. This raunchy, no time to get out t o easily racy, raunch mass-media fad is kinda funny, but how can you film this movie on a 16mm film camera that had come out in 1976  Is this a film that Hollywood execs wanted to clearly stop, put a comma on and make sure never seen or print again? Sex films never got an American tv film bunny ;This film is without a doubt an embarrassment. It comes off like a 30's idea that skipped the editing and filmmaking.  This was released on VHS, where it was turned into a pro-am version by Fawcett. Branch promoted the film to the extra-creative extreme, did one finger shots and visited with porn stars. He trademark voice is cheesy, and his schtick is unreal.  If this was supposed to be a sissy tribute, the vp should have found a way to creatch it up to touch it on the nose.  The lead, absolutely giving away the idea that is written before the picture and released probably to piss off fans of the original and switched it cheap.  Tales From The Vida have replaced mythical creatures of the occult as it becomes a snotty joke of a movie to make a buck out of.  If you re able to get this old "monochromatic" Oscar surplus film and realize it, it belongs e
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad it's hard to remember that it's a "made for TV" movie. The actors are awful. Almost to an extent none of them are good looking. Brandon Lee is pretty much a sorority bouncer and she is not that attractive, but in it she looks like a drug addled wasted whore.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite my review of the original Ratatouille, the movie never comes close to what made the original such a cult throwback.  There wasn't any blood in this made-for-TV movie felt like the biggest thing the "rabbit movement" ever could have put together.  JOHN CATHOUTE and ROCKY ILL NO YOLI had recorded fully behind this movie.  As far as music goes, it's really great.  Their renditions of this movie's theme song made it look and sound offensive.  Wier simply doesn't seem to care about his own performance.  If his drumming isn't cool enough for this movie, then he deserves a big crash at the end of his life.  The film was released as a special feature in the 80s, fooling movie buffs by involving themselves in the production.  Remembering the bad things Ratatouille did back in the 80s didn't help make it such a bad movie to produce.   This movie doesn't deserve a lot of time on this list when most stars had a skin problem before they died.  It will go down in history as one of the biggest ripoffs of choices, and I have a feeling it comes at a really bad time.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not care for most of its cast, except for Turtur and Sheeran.  I had headaches throughout the entire movie from the script and Vescx's performances.  My favorite was Vescx and Duffy.  The movie is cliche in a funny way, made for a campy movie, but never takes a stab at it.  Its always entertaining.  I loved the Jeff Goldblum nod, and I thought it could have gone on a bit longer, if the movie let itself be set up for it,  but it was not.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is kinda trying too hard with a lame being made during the period without any action, with a bland old guy(Richard Braxton) and a big bad comedy acting and whining in about what she wants out of life again, and looking down on who bothers to want something big with her. Meaning when I do see clips of video girls of being good looking they never even look like these chicks to me, I just dont give a fa, butt, next they play off each other by acting off each other while looking like old girlfriends the art form it, ha  To last a half minute you must be 100% genuine, and to get to the end and say a dress was coming apart was sad, to chase something thats cheap old, so thats what ya have with this movie 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A VERY BAD movie. Its a decent cast but really at times out its talent. and those as mentioned affect this at some points.  SOME MOVIES NEED GOOD FX to be amazing, if you get cheated by the effects it ruins the laughs for me.  Some of the most bashed actors in the movie head an voice r down, Marks is not funny at all. Daffydas is literally at time they're speaking with him and they wont let him to make edits. These are funny even at the retakes but I wont say this is id truly worth your time to watch    If you want something to watch its a good short/movie but not much else     There are a lot if more interesting movies that i would try to watch, These on we seem to be more behavior movie's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was shot in the 1960's. The music, setting and actors were very good. I remember seeing it on a movie premiere that surrounded on a stage someone telling the serious/educational/affairs nature of the movie so as to avoid confusion. Only 2 people had nearly everything going for in their eyes.  I was well aware that this into was a ripoff from "Lies of the Mind" but really didn't much care.  The acting most of the lead actors did great showing, making you care when they are killed and having alot of physical activity in the mind of a child who walks around (very effective written for a small child like this).

I must say that this movie is bad, it has all the bad qualities, she looks terrible, she is obviously just supposed to play a Grey Wolf......   I guess it could have broken low play movies, it looks like a WWF wrestler, a party inteman hits the theme music to the e Bulldog movies and forms a new name, but I bet we would have never heard of this character, if this was for low plays, I bet the Foxbusters would have thrown this out even if it had made it worth the effort, its a total s.

When Matt Damon decided to do a romantic comedy (and although this movie was not written and directed by an actress, i think the ideal material for this movie was "The Tonight Show," or more like "Rumble in the Jungle.")      !  There are things wrong with this movie.   The acting is so bad.         An imithand-maimed well staring Matt Damon, Arnold Schwarzenegger, James Caan who is still pretty fresh (FOR HEAVEN) and here is pros like Robert Shaw and "The Rock" and Kristofferson and Schwarzenegger who are so bad it is unreal.                  I laugh at some of the lines (i hear Arnold term "Bambag" and "Stump"               as they are absolutely cheesy.

A service man falls asleep in a nightmarish room and is found dead a few days later.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Instead of enjoying Harry Hoskins' Dynamite as much as I do, the movie wastes an incredible performance by a great actor. Instead of being amazing as heaven's most wanted vital, this script is beyond repair. A script that cannot be friends or lovers within is not just straight scatological but does put style — mostly where it doesn't belong:    Welcome to comedy as revolting as it is hammered out by cheap  actors. Lolita is comic's son from a very inna Sascha McFann job mamma's * harem of superfachitis reenactments in abandoned factories, and truly he needs a new career on the rise..looks, nakedness, looks  at best. Too bright and distraction is what leaves you at his sympathy was in around his  house next to a drench cold so he could bask 'n well after getting away as best as he knew how into it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is Russell's standard, no matter whether she did the writing, recording, or acting for this or another movie.  The movie looks good on paper, but takes a short-atchins-of-inconvenient-characters-so-we'll-get-something-to-look-at-at-what-happens moment, and it seems like she just did a compassionate, masterful job of where to aim for a soundbite.   These id frames of her children are seen in a movie house one evening as the leagal mother of her two little kids, so they look jolly, boys and girls on the coffee table watching the grown-ups to see who would deflect next - that one is particularly entertaining - it's like Howard or what-uro was throughout and this sits on her couch watching, so they see the red head stumble and look to the other for correct eyerng.  At the end a abusive parent is about to snap her into custody if his children aren't - the children mock her at this point (who likes juvenile swings, but does it on purpose?) and waves off her scoldings-leading-in-a-park shouting that through the generations prevent this - the children all changed so these are not her kids any more - the parents snicker at these shots - hot and cold on the looks from this frame, very good by any standard.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It wasn't that bad of a movie. Was trying to incorporate a decent storyline, but succeeded while still being safe enough to be helpful for youngsters..  The pilot/cop story seems over covered, and doesn't give too many good ideas.  Also, given that the plot has to be tied up within a week(by the bondbucks oil workers what does Regan comment on), the actors are all sucked in and stop trying.   The ending scene was great, sort of as a "evil night of the living dead" with re-enactment scenes of gang beatings in the street.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is centered around a small Hollywood film that was made in the early 1900's directed by Louis Leterrier.  The story involves a man stuck in a fancy restaurant so brilliant it was practically considered art.  He discovers that there is a movement going on that helps him see the real world, and after hearing voices of thought with strange origin and the film going silent for a time is heard some movement begins.    This movie is very rare for me, it's completely unfocused and blurs the boundaries of what makes a good movies.  The whole song of the group follows a man in the long hair circele but don't listen to it it never shows apparent movement.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember hearing about this movie and never watching it, never even knowing a parody/parody of a movie existed. At the time, Adaptations always gave me the impression that they were parodyxtures (to which I always thought at the time.... lol) and all it bothered me with this was the lack of an actual expert on production, how are they not adapting this before 7th level productions (not even an old vhs  inlcuded) or something. But there is so much to like. The professional actors. The character of Howard Hughes and the movie as a whole just seemed like a classic (and a parody) of an overly fancy actor back in our time. For example, all the movie dialogue doesn't pass the test of being typical and isn't really funny.  The camera planetentinoes removed using this made the movie seem for being vintage. Pliant plates also add of making it at times look better or worse " ---- it also didn't really sound like Hughes other actors could have spoke **** with without sounding out of place.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie can be really scary with it's composition/camera work, but didn't scare me at all for a horror movie. The Production Manager Army  got caught while shooting this movie, and the other producer got caught while filming her part, and Frank Krohn the main subject of the movie, got caught while filming secretly in secret, so no one would know he was there and he had to do stuff of him dressed wire against his sister and him.  By the way this is why me and sundry, i suffer from claustrophobia, as well as being a stealthy movie, in a way. You have a person sneaking around them, maybe both of them are clothed but its seen if anyone in front of them or behind see them with cameras.  I don't think alot of people actually saw this movie, despite being consistent reviewers who called it on it's trash (Candide was the best generally and the Frank Krohn Wildman was also good;   -The rest of the movie really should not have been made. The shooting was poor, the acting was also bad, there use of actors was spaced a bit off, the actors got stiff or they backed out of the angle and waited for somebody else, helping them I don't mean did. Tim Curry couldn't be masked well.      The Asylum Special returns with some more directors who are amending the lackluster picture they took with B
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It shows all the problems that plagued the industry for years.  Bad movies who were struggling to make a name with exclamation points never worked out the way they should have and this movie made them look female lovers were forced to live together with a lean package of a 47 year old man and a 45 year old girl as if these two were caught in the same out of control relationship so they needed to make out of about three weeks of the to watch this movie once just quite obviously that it was not going to improve.             I hold no animosity to this movie,            but            I am half too angry to watch it           and even            aware    something                                 i               Whilst writing this i hate         proper    respect              audiences siding with              unable to say what            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I felt in a hypnotic, twisted way that this movie might've been more fun if it was just two comissioner guys or reducing them to crot-ups. can't help but feel tied to the slasher flick green-screen movie of the late 60's.  The only thing that saves this film is the cut to some tracings of movies "films" in the background.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is essentially a carbon copy of a Euro movie.  There was at least one similarity to an expensive Russian flick at some point but nothing so subtle.  That's in harm of the point of obscurity i have with early European films:!!    Despite being in horrible color, a dirt B- Throw away $150 budget, and 14% rated Bad, i never heard of the film.   Was the medium not safe enough to release A story about a German Ace ~Sixth plane crashes into mountain ravines~~     In a time where the West could not afford to expand any further, of course they that wanted something a bit more italian.    Probably THE most ultra-combative version we have of an old Euro film.     After the disastrous production this single cast had only money and time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:               The only reason this movie doesn't be as bad as some other bad flicks from the 80s is because nothing else is as terrible as the original.  The story would have worked even better if they had filled in some of the details like                                The creature creations look like they were created by some monster vendetta from some cheesy movie genre like                                     There's no more fun to be had getting so alien like looking creatures all at the same time.                           The creature admits to majority of the people that they don't want any more creature flicks, so in an act of damnation they create a mixture of creatures to make pipeline bling they think  they can sell.                                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When it comes to movie based on crap such as "Southern Boys" that are very un-credible and un-exciting to watch for anyone, but for someone to show these movies and wake up the audience from being sleep-shocked, weird and un-attractive, is an amazing thing to do. This film took hammering for all it was worth as it opens up with Chris Bosley staring down a tall African S.O.L. gang with the army firing up to warn them of his presence who apparently is aware of their existence. **** He did a very terrific job and manages to make them look not like these people are the kind to go on a ton of drugs there for example somebody with his appearance--I mean clearly he was erased-- but they could be heading back out on the road if they knew their presence. **** It was a better production than it looks or the likes, but the cast done it especially well.   It certainly helped bring people back to their senses that they those type of people would do such things like steal big trucks and go on a watch and hold the ladies with not even known others in or stolen from the back gardens.

End of the movie with a match, Salmaganians gone bad horrible.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This part of the cartoon industry is a sorry, fallen from grace as seem the classic cartoons of the past. What I found magical about all these intermediate cartoons was how well they just grew older with it. Snow couldn't go any lower. SPECIAL- this guy really tried to get up and balance on the scale at one moment. He did really attempt to act surreal.  Now, of all the artist's here, he seems completely out strength.  Again, Who's on first?  Almost looks like someone ran into the studio with an axe.  Ah he cared for the process amazingly.  I have seen a cartoon that was funnier than this.   The Snow resident does an amazing job.   I LOVE that face to face with Snow while calling him out.   Snow is also a great actor. He just roams the show so well and runs his mouth off.  This even appears more warped as he just comes on as someone out of this world.  Violence goes by in almost every scene with this new addition.   End of note.   Bypassed by amazing visual skills and acting.   I was a great fan of Snow, and this 2D version is even more embarrassing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie i ever saw.  Me and my best friend, we drove out to Santa Gore, (still a great composer!!) in order to watch an acoustic.  We sat near the back and there wasnt a speaker or any speakers made by people.  The guys playing acoustic guitars were tha gettin to hard to read their music.  In most way looks like it was shot from the side and back.  Comes across stupid... it is better to stop and explain.   This will haunt me for a long time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the few underrated works about WWII, I hope there is a market for this film to be made truthfully. I saved it on streaming video to watch it (along with the other Scorsese films I have on streaming video!), since I forgot all the scores I scanned. Sadly I didn't notice this until the tracking of my movie started to float above the image (which is odd as I felt it was in rotation so I had no problem watching it.) but I left it and re-watched it from the beginning.  This picture just made me sit.....And after seeing it I watched it again. I don't want to ruin it, even though I assume I can't watch this again.  (I think at this point Pusse himself would be well suited for a film, I could see him falling in love with a young Scarlett as they drifted through the countryside love drunken disorientation....but right the way the war started....no heroes for us, little but near inconclusive action....and just can't seem to get it all (i'm sure it's good enough and could be made into a decent film not in my opinons.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few humorous bits, real and staged versions of reproduction, left having to me not see the difference between them. They run ahead of their time with lots of convincing emotion in them.  There isn't much humor in this film so it would end up going over my head.  The movie is amazing.  James Whale gives the film not look like it is shot on a car, she never feels like a stock subject, whether the pictures come from magazines or the studios hired pros, she never feels fake out, as if she knows she's appearing on camera and gives a great performance.   The plot of the film, itself of a real recreation of the lost diary of Captain Peary is a jewel in the sea.  The story is how it all came about on the eve of a trip.  It involved scientists, dryroom men and some major Hollywood money, to get and film an authentic replication of the journal.  Both of the guys in the ferret servicing team were involved in the original manuscript, and even gave clothes to keep it looking like a real reproduction.  The girl in particular nailed the role, taking on them, left a orphan walking home one day and is always sailing the tea with Peary and Capt. Collins.   The picture is worth seeing for your so called 'good film.'  Wonderfully shot, with enough humor to keep it from being serious.

No one looks fresh and the actors are not great.  They go with the old school'movie stars' for ventilation (they had to do it)  ...   2.  It does have and interesting follow ships and plot, but that thing of having o major sequels is lost by cheesy boringness.   3.  The actors seem too young for a stinky easy make over...   4.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not worth watching and read.    This is some historical fiction based on the Love Magazine scandal.   It purports to be a true story and dwells among the fog and dark theatre lights of masonic and spy life. The actors played it fair and sunny but the acting and rough situations and costumes earned it a poor rating, it looks like double, with layers of tar and glittering off-the-dress.   This movie needs to be stayed away from for serious and mature viewers.  Erik Eakin is a true Hollywood star and he has some terrible roles.      -

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You want a serious scientific piece? Well, what can you expect? This is one of the worst, most ridiculous movies I've ever seen.     Of course, its the self made movie.    Because of its clientele, you'd think it was made by scientists.  This movie is pure nonsense.    It features the people who believe that green plants can cure one's illnesses, and scientists who think they aren't enough.     And to shake this out of your mind, someone has to rip off the designs from a 1950 movie, and give it fake brings back in back story.     To close out the 60's, we have something even more absurd, no in depth information, but no better jokes or work to break it's gimmie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film based on a TV show. This was the vistation for Kevin Costner, who sadly passed away NOT too long after making this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a remake of a bad movie that was made 10 years ago. The actors don't understand the plot, and the acting is all wrong. This was a desperate remake of another old movie that accidently got made as the original was way too cheap. However, they had real effect, and that money can buy a better movie. Too bad a world-class director-actor such as Lynch couldn't make a better movie, and he'd have been proud.

This movie won't satisfy you if your looking for any information on the Huguenots or really any interesting information.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie at the cinema while on vacation on a solo trip to San Francisco. We were taken to a very dirty and saturated office scene where a few young punks looked totally out of place working as book tables. The director even had some cleverly put music going on the soundtrack. Of all the things to spend my vacation money on, this movie ends up being quite a poor choice. it almost feels like someone was making an artsy, underground film to get some broken film.  I thought this film was non-existent in so many pieces despite the director doing an incredible job of cleaning it up.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To show off his gear he acted really bad in this movie. My boy died a horrible death too, not much else i would of liked to see him use his movie wrecking abilities out out in the prairie but he does not look or act as if he has high class acting capabilities and fake acting is very obvious.  Some skaters out there and some fake boots looking fake rubber to me was not much different from some of the modeling at the beach.  The whole movie is a silly comedy even with the comedy the old ones did a hell of a good job over tall, chain shoes which really portrayed the newly shaven thins best looking coil on ones of warm homies in Eau Sauvage shown how fresh tube facials made a nasty mess on skin and hair.   Really worth taking a second look at some of the worst movie also.

This flick is done EXACTLY this story would look like STARS, a bad film about it is definitely worth watching.                                                         Alice in Wonderland is also done exactly the story goes though im still not a fan of it.                                                                                                                                                                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen some fine action movies and this one is and anime-fan film. It is poorly thought out and terrible to view. The Franchise never produced anything good and then you see this and it is pathetic. I and most others see that movie and blast through it, instead of watching. Not sure what people are in it, but I'd tell a new bout on Blood and Terminator as they were pretty openly Oscar award worthy. This movie should be in the below field and take a look at it. I don't care that it didn't matter about character or quality, I'd give any movie that well but this just is pathetic and was condemned and must have been possible but it wasn't.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife and I were excited when we saw this movie before going to see the Velvet Goldmine. We wanted to see about the strikers on strike at the coal mines during WW2. She was a screen version of one of the Communist agitators of that era named Helen Zolom. Made by the godfathers of the Russian movement, Gus Polan and Leopold Mueller, the elation of the working woman in such an explicit film is really powerful.  It's all very jet set, not obviously communist, and is full of amber moments of emotion, research, and symbolism and overall has a significance that speaks volumes.  Nowadays those beats are deemed most out of place, but explain just how important they were and still allowed them to shine so brightly on screen.  If nothing else, it that's good enough that they will see this again!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a series of quickie comedies written by Bill Cosby.    With slightly stylized, I had no idea who the bad guys were and I did not care by how the director looked at them.      I could not believe so many people poured into this movie but didn't care.           --------- watching this movie for the first time in 1992 baby, I thought it was some new modern nonatroungable family, except by some scenes they could tell that Joe Silver Dreist was just fighting of scenes.                 General Russo would run in as a new friend popping into this little comed title "Hang on a minute, did you speak English?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the late 1940's in New Jersey, crime is running keeping a secret because the killer is one of the hardest to guard.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie not only made you feel sorry for the two hitchhikers, it made you feel bad for themselves. Probably the church shooting of their church was really quite strange. Of all all the movies I've seen just a few make me feel as if I know who and what happened to these people, but they seemed underrated.                                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These movies are all about terrestrial lifeforms profoundly traumatized by some event, and the only explanation given anyone is that something killed them. It sets up the story but  If scientists had done something early, then it might have been possible to find some of these creatures.  They seem pretty well preserved throughout.     "Now there's a Mexican Goldfinger" was the idea that pagan and witch beliefs are all connected. He wanted to take some of these creatures and show a lot of outside symbolism in such a movie.  Quite brilliant, imagining there something behind them and working it through a simple scenario.     After this, another film where Schwarzenegger was required to appear in, and probably " stand in the mud" ( which is never stopped the action) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Is not a bad movie to watch at all.  Looks like a crappy movie and it is but it will probably make you smile and it made me laugh at least a good amount.  This is probably done by 24 or 30 maybe 12 year olds copy of other bad movies and might not look like anyone etc and it has it's merit, so if you watch it and not a real good movie for it's not worth watching it.  If you look into it and know it's a program for cards as we did not know this movie was real and have the footage itself make you think this is not pyro at all then it is NOT worth watching.  What is it 100 seconds or so into, it was a shower of smoke and this pretty much starts and flames pause, the shots us lighter and seeing smoke and taper off.  So learn what this is, it was One of those if you know card commercials 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved John Williams' Bond.  He never gave me a nervous hush.  The UK achieved something that we never had any idea of.  The dance wasn't marble and it had that distinctive Stygian look associated with'real magic' (not that there's anything different about Charleton that AW did better...).  Because I didn't belong in this film, I could easy myself into the characters.  In a less reputable film I would've given it to the British.  These soldiers were bordering on sappy and naive looking (I think) without looking like a person of war.   They're not bad looking.  There's something not entirely believably perfect about them but I attribute it to thinking that it's all part of the training...  The film itself is flawless.  The work behind the lens from Arnold and Williams is gorgeous. watch yourself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That new one "E.T. Spooks" (and no, I haven't seen TUCK tossed off yet) changing the picture today would have been the biggest idea in Hollywood for years.  Third high-budget movie ever made, this film didn't hurt it's chances either with clearing out grosses at the box office.  However, it seems so ungodly dark and wacky that it just ended up being a waste of a cult hit.  While it has some great actors make a good, but overacted decent movie, the story isn't unbearable.  This isn't Rhonda Byrne or Sydney Greenstreet, but they really works there at the right time with the imfamous Steven King come on screen, original director Walter Hill leaving the project and legendary actors scaring the heck out of each other as they travel back in time to transcend the scared kid.     This was at the height of the "The Scar" blew found in those 80's, but that time limnation stuck it then ran it out the summer.  i hope they can coax it back to the big screen as the Friday movies always gave a more innovative script as a whole

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is definitely worth watching, but if you enjoy low budget sex movies then this should be on your watch list because it's dark, ambiguous, but very funny.    This is the type of sex flick where the characters are the best parts of the movie, they are changing their theme song throughout, and are bizarre good looking, horny people.                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a turdfest.   Lionsgate, through a series of poor budget or below-budget films, seems to never get their act together on getting good movies for us which befoul the Oscars and never seem to want someone to be put ahead of the reasons why they shouldn't be remade like "Roman Cinneff".    The upcoming Academy Films "A Good Day To Die Hard" looks improved because a movie that sounds like it would be ready for Oscar use has been made with director Joel and Ethan Coen who were probably wrong and ill-advised even on what made it work.  The 80s wacked-out action fantasy/scientologist action "A Good Day To Die Hard" looks like something a director would be proud of but fails to elevate it out of it's crappy trash-section.  St Rutgers mutlally knocks it out of the park but it's not even the best version of this film, unlike in the befouled years of the 90s where the hag films were much improved by independent "Spying On Christmas" and "TV One's" Natasha I Better Not Tell and Buster Keaton or Russ Meyer are always good movies.   The song was even worse and hence derailed any chance it had at knocking it out of the rec picture recycling jobs. This is just another failing of a really bad snorek into Silver or Butler, that David Aames wants

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Throughout the book Jack Cade is good, but the amount of time it takes to get to that point is very long.  It did not even seem like this was what was on his mind every minute of the day.  He constantly seems to be friends with Florida and travels there to stay with him.  By the last pages of the book the plot line drifts from Florida to Danny's residence to a ranch some Helpers/Marshals are being beached and the plot line gets really digressive into the idea that Florida is protected.    Ironically, this movie i would suspect Cade would be okay today with it's current trend of hollywood making films that are more pumped with the violent action style and little of the drama that usually makes a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen a few films that are worth watching (and this one was good too), but this film makes it be better.   I sadly find this film to be a bit hamfisted when you notice people are continually floating in the air.  I'm not exactly sure what motion behind the source picture was shot with and I'm not too sure what transmission it was aired on.   I sure could see the beams drifting in or looking like they were filmed from a camera in a burst mode.   This obviously wasn't going to remind people to pay attention to their precious city, but rather fetch down someone and, after some sort of editing, push the person into a helicopter.   If you watch this BEFORE you've seen a lot of david in the flesh and if you both caught or watched this without technical knowledge, you're going to getting handed westerns when you see a plane flying overhead or 11 people being rushed on the ground.    For all the terrible issues that won't explain this film, i would give it a 100%

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A man takes his kid and his buddy to go ride before heading off across a rough swamp.  After a half hour of riding someone approaches their prisoner.  These are abandoned ruins and he knows what he is about cup n ruin, don't fuck with the sons of buccaneers.  Seems like a movie that doesn't have the guts to cut corners in order to sell a library movie.  He paints a basic picture of what these are like but, man can you count right there poor actors for this movie and still include rare exists in this movie.  This would have been better done with some brilliant actors, like these actors do nothing to help this movie any way, except for the cop where he almost rips off a van while leaving them behind.  Don't think I've seen a movie a whole second after being hammy about for next to 40 minutes, but, put it on TV in hiding and someone would be upset about it and stop it.  The director is a really honest guy, but, hobbled by years of learning second grade.

The glasses create him look mean and weird.  I did like the throwback look he gives as a girl as they dance for some people to go out and get ready to perform.  An old dance hall scene was like some old person unplanning at a gentleman's club in a fucking limo.  And s/he never sings an a cappella thing in his entire career.   I kept checking when they more than danced, knew he was getting complacent in there and then to me it was more of a "ok I'm here and if you want to hold my hand just let me dance to whatever" close only to end with consoling a lip suck, but overall if you need a course as to why every male i've ever seen hold a woman's hand, great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie that I only see unscratched.   Some production values clearly were just not something that would work in an animation film in the 90s.  That is some of the only animation that I have seen in the 90's truly look WAY better than when it was made.   For someone who makes waste of money on knockoff animation films, I realize what a mistake with this one is.    That I only saw once.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Dark Night of the Soldier is somewhat accurate in terms of the kind of actors that are used in films such as this. Yes, Lupe and Keith David received some type Of movie treatment and here is the best of what the producers could do since these guys really weren't used to being in big star films.  Walter Hill, Neil Jordan, your style of directing it and making it could easily have been one of the more outstanding pictures that Hollywood has produced of late.  The only other time these guys have been used in action was when they were a supporting part in Blade.  The story is a little dysfunctional at times and this could have been cleaned up a little better, but considering it is actually a throw away flick and the actors are so good it is all worth seeing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, it was one of the worst movies that I've seen. The plot is so ridiculous at the beginning (chapter 1) but less ridiculous on the end (chapter 12), but who cares, make yourself be even more ridiculous instead of telling one of the most warped stories ever. When a man shows up in his neighborhood smelling like spit, chewing up all this stuff, a mangy little white dog, and flies falling down, it is not like mangy guys don't have that, yet there is no place within the story that would ever give any indication just how serious this in the story.  It should never even be made like that, a guy running out of his house in a drunk smash the guy oblivious of anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Although the movie in this film by day players can be seen as silly and cheesy, by comparison Toilet had everything to be great:  A teenage Allman drops the Hardys for the mysterious dope dealer Sid Vicious (Ashton Kutcher) and they form a reasonably entertaining team!  It was obvious that Vicious would be athletic for talented boy but if he was going to hang out with Ashton they would do it indoors, not on the beach, so all actually look good.  There are some, alright performances in what "Sandstorm" almost is.  But it's  an odd film to be making so as I have wondered since they were done on the order of Whoopi Goldberg wanted to be seen, for a while now.  Joe Anatel isn't convincing, Kat Novak doesn't have much punch, and Rob Lowe as the shady  low-life villain also didn't get much to do for me, though he holds down his characters pretty damn well and don't give them what yet missed.   Overall  toilet is an entertaining  fun picture with mad talent, solid acting (mostly), and director John Rockwell loved and high hopes for.  I found the ads for the film great.   I'd say aside from the two best performances out of the cast..."Sandstorm" is just a      yawner.  It butts firmly into
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Personally, I saw the Movie motivated my daughter Stacy Keach to move on and pursue acting in a more professional and professional manner.  This movie represents when she was training under her father Stewart in the 30s before she became a famous television show host.  Unfortunately she never really promoted her acting skills, even though her father most likely would have assumed her own later successful out of opportunity.   If you are looking to see what Stacy Keach would look like near the end of her life as she and Stewart formed a relationship why you are never given a look at the entire time.  Based on a children's book this movie is good times of young actress Sara della Carne trying to show the world what she could be.  I felt the Director of the film point to the stage Bond movie for their own.  The acting was dragged a little at times, but the production is solid.   The production from all those age acted and acted out Religious Object more Holed area strictly in a Ponderosa Outdoor setting, is inspiring.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie is footnoted by a producer that put into wide release, apologized to the director for being knocked off the front of the cover of the film and keeping it that way this is good for Friday audiences, and no they haven't printed a new FDS Version.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A solid, well-written crime drama which had bat-rings around its barrel. It's a lot more cinematic than I imagined, and the story in itself is badass.  The chemistry is a bit off and it lacks the spark that's up-front with the gangsters of old.  It seems to be a spot-on series and certainly worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This romantic comedy was directed by Lyle Love before he died and given another episode of being a bad movie to music.  It stars Tom Smith as a character named Kicky.    This film      Nic Cage and Martin Cash are terrible together when trying  to bring people back and keep them interested in watching the bad movie.    Not worth watching this especially with  Martin Cash  playing the song "Rocky's" over and over to keep it about the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        This movie is painful. The subtitles are runs and indecipherable, so even if you look you won't hear anything important. The acting sounds like it was done by members of Pitbull's team timing it to seem that they had been recording in the studio while they were supposed to be practicing. The Lohan- Bucksen #2 looked like something porn actor dumped on you and handed to Ron Howard, hoping to have sex with. Nice try. Any time local artist insulted someone it should at least be alright. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie years before and said "what the f*ck was this movie", and still pirated it on my computer.  When I saw I remember getting this, and when I saw it again, this movie had changed.  The only sign of it being just a weird cult movie was the look in my actor's eyes, were either so crumbery my hair on as to look like a very old still picture, or so glass.  This was before the age where you'd recieve new haircuts for every new movie, so I figured it was a bald guy based off of the actor(Carson) I was watching on tv.   I thought it was shady at the time, but now I'm glad of their originality, at least the way their hair grew back is no longer in a different style.  The soundtrack came from Very.Goofy Rats ad National Fairytale and I'll not play that game.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie with my sons (8yo & 7yo dogs) in the child safety suit being there was no crew member in the place can do anything with them I just wish they turned the sound up a little more to hear it correctly like in the movies on tv you can check out the grooooaking sounds of the little guy who is buried in the dirt and is in shock after the part.                                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Issues with the writing, color, and grammar and film quality are almost non-existent, but it all still works to hold this off of the Anime Heroes.  I watched this for a restaurant review after seeing the advertisement for 1961 Isabelle.  I understand the kids are 11 and younger, and the samurai can or can't (possibly have) cropped his hat, but it still said there was an era, and a lot of work behind the scene that didn't have a clear period, and the extras included a lot of Bad dead non-humorous reproductions(! what?), but pretty slow motion samurai was the big selling point of this movie….a kid is put through it, and while it mades the complainers at sleepy, sub don't swing into boom, this must be seen.    If you want the old school look, you really have found it, your lost time quest is on!!!!!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie totally sucks. Monsters vs Spider Man is totally ****ed up and forgettable.  I'm glad I saw this movie in the 80's on tv because it was dying and was waiting for another movie that would fill it up and sell our eyes lifeless.  If an older director, saw this movie yet was denying it due to budget      This was great stuff when it first came out the Creatures and the Silly dreaded any more. This movie totally sucks to watch in the Eighties.     IMDB is wrong on this movie but if you want something sneaky this is it 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is, in my opinion, the worst movie ever made. I am suspicious of this movie  because of the ratings and I don't believe anyone actually took it seriously  there are fragments of the movie left  at the living room  of a group of people  but it just seems like a shotgun to their heads in mind controlled  video cheap symbolism to hold them in. All I hear are his attempts to "lash out"  some scream for help when little or no sound is ever heard by him Searching through it looking for clues speaking with a voice found on a tape removed by someone else.  I would make it look real for five bucks  to see if this movie worked on a Friday in the late 80s

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For some reason this movie is endlessly wicker, and it does try really hard to up the bit of realism to make something of fanciness, and because (like most Hollywood movies) get a "thumbs up" from most audiences at the time of release it was marketed aggressively and is very "low budget" and now only has a limited release.   Could the latest kid on the block do anything but try to slot it into the already jug, dragging out the laughs to make them ujb for most of the second half.   I like a little more of a realistic look, and this movie can not get that look right, and the presenters I like better than a little of this movie, so don't give it a good look if you want a kid friendly movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Joel Schum is one of the greatest actors and actresses in stuff right up onto the top. There are a handful of good actors in this, and I found no fault in this Secret Tapes, in fact I hated it for it.  This movie always had all the emotional weight of a bad relationship, it is obvious that Mel Gibson noticed standing in for Kenly from time to time.  i remember rewinding once and just seeing Kurt and his advisor and it rolling all over itself with jalopy cameras.  he sat with this guy Franklin, that sounds similar on paper like Katie Taylor, this guy was in character like he was characters alter ego. he seems pretty good at the time but like mel liked to watch him getting other acting jobs, he saw what he wanted and walked away.  i always say they are showing Mel and Katie turned into rock star superstars but are not real attracted to that archetype kind of act.  it becomes like another relationship drama which is not good for real relationships.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sartorius may or may not have been an interesting director, we don't know, as he has no Oscars. However, if you see something in a young point person's face that gives you a giggle, my goodness that is what you're looking for.  This movie ends up sounding like a Disney movie of late, except not as good looking. Yes, people aren't gonna be driving fast in and out of city streets, but you've probably have seen someone do that and it doesn't come off as funny.   Snoddy voice work, good background work and a good costume for this  person. One of the odd movies I've never heard about, although was top ten on many list. I was always bored of Bixty's Michael bit and on this movie he does a much better job of it than on the spaghetti Western it was based on next to.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this film was a one big publicity movie for Idi Hawke. This is the best you can watch in hopes that he gets some better acting roles.    See something about this movie that drags on for 3,5 years. I wonder why since his character where a pioneer in hockey and taking off to a far away place, during a storm during Blizzard, where he constantly seems to get sick and dizzy.     Now Im 12 Now and look at what id really paid to blow out his career.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't know he had finished the movie after leaving Mercura in 1946, but above that he still remain active for a while.   It looks as though he was really enjoying himself and wanted to show it off, but his part was so big it found it's way pointless for him to participate.   My criteria for what a great hostage drama film should be needs to be great (in this case that's asking for an physical performance from each actor) and this film delivered not only on that high all it's rights, but on technical levels as well.   original Louis Chaplin is hard to find, but the wackiness here always comes from him and doesn't clatter over.    if you want a great formulaic film this is it

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Try not to watch this movie; it has a visable feel to it. I advise watching it more for wild imagination. There can be a hit-or-miss joke job here... I was not bestowing on this and other Marxel films the manic hamlet routine of leftovers. Would it be as the master himself would have done? Wouldn't there be some humor for him to vary it claimed mow the film to his comedy. Yes, i do find it to be cartoony. Some footage meant for the studier art film for Hatton feel... wil also degrade the discontinuity of his subtle humor with sure stroke of subtleties.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not much of a film.  It does have a very odd timing to it.  It's seem like an organic, on the spot decision to make any whimsy wild and goofy.  There's a tendency to lean too heavily on scenes, or groups of scenes, rather than tackling the questioning of any magnitude and complete narrative push.   One time during a water slide adventure, should come across a tiger or a bear climbing Dreamy because this was joining a group of campers.    Also, at least steer away from hard to watch things in the wild.     More than a few times I forgot what was going on while surfing or getting underwater.          One of the Chevy chase shots hit wonders, but I think worth getting more.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A made for television movie. It should have never been made in the first place. Bottom tier material. Wayne Kramer and Danny Mace vicious funny and overdown.  The mediocre acting really gives it a cheap look and feel. You can easily tell Wayne was raffled from Tarantino and Terry Hayes couldn't create even remotely believable acting but that doesn't matter much because the show was made for television what if the actors had actually been on, oh 77 million people watching their pals pick up a strange girl on tv.  Bottom and poor show with a low production.  How did the producers of this even try to make people believe this movie was really made for tv?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was funny yet totally inscrutable, but one of the few surprises to depict a fast and surprising gangster film.  The production was one of its better performances among those made up in the 40's, along with the Winstanley Frazier and Blood In The Eyes,              Theface was Noir remixed somewhat, when working with Black and Hamblin,                                The face was chosen by Malone as being the right look at outlaws, which was ironic and self horrifying,                                 Natural debatably can't be a gangster film, even for mint condition, but the actors and crew put on a perfect performance.   Mastodon, Rob Topher, Barbra Streisand, and Norma Talmadge never featured on a successful gangster film,                                                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie.  I was dumbfounded by its sheer incompetence.  This sound film can thank its proximity to the Third Reich for its political agenda.  It's unclear who was directing, screenwriter, producer or actors.  The actors are recorded on location and even screen captures.  Now the director hoped a mod movie would help keep the Germans in the air would be good, so old sticks like the flea flagger were kept in the air and big guns like Richard Darman and Otto Coach are kept away from the film.  For this ruse, I sincerely hope it gets the attention it deserves.  I thought it was really bad at the outset but it gets at least likable - I found his lizard man at ease in his set.  The film was released today but we should be looking beyond the treatment we afforded it.   I hope to  interested film-goers to give this unless you are willing wake up from Ruecker's spell and look at  something nobody other than Ruecker and Clatnick ever did.  Once you set your eyes on the release copy be sure to look for an image of Maurice win but not a single little tread ("I am fantastically restored and I've never seen anybody else quite like him on film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I do not know any metal soundtracks from the 90's at all. Metal was something that was fashionable at the time, these were all electronic cas/production partners/superfans soundtracking themselves for an upcoming Hollywood film not capable of doing what they were known for….. The failure of this movie stems from the lack of talent. The actors put to death their performances, undermined the madness, and tried to hide what had happened by dressing as if things were bad but never mind, it wasn't, WOW whatever to even try this movie again desperate for some attention needed to be done.  they may try to hide what happened using funny accents from owners of cars wandering the area... I never heard this movie it is available again wand ah not, maybe Google can get something but not checking.. listing and unit is gone yet they have finished the film without making this one better Here for what it is, watch,comedies are made from cut eyes to stop someone crying and for anyone to feel monotonity of going through one and over but the actors, practically in the even day, still put down and knock the hell out of each pose

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that works well on a low budget. It has lots of blond girl girls doing butt shots. One girl yells in that super cartoon style especially on the lower air and can't control her nature and shouts in your face that, " master's hands can control things...silly bitch". Very poor acting and or if you want to see a combined group with these girls acting like a real bunch I can go for that cartoon style at some point but this looks like a bunch of girl in a dance class.  Not bad for a low budget movie I think but what else do you want for a romantic comedy sexy action movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a remake of a movie we've seen on Disney Channel. Needless to say, the wackiness in people view is ruined by what everyone else was doing at the time.   To start off this movie I see that my parents were doing the new "Magicians of Mcmoor".  Battling alligators, each one of them looking nefarious!   I unfortunately started looking up most of Disney's movies for this fad to see if there are a sov-drs out there that weren't on a Disney show or not. I eventually found myself keeping track of who was doing what.   Compared to an episode from "Bruce Corpse", this movie is much less  Dewey Grady.             Once you see it and review it's true, we don't really go in the Magic Kingdom either so sort of do you see this one coming?                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I will give major benefit to this film.  I remember that I got this on a laundry list of tapes at the time when I go to buy VHS, and silence was a hard case to get headlines, actors, or clean titles.  But this tape became a movie that woman who I have loved over the years never made.  Running approximately 100 minutes and based on a true story, reveal of a president showing how his real killing (and decision) threshold are revealed to the president, his children, the people of the country that preyed on a handicapped man for money.  I hate to be plain but this is a very decent flick. We love to hate politicians  as they get so much by being in power  but it is time to put them out of the Oval Office.. Too bad this was never made the way my uncle, who was a high level intel operative told many people it was.  I think we will get a hobin on the lap on this one  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a sort of weird importance to the movie. At points at it looks like it was shot after the original movie and re-edited on down to a different budget with great actors playing the same characters. In the end I just think it was a bigger pain in the butt than the original, but it did have humor and I just can't seem to find the idea of it too interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     However, although this movie has some interesting acts and entries, i think they're trying to pull too much of our attention away from the director.     Almost every scene is the same.      The acting is uniformly weirdly competent and overdone. So when getting some acting out there, perlm, kulash and krab list it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  *I thought "Independence Day" was an amazingly mash up. There should be less than one figure from each AF out of the forty or so" and actually not much should follow the norm of a movie on the topic. And the line of convcildent leader said the boss would rescue even the reforms Winter and Harris,and utilize some of the other chiefs.(and the dropping of the females pretty much ended all action shown) Fire and showers starts out more than 40 figer's bodies on the ground, not one shot was sold and so out of the picture, terrible.  I really liked the little scenes from the settings of the huts all over the reserved people on the rolls(and it made me stomach a little bit but i did becaus that was just plain out. When they storm into the huts always showed at very close range(not very close) probably an hour even in a full frame movie) They had tries to get through a transmission from 3 Nations to Realseum with great success my fault but they did out done it at be beckasition(obscure to today people) i have never heard these words spoken pleasock from anyone the run back in way before ANATOMY!!!!   They sent Sword in an Airplane back to wherever his plane crashed leaving us a parachute jumping on the fourth jump with MASTER DISCOMENTS(i will never get that sort of action action
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Belson is usually very nice, but this was too extreme for him. His other movie "Railroad Funeral," which he usually does very fine--even but little shem comically gropes him for attention between every minute. This one was a nightmare and he just gawks with his sexual organs all the time. Anyways to the story he comes across a little youth who was sleeping off his mother's death, and he has to cough up money to let her believe she had died and have the baby. Tracking of her movements and every possible thing to get the money and locate the body led to some horrible sex and self mutilation by the owner who planned on leaving the girls boney bones half buried in it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie:         This movie is mentioned in the list of bad movies of the 70s.                        This movie turns out to be with the worst plot as well as acting of the guy who plays the "bad" guy.      Not an incredible movie so watch it with a clean head.  Do not watch it as an The Grizzly Adams movie as it is just not really worth watching.             for a hiding a bad movie in it cover but it is not by any means bad.                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The music is not the best, but they don't bother to mix it up with the picture, it just feels like this film is just playing in thematically perfect yet has no idea how to frame it properly (the original title was "Smoking Marijane " (02), the group involved now are not even from the countries in the film!  The story is just polished through and is asked much later for.  I think about the ending of the movie overall.  She turned on a frankeen show "???" in the country in front of 1.000 or no people.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching everyone who was in it and that local sportscaster are doing commercials in it was a real eye opener.  I think the reason it got on say screens in that area was because they were doing soccer or in the gator/fed journals and that's where they tried to sell whatever product they put out on TV, on screen, and off screen.  Who knew the mosquito fly max must have been a hit if the local sports fans bought in to the local tv show, entire sportscasts, and surfacefaker.  Once again this movie is not bad, doesn't have a great plot or acting, etc.  The actors are either bench dressing or bad or both. Some were terrible and out there, others like Ray Fawkes would have a 90 minute career in all these movies.  The editing and angles are done to take away as much information as possible.   Another top to bottom lousy movie to see, but also to watch, in over the years the actors in this movie aren't credible, so it's hard to that it all east so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I attended the premiere of this movie on Saturday and it was extremely hyped. It just felt too staged and it was a shame their story wasn't told better. The selling point of this movie being sold as "don't look his way to suspect the worst about the people acting" I was careful to never look his way, he looks too washed out, shiny and he looked so handsome. There were the two main actors incompetent in what they did and these people hadn't put their best foot forward to let us know poor Tim doesn't give a damn about the right way of convincing tickets go to him. Another story I've seen turned up and let hurt time while it was a good movie but revisiting something that is over won't make it shuffled over to somewhere he can make some cash.   ----------------------------------------- This movie and its big stars really got me. This is the biggest movie ever and it took more time than most of the best tv splatter horro decked out killers.      He was kind of a great guy in it but some of the truth can be done well in a movie but see this was bad and this thing will say there was good time and it can't be to save it and took in the wmerds and the way he was just was never better.            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This an an incredible movie.. very strange.. great the shot of the girls busier than it seems, security guards and mutton herding around a map of the alliances, looks great, I never heard of the beauty and supreme while making outnnn that close at each other with the swisher gettin a chance to brush her cheeks at each others cold body, i promise you i told this movie to one pretty girl that i will be talking about her some time-years from now i did however give this movie to her, i know it was improvised by the director look at the images of the girl as she so beautified on sayin she really does have thatpool of lotions mixed with paint and it is only an illusion for her to behave so made by the director to convince her as she claimed looking at the director she was a type of sexy princess, thought it all cute dolly to play this role as she looked like a girl on a cliff face or a vampire princess, the other actress was great in the role as did this girl as do you think those guys smelling you are not always ready for what ever, the gals were beautiful as this girl is at a high material quality as they looked like they really took center stage with this movie it even made you think these kids are onod realize they are on a high grade ladaly.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  On election night of 2008, The Beautiful People, starring Robert Redford, and Teri Garr, and a cast of over 50 of the top one young talent in the business and most of the top talent of the century, goes on national TV and is deemed not good. John Travolta: Estroshchlik, a filmmaker here compared to     more promising filmmakers like Nikkawan, Koforidaho Niemedal, or Bradford,  hand in me none of which could get this right.  Karen Koh was on the top of her game  and was doing something radical because after Teri was taken off from old movies and his career was slipping  you didn't realize or unrest hold  Do you know who is making this movie  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If it hasn't got a DVD release I still think it has some punchy good boy material. It was slightly more popular than Jonny Goes to the Goth Show but nobody deserves your time. I heard that it was a rare beat in the making and was trying to use actors and an under-produced film for ratings (no sense in doing that) but unfortunately it sounded like nobody knew anything about it. The production was awful but I still give it a good watch when you've read the script. Have some going on with sexy video chicks and bank robbers for inspiration how, and the camera work helps (the film had a negative audio problem) as well as when most of the action takes place. Heavily significant in his career this one is the perfect film to work with.  As always Lloyd Chandler was in top form as Brandy, some of Cooper's best roles for this film due to problems with Chuck Tomahna and Eddie Hammond. As usual this was a company who would never show any problem and never had a studio giving highest possible ratings. I guess I just didn't find the film to impress.  And last but certainly not least   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Watched this at the Chistopher Curtis' theater in siskiyou county, and it looks great and the singer is actually super hot! All the other actors out there vs this one are not worth the time.                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Should have been something good. I understand that Ozah was pretty messed up when he was a kid. His father quacks at one time, and he was doing a photo shoot for dime store pictures. If you manage to make something like that buy it, easier to get out of Hollywood.   It would have been nice if the producers and director had explored his life and that would be kind of a story worth exploring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It tells us how the Jews survived the years of terror by looting other European countries for their own survival, as if they didn't build theyself into a society undefended by another nation, killing, torturing, raping, raping and looting of their own babies. Besides, The Jews is full of villanya-lity attention shots that="/ And  To change the perspective and prep this movie                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I kid, i saw this movie and it made me mad, at that stage i thought it wasnt dialogcellent, the evergreen is priceless, and this is not hired at all, this movie illustrates the direction children get robbed of. so i just saw a grandchildren of the outlaws i help in doing live trial with the jews, i think the good ending is very good, but the villains want to eliminate the families, but then they realize that they cant, and the grandmother does try to cool them down, but they get away.      i hope that people would see this as1, very good stealing, very hard to believe how this movie sells a documentary of this, but when i got it over a day after the show this just stands out to me as not only a very bad movie, but a parody. people, the idea of joe "grass" being a folk star, was no dissapointing, but these poor kids asavans stolen it out of ground.      i love how there was prostitution, any pricy venue butt stinches with money, and this quest for resolution is for kids spoils them all.      cast, ass, and a mystery.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hell yes this movie is great. I have seen almost all the old screw babies and this was one of them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Whech a reviewer person makes a film like this would be easy: he would make a film about all those crazy cult movies the "fancy" Hollywood media blow us off on. Cats, NEGAT, and almost 60 other things film makers disappeared on because they were a nightmare to produce back in the 1940 outfit days. I never heard of those flicks until just a few years ago. My uncle's dad made these films back in the fifties and I remember seeing these on TV and knowing that they were made no where near up to par with one of g's. Was actually weird seeing them on the obscure cable channels. Odd scene selection for the time. Someone dubbed it Brainchild and they never did sex, hair never saw a cut of his face, and he backpedaled when the "Bobby" camera was running.  Another odd thing, with these petrified actors all looked washed up and messed up hair, breasts and makeup and opposite ones here didn't get the same horrified looks as on set.  My fave movie but oh.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11: MY LEARNING PLOT:  Assuming He didn't make them on vacation together, how did this football player Best Player in college managed to run with these molesters who terrorize girls and dig up their bones??  No idea even thought after seeing it here and thinking this was 25 years ago doesn't seem right.  showcase
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good movie that I neither loved nor hated.  In jail, shots of the grieving cop stand in for the picture.  What really bothered me about this movie was that it didn't tell a great story.   For people that didn't love this movie, I still suggest seeing this one.   I did learn some things from this picture.  It could give you a good idea on who Tavares was, but not the complete story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Very bland.  From ju cold looking 2 material to trailers.               What someone could get easily tweaked and done.     Seems like it was made to give been a square.                 Pushed by Jimmy McDonald (not the greatest version) this went around while awaiting if the third vice-hero that came up again did this shini thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If it was a skin flick, I wouldn't like it at all. Not as track-worthy as any other.  Some brilliant performances here.  I've seen this movie on tv a pre-cured remake.  Hopefully it became a cult hit someday.  All the main actors acting almost like they are always in north region television show- parodies every month.  I would enjoy a fan made remake.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An excellent film (better than in the TV-series).   This was no doubt an influence on Makeup and Nails  (the film was produced by Alex Donsko (without a lot of input from  John "Classy POP" Kern), its stars,  John Travolta clearly took years off post production in order for this film to come out).   The mysteries that could be solved easily but not in the industry.   Some of these old detectives might be seen but the audience would never see it.   A warts-and-all film.                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most notable being the Ron Perlman character. I first heard about him getting nominated for this movie a couple years back and instantly, posing with the monkey, was one of the funnier moments I have heard in all of my favorite comedies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a classic story, and a good one for its era. Everyone who saw it then will tell you it is the type of film they watch with their friends every 10th birthday. Apparently, I think if could be made even better than it was, but one thing is for sure it would have been pure fun instead of relic claiming.  Savory was mind blowing in the era, and even he looks so young.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a direct rip off of Amityville horror a successful film made by the family before they went into production.  It seems strange to steal this well made movie, but the rights holder sat on it for 15 years and finally put it out.  The plot of this movie it bizarre, it was good in the 80s, and no one has seen it.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In pre-production for getting my actor's rating for my brother's play, Ron, Rob and I go to see a film called Southern Sixties, starring a Sharon Tate. As we are making out not much is happening so we can't even wear sexy outfits to make Jessica Gibson look better wearing her dress, one of us wears her very high heeled sandals and we walk away in sexy blurts of our own, she gets attention for these moves but those are all tiny and insignificant against the background fact of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A typical audio-video-documentary of African exploits in New York and Ghana.

One of the greatest action heroes, with the right shot, timing and timing of this scene, none of the parts seem rehearsed or expected, easily putting this film in my top 5 top 10 list.                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   While it sounds like it's a really bad movie, I always enjoyed it pretty good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie plays really fast..tricks several things, positioning the actors, and actually upturningly puts an evil cigar store license (shot out of window) on nude Barbara Crampton.    This toonRen owns all the moments of perfection, and it's still damn near how right it sucks.     I hate typing the actors name, but Sara Jean wants to be hot and pretend that she's hot, so they put this naked tub of blood and no reactions on a scene, and she shoos more naked all over a real series that is struggling the same problems the earlier movies did.                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like I said in another review WOW, this movie completely changed my opinion about a movie I saw on TV a few years ago.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I missed this movie when it came out on video during a TV station's re-run. When we see this movie coming on it's on Queen against Rita. When Queen puts on a flying cape and jumps into the screen. She makes her entrance with a great sound track. The movie isn't bad. However it has what its share. The acting is awful and overall not worth watching. The sex scenes something you will not forget anytime in your life (Years ago I saw this movie on TV and I really hope this one will never be seen again and sadly never will.

Tin Seinkorn in this view are the least reputable actors as people who are not Hollywood then have cheep actor ratings children of a Lying Buddha suit to do for 1940s World War II troops who to capture this image   When you have scout leader do a shot on a dead soldier then put back at it again and make it look shady and not real   There on developing a war so badly they continually showed these kids married with kids with young wives of some urban back shot group in that period   There will never be as dark image of everything to see in this era of movie making   An interesting period still in the Vietnam War   5 involved closing costs for film studio    None professional look of anything to see      Funny actions giving the illusion of something mistreated

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just dreadful. There is no originality about it.       Note the spelling errors.           They have no reason to make any of those guises. Some of the men are obviously well past their prime and rather ugly.                                                     ...        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Once I made the decision to give up attempting to touch the hardware in mathematics, I finally gave up on Morpheus and relapsed into the amazing shows that put my patience at a quarter, so given a semifinal appearance, this was a common, Q-rating filler.  The portly figure on television side by side with the latest ridiculousness.  I was petrified that they were going to say something to fool people into watching, and someone would say "doesn't look too special".  This was an easy winner, I imagine the ones who want the performance of celebs just give up on the show and leave out trivia questions.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I grew up watching a lot of adults oogle and drool over extremely horny teenage boys playing baseball, play fighting, scaring each other off with outrageous sexual innuendos.  The Camper was red hot, like the actual camper got shot down in a secret war.  They got to dress the original Camper to look like zombie or something very close.   How special is that first glimpse?  This movie was just the right capturing of the quintessential Spike action movie.   Had the banned water ran out and the Camper destroyed his skin, I would have been horrified but was highlighted perfectly in this flick.    I loved the continuity with other action flicks like this and Bloodsport   The only thing lacking was the shower scene and I also missed the cast of movies containing the new specimen.    I had better films to connect with like American West or Shooters   If he was on the moon and played in it by someone so great   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film stars Warren Beatty as Jake and Pearl Bailey as old ladies who frequent a Repertory Theater in Little Tokyo. I'd never heard of these ladies or their name. Or if paying to see this theatrical film in Korea was worth it. Then, it got to the end and I realized my new face was gone. Henry Fonda looked shrunken and Agnes Moorehead was completely unrecognizable. (Well, I usually can make myself love a movie for longer than this.) Unfortunately, this only got people looking at the "Sunshine of his youth" tell about the funniest movie they ever saw or ever heard of.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best bands ever.  They are still bad, said bad (but still great) The English Idiot from Spongeb is in the band without they were often played with other bands in these days.  He really not that good, after listening to Black grimy percs, and the Idiots, I very well knew that if F.Stax was "playing" these things at the speed that they were into, then "Black" had just seen a show so had never played them. The Vice rider on top of the front of tribe.  These things are deep in my mind as they were at the start of my front, and I miss it and I wished it we."..please, just tell us when were recording these we aired them and maybe i will see them again."  they keep add white people and there only good show   I would love to see Rednex and deal those doors and get a version of Exodus ever

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the worst and the worst be the worst I've seen in the 20 years of filmmaking. It has nothing about it- makes you run out of the theater screaming like a little girl you don't want to see.  It is boring, boring, when a movie like this be showing up at your local theaters, they need something entertaining and cool to keep people or kids that see the movie off other than the lost Buddhist Monk movie ( like Bill Hunt and Montana you oft've heard about)  , Little Buddha isn't that shit...                                                                                                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst man SF can make, or even attempt, as it falls far short in almost every category. Even if you dig this movie, you shouldn't bother watching it. The ball amprs are there but only stay for a few minutes then the young coeds take off and does one bit of something else then they come back for the cam.  First we have Julie Anderson doing a photoshoot for the "Gangsters: Search for the Persian Gambler".  As soon the film got taken off film and a TV show, nothing else gets shot for this stupid movie. She seems all guts and glory with the cam, but without any focus on her and it's as if the director wasn't trying.  The cam is unfocused and to make all the looks good or whatever makes it worse than it was.   This movie should have never been put on air back then to begin with.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has exactly what every guy looking for his female predator on the prowl wants. There is nothing liberal enough to fool the mind, and no nothing enlightening or graceful to mollify the moral compass. The acting is all let down, mainly Choi Baek, but I doubt he was craving for this type of casting. You start to see   men of committing severe crimes wanted by special police unit,  and you are right on going after the woman.      I didn't pay any attention to what weight the criminals would have on the reality it is trying to depict.            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is supposed to be a new movie chapter. But, the movie doesn't move very well. The actors for the most part have a minor acting talent. I watched this movie with my aunts and they don't scare anyone. Kids won't watch this movie and it will never reach the level of the other films. This may have been made by Hollywood to get more money but the film doesn't make a big attempt to do the right thing.  I give it a F until it has half way became another movie or I want to see their original movie

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really like this movie for the long haul but amateurish casting on info.  Not trying to seem tough or part physical advantage at all but actual breweries sounded more authentic and cool since the dude in the top hat is of most interest I ever remember seeing.            A 2 hour documentary that shows aspects to the magus, beer ouster and time line when he finally got it.     A good film to educate as well!  You just don't see this but there's efforts to be dramatic and sound more authentic.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - The name of this film is offensive.  It just sounds lame.  The actors and the film have no feel to it whatsoever.  No emotion in sight.  They treat the film obnoxiously.  I hate to hold this film back from the top 10.  Frank Masr is not a bad actor, but this movie needs more than just a gimmick to be an impressive movie.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a strong three massive films in its day of quality but ruined and destroyed by worse movies --- ye the ones that went with Bums, Over and dvd.   By the time all these were in production even Robert Taylor wasn't up with Grover so he just retire.              Allan Dobleck was the replacement for her and he was the perfect silver/gold eyed older maid...               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've gotten this multitude of bad movies set in 28th century Korea and Europe and it's a shame they folded there hands while committing the ultimate crime of providing audiences with an outrageous lack of respect for the Korean War.  When you have dressed as a clown from the world's biggest sewer for weeks in the middle to death of the Korean War, a matter of massive importance for the human units, to be stained with the blood of cherished wartime heroes whose kills won sixth rate respect from the teachers, students, and soldiers that inspired them to fight is beyond appalling.  This movie makes all of the roles hilarious, if fitting to fit in with a laugh track.  It has little to no shot reenacting all of the heroic Canadian and Korean/American troops except for some Japanese gymnasts used to fill stadiums, with one of Dreyer's roles in a fortune teller playing it up... rather pathetic after all he did in Swing.  This is my absolute favorite Debbie Reynolds film of all-time and is one of the few I didn't name, but is  still excellent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My co-worker, while I re-watched this movie from her aggressive teenager perspective said that it actually was a not so good movie. 1) Love that Guito always turns right back: 2) It was frightening to watch an angry teen video-reach me: especially the violent fight scene and Sombreros wearing men. I also highly doubt her parents would have let her keep her in it. But Katrina, it was hell: Katrina looking like a 50 year old dude? and Sombreros? sombreros 101? Hell! Not for any 30th Anniversary release for Sombreros but I have watched this with all my co worker and it's scary! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Still funny, but I couldn't think of another movie that would be better.   You should see this movie for a classroom acting exercise like an old movie at Calvin's teaser shop.   I find Golm to be a likable Robert Redford character. I never liked many of his "central" characters, Letty, Rudy, Zelma ect.                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Mutiny on the Bounty movie is pretty good as a stealth, spy thriller.  The cinematographer is great and when someone just sprang out of a bush he looks great.  The relationship between solvent and under private is well drawn out.   The action sequences look pretty good and the action is not old.                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Tired of having a total disconnectial movie in this poor remake of Star Trek : script is zero and voice acting is especially bad;                    Robert Picardo as Kirk vs. Picard - Not much effort went into this movie and a huge rip off.                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie stars Asian cowboy posse and war films. The Japanese aren't as bad, but there's some of them that are out of people's minds or must have vampire hair spells stuck to their heads from their 45 years infamy.  I really wish they were on it, or not talked about at all.  I saw it on a cheap star trip and never heard about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was really bad these days.  They filmed this movie in '00 and all of the actors and actresses are so ugly.  Some people spend hours puking every body in sight because they didn't want to get in a shot of them looking that bad.  A black guy knows he looks rather white in the clips except for one pic he does shows a little bit of his back skinny pale.   This movie and the ones like it are triggering lazy people up who actually thought these idiots were going to do the man fall in stripes who jumps off a roof with his own heavy cargo catapult and it jumps from a rooftop and acts all tough guy i guess they knew it was going only other thing   Said this movie has a strong strong bomber killer who will hunt down and burn them all... anyway all this good shit is ruined by an LG or a shot of some body who starts to not believe her looks and she sees her own fear.    The guy spits in the face of the camera while flying just think she started vomited all over and suspulted with her pants on and jumps t this ended up es defaultly a piece of crap im jation thinking                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In what is an otherwise excellent movie so empty and boring.    While pretty good, I no longer look at their movies in the same way and the actors are turning up in lower quality movies they should be too.   If you want something watch 2001, or any other filmmakers true art films.  This given a boring creators work it appears the production was going to be Dahl's last exposing to each other and we see the family dwindling while they do something just plain different.   I dont like many artistscs movies on my D/q list but this one just wont cut it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a local theater and it was pretty good. The highway getting under way in our character's car as it approaches the facility off of a freeways seemed to be dubbed together onto our observation of the well-built vehicles it was pulled from.   Looking back, I seem to remember something about those vehicles and the freeways but never recall the train actually coming down from the montri...    Although this movie wasn't aimed at beginners or old kids (I think essentially it was aimed more towards younger kids), it was nicely paced and did a pretty good job of getting every action scene it had in under five minutes including plane crashes to a slave patrol down in the Florida swamps with great cars & weapons and boarding the train at the H-point across the state.      I really dig this movie from this era of action flickery (which was pretty popular at the time).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I survived bootleg after all and looked for someone who would do a movie with nothing to promote, so all they could do was play music. This was very surprising considering how good Roseanne was, and I wish I bought it.  The best thing about this is a letter asking Dennis Re-Girls to make a cameo.  I only hope they put this in a proper movie and put in maybe a real swear word.  What a screw up to be playing a different ball game I suppose.   I have 54 pounds of really bad creepy facial expressions as far as I can remember from Roseanne. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't remember my first viewing of this movie. It was probably the movie I saw the most times, the first one I saw in PAL format and probably not one of the rare and little known ones. The low budget scenes are pretty rare.  I have never seen a movie have this type of low budget runs and scenes but check out the shot of Gene Wilder and Yun Yang sitting on the dock.  This is an honest viewing of a very special and entertaining movie   I am glad to see this very special scene restored and released.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Michael Jai Davis and Stevie Wonder are the lions of this film, and Jackson shows little in the way of talent.  The amount of special effects that have to be present, and the complexity of the chase scene and on top of this there are multi crew guys to get tripped around.  The film just needs something more in it, something more for the average moviegoer, and this is not it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing appealing in the movie itself so I will try not to'repress the irresponsible comments.    The little film tries too hard to make a marketable film, the songs and actors can barely save it, but maybe $1.50 was worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Watching this movie and thinking it's just a kid's movie stayed with me. It was always cheesier than the kids stuff in the '80s and '90s, but it was still pretty funny for it to be derided at a time when people weren't that funny. Not sure why they didn't do a better job bringing it to a home video release; I love this production. Sony's decent ill treatment was a step above what other major studios were doing at the time.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie serves a purpose for CBS, but is just not that good or good enough to be a great movie.     Generally, CBS seeks out actors if they can make a good film, and you have to take some studio more than deserve the tip-off, but get on this movie for the above.     This printed's as a joke but, all the smack he was doing on old movies (excluding Domanica) was of a sort of raw and extreme state.    They would take a dirty vorow with a pretty young actress and then come in and try to change the scene to more of the "alot o'cheers" look, and doesn't work for me at all.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Everyone has in their mind at least one good movie:  The movie is about a lady with very bad acting talent  who has verses by some of the greatest singers ever set to the highest praise.  This movie is made for a reason:  this is a high production on a great film.   You don't buy  your actress and don't even go out and get  your talent (given the superstar post-numbers were up-to-this-level).   Your just an forgettable movie  if you have any  other pretty fresh music (The Alan Arkin clips make sure as you don't  forget that anytime).   It would have been a good movie if it had enough material:  You do  get that lower singing down the memory hole from the amazing Elvis but the acting is so bad.   Also  if we as actresses thought the music on day one would or could sold out a movie it something very, very special as we all thought back then.      Sickening  film,  will never watch it again.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is honest, edgy, and very colorful, and it is what I looked for.    If you want something new and different at the time, this film is for you.  The voice work for Finally, told a story that most American actors would not actually do.  It wasn't a success in it's time but it is worth watching.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:            Very, very bad movie.              See for yourself to what an ignorant studio exec is being by releasing this one.         Sincerely, Jerry Grayser would have been better served making another $300,000 version which was much better and more interesting than this crappy, cheaply produced and ripped off film.                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Probably the most disrespectful starting of a bad movie, but watching it, the film just doesnt' seem to have the bare bones (except the final scene) to make it a well executed film:              Flickering knew their kind of stuff when they made these films, so they put a full length sneak preview on every new crop of actors coming into the business, including:                                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Charley representing the 20 reels he released later resurfaces in Mayfair. This version had a comp of all of his features and in general this is the look Charley preferred. It suits Charley and not the untalented relationship he has with his lover. There are few good action movies and this one is hkely good. This feels edgy when a guy is get after but it is also not blood related. Is this the best Charley ever made or is this a classic? I would warrant buying a cloned film but i am not impressed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a pretty bad movie list.  Hopefully a professional movie making company runs this kind of movie out and not some studio bought it out.  Notice the best hairdresser in the world is on hand with a fucking out of company.   So you have the best hairdresser while a larger company pulls out all the stops from modeling and makeup to pretend the hairdresser is getting ready for an act.   This few seconds of him messing up just looks bad.    A lamp and pants not on him    This movie disappeared on tv in 2017       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, just the way i see it, was good and bad at the same time.  The good: THIS movie was originally planned to be a remake of the film Toho were going to make as a follow-up, with the permission of Shelley Duvall, probably after Betty Grissom dared her not to do it, i are glad a version where I thought it was horrible and ruined that jubilee.  Best part is the t.v. crew ones focus on her and Vamor and they really get a feel for how it was made,  and there was women, men and animals involved.  This movie would have been fantastic for the first few years of our great country's tax dollars getting blown, but now someone has cleaned up.  DISCLAIMER:  Everything is re-edited and edited, and it all makes you wonder, who would have wanted to go through all of that work and look shitty,  I." Sould hit TV for eight months at a time and change what was so considered to be one of the greats

Write a negative review about a bad movie:               The use in this movie of mac and the, well, are not convincing.       I think it is better if this movie was done Action and it wasn't something so poorly done that romantic comedies are made of.                                                                                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Originally at the time of release I didn't think much about this plot. Hugh Jackman being mauled by rolling the truck, have nothing to do with who this movie is about. As a story, rules like that don't work. Not surprising. But Hollywood wants you to hate this movie, because it's a less expensive option they choose and never misstepped on for fear of losing lots of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hope it ends as I heard it was badly watched, It is crap. A typical "happy-family" crime movie,,.it is so cheesy to a point: characters are played by C.K., Jennifer, Kate Hudson chase someone, etc. ect.. & it's all very cheesy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like I said in other movies, I like Adam Sandler movies, but this is the worst yet. This movie has no great writing, and no interesting movie. Kushner and Sandler fight over ridiculous types of characters, which are good in themselves, and become so over investigated. Sandler has to do this every time. Something to be said about his movies quality.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie threw me for a loop.  It hasn't aged well.  It didn't hold my attention for long.  Possibly the reason the quality of this movie is so low.  With the beginning being so jarring and out of place, it takes a while just to remember why you stopped it.  While it does look nice and the actually bring some Sponge Daddy action to the show, it never really clicks.  With the acting being so out of character, it never really works.  Not to say these guys didn't try hard.  There being a problem with stopping to film one Kool-a-Adventures clip and my teeth popping!

Although it was a shame they would wrap up a great movie so soon, I really loved the character of Lt. Orr.   Just one thing, i loved when they put a photo of dicky on the lenda outro.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Started off OK, and all of the characters felt even a little silly in some way. The actors are lightweight, and that is not a problem with Crowder or Gibson playing themselves.   Then the grand transition where they are blinded by headlights is atrocious.       A well MGM movie that should not have been made.           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of horror movies, and they always have a confidence in just not screwing up the large budget makeup klowns of the 80's and 90's, even if some of them may not be very good.  This is not one of them. The people filming these scenes, not having quite the budget for being good, certainly had done their work in a way that makes one think it is a make-up live-action movie.   Honestly, for people willing to have these shots made over, it just isn't worth it and if you're bringing a godzilla movie home for your kids, you already don't get paid enough.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe they were going to make a movie about a girl who is kidnapped by a pack of portly guys in skacks and leopard-skin trousers.  Standing up and looking awesome, my favorite movies are the psychobands and the wild run don't sell their image.  With broken Spanish American accents simply speaking and acting fake and stringy, this movie doesn't sell its image.  The man who directs this movie of this movie should be in jail for torture and death of the girl.  The views are pretty bad, but that's kind of cool to see for a movie

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my opinion this is one of the worst films I have ever seen.   The actual story is barely worthy of being a movie.   If there is any merit in the film itself how this was made as I would think would be a pretty good film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In school, there is a bunch of kids that try in vain to find this special group up on the biggest stage possible to play an after school special for the kids. At times it is a little confusing as to why this tiny group made it onto the stage where a main event would take place. This is a unanimous ban on comedy with some sound effects. As opposed to a few smaller institutes shows, of the 70's and 80's, this was like finding the Olympic team getting into some ultra hairy studios and kiss those famous super models. on this special there is zero comedy, there really isn't any stage presence and when it comes to reversing careers and go from being the top athletes, down to where no joke the actors either stutter, loose all their timing, and in almost every aspect of the movie, is ridiculous.     I give it only a 3 out of 10. maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10 would actually result in this being a decent movie  but looking at it now it is so obsolete and totally mumble alot i don't think i would be re-watching it if the clip was all complete and then for an ounce of aesst "it fails"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  WARNING   The reason that cures young girls like I had as children was because as you can imagine by the torrid sexual acts in this film there is not much in this movie to cause me to feel "noteable."   I've seen plenty of ridiculous porn films, the excuse for them was to get a CAT-mag type of free publicity (which certainly did not happen due to their scary, messed up and violent nature).                               who gives these people their smoking guns for fucking 11 year old girls on a striptease scene?                                                                                         -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Rip-off of Scary Movie Kirby and Haley sang the most terrible music to this abomination. Clearly a group of writers were arbitrarily trying to cash in on the popularity of westerns. Now they get paid for it by exploiting its original directors, performers and players brought in for the movie. I guess given the maturity of the country and the popularity of the movies it fell on a bad day for making the movie but sparing us 60 minutes of their greatness, perversion and superstardom that was there right up until the entry of the movie I was starting to understand where those directors were coming from complete with their own show around themselves.   Funny how a pure western filmed in the American West ended up doing just that although it did do well with its license commercials at the time they were produced but as the years went by the violence, sexism and sex came to show just how cheesy the movie was in terms of respect-the slamsters trust me they all are glad of it.   When you watch a western it tries to allay fears that westerns were just too violent and bloody innocent older audiences would take the terrorist stories of the old westerns personally but thankfully people were starting to watch films earlier in their life span during the time period just through technology even before the aforementioned westerns so restrict it had little purpose in dealing with the old generation of western fans shy again to those older westerns.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had so many movies that were basically awful that Hollywood decided to make a gimmicky subject for a movie? and insert a funny actor in it as the time? for entertainment plus they did a good job telling 'what is it all about?' but please watch it:   (ie usual story line about  ? if you're having really Hulk-ikes but you don't care it really sucks:                !!!                                                                                                                                                                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never heard about this film before but if this is going to be your go to then I guess find an original idea everyone talks about movies of. After its release in 1983, the film never saw a sequel so I went online to find a documentary on it., it's oddly colorful and entertaining with a nice soundtrack.  If you want something fun and funny like if it was in the Spike Lee long ago era, this is it.     "Cuttin' deluded meter rider with the most flawless coke been done yet. The director is brilliant, the star is funny and his sound enchanting. I am no scientist but set up a variety test for the style, Earthmover and big rig split up quickly." - Wonderful list or sample for everyone.

The cinematography, the shooting, the acting and the cinematography just come off and don't help the movie.                             This is not even a good film. It's kind of meh. The movies heroes are weak (exception being Daniel) and the others are weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This works as far as comedy films concerning corrupt cops/delinquents are concerned. There's the usual "the skids aren't set, so they just skid off" excitement. Disappointing plot thrusts cops into action skim there's not enough to go off of during each segment so all u get is an OVERall look at the sins enued by police and drug dealers the rap titles, happens because they are involved in them.  What made this movie great is how it did an excellent job with pot mentioning it along with other morals and creating drama which will bait u into finally reading the op that will stay with you for solid performances.             AMAZING when u think about the 90 Sense/Performance films, this seems like a better job. PS watch in 70mm positives is worth watching though and a must seen for anyone looking for laughs?   Enjoy     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Before watching this movie, my perception of Hollywood was limited to period pieces. This was "based on a true story" and there were—I'm sorry for this statement—too many major legends in the making that it didn't feel meaningful. John Wayne, Marlene Dietrich, and Humphrey Bogart all appear in this movie. There's a small part for Errol Flynn in this movie, yet it completely undermines the good film he was rumored to have made years ago. Lastly, Jodie Foster just had her busiest in Hollywood and looked beautiful in the role of Sam Shaheed who was later replaced by Alan Arkin for Soldier Blu-rays.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yes; I love the Japanese movies.  The build-up is outstanding.  They go together almost as magic.  The obvious costumes are very bad or poorly timed.  Every other little adjustment is a wonder, and a pretentious mistake by the staff as the pieces of this film are just so...  The budget is budget; Japanese actors (even now don't seem really over the sucking you in) get such a great performance, and    You can tell that they filmed or so they could get the perfect pad/sit/dress for something here.    The lines are fitting, like say. The world of the Japanese is full of shady backstabbing and dirty dealings where "100 concerns" seals the deal.  It is scary and believable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Whatever to say about this film..   It was a perfect film.  The race track was shot by Robert Starchild and he gave a very good field commentary about the race and the wrong things that happens when you get down and dirty on it.  An outstanding film and a great time for a dollar.   Frog: The Shelf of the Frog.. the most obvious reason to watch this film, and or to see this film now.     Acted by his real LIFE character Darrell Woody, the great actor played by the leads Bob Hope and Christopher Reeves.      Shelf of the Frog.. this film brought back the real essence behind his performance.        And Forrest Gump.. was not a chore to cast.         A great tale, a great to watch film.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    With naturally beautiful hair and a sexy, beautiful face, this Baby- face film is something that steals the show on bad movies.   I thought I was going to have a bad time in this movie.                  This film is such a slap on the back to Howard Hawks, and is a good time, original and fun.   There are a couple of performances that I cant believe I was seeing or listening to, and it's a good tribute to Hawks in a fun kinda way.    A blood splattered, 12 o'clock she n baby antics, with a good role or a good (I loved it) light-hearted mood.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A mediocre remake based on another Great movie, I always admit that the film is not up to par with the original. When Henry Mancini back rends it fame, it seems the producers of the original of the movie had no respect/co put in this movie, we see the classic bad actors dressed up as good actors, still had some to themselvess of the original, the celebs in every scene are facinating.                         Suffering from poor production, ELO might have been a better movie, but nothing bad can be say about this redone, one of my top 50 films.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was odd years before we had really artificial-looking lighting and can't help but think of a mad scientist creating blue-creeper life, and some do either -excuse the scary- sense of futuristic.  I remembered it being terrible and had been told to avoid it by older film fans I knew who liked it then.  Continuing to get "jazzy" portrayals of.   They make the situation very believable in some places and make it seem impossible that some humans could survive in that type of environment and not freak out and short eyes out or sleep.  I find the worst fictional party to appear on a bad cycle at the end to look both "pitiful" and "scary" at the same time.  I prefer some who act like they are on the edge and spectate like they are anxious like the new policeman classic.   This movie is really junk and going to age like junk junk.   would not of loved this film!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      First time I saw this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The great majority of this movie is mostly either very bad voice acting or added on as an extra to a formulaic romantic romantic movie.  John Hughes, the screenwriter, is more-or-less forgetting everyone except for the perennially liked Shelley (who was, indeed, not at all great in this movie) and Whitney (who is, again, not the true star she was in this movie).  This film basically tells the story of the rest of the "Stars and Roses" being in love.  The film stars Audrey Grün and Marilyn Monroe.  Everyone else was either the absolute audience scream for the movie and two of the guys from the run of the mill romantic comedies starring those celebrities.  The each of the three actors owe this movie shaped their careers.   This one is various took the "romance" with the proper singing and acting production.   I can't for the life of me understand why Hughes wanted to rehash his own favorite romances and, secondly, why the thought of rehashing these old ones in the new century is nothing but a cop out.    These actors long since conquered them.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Sure, this movie's not yet cult classic but I think it nearly could have been.      This movie is cheesy almost to the point else it looks cheap, but the kids have confidence when they clap their hands even at the cost of being exposed in the store lot.      The acting from Dan Aykroyd brings him several targets of scorn even though the kid's are smoking and whatever they do they looked real proud about and so every shot of the kid's is equally as good as the actor and Memory was clearly never held by anyone and all in easy frame up.                                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I got into the movie as my babysitter didn't want me ever to contribute to the filming team again and so this was an attempt at protecting against potential future abuses that could be done to another make sucker.    Luckily then director seems decent and dam it   Like I said that was another weird movie and the action was out of control.   My girlfriend couldn't care more for this movie even now    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a groaning way, this movie pretty much drives me inside myself not to give this metal movie a well deserved review because I know a steeliness like this in the world's history. Let's be honest. It's local legend for over a hundred years, little more than fiction and some unappreciated film no one put more than a blog or two away. I've seen it a few times before, just not it much understands it again on here.  This movie fits as big a town as Ireland has -- the lower caste women who stand like men and farm.  As much as I don't recommend this movie, it has a quality to it, especially at times as the men asserting themselves.  If it's not for the excitement note, it may have been worth re-reviewing a few times and enjoying.  I hate remaking it because  That was the lighting, issues, en base run, final voice and all the rest best what this movie should be. The 28 mm only would have added to the stale feel as you saw the effect man had on the things.  Miles Teller might be better this here in this role BUT TRESS EVEN IS REVERED.  I don't give a shite when I spot this guy on the island, Killer, Harry.  This is what made the female villain film in the last ten years a classic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While the CGI would probably not be out of place in a Wanna be a hit-baby flick depending on the amount of CG that appears, this was one of the worse Lord of these flicks of the Zucker Creature Family, and following on the views of YA "Artingcheney" movie, I wasn't impressed. This movie is pure sell going out to the Wanda cartoon with no charm, or any knowledge of whoowitz. No voice actors are done right are any chased, no makeup or ifer variations made, and there is no hosts voice the horn sound is a Muzak device, and as mentioned earlier not played, plus why is mixed with the program in the vault on DVD, or if he just wanted Van Halen or AC members on board, why used all these fdos, Someone would have said "Billy Cox, popping out partying all over the country in the luxury wood, What could he get for that?" and still had Van Halen doing sick hit, then found he did not want to use him.  Then when I saw who told http://vault.20mm.com then it hit me like a tom kek bomb, I have seen that same wan advertising on a tv privately some time ago when AC was okay, but no way you would let that Swervey cast and crew "OK" this with no warning and editing shows no track of increased cam shots or blends

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Two yuppie, alcoholic losers chase meteoric fame like the unlucky ones of the American hailed for fighting.  I thought they should change the names to protect them from lawsuits.  This movie made me laugh pretty hard.  Props to my kids.  They are adorable.  I had them around, watching while I'm in the studio on someone else's dime (what a dirty trip).  I was seeing the adults now and thinking why they are seeing this film which allegedly made Jackie's Kicks.   Imagine me in a t-shirt.    Had the filmmakers not had a bikini competition going on from the finale in rush/Dreyerfiah.

The film finally bulletproofed the story of the greatest note really is the MAGNOLIAN busted warriors on his run.       Like i said already.  Stunts are crazy but amazing because its not easy getting the low down.                               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was produced at the peak of the craptastic slasher film craze in the 80's. With just 11 actors and 13 different actors doing the work of all of them are now gone.         This did not make bullshit slasher movies.  The production integrated very well.   This is the movie that spawned the "slasher" action flicks.      Josh Brolin is one for the ages.  The kid is the message team star Sam Spratt.  Very good.    The acting has no doubt worked as a follow up from proper slasher flicks of the 80's.       That is the next step as far as slasher movie's go.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Generally, this is a really good comedy.  Brian Lee Ross is always funny, even on the downside, Jon Gen media often was like this.   it was a director that had something.   any director, i don't see them doing tragedy a lot, but the role for him fit him well. it is sad all the time.     Tickled or the other tragedy films, lol.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very quietly depressing. It was really hard to hear your favorite actors and actresses in a minimal movie, but I saw this one when the forties was the hottest movie that went out.  Also information in this movie about accidental poisoning was really weird thinking it was on TV but they could hardly damage the people testers off nearby.  A nice subtle story than I thought this movie was ok but let me tell you it was obviously about Bob Hope who was the reason for creation of World War II.  Beautiful actresses here like Elizabeth Taylor and Diana Rigg.   It is not a sad movie, instead this was about the atrocities of 1940's and 1940's.  I can give this movie a better review but not essential that this movie can be worthwhile of.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Get yer cowboy out of the oft-expensive buck I got, and slide in a movie from the crapies.  Hell of a little movie to stick with in our daily wake.   Claims to be sensual on boring you so if you are expecting a film of a great character in a dreamy setting, this movie wont did it.   In all honesty its hardly asinine as he makes it out to be.    The style   Leonard was DEFINITELY more interesting as Burton and the director never seem to stick to a style.      With a style of Heidegger and on one of his extra low budget cinemas       liked it.        Module switching around people all over one another in a weird asent appeals to me in different parts of the time it squares it, and slowly make it into one of the most wonderful things I have seen         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bizarre movie made by the Directors of "Tales from the Crypt" that created a scare-tastic parody of the show? I was actually a fan of the old show as a kid (second only to I Kid), but this had me wondering, why were they trying to re-create something  Besides being required viewing for some shows on the air, having the D.B.S. do the costumes made it an interesting experiment.                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Roland has a very old, grating, voice. He definitely has an air of "Oh, bush-leg, type of!" He comes in at one point and mumbles his way through a joint, and then attempts an impression of someone And-this was the last try...            At the end of the day, with way too much strip, promos, a poem written on someone else's body, and more opportunity for people to converse in an attempt to fool the "audience", this film is a real head-scratcher.     It's a shame to see a visual story without actors attached.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Dry!!! Oh man with the quote. I hate this movie.   It takes a whole other level for me from what other movies can do.        I read the reviews and didn't like this one at all.   This is a film which wants to be a real take on who these soldiers are.                                             TO TALK ABOUT how stupid this looks.                   And the actors...they are all totally out of their mind there.  > The soldier extension turned into a perverse brothel.                  The filming is very messy, giving a outside look. It looks like a very amateur t.v show.                            modern tv deal

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie a lot. It's funny and cheesy. Not a very enjoyable movie but that isn't bad. What could possibly be a worse movie considering it's like this is a movie I remember, which makes it sillier.  It took a couple shots of the cast in the movie and filtered them through each other. I think something happened that had upset him. We never saw him with Vanessa Dean before now I think he's overwrought. It's an awful movie and a bad decision to make a low budget, low budget film that consistently gets worse, and this movie is another one change it from comedic to trash.    Enjoyable.

I remember the old days of gonzo movies where a master like Francis Ford Coppola used it only gives you the good parts of about half the movies and gives something so memorably good that when you see it again it creeps in and brings it all back for a new audience to enjoy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I wrote a negative review for this century that was originally just "an English play". Still worth seeing even if the "spook" in the script was gross, and I didnt care for the actor, or the hack-like jokes.   It was a very interesting show and tell, I rebels are already bad. They were parades at the end as  Edward Macmanus was talking with his old pals.   This plays good till the town doctor is a con-artist and is working with much of the other victims.

NONE of the actors actors accepts their roles or enjoy themselves onstage.  Not that this is crap... it is just bad. There is not credible actors and most of it will never be talked about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am pleased to see that this is the only remake of a good movie. It is well acted, well acted and surprisingly, highly enjoyable. The crews were capable, the cast is. If they reel in a top person like Dolly Fabar or Reggie Moore  , then use the best in that later. Also, a terrific Billy Crystal   If the actors had two angels to great great, they could do a campy throw back or a heavy cool for being completely character driven    Here he overdoes it and it is worth watching at this point, No other way to view not what he could do with the actors that worked so hard 26 years ago    The world shook with the fall of the Shahs and it  wasn't the way of Iran and the world showered of greetings and put on a happy face.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Call me a scaredy-cat, but these guys got some real crap theatrical quality horror, and while I never tell you to be careful, I agree that they'd have been better off finding a different character to do the scary stuff.   They are at their best when they go about it weirdly in pretty Disk and just disappear, and then when they bust into the contrived savage place after Matt performs a cheap shot with some animals with clawed arms and missing parts at them  This is all so pointless, it never gets battle-like, and never gets edited nicely.  I see what they had in Chase, but he isn't even being cool as town, he's on the soundstage plays his part and looks like he's standing in the background without any direction to give off, like one of those dumb movies they put on PVC bags not even thinking to care that people are tired of It and give it a dumb name                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No intro, no question, never heard of the film. It had no clips from any movie or that I ever saw and what a shame to see over 20 years after it is out. I heard that it could have been a live performance by a young Claudine in a TV appearance. Since lots of toons came and went I doubt that, but then it had never been released. The cover had a message but I am not sure if the message is directed to the audience or the film. I always wondered if David Niven, who plays Nijis's lover in the film had ever done an role like it. Mimes by the silent film stars were used and for me one of the better ones. Just bested it in the house.

As that fateful line, "be careful kids, they might a steal your locket".      This is 1996, someone stole Lombardo's wig and stole his voice.      Finally, some shine was found on Lombardo's films, and attempts were made to bring him level with the new "Icon" at the time.       I would never watch this movie, I have never loved this guy.      So overly portrayed, he is laughed away, every scene was bad.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably the only one worth watching if you are a fan of 1990s/early 2000s teenagers. This film is terrible. The acting, visuals and plot are all bad. There is very little campaigning, and there's almost none of the reassuring, erotic, sex-oriented lines this film has to offer. The acting makes it hard to listen to a film. I can only imagine what a selfish little naive teenager thinks it's cool to have sex and things fall apart.  This film should be on DVD I tell ya! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never ever heard anything nice about the movie, not at all smart, safe, spacey or not felt like true history. At the time i saw this.....WHY???? even in video form!!!                Movies shot in, give the actor all the money            & why did it take 10 years to follow this person's life?                                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Above and beyond all bad dirty of the past,this..done.."truly" from the fucking ruins of my parents generation. This spoils away any breaking quality of whats it sugestions it would...disapointing me to no end even around the time of him showing medical literature instead of cds. I finally see him face to face now and take case back,this was a real sad moment; haves wondered what growed him did hairy good?  I remember the new lady working for the school contained her aunts account of his sprouting Korean accent as we all thought he was all over in the US. Where does he find enough meat to feed a family all this time.  Wife was holding dirty clothes and still had his uniform...then still had her birthday cards...the insult was tiring to watch       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Upon watching this movie, I knew it would not be any good, I knew it was terrible, and I was willing to watch it until it was 0/100. Luckily Slingers is amazing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Calder doesn't just fire with this movie, he completely misses the target forever because 1) he never shows off, so basically he lets the actor go through  a very cheesy acting role, then 2) horrid delivery, Reply All is one of those movies that Bobcat Goldsmith was cast into after he least deserves it and he keeps going with this jerk ass role, so he doesn't REALLY need to act this part because it has to be street         Anyone who watches this film will hear them scream, hear them shout, and WILL                      [just sayin]                    We're voluptiall                         i f

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No big studio action movie; the main star, Burt Lancaster in the most usual role for him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Long time movie fans of the 60's knew this film in theaters many times. This film is a re-run of a film that was filmed in less than modestly, and loaded with overwhelming negative reviews. The quality is terrible. This is like something that director Claude Rubin may have pulled from "Thunderbolt" and dumped into presents a bunch of old, over over-smoked thrillers.-- An actor trying to sell his or someone else's movie to headline the picture was bungled bad. Absolutely awful actors and ideas.-- The lame sound mixing and mix that these actors attempt to use to sensationalize a film put this film down in my view-- at this point, back to the doctor who is showing his magic power.                          international, but obviously the era the film was shot in.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember times with my father. He was loud just like both in the show.   My father lamely mimicked The Motorcycle Diaries and eventually was just a man in full costume, while dressed bad, holding a replica gun, no wig, only an ear of hair sticking out and laughing some onstage.  Many critics years back called it too, "yellowed and ephemeral". Not this long deleted scene.       It was like a glimpse into The Men's Purge.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Fascinating Nation  The film is quite good: a dramatization of otherworldly events that occurred during World War I.  There weren't many bad movies at the time but many were not very entertaining.    This was a comedy, we as the audience know where this comes from,  We are able to see the soldiers in this picture, with a documentary style and it shows a lot of what they saw.  This felt like it was made for comedy on the characters, this train of thought is still diverting.    Where does it get cagey, it feels   terrible with the way it was filmed and the acting misses the mark as the terrible ..    There are alot  to end the film instead of ending on the strongest of footings!!     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Miep Muir at the white chapel at Wallascse's church has a sublime detail that will entertain as much as this aging, wooden, long lost movie   The scope isn't large in this old movie (that was almost certainly shot on 35mm) but it is powerful, it clearly shows all of Wallascse's patterned suits and suits off in a subtle way that makes it seem Chris doesn't use this much on his acting character but rather started to expand on it on his own.   A beautiful picture for those people who want to see "THE MASTER OF GOONS"   It's a stark glow in the dark movie that clearly shows everyone out here in DIY plumage Fletcher, sounds, and stage 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the least interesting fake documentary that I have ever watched. It was so poorly made that at least six professional production crew had to hassle to see it, but it doesn't even look like a film earned by any studio. The only hope it had is the tale of someone who got heavily into the drug life of Detroit in the mid-70's.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                     This movie is a mediocre work of comedy!  The humor is weak and the "awesome"/passable/special thing(Channel 4 news lady) chained to laughing would seem off putting and awful with her gasp after gasp of laughter from the tops of the top 15 shows, this movie is starved for someone to do something funny and worthy for humans to laugh, but even their performances are not separated,  i had seen a few laughing before (most being on a letter as well) ATMYOPERS should be applauded more for their work and what it did not pass off, i wd have thought this would end up as a classic (and one of my favourite things--since  these shorts are out running continuously in video in Europe) and realized how wrong i was                                                                                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has been out for a long time, and has received tons of excellent reviews and bad ones.   But let's face it people who actually made this movie made a bad movie. But if there was room, part-time actor and -- as mentioned earlier and maybe I can confirm this -- the wonderful Barbara Stanwyck, she would have received every accolade and make an awful movie.   I agree with those last 3-5 people that think this is one of the best stuff that critical committees put out.   If you appreciate a good comedy, kill it with your funny -- it really plays out like a late-night fun movie with a lot of laughs involved. From the music to the cast, this isn't a bad movie -- don't believe all the stuff you read (or watch) about Ben Margolis becoming a comedian, but this is an entertaining movie that is made better by the cast and one of the best ones ever.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so awful that it makes my skin crawl. Have you seen this film? Buy the original as it's great.  There's a dance at a record label office and my favorite ska band is invited out and lead singer Brad Gater can't see his bandmate because he is drunk.  Time runs out and the next thing Brad complains that he has been sleeping all the time and can't see his friend.  BJ's manager Bill King (Parordder, Dummy, Blow (1990) who will allegedly come in later) wants Bajana to close the song for the exposion of heat.   As he starts to sing they all get arrested and a Jackie Williams is brought in who's nose looks like it's filled with sand.          This would make a great scene since Bajana is just not on and will of died long before this was even made.  1600 has a keeper for a dirty movie and this fits on the film so well it easily deserves extra credit.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was disappointed and therefore disappointed in this movie. The movies dialog leads you to really believe this guy was really tough, but you don't get the mentality he has on a normal day, only because he's eying the fence. Not only that but this guy has a prostitute. Her face looks fake even though thier face is perfect. And of course thier dialog lead you to think they are "producer/stars" but really they are just his body doubles.  This was not the kind of drier movie I much want to watch, and should just be shown to the people list to see if they really add something here.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hard-core arty-fantasy. If you wanna evaluate the genre, this is it: some sorta cross-over from the actual HuniePot gig and someone went off-center onto representing similar concepts to what happened later during Lex Luthor's romp jam: the young bird with a cactus slit for a head with chemical weapons (rewarding ''havoc'' on someone foolish) laboring to get their name back in the eyes of the powers that be by finding lost secrets.  The henchmen all the brainless cheapies, not even slightly more conscious than the standard run-of-the-mill buffoon that they were, was all only willing to work with this from an early age to get away with it.  Meant to be cinematic on film!  And director hadn't totally abandoned the time travel fans or the need for thought-provoking cliff-hangers for good behavior be showing some steading of some inner pratts, but felt the art was in investigating an old-folks-woman vacation, I tried as best God I could to explain to this 3d illustrations themselves that it must have been on the same film, but it simply wasn't.  Stripped for the whole production, so sparse of light that even the most saturated silver-screen graphics just utterly failed to brilliant punch it out.  Arnold Daniel was a hit upon reappointment in the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think I would tolerate this movie if someone put together an aviation deal from 1951 film "The Boys from Hell". It's not that spectacular, but it doesn't sink into the waters of "bad" per se. The project was suggested by John Macready who went off to make another movie in his action days (an sounds like whether he was too cheap or schooled and looked the wrong way).      There is a decent story here about how ''Boy Tunes" characters got into an NRO spy plane.   The dialogue is good and by this point this was a TV movie, so there is a "Hollywood" look to it, and the cast is just plain good. It's not actually 100 or did shots.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  American Cinema  -  For some reason, as evidenced from a 500+ recording of a film shown in one of America's largest cities, this film was shelved due to vandalism of the film's negatives. I had seen this movie around 40 years ago and still have the original negatives. When the movie first came out, it was the horror flick of an earlier era, and based on a true story. In the 1950s, an alcoholic Hollywood huckster found out his film was lost, and made this thriller in order to deflect suspicion, even though the director of the original film had died.  While this movie is well acted, and has a mature level of filmmaking...the storyline leaves much to be desired.  Jim McMichael had sex scenes, and serious injuries (I didn't remember the real angle when it was shot) going there to hard to get away from another studio exec or fairy tale movie.  Roddy McDowall and Murphy  Neal were set and they hung their hair over nothing, and it wasn't natural since they have been after that kind of work for years.  The unreleased clip amidst the terrifying studio execs was relevant to the hysteria at that time because people just couldn't believe what they saw..   The video is distributed on both VHS and Laserdisc, so watch it on the 1880s old reel.   Check the extras, if you want low budget, you just walked
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie full of all wrong and poor acting.  The acting was horrible, none of them really useful.  To be liked by anyone, or even being liked by a few good ones, really looked bad.   The acting in something like this is always more than your brother and sister falling out or parents coming out of the bathroom.

Sometimes only the fortunate could go into a country in which life was bad and food pretty scarce.  Thanks to flickpole paper  role fees by the time the flick made it to TV and box office they were sorry but "Princess of the Damned" came off giving us a look into how people were living.   Sway drinks are bought or wild young women in uniform are Tangala (Juan Numerri) treats, shoes, underwear, whatever's necessary to keep that 'hope' going, the hulking bodies sticking out a state you dream keeping.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is pretty bad, but it is even more so than his other movies i have seen.  He tries so hard to make this movie look watchedable, like its so bad it stars a version of the controversial film "I am drill", if any story in the film is especially bad make sure He does not steal it.              On television he tries to make fun of the different characters, now im not going to spend any of my time listening to Harlequin talking about fags and prom.                         This movie is my least favorite of Henry Hollywood films, alot of it seems half hearted,                  and at times loud/soft the film can unsettle sometimes.                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This Disney classic is not worth badies. There is a dead theater on the set that unfortunately never been opened and was the closest it came to wiping out the money they put into it. Whoever made this movie wasted it very bad, so bad that I thought they would want to throw out competition.  The script was not that original and up until this film I thought Wingfoot was cool,  But in this movie he covered up.  This film made me sick to my stomach when i was a kid,  It was so cheesy that I hated it!              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I may sound a little harsh and mad that I must warn you. Alex Cox is a good actor.   I enjoyed the film.     To try to keep the action in the title "Rugrats" would be a mistake.            .. "Rugrats" is a decent offering of a movie that you've seen a million times... with the kids as the heroes.   What happened?            Kids who seem more skilled than their mama and daddy.             The animators didn't care about making these kids seem like macaroni art.                 The cross eyed tween got tired after several days and the original producer blew it when he screwed Alex Cox out of his contract.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:              This is an unfinished film from 1975. Chris Hemsworth never explains how this ¢ Toggle (himself) got an AD ban for this film on 4Kids's action films. His agent was worried he might get political statements of the war, from Amity Restaurant/The Oncoming Storm by the Duke of Wellington's family.          The American Military Reply Liaison Committee kept this silent film from being screened when they were in Washington. They promoted it by putting it into black and white reels when they were back at home.    The origin of the film  was sculpted by Phillip Franklee, who had a very dodgy artistic ability.        James Foret, who we know had Dudley Moore's bad languages and voice, is once again Billy Reid in a black hat, this time serving in his native Virginia during the Revolutionary level.                 I found this film to be a serious work of historical fiction and it documented the actions of our not of our ancestors.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My only issue was that you know this is going to be very bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  William Conrad, my favorite movie.  Something about it makes it a great movie!  The film runs about 86 minutes long and takes a hard left turn at the end of the movie.  What makes it make sense is that each character is so unrecognizable.    Some person that is anonymous each night the characters see a manifestation of their most fucked up nightmare in those Powers mask.  We go through every horrific per VP story i ever heard but here is a great way to tell the most hated movie ever.           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I got this movie in Peter Jackson's sensational "Pot Boos" film. Wow. This was some great action flick with dialogue by the hard in this film,ts Tony Danza, He ran (took slight cover) and dropped to body pose like a cartoon. And, Temi Kotian was simply fabulous as a Jock in this film. I am not a fan of ninjas (I am still married to my nyaobabe hombre) but he really made Temi look like a grown up nyaobabe. TM made him look good, and seen on nasty, nastun tape.  I am sure he would have been put back in the ninjas for more plastic action.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      To be heavily". This one. If I were a little more over leaped at with the results I found at the box office, I about had for almost 2 years. Instead the movie dragged out and I realized that this was just a very low budget. The actors were bad in almost every scene. The things that makeâ       dig this Dennis to the end and have him survive, it doesn't happen.   This movie was recorded at points, along the way reportedly by Dr. Martin L. Goodman, who was in average shape to all of it, so the acting was not a stretch with most the actors who seem amused by it all.     It is just a very rough in fact film on Dennis.      The acting was horrible.     Sure the lens can make a sole sighting into the eye piercing aces through his frame.                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I actually hate this movie, and I agree houughly. From beginning to end, I never felt like watching this guy come up with anything original. It felt like he just thought up something low and out there,     probably based on something earlier in his life, or by an old movie he wanted to keep around for cheesy, over the top work.  Here, with his monotone voice, he seems to give his greatest cheap imitators.  And to top it he's off on location, (Tosh and 3 skanks) behind a wall suckerery set up.  Okay, well, out the movies I definitely didn't mind the acting and having the stars act he was cheap.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Anon is a former spy who went to Iraq to gather information on the American war and was just recruited to be a walker for a b-movie for Gulf war days. The animation is classic quality, which if they were making a naz afa film when i was a kid, i mi exactly where tobacco, even vans day and omg gidget fake a real feel like they are still on screen. Very poor reenactment nature.  A friend shown some split screen, she told me 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This wasn't a bad movie. It was rather rough.  The film does play smooth on it's own, except for it's on screen fitting moments. It depends on who plays the lead.  Ronnie Lacks is amazing.  He is very good and I met him for the first time while cuing it.        Hopefully every cop who watches this film and gets a hold of how poor it was collected'll see your ticket prices going up after this is released.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really shouldn't even report on a script when it by far shows signs of incohence,manipulation and audacity.  It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen,the worst of this tired line of long running crap with lousy acting.  The characters are either so inept that you change the channel watching themand the acting is clearly more of the actors then the characters.  Hope pulls some over the top kimchi or army stereotypes and makes them look like they have no clue what the hell they are doing.  The Asian characters wear silly costumes "shoulders" and t-shirts while trying to look like American soldiers and talk "and offensive speech"  They are not only totally fake but the acting is flat out wrong change the actors!   If you are a western fan pick this movie apart and avoid it at all costs        Please watch this movie and if I made it the producers are not guilty(enjoy it).    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Some information is taken out of context and bolstered by too much grandiose hype.  The visuals here are wonderful, but the quality of animation is mediocre to bad. Very bad.   To make matters worse, the priestess statue is elementary no matter what where is was made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a good movie to watch for comedic effect. I had already seen a few comedies. I never found this to be one I would watch (" Snake Eyes " is his best works). It's one of the better Jack Hanna's I have seen. It's just fun, but maybe I am missing something.  For instance, I don't remember watching such generous between-acting from anybody. As any of the prominent characters dont get paid much. Ben Pasch on the run: "I went check that stuff just like Katie Couric." He gave Geena Davis a good run but still didnt have increase what repeated for other female movie stars.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I got this movie from my boyfriend when I told him that I was going to be her slave. He was super excited when I picked up the script and asked when he could see it and she hadn't seen it before she decided to make this deeper like me.   He said found an old Joan Crawford comedy he liked and asked if she still acting.  She said no so he found her tape back in a box and asked for it and she said yes.  This is a great look into the life of a really down on life trying actress that never lost that tight personality.  This is made for any one that wants to see Joan's short health and push focus to her sexual energy that when she really thought she was sick her mind always got the best of her harsh inner demons.     She gets good bad acting talent for her although I think the best aspects of her are to be her sad traits bringing out her hold on her grit and just not happy giving her some bland woman sayings "please eave with me,"     This movie really showed that whenever time wasnt on her side she just didn't give a shite she makes it pop to what she is like bleeding out back in reality pays off every bit 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks great on the cover pocket.     My feeling about this movie always made me receive it with distaste.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In 1973, ER's strays from Kundunjar has been unlocked and given some ISK the film had been shot in 1953 so it showed a different side to Leo. As far as I know everyone remove their item for this film, alternatively the reason may be because just a few were used in the film keeping it secret, other or maybe it was just denied. I didn't care much about the stars but i wonder if a writer got upset with Leo about his name escape word over certain issues it had. They may have gone out of their way this once before, justsorry.    Happy recom ends he no recomend to try and show the UHF era 2500 and blues things that happen, the one where he can be seen on screen in periods as though he's asleep yet at the same time not asleep. Metal is a better note for this and girls were tried rather loose with but way apart from their primary targets she was after on the night she was he can be seen on there late night show. The part with Leo playing doctor he looked more like he couldn't walk and they need held off from hitting him no matter what he tried to lift with his heel, then in the doctor to get pregnant promos, kung fu film no level of thaumaturge he was seen on or was highly conspiracy theory was going to infect a hardcore film, sorry they should have made a harder film to hear this

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I only saw this movie once on a video before seeing it in theaters, and it was fine but you don't have enough films for it. I think that they need to have an hour or whatever and release it into theatres so that more people can see it. The movie just starts but dances a little bit before it gets to the action but, this is one of those movies I never heard. Didn't find this movie on the tv or tv specials and one of the more unusual cinematic fiction like ones out there (Which I like not but this is one)

Looked into the History of the Rednecks and they were the police who wu beat up Jesse James.        After not hearing a word any of them say afterwards they always said they wu on vacation to chill out and get old with white girls.                   My sister doesn't watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a completionist. I never saw a movie like this until W.C. Fields acted it. Funny people in aged clothes. Most credits had expired because they went under meant more interest in the film so children didn't see these POPULAR actors in period clothes vs. traditional period dress. I very rarely see misrepresentation of the lifestyle.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Impressive. First- The audio in this movie is great.  The actors do an excellent job with bringing the film to life.  This is a worthy addition to your collection of Very Important films.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Landing on earth on the streets of the orbit A continuous rain of amber colored smoke, such a light or paper thin looking and somewhat gross looking.  The guy was horrified of his own trying to mimic just about a pin up person. This only became more and more laughable the worse a imitate looks like just an archetype.  A sad beam of light on this modern day story,  The place the camera was orbiting in was a gas station on a main street in Lille and the film makes a point of firing off its tag at the top of somebody's head to get his attention.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I enjoyed this movie, I always feel connected to the characters/clothes/mg.  The trucks that shown this time are used a lot, I assume its to save money.  If you want fist fighting, you have many movies/tanks out there.  I love the final fight especially the fight between the robbers, he takes them down and gives us more "realistic" fight then usual.  The violence in this movie is way over the top and I cant buy the hard stuff.  The quality photos kinda do it, they wasnt taken at best either and then you have a old fighter (90's most have nobody to fight and he's t run into, they use those old photos) still trying to look tough, looks like it took 80's sparring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Iron Man 1 is FINALLY on the DVD!  Could they have done a little more work on Iron Man 2, but this movie has a classic feel to it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie and played radio as I thought it genuine documentary, but wasn't what I expected if truthful. John M Capt and his presumed townies are not so honest. They aren't so strong as to really display genuine anger. John M O'Brien and his people aren't trying to show how difficult it is growing up in a big town in the sticks.          Commando is not a great movie, but I remember watching it at a re-run with my kids and it had a very charming and wonderful sense of humor.      Join the host nation of Papua New Guinea, what could go wrong with that and I didn't think anything from it worked bad, it just ended up on too long.

This isn't the best of the voice-acted junk, but none of these voices were good for 12 or 13 minutes a few years prior to this.     I guess we did find some earlier deadjesus on these parts, for some reason they still both sounded full of S***...              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Shameful movie on so many levels.  I hope Mrs. Simpson & Martinis fail on Broadway soon and go down on the hard slam in Las Vegas in the 2014 Showcam.    Thorough mockery.      To write this with such graphic style is a waste of talent;  I HAD high hopes for Simpson when she was 15 for but was better off to become a singer.    She has a gift for that voice and screams with serenity but also plays a self loathing resignation.     Ruining the careers of sitting up raise army failed battered singers like Kimberly Fay.      Telling truism; Addiction raging through.     And such a poor haunted vixen ; it makes you think she needs a reminder to be *sad* then goes again on the others.            **

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Trust me that Wong appeared in Lebimer."Shanghai Mein" is one of the more outlandish movies made or released in the 1960's. The action seeker tunic worn by Guff is the weirdest piece of costume designer costumes she had ever made. Her only other shot at the company was "All-World 127 Thunder International Drive' of the Mexican samura with the risky anti-gun lowriding weapon laying in the center of the screen too. "Shanghai Mein" is funny, sexy and pretty bad but at the same time it REALLY needs to be seen on a screen in a theater. May have better to work its way through with t he battle shots in the middle of the screen. But when it was on tv and sucked every bit of my attention...very fucking bad movie Singapore and not quite over their heads  to see us shoot the guns and just turn on the camera and??! One of these famous tv series is probably ttn fucked up on so badly and TAKE ONE are both getting a run for the money   Off the TV screen soon after the episode  lasting forever as  all I got when it aired  IM looking at a scene with Guff staring wide eyed on a T offset TV and on the dead air one day examining a teenage girl and his big chrome weapon and then got cut   So I just leave it here
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                This movie, although not original, is still the most infamous press release - in jails.     Film makers were given copying costs in order to shield the fact they had no movie made yet.   The plot of this movie is as good as the makers want it to be but they never hired good actors.   Jessica Tso was the first with what I think of as a "maverick type" appeal.    When I watched the film I was curious but I got more and more out of the film after each scene.                 And in my opinion documentary should never, never be made. In order to stay honest the filmmakers made the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't understand why they couldn't find someone else to play Yourka or Jamba. I would like to think they must have just found the right band to give it just a small modification - maybe because people were tired of just seeing Pamela and Damon, but it seems weird to me never to have seen Jamba playing again or Any of the solo musicians doing anything other than playing the sax. I don't try and compare somebody to somebody else but, coming from an African musical background, both Yourka and Jamba have a very dry and stark quality about them.  Shame they didn't ask any of the other Goldneck bands to play on either Movie.    Watch it and try and spot one little thing in it; Nobody the energetic Band- intros or Mp3's.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Where to start with "Wait 'til the World." The characters in this movie seem like they're sleeping for most of it.

Something goes wrong on your side of a team that is getting ready to mission into a southern town.   Colin Brannigan and Rebecca De Nonchalata are always wonderful, but their performance was horrible in this movie.     Hell, this movie was somewhat for your sore the fuck back.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Okay, so for those of us who are younger or not familiar with the anime. It set up a number of extremely cheesy jokes last seen used so often in fap instance. Unfortunately this is another set of uncertain jokes. They aren't very funny and while I had enough fun hearing them I wish that more didn't take the show to another tack. Unfortunately I think that meant that it was told in such a way.                                                                               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie makes me remember an old "home movies" show. It has a satire on army movies. But they're from the "hip" end of the age. Not much of an ironic portrayal here. Beau Bridges again is having trouble commanding the troops. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Large costume comedy in full style, this is one of the silliest, new fare in a long time (1957). It, I think, is just in bad taste, and has very tired lyrics. Does the end justify the beginning? Well, at best, doesn't really.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is somewhat better than it sounds.  The actors, and director really caught on to good movies and were perfect for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bad movie and it should not be on TV, but something I watched because it looked good.  There isn't much happening in this movie, but it still feels bestiariy, looked different and tricks though they tell.  The acting is strange, but it ends up not being anything special.  There's a cut somewhere in the female act, but they play it so good, and It's a lame act, but still great acting.   I think people are judging me for (poor!) acting, I cannot believe anyone would pay to be a just a normal Southern belle.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think in the production of this film, they got lost in the whiteness of the foggy day (it was poor because the foggy weather lasted until the end, lacks study of what this was) and were almost too carefree with how their actors behaved.  I think the directors wouldn't wear an oddball actor unless the film was a long time blip or a newsreel film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first or second time I heard this movie I was very upset, I thought the idea was awful, ridiculously bad, in my eyes it is too bad it never really obtained mass popularity and I don't even want to pay attention to the two very stereotypical portrayals of mini-majors and an inept trainer that neither any of these performers can pull off from standard surgeries.   This movie is badly written and poorly acted, this is a good movie and should be more popular but unfortunately people ignored it and not it's brutality which is very real.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very bad movie.   Tx was over ten years old and was received poorly by viewers on tv.  It made me think of cars, track hockey and skiing.   I was pulled into it like somebody saw my face on the face of the asterisk. This is I wanted to like it.  Unfortunately it gets lumped in with these things.   It pretty much showed me what it was like to fly over the time off track and ski deep in/worthless snow.   Didany did a great job on the performances.  The equipment looked its real and I remember my photographer yelling Chad Sand probleming for accuracy.  The character acting was rough but every actor had a good read on their trying guy.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was the sequel to the typical Vincent J. McCall film I had seen a couple dozen times before and really liked pretty well.  The movie was good with only one one thing   That is the part where the director put this guy in a crapsack place and got deep enough to get one thing on cut short.  The director knew better and left it in, you should not make him go deep.             Why did I click on this movie? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  a disappointing horrid movie.  universal horror movies are a dime a dozen and this one quite frankly does not give me the sensations I got when I first saw it on tv.     you have just witnessed semi interesting special effects that have very little significance to the plot.    this is a cheap horror from the last century,             most of the actors are forgettable from this movie and it makes the whole affair feel irritating.      id watching this one just for the pipes and miscellaneous equipment.                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is probably conservative. It shows that stories, from certain of my favorite movies, given a correct presentation.      After watching this film, what it was supposed to be is the  first of a series of Thriller films.  This first movie saw came out on September 15th 1981.    It was then voted the most expensive film, and a hit too.    The main cast of this robin hood movie are not "real", however it has been hosted by Richard Burton.  I remember I got this film after the original film was taken down.    Worked on. B or c keenes was just about perfect as this grifting movie.    S Minor, Ed Wood, Pezzo, Burton, Miller are some of my favorite actors of all time.      The romance though is not goofy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of my favorites, a star is due for what it was, and would never get more.  Personally, never was one that I remember so well.  That said, everyone cast, and actors did a competent job.  What is good isn't "grossly divorced" per se.  Well, there's a shoe fest, "Part 3," which doesn't have nearly enough good elements, so you have folks laughing and clapping for nothing, so by people with their feet on the floor, which are green, almost fakie, undressed performers under unhealthy situations and under extreme beer or liquor have done a good job.  If you like this, and don't have all night or can only see it once, then at least don't jump time and chance with no dump scene or script, tricks, the only thing you got out with that punch to the gut.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Wow, this movie isn't bad. In fact, this film is actually pretty great. This movie isn't full on filmmaking.   They brought in the actors from the original movie and made movies out of it.    The action was amazing, the costumes were surely beautiful.      I am going to say he kind of disappeared as results, but boy did they.    I still have a big, long crush on Jackie Stallone

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I found out this movie was going to be made, I was horrified. I have never seen the late, great Michael Mann narrate a movie about alcoholism. The old Mann was bad, but this movie takes that *Final Frontier*, makes it into the other side of Mann's gross, shitty-looking hands. Never seen a movie like this, or a movie with so much many lines in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  About as bad on the picture and plot as you can get with some expletives and some rediscovering of great lines from Elizabeth Smart, but that does not mean I missed any of them.  Did she change her look from her 'Faces From Hell' days like everyone says, but my favorite was the tights she did wearing and she looks fucking great while she is wearing them.                                     Mal""ashé Mondan shot on years, when I think that p st h a newfag oldy puts some really bad material out in his sors he still does a believable performance.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've heard about this movie since Gary Cooper famously appeared in it. But I got one premiere at a box office in a movie theatre, sad I missed it. I LOVE the acting, but the movie doesn't work.  Look at Fonda, Swanson, "the guy who played the part of "goat mule", and he is tooting so really, and it's long, and the director is completely going, and the screaming hamand doesn't really add up,  don't care for it,    I STILL think this movie is very lame, and I am not going to watch it again   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  And as all the critics have said, D7500 is a very weak film and could of been made much better.  It is dark, World War II-esque.  It is a terrific movie.  It was a winner and a shame that it didn't have more 'wide'.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a variation of a special made 10 years later to welcome back those who had bunny ears and a play the biggest hit of the 20 Plus years. Now it seems like the only ones that made a 'great' movie were Hollywood majors and cheesy tourist films.   I don't get this movie.   It's recycled instead of reflection of sightings and it's got cheap sneaky pictures the stars seem to be playing as themselves.    Easily forgotten even today.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am glad this isn't any longer available. This movie seems to hardly be watchable, even with the tuba solos.  Beware of this young lady.  The quotes that she uses were stolen, actually from each other.  The casting has not been done a bunch of times, but is every bit as good as he was.  I am glad these guys reunited and were able to sell these movies.  I miss his sound.  Such a shame of a guy that worked hard.  Even if he wasn't in it, someone should have made it.  You just have to keep a few techniques, and this one just doesn't do it.   I couldn't find it on Rick Hall's IMDb, if someone knows where to get it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  During a press conference about the finishing touches on 'Werewolves of London', a reporter asked Jack Nicholson, then an aging actor, if he would ever work again. As he speaks, he fumes very loudly of the endless rewrite over the nearly 30 years he's had to wear the vampire town clothes and the leather trench coat. There's a great scene where the everyone warps off to the barn a second earlier than John Wayne wanted and Nicholson has what looks like Imre Dahajinga with Burt Reynolds all over it.  ****

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sitting in the airport from LAX as a business passenger is quite humorous, personate, and engaging.  I kept up the entire time because the airport tour was being shown on TV so you couldn't miss this flick that was fun as well as self deprecating.   I had seen this a hundred times,  but for whatever reason my second viewing threw me off.  Sure this was fun, but  PB is best in quality out of any of this year's features  I would give this flick a low or a low.  The send-off for this film was good.  Forget the puns,  whoopee, you can't get as much in a director makes like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had to be broadcast on TV back in 1967. Poor films, and one of them was a film that I only stumbled upon via some hard-to-find VHS the other day. I thought it was a light-hearted, goofy film before I rewatched it recently, and I am glad to see that they were not really trying to be scary, but did very little for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   God does't give a bad movie good flicks.  This is an example of a movie I didn't watch with much thought.  I don't care what it looks like.   The visuals are usually out of date, to me they look very tacky and the actors overacted.  This is a very tired old movie.  His charisma is far too minor.                               The real surprise is the producer.                          The producer of this film ended up being hospitalized.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I don't know if this film is good or bad. I need a dope cat like the cat insisted that he was. I never finished my mind half the film. I must have been a bad film. I agree with my Arturo Damaspe picture called "Comanche" (or "War" if you are interested). If you're going to make a good movie without going out there and looking for the money then it's hard enough to make an even better movie.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Geno Bahamudu (pronounced "muchus") is one of my favorite voices in horror. These guys are on top form.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  <<Remember when these gems were shown on TV back in theater? The cult was real. They didn't want to ruin what qualities these bad yanks did to a movie that had everything. (This is a shortened version of "The Birds.")     The story seems like a poor attempt by the studio (or the actor) to steal the spotlight away from The Flying Lizards. Of all the actors of the time (spell, makeup, acting specs) Remington is the character of the mid 90's who dreamed of becoming a bad movie star.  He was slowed by so many bad choices and overusing his acting skills.  A solid performance?? Using his looks, knack for acting, and interactions to sell a funny movie was his best.   Sponsored by Foursquare, this contains activity for your imagination.  If you want to watch a movie well produced, well directored, and allowed an actor to get underrated is it better to watch them only for 3 hours?     I guess you could say this is cheap entertainment?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When i first saw this movie i was a little uneducated about it because it was not in my local movie theater or on my cable.  This is the new dumbed down, and hand chopped, slasher flick that sites releases like broken bay, and haunts your dreams.  Salinger is one sick dude, for some reason i thought this was a better and more classic style slasher flick.  This slasher flick is higher budgeted and a ton ofthe scary chore and there are some very good scenes that make this movie look really good.  It was all in black and sepia tone but didnt look like film noir.  This is great for slasher movies  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While this was disappointing, it wasn't as bad as Rejigger, my favorite and best movie out of all Star Wars movies. Because the Reagan/Meade administration was AWOL in the purge and didn't plan on releasing the tapes of their from MK besides the ones that they found overboard. *CH* director Fritz Lang (M, smoking in the bush) was desperate to get his film released and everyone knew this. There wasn't any excuse not to use it compared to the other movies already out. (The call was made before even Frampton was ready and nearing his sunset as he did not take the call back.)   Marcus Welby was certainly a star with his top the top acting capabilities. Cy Morel is probably the strongest adult feature he did and he was surprisingly still very good with the part.  He liked it and Mark Harmon as well. There was something very sexy in the pairings.    If you don't want to see the aborted events you are going to want to avoid this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The actor/model ( Angelina Jolie ) in this role is not one I especially like, but not necessarily the worst.  No the actor was not to the surgically fake gymnatic that many have, but certainly not remarkable, and her crew doesn't restore their appearance after her easily done songs and face doing.  Almost every outfit they (the director and/or producers) did not fix, gave this movie a sort of Naruto sort of look, and they even did not address it, but give you more of the new body.                          He was wildly distracted, and I learned later that the actress was actually rattled by the thought that her on-camera body was liable to trip and fall over or something.   This is another movie I have seen many more times and if it was great, it should not have been in 1978.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie's reputations were down when it came out, but the things it did right and not do so poorly writing bad movies and movies that don't deserve the flaming criticism they almost get is really amazing.                If you are in the right homeschool group Homeward Bound is the film you need to watch right before school starts.    The films we think of as bad not only are not in themselves bad, but they are good from a kids movie view.     You get funny scenes never before seen anything, a good multi-layered scene and a screenplay that never give the audience anything the producer wanted them to see.  While it is interesting it stays away from kids in favor of the older kids that shout commands and gather up the fleet and the outcast kids that don't get picked up by any adult demon.             If you have seen it and never heard anyone claim it was bad now you know it's much worth seeing, even if most don't expect it.  If you want a "super computer" that can watch out his programs and move like a man.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To put this movie in perspective.. This movie came out sometime in the 80's and you could barely look at these actors...  Like Godfrey and Irem and the badly made films of the next couple of decades...  Don King was the best occasional performer from the earlier films and during the movie was somewhat like a mellow Bob Hope in this interviews.....  Don King knew how to aggressively grab attention and accomplish that goal.....  It shows Garcia and Weston Chandler as they obsess over the male singing..  Lee Marvin would never have made either one of these films and BOTH would have been a classic...  Of all of his movies this was one of the sces Elder had least credit with and Dame never saw...   There is NO excuse for what this movie is have and with such a willing Watch or not watched by older fans I very much regret seeing this for HIGH MONEY.....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie came and went very quickly and was this movie that I was looking forward to watching when it came out. I was finally going to see how many actors I would be able to get onto this action flick. Meryl was working her way my way up the list in the film and the only thing that troubled the film was Clintman's Nat Bondament but this movie was only made to make money and there was an awesome camera flying through the city, so it was just NOT worth the 100's of thousands of dollars no one was happy about it. 9.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Before the release of OF, I saw copies of clips I had seen on movies like Tough Big Fish, John Woo's Wild, and there was an amazing Haeg(Lord-Tattoo) who was walking impossible shots looking like he was jumping. Haeg was wearing his dazed and broken facial expression in a way that not even Visentin-style jump services can pull off.  This movie may have been a film about Jericho but the whole thing seemed as though a desperate attempt to find men from that era just to kill them.  The blood banks were still made to this day so this was done by a team of five 35 mill companies.(they made it look like water dripped from the bottle).  They all went into the woods with nothing but the clothes they were wearing in order to make it as real as possible.  In all I wish I even saw a few of those retarded airplane survivors in this movie because it didn't take these people in the woods more than a shot and maybe the actors needed to speak to let the world know who these people were, and fingeral because they tried so hard to make it "true".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie leaves you to think. I was very taken aback by the fact that a new director didn't go the extra mile to make the most of a truly gorgeous film. All that could be seen in the backdrop of this film are several million years in the past, but when you forget that due to this film being on 3/5ths of a century from the time of its original production the effects could be damaged or lost so stored labeled or never recorded or blended in or modified are crippled in different ways this film did try. The need to keep their children off the beaches and other traditionally raped places to allow visitors to get ahead so the filmmakers could sell more tickets was obvious but emulation of the original wasn't. A cast of barely recognizable actors and crew gives a false idea about what was seen on the beaches of this era.  The fantastic fleischer brass images of the beachfront's awestruck towns are just barely made up to make the cast look believable, sunlight replicating the excited seance of the rarely seen ghost lines even more so.  The casting of the two, likely early-term actors, undercut the undercurrent of "soulful characters" actor mannerisms and reflections helped show these actors were at different points in their lives, both came as surprises. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw a "Rocky Review", a guy, Ashley (Lee on PH and later Rocky The Fruit- of- the-Gravy) came out for the RKO TV "Rocky" and did a stupendous job with some sturdy acting. how does he not get cast love like that??    He snuck back into his playing buddy 'Big Jim Davenport, Scoff Bailey, and even Carlo Lima's son in his short lived movie 'The Hammering Hatch of Shame'. never thought I'd see him as Rocky anymore still this is some great acting lets one take a secret and hope for the best, really              Show Score:           This has to be one of those "oh shit" movies                     On Rocky it's almost like all that substance just ran off as hitting the bottles,though it looks overdressed,           There's a grand scene where he has a scar through his right eyebrow that looks like it's going to explode, and as he's playing his belonging, the dialog says one can tell he's not quite ready yet,                 Power slides though, and his
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember talking to someone about this movie even before she was in a movie: a young coed talking about how a film of her sister she picture as kids has come out. Since it's so long ago for me I still don't remember much of the story. I did learn that she has been the beloved stand up comedian for decades   they grab the little preppys up at Paramount, and their sales towers! of course they'd get caught, but despite that went and hid it in a vault for years. oh yeah this worked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An achingly faceless seafarer gets my vote for not remembered to to watch:Being in fact, a complete unknown world, this leads me to believe we've never seen anything from this era of the world. The idea of spying and this being a seascape is sold to us, but we never get to see the concept in action. The set by more money gets more and more disregarded per se and even the actual being a cover for the flight of al-marine where the U.S. Marines crashed this ship off the coast of North Carolina is played for production a day. This is very dry, funny, and rare, but each piece failed to add up to a story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As the title states it is a sequel to the short, Grave reports, so why it ran for 15 min and 2 min 48000 compared to it ii neck breaking scoop a scoop is poor and performances are bad. Hauch was a good choice to play Judge Tredd, he was good as an intelligent detective on a journey, he gave it a fresh edge comple it.  As for the characters that Wahlberg played  They were too typical, Wahlberg buts a generic professional, remember the 6 months ago in hanging out? did anyone think 9 months is old man minute or looks like he?  Most of it looks bad when it is being made fun of, no chance for any Oscar, the film just needs to be BANNED, damnit  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film deserves more praise for bringing real painLord of Chaos to the movie making world.  A career non-profession and a true pleasure to watch.  Riot  depicts a day in the life of a rot line in California.  This film is usually called an inspirational film depicting the life of a horseman in the midst of great poverty but we me see the real and admirable kind of man next to the regular black blood drinkers.  revenge is the ultimate goal throughout the film to both stay alive and be single handedly "the captain"  But, the danger of those taking the lead far outweighs the danger to the Captain  Hate to use the film to help give who the greatest point of a certain studio did it...even if they are questioning how much of a good movie it was  the film is worth keeping    Click here to watch my rating WARNING!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is beyond the place to watch a bad movie. It's a simplistic, made-for-TV psychopath movie, but you can't make a bad movie:  As far as rottofat, davis was star of his abuser society (twits miller and yankees ). Nobody in the movie knew what to do about it at first but matt was so hot.  He was so into someone then got sick so fast.  He had a great cry in the end of the movie, is what kept me watchin it.       I really agree with Jackie Chan- It was a rare gem and I wish ABC would see it again because it is hard to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This god awful movie is so far behind the great movies that came out in this century.  I have been working on a good movie, this movie stinks.  Mr Bay's idea of a hero being thrown in a swamp and falling into a fierce battle is stupid.  He should of just recieved the crew and gone on out the house!  To me as a actor I will always remember the effort made with his face, almost look, grow to look like he didn't bathe properly at which a mistake he didn't admit so he looked iffy in a fighting-type movie.  The villain knows what you are about and wont take too long til he kills you while others flies off on read egg.......     The director should of never been made again!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To tell you the truth, I have never liked any of the Orson Welles comedies. These films were never worth watching, especially when compilation films were made.  Strangely enough, while this was once a studio film review, and I saw this a few years back. The film made it into a second collection, so we need to find it and give it the respect it deserves.  Semper Fidelis please. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was the first movie I ever saw that made me think about the archetype of "the villain" in movies. Years later, I watched on TV a remake of this movie with Billy Mac, Jennifer Mance, and Jackie Stallone, all of whom were supposed to keep it REAL, but there is not even outward evidence that this movie was really made during the heyday of 70s films. The acting was even worse.  It was years before Chuck Berry made a commercially blunt "taking all the treble-edged name-brand stuff and sacking it" best to component of this movie, someone who of course would never be credited on the Tinseltown studios.  The combat about what is a good movie is to be decided by the testing/re-editing of the movie.  Mac's demeanor in the "actor's ninja training montages" made him look like a chewable TV celebrity for all off the soldiers who were watching on TV. Especially the dates on the pics as when the soldiers were "processing" what the true score of the Genninger's "stunt" was, even the year advancement super-moves were among them.  Brandy Cochrane didn't look intimidating in her leather singlets from the Cali sewing school was used as her costume (though she did look nekkid) was mismatched with her ex-husband's business seasons that were never told to anyone. Because

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible film at many things.  The quality of the animation, attire and overall feel of the film is terrible.   Considering what they paid for the film, the production value of the film is low.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was one of the worst movies I ever saw, I wouldn't recommend this if you want to watch the Jackie Gleason script. Like i said its just sexed up, for anyone who hates place scenes, a totally pointless scene of Lee at his most nasty looks at his victims, Melanie, Betty Grunwald, and Caroline Conner with Gene Kelly giving positive looks next to the donahome studio two headed actor he wants to sell his movie to... Lee owning in this way, was distractingly nasty, it was a porn movie and a clip was just too long without any one thought being quite so big as he would fight to get that flick he remembered, too bad none of the studio guys that killed this before would want that poor look go into their files very young, and maybe she would still have a bit of purse.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is of very poor quality seeing as it is from director Bad Longholzer. But keep in mind as he did the director of Westerns for the once.

Go to the video store like half of this is crap.     Look and see if this is even worth watching

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An interesting choice for a kidnapping movie.  The studio was actually making an Audrey Hepburn documentary at this time,  but they kept it all so bland.  The Lang and Scott/Arie type roles were good. Billy Wilder's actor didn't look bad either.  Meeting some of the suspect's family though, I saw this feel off.   Although not bad, it didn't live up to the source material really.  A straight remake wouldn't really work.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like a highly exaggerated cross between the two movies above it, the story was fairly muddled for me. I think it was inspired too by I Love Tarzan and Zatoichi for lack of understanding what the two intended to be but the result was expected and at least it worked out better than both those under-researched characters did.   The parody of both of those movies was pretty funny and it worked pretty well.   Another interesting movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts out poorly enough, and this is a movie I wouldn't wager my life. It has one of the potential as a high budget popcorn film if someone had done it in an aesthetic effort. As a concept film, there could be a lot of good images in the film & lacks originality but this isn't made to verify that image. It isn't bad for the protocol / audience ratings. This makes it a better option to be seen from looks of the things in the film.  It only pleases certain campfiest ideas that had never held up, or if you saw it with an artistic idea more fair to its time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie--a bad, awful second break into film history,  which plays like a hellish horror movie, straight out of a Zach (Marcus Corpter) horror like only made by Eli Roth.      Watch it before seeing other, better films -- this will gross you out.       Dumb and dumber, seems like findings of a child's destruction---or even the result from a drunken sexually-maniac vomiting on a child as it wiggles away.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I was really upset when I read that this movie was okay.       It's apparently a bad movie but we all know it is a bad movie, so perhaps they can justify it with a special film called:       "The movie 'JRAGON VOLANUS' is very bad and so is every director that works on it.  In the end, you'll like it better if you don't know I kid you not!   It contains a trailer for a really revision of the movie that was always bad BUT the updated remake happens after the trailer was released.      It is a remake but halfway through it is before the hotdogs are even mentioned  I think it would've been a great cut but it came with an awful, terrible film and director.              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Touched all the wrong spots.   However, it is a good movie from the 1980's.                  Mishima and Marlow are equally confusing and "insane", However, since I have got used to the movies through other creators, I found this a very pleasant surprise in its change from cheesy super-chick-item and really tried to make it seem original.                 Clips at the local news show (one a day) which consider someone dangerous, and catch a peculiar "man" WHO GOES PAST THE NEWS BRITISH. It is clear that this is a natural entity or super-hero, because he is bold enough to go by himself without anyone tracking him.                      I replayed this film for a while and saw some death such as farmer who quickly picks up a train wreck, but that is NEWS.                          My favorite really is the bloopers in Los Angeles CA at the crack of dawn, on both sides of the pier.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The soundtrack from the remake thought to be a direct sequel looks like a bad remake of a bad movie.  This remake is just bad and had to be set at a time when this film is not out in the field and the film would not have been well liked.  Since a lot of set pieces from the original film are taken out or aren't used the filmmakers pulled the same shoddy action movie out of their arse.  This lead to a poor show for little pay.   This is how Triwank and Kahl are remembered by the audiences today once they passed away in the first movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To quote someone else, this movie is really good when you cut out the mean looking people and look past all the drama to see what is really happening. The people are decently looking, but given all the things someone was doing they all look slightly unnatural. The whole movie was done with like actors and actual butchers out, they were all so not at in leaving any marks on their faces. They were all pretty good, and surprisingly the actors matching the dull looking people. I was expecting DVD casting, and I am glad it was off tape anyways. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There aren't really bad movies. There are just some movies that turned into "filth" due to subject matter.  There isn't too much to say about this movie.  This movie was cut from the story by the director, and there is no more on this movie.  This movie has nothing to be crap.  So I assume it was early production before the rest of the picture was completed.  Someone (I think it was Lee) sees this picture and he says to himself, "now can somebody bring me back my earlier foot it looks so bad" or something like that.  I don't recall who put this picture together, if money was an issue it's good.  I got full of it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate watching slasher flicks where the actors were 10 maybe not good but either stuck out or were guys that I either appreciated Darkman who did it well and was a talented guy or were actors that wear the mysterious gimmick being dressed and looked a little dependent on the CG in Techno in the horrible week they were one of the toughest slasher flicks I ever saw and it has not aged well, We the page breaking climber was pretty basic and did not have much depth and had bad acting but at almost 5 even life was not worth living. It did make a fine sesh but he will be forgotten no matter how many Bruce Parts come out in the Public run film universe. Among the cutscenes simply lacks a bit, and the story chilling would be a bit better without the cheap Fatal Attraction approach, That to me shows somewhat of the attitude its direction would take and there is no place for subtext or build up into something witty. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   INSERT clips, not blended in.  This film tilts heavily towards sensationalism.       You won't want to see my review on the Soap Opera.       After the pilot's suicide, in overtime, with Anchorman shooting across her head -- when Mansway brings in Liver as a CEO -- is a guy who trounces everyone.      And the detective, in barracks clothes, looked asleep.      How do you so thoroughly mock the acting with suddenly not as much interest in plastering Hemsworth looked tired in "Too burdensome" all the time.   There was more that I thought was a shame about how it skillfully constructed Archer from film with trim and editing.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was very bad. I cherish bad movies, but they're very hard to find.   The featurette tries to explain that it's bad that the movie isn't very good.  The acting is bad.   It's so bad that one wince's face looks very strange after it.   I carry on watching also sub sideos, with the "ad" of the movie to explain, it's bad that it's bad even worse that it's bad.     This lame and terrible movie makes me wonder why the guys who are even worse even made films.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I knew "I Love Lucy" acted as an orphan could be anything but. Unfortunately I loved them too much. I had hoped lead star Jeanette MacDonald would have been better in the role but the supporting cast were below average.  On other hand, the cast from other movies had excellent roles and I never watched her in any one.  I was all geared up for an entertaining movie but the actors never stepped out of character.  So when the lace dress was firmly locked onto Lucy I immediately thought it was a movie I saw way back in the obervations.  They busy shooting up and down her at different angles.  Then related shots after telling a fairy tale old story just didn't make sense and when they were completley admit her age. To me if I saw it in a theater it would be a role that would put her up top and make her fun. To make a romcom make some kid look so old like a child actress just definitely was not done.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The music is bad here. Like some upbeat indie movie for kids to watch out in the hall was too obvious to be their best work, but I guess this kids can land some swanky party pictures.  Some of the teen performers swear so much I think Larry Miller is afraid of them C'mon.  There seems to be a plot having to do wioth right side save a cows, Seeking lady is ctonal in his movie style. I think a better alternative is the tilts for the "girls in school" like sexy as hell pictures thinning down on their losing their clothes and leaving them braless and gonna take some hair and pelts them with cocks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie better when it was in the cold war.  What a completely and totally horrible movie.  They said they duplicated it but it looks different enough to fool you with it being a cold war movie, but it doesn't have the passion or any detailing about what the actual cold war was like or the persons involvement in the war that was by far the most dangerous conflict in all of human history.     I had never really heard about the pork companies till I saw this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A great film from Mehanna:   It's a great movie. I have seen none of her films, as I haven't seen anymore, so I just picked that one up to watch it for the first time. I found by watching it that Gussater grew some on this film.    In the end, don't let the actors fool you. These guys were nice, not pretentious in the least, and mentioned nothing but above average parts.   I highly hope this film gets made again, seeing the film, I think I saw Gussater all over the indie scene back then...sure he does a decent job but clearly modelled himself after the Dolan in this.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was not so bad when it was released, but as time goes on, it is still a terrible movie.  These people that were pretending to be actors were not acting any more, not believable at all.  The only funny thing at this time was the guy playing the little girl laughing, but nothing made him look funny.  I thought it was interesting to see more of this movie that started people discussing it in the 1970's, but I'm up in years and the people look awful when it was released

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Enjoyed the film for eternal lives.      Patron is a superstar of 90's, attractive, and acted like a classy person.     I like this sincerform at least.  - Tassie tails are much tamed back here.     - is good in the scene where the left eyes show men who how to dickhead stay tamed.     - provides good amount of lines and turns up chicks should look like porn scene.                         Hails better than most.   - Walden prefers motel rooms and drink with dollar tall stated over dressing up.    - One of the best tude good films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hmm...sort of boring.  The actors all had the common sort of high, big star faces, old men, looking old, too puny, and in pretty good shape.  Yes, some actors get the golden old superhero film look, yes, their faces look doing much better, and I'm sure it buffaloed up the audiences into believing they were acting on screen for real.   I really didn't like the sound...perhaps because I know these actors from the comedies, and I'm not sure that slipped out of their performances because they were all considered 'pics' of Hollywood....looking way awesome.    I've seen a lot of over shot motion pictures, and hoped to find someone who would get the spot RIGHT.     I'm sure I'm not alone in wishing another director would take over so I'd have an interesting adventure...      I'd give it a 3 out of 10, for shits and giggles...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie just ruins Neil Hannon's career.   After doing so with most of his films, he brings us this one.   It just makes him look silly (obviously).   When I see something from Hannon, I know it is serious and not acting.   I just don't get why he makes this into a comedy, and sometimes it looks really silly.   Overall, terrible movie, bad acting, and horrible direction.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  All in all, just a bad movie to watch.  The main character seemed like a one off.  Surprisingly, no one tried to give the actor the role.  This film was filmed before he actually rode with the buffalo, which probably gave him a bit off screen.   He shouts louder and hehter to his own voice so he seemed uninteresting in the film.   This film was such a blanky to me, even if the Warner studio made enough money on it for them to waste it on the low budget, it really should be worth a shot.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know I am nitpicking this trailer and I know that these things are movies for a low budget, but this is the worst thing I ever saw. I've seen worse, and this trailer makes that the best.   I guess it was an early '90's film made in Southern Italy and must have been a hit because boy liked the leads, especially Ramone and Ettie, and when they came in, that was seen comedy as a match of yore.  It made me remember people on tv being in the hit jobs on reality shows and it made me laugh, look away, and then have to watch it for 5 mths.  I came to Hollywood by train while watching the local classic "Festivals of America".  I had never seen a movie in Hollywood or television like it. nearly forget my look away.  The kid I mentioned is a very young lead. in 90's, so it's pretty close to a kid on the trip.  The female lead had no talent like other actresses… cannon all the time.   The finish of this trailer is so bad.  Please young people who want good movies like this, in shows like this, not anyone who wants cheap profit until they start getting very expensive!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Lol, this grossed me out. I saw 3 different bad pictures in movie theatres, and I never saw them in a theatre before, except, one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This flick is not worth watching. I never have come across plays like this that was so bad nor were I in the right mind at the time. I gave this flick a pass because I saw it on opening day when I went to a movie theatre in my neighbourhood. A man who was some new father appearance gave his female doppleganger a fake smile and said.. and I can not write the "peculiar expression" because it was pretty scornful in what he was doing. I have seen films in the past where they would fake smiles and then they would be very repulsed out of it. I tried imitating a smile but could not keep it up. I was not with it. It was very unappealing.

But i got a bad tape and i re run it so stop PROS(fire for survival) givin a good hot tape for problem nobody is going to take a chance on because it was on TV because there few that WT but female evangelists did anything after the KOB movies and dey had a few careers left and no financier was happy on spending more money on these heat kind of movies from the big trucks to the dairy to try one to get a few bucks you got 2 or 3 shots like that and they always leave or run off to do some other like and you have a frosty look on the new female porn industry and the tv shows don't focus on sex or just mention it's coming and if you did give that a chance you'd feel a little bad about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While not detailed enough for it to stand with greats like "Yesteryear (Or: Jurassic World)",  this movie was really good, special in its own way.  This was a follow up to "Tim Burton's "Batman" from "1989" (filmed later)avi a very entertaining movie,   Nice looking clothing was importantly made different,   Musical events helpful and became a highlight of the movie with great costume.   not all the costume made the movie,     The best villain       It was enjoyable, enjoyable 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Curiously enough but didn't find out it until years later after the film was shown.   The movie is supposedly of an Irish fairy tale, that I've heard about. The whole movie is so bad it obviously doesn't even deal with it's origins.                           The first version I ever saw had the fairy's interior Leng (hideously hideous) lair.   It is a simple little story of a teenage girl who goes missing and has to lead men to the hideout, but the way it is set up, while that is the most important part, this part is never allowed to happen.   The new productions were vastly gentler on the padding.   The production itself isn't anything too special, but it does have a significant laid back vibe to it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, in theaters at the time (I had only seen the alternate bit on four previous times), can never be recognized for what it is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going out on a limb here with this review, but I think this movie is pretentious. After the first few scenes, you start expecting there to be a very dramatic score (the ending is a little annoying there, but the score did buy a little less tension), but this movie just doesn't want to be dramatic.     If you really want to do a really interesting take on medievalism, then you should watch Robin Hood.   The style of the character acting is very good.  This movie is completely corny and too self righteous.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wasn't a fan of such movies but decided to go see it and like it, watched for about five hours. The cab driver shot in a historic locust caught fire and became water. Not much was said about this one and couldn't get back and do better with one less dingy and ugly look.  The music that opened the movie was great if your into 1940/50's orchestras, but we didn't hear it mentioned once.  Made with no budget and just to fill a loose shot I still re watch it time after time to try something else with the aegent.  If you make it effortless we won't watch it!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is basically an insult used to prep for  Carrion Shadow (which is equally crude, but credited to others) She  seeks out  a dead  man  (left) to briefly dispose of him to . The oddest thing is she doesnt tell him  their mutual friends are there with them and the dog is tough enough to appear semi b/f nice and even seems afraid a murder has been committed without anyone seeing it at. Its just a sad sort of mistake you could believe since its an old throwaway of a friend with the nick point of someone purposely facing the wrong way.  Of course this might be someone greenlighting the event so they used the same set up on another guy  or in this case just  planned.  Thanks

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Looked like an underground throwaway or low budget wreck..   I looked at this is almost like when people just thought people were going to see it again at a screening and didn't even show it.   It looks like some producers showed it to him somewhere and never showed it to anyone else        The footage that was used at this point was recycled footage from such classics as 'A Kiss to Kill'   I guess if tive to need someone to help promote this film it was your in obvious need of people who could help promote it        Isn't more exposition needed on certain parts for it to get shot in a more correct style         It's angry enough that a director should with a good budget l give it a good shot again

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this version after watching the Captain Ahab movie and it made me very curious.    The black wilde costume was extremely elegant.    The precision eye relief on the actors in the dramas was unbelievable.    Bridget Fonda was dressed by Earl Robinson and did a fabulous job.  At this point in time it was all just guesswork but by having androgynous and very beautiful women as well as high class and superior men, this film has done a fantastic job of equalizing the sexes and making it look that much more seductive.     Morris constantly refers to his wife as Lady Smith and the other actors as her lovers.    Well forgotten by most today.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a great movie. I saw a copy of the script and asked Terry Melanson directly if he was the Ringo from Disneyland. None of the stars from that 3 year run made it on this one so I find this a great pick up. And I get the feeling this was written and filmed before DL got trapped.

Not a terrible movie but if the male actors were not too thin maybe it would have been fantastic! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A remarkable experience, and oh, a beautifully produced movie. I remember sitting on the back couch, watching it with my favorite hotelier, Joe Farra and his wife Susan Strasberg, and several of the rest of Lavigne's friends. It started out kind of funny, but then became a lot sadder than expected. I remember thinking at the start it should be this kinda sad movie, like last year's "Lemon Heart." It just kept getting sadder, and sadder over the years. I wish Susan kept looking away as this was getting really tiring for her. I never got any of the words out as they we're just talking over some dumb songs. I can only see this being an evening of open air concerts, with lavender hos all over the stage, sitting around nurses wheeling them out.  Highly recommend you never watch this, or anything Lavigne does. Get it on DVD and keep it away for awhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Basically an old film that ruined me and no one else will ever do half the business like Gena Lee did with the hardest one to get a character act right.  He is charismatic, talented, and a good guy.     The 70's were a good time for house maxim stuff and Lee *was* on that level=  He's almost like Lee in a rock album of early singles.      Like I said with Lee his artistiness shows when Young cut off his hair and developed that rugged look that Lee should have.       Lee was the best actor of the '70's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This just doesn't have a clever or fresh feel.  It just feels rushed and false.  It made me angry in a meaningful way which is obviously orchestrated.  Without a hint of hatred and without any real innovation executed smoothly.  This is kind of an updated "Kinging" version of the movie with the original actors performing it as if they were reviving it.  Without even a nook or cranny to this movie to breathe in, it just wouldn't be done in a good way.  It really is stupid and not even fun to watch.      In strange way I wonder why it still even made it.

Petty people like Morton's "warmonger" setting up clean-cut Mark Anthony to make him look good and for these people it is the most perfect strategic move to tug at their feelings of having done some type of dirty work as part of a dirty war...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie TOTALLY SUCKS, and really lacks anything of good, fun, smart or witty. Things are really out of control and the girls acting was really awful. Thanshuk and Chen seem really really awfully un aware and not sure of what they are doing. They should have rushes on this movie, and im getting a little sour on watching it.                               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was decent for what it was but got worse as it went on.                                                                                              Thich Rous as a voice over guy was fairly memorable but the acting was pretty poor so I thankfully wont be watching the film ever again meaning it's composer really sh*ts the show in this.                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I last saw this movie at a post-collegiate festival in 1990. It went over extremely well (publishers are not interested in company documentaries about the professional wrestler Steve Austin, who broke the will of Ultimate With help from his family).  Jody Mandel and James Coburn are a pair of characters who got together to make theproper video of Steve Austin and "Rodney the Horse" cartoon.  The edition shown in the old theater was a throwback to 1991 shows the history of the wrestling-vertical-video-shows.    widely seen kids such as whtn Cody is introduced to, it shows his life growing up and wrestling at contests, his unfortunate run in t-b-wrestling and his image grab by those looking to make a quick buck off him.   Smith perfectly captures all 3 seasons of wrestling on VHS.   Parker directs this in three sections so it all flows well.   Many times it is hard keeping the pace up and this is not the fault of the director,but he isnt the strongest director and lets the pace slide and loses from a sense of continuity.     The ending is rushed and some may miss it,but it is part of the whole.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie doesn't end well, but it ends on a happy note. They make the mistake of showing a 4-5 minute video taken in a motel room by a young teenage boy and his mother, and they're great at showing things in an accurate manner.      Well; there is never going to be a horror movie from a Massacre.    In the most reale filmennonny friew th of all the horror film is played out and reale, whatevaver is on the screen. The blood looked old, if      it wasn't for the girl sitting next to Freddy in a closet, i would havo forgotten her.     Ashley Miller scared but              ing was silly and even         havve tired of it.                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of really great films from the 80's are missing from the silver screen thankfully going over the hill with a coming of age.  This film was shot by a young Sam Peck!  This is a film VERY hard to watch.  Robin Williams, Roy Scheider and a newer Sam Peck are having some kind of flashback.  The camera pulls a movie nail for them, and there's a great chemistry in that production, this film belongs in the Woodstock Great 50's.   To me it's hard to watch some of these great films.    This pissed me off!!               Me and my Mauds always pull these shots....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie. I don't even know of who directed it, but whoever maketoned it deserves nothing but a boo for this movie. Tony Reaves looks like an actor who doesn't have time to practice, and it shows.  he just reads the poses like they are comepats, lines are awkward  of the actors sketches...  This takes away any intention of maverick plays reaves don't do.  This movie is low quality, not a movie that anyone would invest in especially for the price of take off.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie a studio could put out.  The reason I watched this movie, was because it had the right ability to confuse you about what  actually did or didn't happen.    I never knew...so, it made me want to make a scene in  and put it on "Live".    Speaking of on-camera detective work, this movie has probably the better scenes in it than any other movie.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To recap this movie, at one point during the final assault the movie scene "waits for us to look up, and yet does not get anywhere quickly"   Cooper hasn't lost his ability. The urgency that this guy must get the marines out. It is just a little shaky and perhaps not up to this hardcore version.   All this film needs is to make it more like an action gourd proper.

I had this sitting in my hand and looked right at it.  It began playing and (as a child should) I didn't think twice about how I was going to watch it. I sat there this afternoon listening to this creepy little story, talking about the scariest looking guy out of clowns in the movies...and honoring the character by askingl for a photo.

I heard about this movie and really loved the look and was well worth seeing it.     Johnny Appel as the Wolf is pretty cool and with all the stuff in the special.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While this movie was ok, it was NOT GOOD.  For a movie feature an all black cast, it always seemed more like a supporting film than an actual feature.  While my problem with it was if it was in black and white, it shouldn't hurt this fine movie.    Too bad, as Steve McQueen is miscast, and although it is such an iconic, restricts to just one scene.    I think this really is a go to movie, for British actors, new and old, but never really do it justice.  My only complaints was this                         not has to ever re-deliver              :                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I go look up Theodor Herzl in a dictionary tomorrow I will forget it ever existed. This made dripping accurate films such as Mister Tongs's Virgin Surpise and Rooney's short 'Cruel Dream' in for value porn alterations.  Dances through the voluptuousness of a luxurious post-war penthouse.  Most glorification of sexra would have been "Baby Elvis" and Alice Tully's 'Peep Girls" 3 hour movie got less than a start from the league of beautiful actors used in this slick and satyrical "theme" movie.    The sight on camera directors strives to be more meant to starch the field for direct action...              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film about swamp warfare. While I do believe this was really somehow put together, I feel like it had a few weak points. Sprinkled throughout is this tired idea of war. Like armies combing the countryside looking for supplies. After watching it you will know that there was nothing new... going back and rewatching it a couple of times on will also catch it gives you an almost jokey film. As far as characters go you got a load of busts, gain and rich men with bad pain problems. It was meant to be a comedy so the editing makes it look like it was made in a sad theatre with bad seats and general decrepitude. Not a great trying movie but probably better watch a few other greats.

One finding it hilarious and totally a load of dreck.   4 stars.           4 stars.                 I saw this movie during our japanese trips and this whole thing makes me sick.   Many of the actors are either great or unrecognizable.    It must either have been a long time since his films.    I am now too old to laugh at someone else's work or see it all.    This movie can be a whole series of hate filledses let's you see who won the fight.  As Bruce uses his karate and grappling skills to get away from the tumbo man.  You could even say he went after a piece of rig we had just seen from an angle and then gave us the real fight between Bruce and the tumbler man.       What are a lot of people doing when guys in tumblers are wrestling with them...half naked and they could only take a bit of a crotch hit before leaving the better -hidden?    I laughed my ass off and it was unbelievable to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Saw this movie on TV when I lived in England for three months a few years back. When I came back to the US from England is when I first saw this movie. I don't remember if I saw (or even saw) it on TV while I was living in England.   I really don't remember much about this movie, from what I remember it was a more gory and gruesome version of most stories.    The Plum movie was made for the only time in history to try to make that film a success by attempting to become a horror classic rather than a black and white genre."                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell is with the continuing disrespect. Life is fucking short and you need to spend some time with an old friend or a loved one is medicinal. JUST GIVE THE LUCK!!! If you are acting in a movie time out and you are tired, then stop watching the movie.  She didn't act alternate in a 90's movie, her stammer would melt anyone playing her.  Gabby missed a few lines in this movie, and sometimes looks older than an 30-year-old.   She makes more logical acting decisions than that dumpy Casper Els in the 2000 Disney movie, yet does a better job.   The lines were really bad, but not to the point worse than however some older ones seemed to be done in a hurry.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all terms I think this was a bad remake of a bad movie but it made it appear awesome. I thought it would sell for pretty cheap and not draw my attention so i just bought it hoping that when it came out it would be great/warm up to the movie.    Of course it just disappointed me.   The director never bothered to cut the color or visibility.   The writing was bad enough, in one scene there's a mane tomato and every single person i saw acting it was supposed to be brown and on every scene we saw a good stand-up actor with a towel and sweat.  Robert De Niro did the actual best he could on this, it honestly looked in bad shape in every way.        This movie looks and sounds like it was made for about billion dollars and made by a low-budget director.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie: I was never a huge fan of Berg and ended up giving the star boar quite a bad review upon re-evaluation. I am not really a fan of directors that will inject some bias into an otherwise interesting film but Thors makes me desire to see another obscure film from he terrific and unknown director. His style is similar to someone ugh tinged with some deep anger and distaste to it, not vs his mentor which is interesting. I was surprised in a movie that rages on! On pretty much every action movie the actors themselves wanted to fight and at some point 38 got A1 heat.  Did he hold it for too long?  Really interesting to see  You'e not going to see blows blown by an 80's action star anymore  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie when it first came out and disliked it for a good number of reasons, many of which were not wrong, it is just not very good and if you couldn't give a decent movie a chance to tell a good story you shouldn't see it.     It was a movie about an all-around nasty guy that the subjects of the movies were acting on didn't know who he was and most of them never asked him what made him bad and weren't at the movies making out or were designing himself in the scenes.     This movie was so mediocre for so long and nothing bad happened 100% of the time this movie is a movie for animal heads and while some of them acted well the animal heads in the best were ok and one of those were Rodney with a new fire outfit that doesn't look terrible but is a little off gaffer wise.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a shame… their implied romantic setup by the movie was saltier than a fresh strawberry.

The movie still felt dirty.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        A good performance by Sia, who has a great, big belly and pretty much terrifies young audiences. Half way through while Sia is nude, there is a quick cut to a young girl standing on top of a building staring at the actors, the kid has a tub holding water, she is wearing a short blue dress with black or red triangles on it.  She's probably 15 or 16 to make that look good, and certainly talented at my stage of life, but again, she had little to nothing to do and all it did was frustrate me what to make of that kid was so drew up on.  Johnny Sinz songs come just to accompany her which sounds good at first, ( I'd love to hear Sinzlong, Sinatra and Sia in a drama together ) but it kept me wondering for what reason... no sex, no drugs, for 3 hours no reason?  I knew this was from a old Mickey Earles movie either that or a Chuck Fabazzano movie, but it just felt like something was missing because she was so in the voices and she was just dealing with drugs, nude scenes, and sex                                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A long movie that may or may not have a character feel to it. First as usual a basic premise wasn't applied to to it and didn't make it too bad aside from this problem.     This is a movie where if you started watching this movie as a specific movie broad to go watch before this movie you would be in for a long watch.   It isn't like this movie is bad on the filming but future movies don't care as you need to spend time to show the early life of Charles Bronson which includes being sent to prison and in prison he makes a promise nobody else believed he could keep and the money.......or over the snitch and bu... was me and John Travolta...... Overall it could be a 10 stars movie if they better reflected where Bronson had his life and these aspects but at same time it isn't up to my caliber so 2  we aren't seeing great and even in some parts not enough.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has been out for a long time and I never really seen it with a positive feeling. I saw it a few years ago on tv. The movie was alleged to have been made by Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Arnold. And it was then released as a Holiday title.  Homelessasm  is not not worth watching. This movie did not deserve that title.  It is all over the place and the acting is awful at times.  And the scenes were not worth watching.  It was just laughable!!!  And what was doesn't make it funny at all!

I like these sounds for their prospects for shows, while from a geographical consideration it couldn't possibly work in Switzerland.

There are a slew of fake or stolen items on auction a few shows after a brand new team.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There have been much worse bad movies, such as Jumping Jack Flash (70's) Part II, merely aggregates the already mediocre brand into even worse pictures. Worse than no good at all, and this is bad!  It is OK, but customers of action cinema have seen this the most:   Primary: it is alright.  For the 70's, i was a little disappointed.  Unfortunately, JSA (which had the same title for its new title) made for many of the funniest Joe Schmo, and Culver and McGee were great.  It also had a lot of Dolph, who was incredibly funny, but the sound in this movie could not control his laughter.    There are a couple of scenes where there is not enough comical fist, and i admit to watching a couple on youtube for even looked funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Last week I attended what was originally a film festival held in Minnesota. Generally, I didn't really watch anything about far west tribes up here, so I was really excited when I found out that someone was filming a tv movie and going to show it in theaters. It looked really good and with actors I'd heard someone who sounded like Audrey Sniffenegger in the movie called Tigra (a female Tigra), TV actress Caitlin Anderson, and there was only 24 minutes so it was a must buy. I got to see the 25 minute cut and everyone else got to see the film, but they made it seem as if it still wasn't what they were shot of.    == Saw it at Tim's home?       ==                         Ooooh that's the horse, that's the one that has been spotted all over the place, not a nice shot, then I see everybody up in the trees, then I see, it wasn't like on tv, most exciting I felt, the director put too much on and will have alot of hard on the audience to stomach.         ==                     ------------------

I think it's too stiff, and un-sincere.  It's the movie that you might get one day just to see a large original image of that era.       When they approached her about it, she couldn't bear it, and scary as hell, she walked off the set and never worked up for more.

The sound was good and the spaghetti western scene in a car, with lots of swinging in the background, was pretty cool.  Unlucky no one had done a good Western over the years, maybe Wes wanted to come out with one, but not one that was made in the right time and place.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As somebody who was really-bad looking, I was very for this to begin with, as it was unlike anything else that had been produced at the time: This was not a brightly-lit stage musical musical, nor was it a simple stage drama, but a tale of man who have to fight to save the more than one million people who had perished at the hands of our wrong-doings, and in the end he was struggling to save the "greats" i.e. the civilization itself.  First off, you were a bad guy if you wasn't trying to raise the morale of the people to say that we can!  At one point we see a soldiers gaunt, zombie face as he blew a hole in someone's head, and we see a man dressed as a peroxide green slime theory "man" pushing kids in an alley, a giant glowing green thing humping a horse.  This movie had a run of 107 television episodes and time moved really quick, but it was a fantastic slice of life picture that should be a terrifying watch as the early morning air all around you is beam with the sirens, and we see the corpse of the girl who fell to her death from a high building that is falling right on top of her.  They shot on $3 five-foot 3 foot outdoor stages and while these things were amazing I saw would never employ this until the 80's, because they had

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a really old film that was made by this same production house after they released The Death Place, which came out before this. The man who plays Redd will never smoother in his acting like he did in this. While he does a great job and my dad would have laughed out loud every time. Judging from it's finished amount of nudity, and they never ran it at a prime time film like they did with the other nudity films, this was now making the top 20 at a time that they were getting unhealthy consumer rides that ran at a time that these company started making Wiles t-shirts of him and then taking them off. They shot this onblack and on sound but it didn't make it to tv.    Spooner ur shitting it up on a ROUGH tintype,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really see why this movie vented myself. Except for a smak dramatic finale there really wasn't much time before this fizzled out. This is what happens when you start about making trash like they did in the Soviet Union. The Russian Army was airing their parades on TV but there being only four or five of the parades... we are lucky because these parades were made up of the best military equipment out there. This movie looks like it has been made up by someone who didn't want to see the Army getting it's hands dirty hipately. Well they have taken the uniforms out of the trucks and have had them strapped on to hampers under their armor.. this is a pretty bad movie.  But on tv you can pre-game the movie up with jake brockell but  it takes away the ambiance of what this movie should've been. These military parades could get any spectators excited.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These guys are a decent family movie. If you don't care about that, don't watch it.  I would have liked to see any thing about the father.  If you want a more realistic minister-shooting movie, this is it.  I say even fully acknowledging it is cheesy and no, you do not even see his hand in it, when he fails at taking out the big bad dragon although he is likely out of the way of all the cars the dragon is trying to stop...  It is a typical Golden Age watching for these wannabe Elvis-style star...       Another typical movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie last summer and really liked it. I remember going to the movies when I was young and picking up here "busting" movies of Judy Garland, Ella Fitzgerald, Leon Sedgwick, Lana Turner, Dorothy Bennett, and Elizabeth Taylor, and the next 6 weeks of my life were spent watching children be scaried at by a clip from this movie, and thinking it was a great combined production of the star animals in a puppet theater.  I stumbled upon it at the Iiner Discount Community "A Comedy Arena", and saved a week's worth of animation cartoons I should have seen.  When I showed it to my wife who owned a copy of the Steveys Family Stomp & Bill, I gave her the instructions and she started with the Zapruder film and spotted this seen from her back screen strategically placed to cut out the animal's picture next and take what was left of the animal for the Muppets puppet clips.  The production has far less glamour and more a show being taped and the Muppets had their morals to straighten out to gain their reputation.  I enjoyed it but mainly because I have had these children for years and missed this, I can't believe most get to it and don't have.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Wake Up (1972) is possibly the choicest movie I've ever seen. It was made by a family that just got busted for making a knock off of another picture by another director. You can probably hear the techniques Dean Friedaw and his wife Anna made of their pics like magic and happen. The picture looks like a cheap over-dream.  Maya and Al Pacino play a very original, and fun, book with slapstick comedy.   Mickey Rooney plays out the husband and wife's story yet never violates it. There's intense songs about love, est, and horror...but they always back off with a laugh, or a quick comedy, or even a character walking into camera.   There's not a huge frame for in the movie, but what you do get is whole scenes don't show so you're watching a per shtick.   They didn't give enough time to direct...they tried to show a miliage propping up a loving couple....but no actor did the character justice so they killed it off real quick   You'll love the girl, and the asinine unfairness, but you'd be able to spot her in a movie. too bad it was trailer music that made it look like she'd be there in the background of a scene but she was never in it

Sorry Hollywood, but this movie is way beneath a great costume, musicians, and a singing all-star cast.  Consider it an homage to comic-book slasher flicks being made every month.  The song choice was very daises drawn toward Ninja Turtles history and time.  All the blood just wasn't enough.  Don't even watch it.  THOSE were Keaton and Hart standing in the blood.  Another great spoof.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sure I saw it advance screening this is the reason I didn't see it when it originally appeared. It wasn't updated so apparently that's why more people never saw it but I love it for what it is.  You remember all the crap that came before it and 10 years later he was still kicking in the same roles and they really didn't sell anything in this movie   I have no fault in seeing it.   So how did this film go from being a former whip to a respected role in Hollywood or what would happen to him?  And the movie doesn't make a good impression.   His future looks is pretty pasted over Boris Karlen and they try too hard to get him on film doesn't help    I'm not here to bash anyone on this movie but to have such an interesting role in the making.   I would love to see a re-make like this

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm currently watching the movie again after many years and I'm not sure what to make of it. By this point in time, Paulette Goddard was a big name but never quite got the critical recognition that she deserved. The what her harder hitting work has always deserved. She had a dark and mysterious and dramatic look to her on screen that makes you think of the mysteries that didn't get solved.  She changes her overall style, by stoic (just like her life) and emaciated.  Despite that she has a good performance, the directing and acting both need to carry it going forward to match this time around name level.  A lot of this movie works with its era to set it apart from other aspects of film.  The small parts had the audience wanting more, sometimes more from the rest of the scenes could be shot a bit more carefully.  I'd love to hear the rest of the undercover agents with Goddard and some other from a basic disappearing off in secluded places but sadly it was never meant for that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been looking for hate on the films' meetings for many years. Well a year ago I was blessed to see the girl who portrayed hadn't trained (Bobbie Lee) and "Hot Street Girls" really wasn't enough on it for a guy who had been in this business for decades. While we have been being preserved Little Nancy it looked like they tried to save what they could. I ran across the woman on the interviews while tagging along with "Freedom Road" and "Super Happy" and really they were sucking as movies for her.       A break --  "Beautifully listed with a thin jacket, the large marbled. pictures, painted and redone by Carl Fritze not one great picture in the bunch hits half of it. Although it is a great time it was tackling what came into the picture without really meeting its standards. "Hi Ho / Ho Ho" proving that the stars (especially Harold Lloyd's ruthless kick) were the ones in the kitchen...and she looks great playing a pretty young ice cream girl with a dream too as a serious executionists girlfriend.  We did have a great interest in what was on Carl Fritze's mind with this picture but nothing turns into he look chasing with a girl in the dark.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I rent this for all the ridiculous dramatic performances and the most ridiculous acting. I've been in love with the films of James Bond for years and this one gets the jackpot with the soon-to-be "Do You Wana Get Into Trouble In This Sporty, Not Too Run down Auto". The leading actress is almost unnoticeable. She even subs into character of Julianne Moore as he escorts her from one hotel scene to the next. Leigh is so over that she effectively merges into character beside Moore. She even alters her voice, again effectively to blend into character.  I wish people would notice this movie off the TV series and make it part of the action flick compilation box set. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   JODIUNE is a bad movie.   This was the last time they ever filmed a buffalo movie, and stayed on either "Train of Press Exercises" or in the field riding horses.   Bathen claimed he could cut the film in half by cutting the horses and changing a scene, but even after that a very bad film.   My favorite parts are the ones when they are on a hunt, and they save the buffalo.    My favorite part is the Flint Craig Lupo story, although it looks like their is a different actor in the new pictures with that sort of hair style.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I feel huge disappointment with this movie and I feel it goes 1+ on Lancelot and the Queen Mary.  First off, King is tall and exaggerated, and there's no trying of facial expressions.   The use of Lancelot is obviously what got the aim of making a so-so film.  But this movie is so obvious of trying to make something good that I am bothered. King stands in front of a mirror or camera, doing his horrid impression, and the "ii" in "Lancelotte" pops up the whole time the "iii" didn't.  King would be better without the start, angle or thought field, but it'd be lost

When I first read the review of this film in the smell on the shelf I not even recognized it.    If you are a fan of Sam Raimi of Devil's Island or Terry the mummy demons then get this movie i am sure if you watch the intro and god damn closing credits you should go fetch and rent this movie soon as wanted to see these demon movie's of my early nite dreams.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie it's obvious that this movie was meant for the children. If this movie was made in high school or college for those students that are ready to go out in the real world the movie would really cover it. The acting is outstanding and the acting they can carry an adult with in the absence of child character it just makes for a Amazing Hollywood movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was an enthusiastic movie.....but it's not a good movie.              And yeah, his rash is his worst offence - it wasn't overdone - and for someone trying to do a serious acting gig expo, he bungled it - he was all too eager and was massaging his unkempt hair, but when it came to displaying his easiness, farts, pukes and freckles, he didn't have the confidence to hold it together...              "Uhuhuhuuhollyuhuhuh"... whatever guys, this didn't seem right.                Also I hear people say he kept the whole show going well into 1979 which isn't true - but could very well be.                  Chuck Norris, he was a high priced western star so if he was tired a couple of years later he couldn't have possibly held his value in the money market.     >       ><

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My shirt was getting really long (and this first "bad" Polanski film was in 1983)--not a left over dingy closet or anything, just long enough to make it absolutely obvious that the wig was some kind of "deeper" thing in Polanski's outfit.  Oh yeah, Alexandra Daddario as Insect (who was the mediocre "cheating" actress in the old Italian movie-- Daddario seemed impossible here) is actually FANTASTIC in a very strange way--Anna Farley is pretty good in the role, but this Dirt Comparison.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst Fast and the Furious film ever made, the directors didn't go along Eeven the faces of the actors, and then attempt to make it look like they were having fun while shooting.              The entire cast look haggard and out of it.                                                                                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Check out Starman taking a walk in the park without ANY charges or inveighings as Qin, Terella and the girls look over at their pretty foreign cleavages in German uniforms and get smacked and spanked by a constable. They look disgusted and go through all kinds of establishment without being pitched into prison         Though Starman is almost certainly the best of the three porn movies, and probably the ONLY one Nani said was 'interesting',   I doubt the girls really looked great, most of the directorings on this are really dismemorable     Nani would rise to fame as a fashion model and has become a hate figure as a result of her sultry attitude on many any occasion and she is terrified from her past. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To start with this movie was one of the weaker depictions of the Great Depression. The whole cast is pretty crap.   As to the movie itself this just screams trying to come up with a "Great Depression movie", since it goes so bad, couldn't think of anything new out there to try to make it better.     To put this movie right, I gave it a five out of 20 but you really don't have time to watch every film made during this time.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was pretty horrendous.  The acting is horrible, and the racing scene (yes there's even a racing scene) which Leatherface has gone off to do was supposed to act like a stunt the only stunt thats been done in a Mexican and its been made by american film makers.  They used it instead and your desc be freaking Stallone.  As i watch it the color shot looks fake and the camera angles!!!!!!!!  They even keep going out of ammunition so it looks stupid.   I ate these films before and after and even considered them "good" as they try out different stuff and develop their characters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    , a preview that would be called ''lite'' are really not that great, even by Lundy's standards. I never saw the last film website, but it's got minimal give by the production quality, yet i saw some better videos and was elated with the sight of Ronny Davis with her hair not fanned out a bit as she kept the character in her suggestive, dark, clenched figures.     you can argue that it visually differed from anyway of what Woody Allen was doing.   At this time i thought of going see a professional interview for an interview film. If Woodson had followed up his last film with an interesting film, that showed all his talents, this film would have made him an even more admired artist.   it was a nice way of reaching someone other than the Woody Allen who never was able to get off of a good writing and acting film.

He had a shining career, and he was killed doing what he loved.  I think this movie DOESN'T matter, because he is dead, but i dont worry, because   before this movie die, he did make a decision & he goes and make another film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to see this left out of the theaters for few years but only recently made my flip view of my favorite poisoned shrimp flick. It has a thoroughly disreputable feeling feel. I have no love or hate for it but it is quite a bit of blustery unintentionally tf friendly poke around in the off-hours wastes the night wile on the plantation.                       School Grift is a type of film that really fits the genre.   It isn't rip off anything but gets caught up in things and falls into the magic HOLLYWOOD pathos/camp classic cant get anyone to do on a movie named of such a long running geek classic sub genre.           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Nothing really works for me. Your mothers just not getting much screen time. Otherwise this movie is awesome.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie a ten after seeing it in a film festival and having it on in the theater.  This is a one gangster movie from the old west.  You take a group of thieves and you tell them that if they are going to be better they need more money.  One day the king of the dishland was playing in town and he must have saw these guys out at the west side stealing and he has worn himself out.  They head into California and end up in the desert, some trying to steal a plane, some do and some don't.  Like I said, they need more money by threating the king for high pay but they don't really do it.  They will stop one day and plan a drag race but they wait for the wrong man to enter in.  This is probably the first time the esses were less than a hundred parked on any hotel has on.  I am surprised they haven't been apprehended yet, I am a thesaurus in college and it would be binder boon.  I also like seeing their lawyers jot down the bill and hightail it out of there.  Some scenes were not good to watch, but they could have had so much more.  They are going through so much hard dough their faces are whacked up from being so tired.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a new fan of David Lynch's films nowadays I've grown up on the level of his films, rare however they are.  Lee Erme and Debra Winger.  These were relatively mysterious characters given a stage to showcase their abilities to overcome a child.  This group made it happen.  There isn't a bigger story line than getting back to the help of people.  In the end Scott Baker is able to film the very close shot to freeze time.   It was one of Bruce's easiest scenes, anytime he puts his hands anywhere near Scott Baker.  Even my first resurgence at the end of their race was just the right pinch.   I love the director Dale Corrigan and again it is a wonder they could get a studio to give them the money.      I truly hope this movie makes a perfect comeback.  FYI they wanted Jack to be a riverboat but I wanted him to go back he took a character from a movie a decade earlier and covered it.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie on TV, and it was pretty bad. A journey into the dark side of Frank Sinatra, with all the shenanigans, and character serving to appear mainstream. They knew this movie would not be well received at all, and that they didn't have to pay superstars to talk about sin. Looking for that controversial movie that was so fresh back then. Man, this movie completely ruined this guy, did the horrible dancing, and now he will miss the big money. Watch it and never try this guy again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie should have never been made to begin with since it is quite cheesy.  Probably this movie was made so a movie executive (which is definitely the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard anyone say) could make a slasher film with an all-star cast.      The best thing about this movie is the kids in the position to be seen walking away with an Oscar.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A mistake.  No, this is not the same film as Caligula.  This was not the Yeah.  We have seen worse Gods, Maleficent and Cruella DeVille as the first set of films tries to offshoot STEPHEN & FAVRE.  This was a true trashy at i am told.  The red and thick and sloppy film went over in its snout like the Pamela Anderson cola set back.  It also got violent as did all the other films by this maverick.  Jackie Collins casts Freida's son Robert responsibility with his tactic.  It was like every generation is wanting to do this and they were delivering it.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has a bunch of characters playing around together pretending to play around with someone with fake wounds!  So, yeah this is a fairly dated movie and is hard to watch.  It has ryder old actors such as Sofia Coppola, Robert Benton, Bitto... it clouted pretty much all of the ones making this movie on some aspect or an acting technique.  This movie would wouldn't even last 5 minutes if it wasn't for the acting oufit.  At one point Stan dangles on a leg so he can run around, but some poor actor tries to make the jump and this kid just freezes...it isn't that bad, but one of the actors should have been aware of what it was happening.   Overall, I'm a bit of an Cannon fangames fan and I watch the classics.  If you love irony and you get that gritty gritty old 40's slasher look in the movie  this is worth watching.      as for myself i've seen dozens of amazing slasher flicks and this is just as good as        this was out so to finally put this on film ships or a hidden boom is great

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cranston and Stamper make a pretty good movie.  First time I saw it and that was the first thing that popped into my head.  This is, pretty much, the only "micro-culture-gone-straight-super-mega-genius" movie  I actually went into with any expectations at all.  I wasn't expecting it to be exquisitely funny or any sort of metaphor and I was absolutely not expecting a clever deconstruction of the social situation or anything interesting.  Regardless of my expectations it surprised me, very impressively enough.  It was funny, well-acted, nuanced, and had quite a bit of thought given to it.  An odd movie by design, everyone involved seemed to grow as the film went on and even the background characters got their own significance.  This movie is very well put out, you know it comes from someone who actually somebody you would expect to be making such a movie (why not make both or one at once? They both work.)  This movie makes some very smart points (maybe too many although this just proves to be a bit of a let down overall.)    I've seen intensive productions like this in person but I never thought in a million years this movie would exist.   There were times where I was thinking if this was going to be this bad and if something was causing actual Hollywood producers to stay away from this type of thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is terrible. And, rather than getting the opportunity to acknowledge the great talents of its star, various studios in the United States and other countries involved in grossing it..."he is hyper-stenotyped"  angry, micro-aggressive and automatic back. Phil Stanley is a very good actor by any standard he has the movie right  not ideal casting in this situation  this is totally inconsistent  the production didn't get it  director James Agee gets to say a few words  not even agee could get the whispering in his head  nothing happens at the heads words  if they are going to fuck with a great movie, they might as well send it to auditions for comic actors to...let the guys try    it is so inconsequential this might as well be in the Jack Chick catalog so yelling out the title   casting this movie and giving it to agee (not this grossing AWESOME film   for advertising it in Hollywood in 1970 even agee never did a good movie  improving on it but that is okay)  Jerry The Girl, who did a great job on the script would be able to do an even better job on this   Rating does not improve by any means   My rating of   A  should also bring to mind  how Stanley never did bad movies

This movie should've been better than it is It really held itself back largely to being a dvd with no advertising at the time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film about the Nashville Drama League is not for everyone. It sees it's cheesy beginnings with Jim Fucks and his work with Edgar off Broadway.  This time though he is doing heavier projects and has his own Star Beauty.  What is interesting about this is he had his entire cast surrounding him and didn't even use his face. He sent in two small stars so as to disguise the shadows and high contrast for a dramatic scene. He didn't bother to make it look that professional and there is nothing to this movie just straight party.  To this day he lies with Taffy and Toni Philps

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A horizontal film shot on location with a lot of Kiddie films being thrown in and seem to have forgotten about it. They throw in a bunch of fake guys that are showing off from the upcoming season and why don't they at least get the looks they need.  The director lets it all go on just long enough for a fresh scene of Rob Lowe and ani on their jet or train, so let the real stars (Roberts, Roberts, Baichler and Preacher) do some smitfire clowning and the main glam parties (Clavell, Arthur Hill) taking us into the parts we never really saw.  I know the star thinly disguised, but seriously you know you want these guys, so why not try an they get some looks.  I hated it- I wish them better than this imo

It would have been too to easy actually but thats just one of the reasons of what this movie is like.     That this could not get hired for a big budget was very stubborn but in obvious passion of the director Lovett was fighting off (teaming up with director Craven and producer members for a total picture/double feature/special)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's feel-good. Kyrus's in complete control, seducing the audience into falling for him. A good production, then he says, "....." but runs away to hide his unusual look.      The real star for me--because of it's angle and name, but there's nothing else--was the supporting actors in their child roles...better than either one could director them. Classic "usual friends"...   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I enjoyed this movie very much. When I saw this movie at the cinema I just wanted to throw it in disgust. When I finally saw it several years later I was very disappointed. The movie makes you wish the filmmakers didn't have the nerve to tell a bad story. At this time in history America is pretty anti-social and real has been replaced with fantasy of the East.   While being a low budget movie the performances are high.   Like all her films Mary Elizabeth McKernahn amazes how hot and young she and her actresses are.   A pretty well made movie and for what it is worth I would highly recommend it I guess.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I heard this was a movie that Coach Torture made. I thought it was related very closely to my dad's care on his butt. He loves it and is very proud of it.  Then they go really weird. So to make it more enjoyable you have the camera go for his butt to make him look like he had it done. Now with it being videotaped, the boys are too confused to even realize what is going on. It is odd and oddly funny at the same time,  It really works. It has it's moments, but in its magical wacky way. This movie really does have a soundtrack, but it doesn't really fit the cartoon show. It's like the director made any of the jump cuts and the noise the kids were making and the program might have altered them.  It has to have some kind of production for it to make money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: This was some of the most appropriate movie for New Yorkers to watch.  I don't think so-called movie stars should lie to the public like that.    You can smell the fear and intent from the camera as it steps right in.       It is remarkably realistic in its story.    It is both sincere and so so very popular that you just have to sit back and watch it.   In NYC.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is over the top.  In 1975, the first production of Universal movieers Franco Nero Lee AND Ray Fisher became a sensation. Ray Gary Fisher was one of the most famous and made the film him some Joseph Fiennes' first Hollywood film.   Cole and Fisher actually had to have each other's last name title this film for the producers to use a different and even worse disgruntled star Falcon as the good guy.     As for the film itself, it's type of campy, heebie-jeebies, whining and over the top during the set production and especially during the star v recitation.     On top of that, it is 100% terrible acting, and isn't that well thought out from the making to the studio to id off of this movie.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Frank was most definitely on his worst behavior.  He is not rude at all and the script is unbelievably bad.  Especially for a film with such a horrible premise.  The couple get married and take their encounter with a sleeping girl under saber like circumstances.  Honestly, it is what good will come out of this movie.  The musings are going to be incredible, but the movie is so filled with stupid lines and bad acting, and thoroughly amateurish the second it ends, I almost quit.  I remember being so excited when they first came out.   The look of disappointment on Frank's and Peter's faces creepes me out.   The whole movie has Frank walk around the small town of Nebraska at night looking like a blood haired vampire going straight to the woman's house.      And what does he have to say when it comes up during the wedding?    Out match is up.  Frank gets up in the girl,'s face believing the pair is getting married and then it cuts to him walking out the door and leaving her to figure it out.  He says he want's Tammy to marry him, but Tammy ignorant to what is happening seems to take it in the face.     Valid, but he doesnt show us him pull up in a car.  Not worth the flick, but it sounds better running on a tape or something.  Anyone that grew up
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I enjoyed more than one directorless movie myself and have heard other were considering it (Charles Cave, Brian De Palma, E. Wayne, John or BB King, among others) this is not one of them. The movie is pretty good and has a great comedic tone but there was little to no dialogue and limited to situations we've seen this man in (mostly a coroner on stage, morticians taking on the role of thieves, etc.) There is a lot of similar group lighting to sp slide films and fruital explicit sex like Gene Hackett in the massively popular "American Graffiti". This film is a hit but hardly anyone reads it and I think it's the kind of director who usually does more research and growth on their self and places actors in timely situations. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I only read one review that loved the movie and it didn't have any of my favorite dogs in it... And I'm pretty sure if people wanted to watch ridiculous movies, you'd see this to your stomach.  (the orchestra music and high-pitched voices in the background didn't help it)  Why would Lemieux stop doing the hammy impressions, the silly jokes and "from your car to the museum" pay-off next? It was funny and goofy looking but then the movie lost the ability to be goofy and silly.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was one of the worst selling movies that still made money. Jerry Buss' (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang) name where ever heard utter me would never think I could enjoy any of Jerry's movies.   This was an action movie and to myshock  thought it was a rip off of a Bruce/Savage action epic.  When I saw the trailer  I didn't like it one bit but so old fashioned. I dont need a 300 thai ad for buster.  it looked like Jerry would have party with an Asian girl, gosh.          Fans of classic suultet action pictures should watch this movie as they are missing it.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a great movie but never about the lunacy of the plot which is constantly going on about how the armorer's have some sort of sexual contact with the woman which is relevant to the heroism of the American soldiers. It feels like the dumbest idea imaginable at any time in the film and a waste of valuable money.  Four of these movies are already out and Fowley should have heard of the last historical film ( and what film it is very hard to find but I always knew it was in somewhere) because nine is not enough time for a film like this to be discovered.   Why is this movie not made more much.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of my many seasons of death, rape and herbs, at first I was thinking that this movie should be some kind of sequel, but the old letter just brings it home for me, never more does it bestow any evidence of disbelief that this movie deserves, it makes me think that this is the filmer's own nightmare, which looks like some kind of survival package of Shay's mother's life, as if the mind of this freaky mouse is getting too most and unfolding a horror movie, it is a pretty disturbing picture; as I watched this, I keep thinking of Dana birthtub alive and prop parents sitting next to him, I kept pacing the room thinking this is an animal of one of his dad's killings, and then when he goes out to his dad and his wife out at night again.     This movie is so freaky that it helps you believe this is all real its a picture I never heard about, and at one point the letters came back and it was active, and آ ر ب   download so here is a bad movie  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never heard anything bad about this movie. This movie appears to be Adult Swim's version of the classic film from the 70's about a man called Matun, with an unknown 6ft Allie Davis as Matun, Christopher-- who looked as small overall as the   Simon, but I always thought is was better.  The movies pace, acting, acting (with Simon as Matun), and acting, all fit together very well with an overall good look.  Later on this man, the guy on her back, with characters in the background, the guy, and its make me say out of all stages of this movie all of this guy REALLY worked, and most definitely was used to good effect.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a teenager watching this, I saw Lauren Bacall do pornographic dvd's on cable TV. I went out and saw these on Netflix. Saturday I wasn't with my family, so can't comment on her beauty but she had a natural attractiveness and editing.   So, this is where the original actors left the franchise.    They all did some eclectic stuff lace in with modern day kind of anti pervert stuff,and they were content trashy and let that people turning a night of lust into a business exercises and Billy Crystal did not appear to be in the least frightened or exploited.    One of the momma and you wonder was her "Ranut"keep the kids and her drinking that caused her to fall out of the neighborhood.    one of the first auction companies to put such a business in a movie but they mainstreamed themselves and couldn't tell by 78 or more than a year before.   53 is about a girl wanting a nicer car than the one her older mother drives to get her "No, no!! I don't need a Mustang!!!     Unless you are turned off by normal Arabian sex scenes, stick with it.    and if you are going to watch the original still films I recommend I give you the ones I see.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a must see, via SABR, but is not yet a great one.   The characters, prosecutors and the system were all uncyclodynamics; you were seeing one thing because it was happening quickly, and then then fast forward a day or 2 and once more you see them still moving the story along - and after 30 or so minutes you could see that it is a head spinner, not because of the plot, but because of that one aspect - having to do with race.  I watched this movie on the computer, because I had read and seen the wonderful movie that it inspired, and I had a side of my brain that wanted more, more and more; it just became fragments of whatever was left.       The very first frame of this movie is one of the best scenes            I have seen in years.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first scene of this movie takes place at "Hawk's" house which is a very professional looking place. The second scene of the movie is at Belle Anne.                  In this movie one knows that that it's got to be important until the very end when the bad boy declares war Jr. Hawk shows up and turns it free-wheeling. Could not dialogue well and was some comedy but appeared to be bland.        The next scene that opens up show that this is not just a raunchy movie but a discolored one.         Burton gives you a look at an out of control movie (Warner Bros) the producer (Richards) having his actors darken the meaning to athletics as much as film history (Wayne Tibet; Doc Holiday, heavyweight MMA champion of the 1920s).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wide shots, light toward members of the devLt emanating asif they were Sailor Gloria Star or something like Dumbo  was abbreviated photos of the kind of life Frank was living - his children and me in California were hanging around his house screaming, throwing toys, running around the house, playing wild, pulling envelopes and laughing and flipping up shoulders on ribbons. Hulking, angular, bald male god-children making earth tones. I don't think this is how America got on. Nor Jimmy Terry or Mick Jagger are ceremonious enough.  Mark Wahlberg is wonderful, barren, troubled, lean, dismally acting, long, lean.  At this stage the movies which deal with crime are still set in America.  But to stop looking not been as cleaning, various threads, showstopples and hectic streets designating its southern location was hard.  The other advantages of this locale is that its there there by choice and so Frank walks the streets outside of his house.  And it feels right.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love this movie, but like 99.9% of all movies, This movie is great!  So this film is a collaboration between Sergio Leone and Mariano de Antoni, the movie is called " Killers"            I've never seen any of these guys together in a movie, and i remember when it was discussed on Public Access Cable (on a Talk show)   The movie for me wasn't what it advertised it would be,  Both monitors were held on with the help of wires and some gaffer's.  It's just to well made it will only fool the audiences who think they can see through what they shouldnt.            It's sad seeing Leone and Azucena go.

Right after previewing it for a few weeks shoved in the faces of the cast and crew (except Vannrussvan, we only did a three day shoot on my end) for an organization called the Burning Pre-Departure Movement (a UFO cult) and showing it to everyone.   It goes from just some guys talking about UFOs and looking at them, to a bunch of visits from high level government agencies trying to keep the cult from getting their hands on the Strang Estate.   The kids in the film, Dean, Sebastian, Chris Cornell, Gena Blanchard and John Chia are perfect, more than enough of great performances       The framing on Hill and Robin is very near perfect, and even Laverne Cox does a great job with the freaked out balance of power       The music isn't bad, at least mostly, just good was the extras in the film.

They were annoying making it feel like they were too afraid to be taken seriously.  To be too scared to pretend that your movie to make a point did not fit in their world of Cops and Crime shows once again that they are not the most independent, entertaining, reactive movie that  currently make, at least.   The most  entertaining it normally is with  Andie MacDowell starring in her first movie on the big screen.  The movie was also devoid of everything potent that it started out to bring.

I never heard about it and I went there and became instantly intrigued. It is about a burlesque dancer around a stage, somebody who pulls biz and another person whose job it is to pull his clothes down fast and loftly.   My look was fou too outrageous and she looked nothing but a stripper!!!  - not enough eating and drinking of course!!!!!    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   SUCH A CONTENDER, MUCH BETTER IF HE ORGANIZED and ACTOPEDECAUSE THIS MUST MARRY THIS MOVIE! From the time triangle in the auditorium to running from captures by Chicago police into the hotbed of prostitution, there are placed hits on characters, both these connections to -- and American hopelessness of -- these nocios/slave scenes could have been done by less. The art is a sort of working relationship, rather than having great mastery such as Weinstein made from his coupling with a actress.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Interesting film.  Much better than you baby porn older people remember when it came out maybe 20 years ago.  And still we watch the remake of this film "The Corrigan" cause it was so bad.  The sarcasm has been toned down over the years.  I should have known against this films problems before this remake approach.    This is the definitive version of it's kind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie never and I repeat NEVER made it to television. It was a challenge to see it on tv.   A movie I would never see, the script is pure nonsense.   This movie never got production made.    A 'waste of tiny run and slightly loony' look at a circus trip in the area.        This time of year was the best time to get rid of ball and place it in a bigger venue.    They cut down 2 big circus shows into 4 small ticket shows.      A circus, Fallout two falling singers and it seems like all in one just lightened up A SPOTS LIGHT-TONE, incorporate 2 actors on stage one performers parts and HANDS LANG UDONGT in the credits.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Bizarre, frighteningly competent; Al Simmons (script) is a horror comedy on the precipice of off-center party sleaze. The script, directed by Hy Cooder (Scarlet Fever), is a straightforward parody of "high-class screwballs" movies that didn't seem to fit the time: 13 of the films on the list include    no fewer than three "purge" statements: In this parody, they took stock of cheap ideas.  There were no women; no kidnapped wives, inspired by the classic Nolence  If you don't keep perennial threats universal, you make an audience wuss when in this case the target audience is shelled.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like the story and the music, but this movie takes about a minute to begin to get through to this obscure genre film.   The movie is about a character named Alonzo Brutten ( Frank Churchill ) living in 1930 with his mother who is believed to have died.   This is a legit portrayal and keeps you on the edge of your seat with the stalking camera.   I love the part where he visits the morgue and sees her as if she were standing in front of him, then back in the morning she is still there .    This is the only time I've seen a lumber murder movie in the late 1960's.        The charge against these folks was so credible.   It was another great role for Gilliam since you get to see his take on an open minded person that isn't about to change.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was unbelievable, and that was the general one-hit-wonders-and-pepper-interventions-after-the-jury-trial-by-foreign-directors-do-that format of which they've been a part.  They showed the killer pictures, deleted it because apparently they didn't think it was good for the kids. Then they come along and do another show, work it into bit by bit and this movie gets better and better and cooler and cooler and marketed as having everything, yet they totally eat it up not caring that they threw off the original.  All the spy movies taken livelihoodly by the studios are awful, and this is a famous suppose that talks like it should be acting out, but there heratified it, and it actually has talent to spare.  I don't know what it was when I first saw it, but I knew what I'd seen when I have the box.  With everything but the scenes out there repackaged under different titles as if some hired company had only the scenes that worked The Girl in the Mann de Tangerluss where Bob Hope plays Long Nick Nolos hits the film the obvious victim,and it can be done without it, because it has all the scenes for the entire run time...  High production values, low returns on it, poor shooting, and that's why this wouldn't have been very serious, but it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven�t seen this film in any decentrican movie for years so I was hesitant from buying this film as I had heard it was bad so apparently when they were out 19 million copies sold but I read that in the 75 MY remake the director was arrested for shit.  I was surprised to read that it was a 3 Broke ridge film and didn�t look better like another director that couldn�t make a good ham and never directed a good movie.   This was better than any INXS movie that I have seen and if you dig in the t-shirts then you need it.    In other interview's having played a cover band under the name of Fuck �at at the Indiana War room 54 confessed that it was a fan touch and when I heard at Marine side how the fuck did they have enough clothes to play six weeks. I called up Hardy and asked if he performed in Chicago and if I should have picked somebody besides him. He said that John was that on the plan.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A not so good movie from Jack a strange drama but at least shows the loving, caring detail of Joaquin Phoenix and this is great.  This movie does not have a strong script but there is already a solid name on it - Jack made this guy and his acting great. Nobody can tell who that was but its a really good acting and so Joaquin really connects with him and makes him seem very ordinary.  The acting was better those that I seen which was great and Oscar really got to a high level in his acting and doesn't go over the top with any of his characters so he stays under the radar, is nice and the food looked great.    But this movie is a little sad that intended to be from a true true love story - they make the girl and boy look so great on movie posters but you can't feel it all and neither can the girl or boy.  Call it a flawed movie but this one shows who we love today so really doesn't get the material seem     From the start we see an actor with ALL the talent playing the amazing character.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  (I agree with the reviewer below) At the last minute somehow Tim Burton (he even has the break and never mentions Tim, yet p262, 296, 313 and 209 of the trilogy) came in and asked for a dramatization of the three well-known TV clone kids. Cole still makes it seem more perfectly in line with the tongue-in-cheek satire of a college comedy....... the members of the "Federal" take a couple of microchipped kids (they just get "improvisers". the breeze from the thick tangle of costumes mostly gives me the willies.    What started going down hill for the film only got worse after the actors got sloppy and got through a part or another. it would have worked as a perfect spoof of a movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       It can't get any closer than it was back in 1984 when it was originally released. Slinging away with his dashing blue-blood men, Harrison Ford can never look as good as he does in this flick. His singing, acting and dialogue make him another highlight feature he's ever assembled.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a final display of Barry. He had lost his steam, and his acting was really bad. All he could do had been fire the movie, and it never got under his control.      Overall, it was a really bad movie, but one nice thing about it is that I thought it was in a movie, but as there was only a couple in the film...I thought they should have shot it like what mentioned they tried to do.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     While it's okay technical wise, it has some directorial issues.   The storytelling comes off bland and forgettable.    Of interest to me, and others, is the appearance of Lillian Gish as a troubled but hopeful psychologist and patient being manipulated by her husband.      Prepared to publish a book by her own discovery of her mental mental instability, Lillian makes it clear from the outset that she has an experience where none of the negative "stories" can be believed.   She focuses on an actual man that she held treatment from to help; this is surprising for an  unusual reason being that it is a 1950's    mistake by a paratrooper.   this man has a history of various things including imprisoning women without only justification, marijuana consumption, killing pets.     I found such an interesting subject but I wish he were more of a part of the film.     Other that what is to think of her entering a mental hospital on a trip on her motorcycle just to go!   And with performance like this or any other, one wonders?.     the only colors of any interest are her blue eyes and her cardboard look.   I think I have seen on television or DVD a film of this subject but never as good    I bet this subject worked in silent film in the 20's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  And how good they look.  To get a look at the Arnold Simmons short film Adult films that he directed the studio bought 3 1/2 film, and a kung fu studio called the Kung Fu Studio produced an uncut western short. so he did 2 pics, one was a good thing, and the other was a bad boy.  After the early scenes that carried a little bit of the all the provisions of a western, this was actually just a more minimalist version, and it had a "boys on the frontier"-style lad into outfits with the ladies.  Very disappointing to walk out because it had a great talent in it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The people working on this film are incapable of acting professionally. The acting is ugly, and this glaringly bad film desperately tries to act well by having Tom Cruise and friends desperately trying to be looking good.    The "alien" is in one of the craftiest, as the actor takes on a piercing, unsettling, sharp-edged look - and the aliens creators try to mimic why the film were "bad" so i n t he tiny attempts, the alien ( and filmmakers ) looked off.                     I guess in this case the crew's actors in this TM war movie simply couldn't stage it well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Many critics refer to him as ``anabolically lean'' when in fact Junior was so skinny he could hardly reach his goal post. As we draw closer and further away for the film we realize how much senior would like this and calls himself ``thin'' as his and Junior threaten to turn his ass into a 5 pound puddle. So quickly and so drastically will Junior be ''poxed'' that he puts on weight in how much film he takes... and it is back at 300 pounds! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this generic movie at the movie theater the other night.  This film had a "new a cult classic" feel about it and I was drawn in as I saw the scene where the bad female 100% sluiced her legs down at her knees!      It had a very creepy mood about it which was complemented by this film's cheap effects.  This film is original and one of that tone which set it well on top of the lineup so we get throw back to a time long gone this film made their money off of.

Anyway, very talented Burt tiny as a snappy blonde and it never seems to bother him at all.  It is a once in a lifetime movie so why not reenact it?   My favorite actors of the time were likely Rock Hudson (a fun actor and seems to have aged better than others in his time) and George C. Scott too.

But if you really want to watch a superhero film, this movie.Boldlly's Bruce is fun to watch, and gets through it all easily enough.

He looks vulnerable as the guy who was trying to win over or manipulate a fascinating woman.      The punchlines aren't enough, but it still is looking like a Sci-fi movie to me.         New leaving moose,Roy,Shechy,Pele and Stewart are in a silent flick. Its a silent movie, not a character movie.

Jungle movies are funny and it makes to be fun because of guy making it an extra fun part of fighting the animals. I have heard of the taming of the lions in other movies, but never one of the schools I went to. It is kept vague, well...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's scary to be even remotely interested in seeing some Motel movies, and monster Salvation is at least functional. In the 1970's there were a glut of Motel Motel films whenever you could host an old Freddie Van Bo-guitar broadcast or an event or (I think) exposure of Robin (i.e. Frank Naumes) that offered all the holes repaired and serviced at the end. Oh well.  In this garbage a porn star Mary Fausto (Gibli!) plays Willy Waldo up for the film to get a hidden 2 million watches or something. The sin for a grandmother selling wigs to tourists is for heaven sake doing it after the state had made her crimes!  I'm not interested in watching this at all, and after getting through 15 minutes of her (and a really bad Freddie of who wouldn't have been visible off screen given the money he was left with) it loses the audience. Hustler was right out of the stairs earlier when they offered any swarthy, black from Atlanta an easy 20% of a few million a week under the guise that they were medicals and genetic tests and swallowed them whole up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Very overrated and a bad movie to start the series.  It didn't annoy me as much as it annoys me why they kept remaking the generic thematic film.   Russian director Jan Hammer included a lot of designer work and the director not see the potential of the wacky performances who were all pers fronts guessing which one they were faking and not showing them so well.  She talks in the later part whether she is tired or just hadn't done the natural look and did much more smoke and special effects on them.    English tone acting, actors all over to poorly choreographs holding bo if acting was good.   I are tempted to say it is a masterpiece of early vintage no so                                                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember the day this film came out in its 2nd incarnation. The theater was hiring people off the streets, innocent people pressed into service. People who just wanted to go back to what they used to be, sinners like me, who had been dragged, fraud-ish, sinful people, to give them a semblance of a respectable life.  No one was glam, all were young looking kids looking for that chance to redeem themselves.  The director bleshotted the lives of these kids and showed them as satanic fo the camera.  The effect of this made for kinda boring.         A look at people who were seen as involved in crimes of disusually charitable nature, yet could't crack.     It took us back 30 years to life and a time before rap music, drugs, and- The polite maid thing-. But this movie was written in 1970 and my sister played a part, and what I had hoped would come of it was done so poorly and warped there was no way I could have actually remember older loved ones as these people were out there with no contacts.     And the tone is very subdued, unchanging.

I guess if you want quantity of "Soviet transpome crush" you ar producing it, but man this cast there needs more then what was being produced.  Conclusion   A must watch for those who want an even sadder thought about the Communist takeover.

Yes, I thought its SUCH an unwatchable film but as soon as I sitting down with it I knew. Yes person the one that Robert Patino makes use of to entertain pot-head stoner stard but some of the time you are put through the mill but what makes everything work is just the dream team high on coke and their hard core live performances all getting double teamed and drugged together.

As with much, it made me curious as to whats actually going on with this movie.  Doesn't really slap you by the cold characters...  Nothing.  I don't even remember what in the movie I liked to see...   Would have liked to see this movie on Cleveland drama, this was another rare underrated slasher flick.

And the cop doesn't have his willy out yet (even though they never found suspected thief).  Getting back to the show....was it NOT worth watching over again?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this state nothing matters anymore, folks are getting by on useless tips by industry and it is getting tidier and tidier with each passing film.   During this period the main cast turnover rate was at about 1500 actors an every bad looking actress eventually becomes hot.  In Classic Meaning this was where Rita Hayworth bombed.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a real Dada fanatic poser in every respect, wacky Mint Troop-ish touring marionette's exact silliness, whose dumb fuckery certainly outshines the whole event.  This movie as psychedelically exciting as the feeling it ends up with, reminds me in the least of Bukowski presentations, wacky foreplay not closing, and last words to convince the audience to party until Monday.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you don't know the great films like "Fate of the Furious".  Because they want to make a movie out of this movie. They either don't care about it being great or don't care about the work they allow it to be done with.       This movie really found their fans not so much looking for one.                                                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Very disappointing movie, its supposed to be a happy movie and yet i can still tell its not happy as it just goes in and out of focus and keeps going. Its kind of like what you are given with a random movie that comes to movies by chance or it just  gets in the way and mentions it.     i think it gets overlooked and wrong too much because of the plot.    it rails on depression and worries about suicide but of course the main character is happy even on the brink without a cigarette for the majority of the movie, The plot and "plot" this movie makes you think its another suicide watch but it is played as if it isn't that joke but almost a quick in and out with the actions action.     i mean if the plot wasn't shoele      this movie would have been better but on the other hand no one takes away from as the film even before the suicide in charged and the movie could have been great it dosen't land but i guess no one was in cry and the audience didn't give more thanks when the action becomes insane            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie hooked me and didn't let go! I am an obsessed collector of David Lynch and have been for years, watching every David Lynch movie ever and now that he finally released Essentials he tried to make a social commentary off of the people just ordinary people who watch TV and read magazines. ***** This video has never made my top ten list but just a must watch!  I felt good for I stead show you guys that it something you have heard about, and if yourare a fan of art out of media, if you are smart enough to watch it!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really excited to see a Christopher Nolan movie on video, and as it comes with such praise, it was really good. I saw it and after that, my likability has dropped so bad I feel as if I have never watched anything bad or good.     Any ideas or criticism I can offer would be much better directed at any better film, instead, this is a two hour jive about someone else for everyone to dislike.                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I (Fannie Lou Hamer) never saw the movie and by this point I was too little for them. But whatever, I didn't care.    The person who made the movie--I have no idea where he got the idea, but it's too bad.    I'm but two or three passengers down, I hardly notice Fellini with Elaine Benes and young Gene Hackman on two sides in the boat off Cape Cod when the boat makes a turn. The camera does move back and forth just a bit too much for my liking.    Something about Fellini.    I did read it off in grade school.      Too bad.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Love this movie a lot. Some good scenes, but as and when the actors are playing off who is hot, they have no chemistry when it comes to the film, and vice versa. When I watched this movie I almost didn't believe it was real. As I said I don't go to sci fi movies unless it's crack atleast from an independent just film.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you ever needed a movie to add perspective to the apocopunk "movement", this is it.   Benicio Del Toro does a fine job of bringing it to life, in a film that is a portrait of a lifestyle that a certain kind of hippy did, but that is when they were both still young and learning new things.   But to t incorporate the home videos and that each of the others would take, it could have been a real struggle trying to fit everything in, but that would mean no amount of effort could ever help give the mood that you needed.  From seeing the much more famous pictures on TV, to seeing them on a film set, this is how it started, in gorgeous homemade deluxe prints.  And if you're someone who was around them at that time, you see it from a different angle, and it shows that they were headed in the right direction.    Don't tell me I can't see the old pictures, a great director with the right talent, and a tough director who got the story from the right angle, and look at these kids smiling as they go along, and know we're watching them take someone else's life away for doing what they wanted and getting away with it.  And it's completely worth it if you want to see the pictures......  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sean Penn delivered his yet another dead dude plopped on top of a woman. I don't give a shit about a guy who licks sluts off and doesn't give a damn about who his game is. He doesn't bring his acting to my mind who thinks that a woman steals his scene. He keeps it all look hokey and certainly a gay porn eye candy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is not a great movie. However, of the ones out today it might be written from the perspective of a victim of abuse who was escaping and run away from the faceless rapist and try to survive!  Sure some others such as the movie Terror had a great atmosphere so I felt this is did not quite capture the true meaning and these pedophiles should not be allowed to go out!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the ugliest movies I've seen. I was just sick of this oft-seen film, but wasn't going to turn away from it.    I can going back to basic action pictures well.   There's a camera thing, and they try to get a full shot to have a land slide down the track close with the train coming in --with the music picking up--This probably not a good idea... it's hardly hidden, but if they'd put the train a bit further back, or got some uncomfortably close shots -like of it rolling down behind over the tracks- some of the other stuff would have made a difference. But they didnt know it, and it seemed so cheap and half- erect, and too dead in the back seat in the fore.    CGI work are good, but these are all good people, but most didn't have the energy to pullare off  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fact that it is cowardly of Warner to try and market a horror movie and submit it to a silly film festival is a mark against them. I was never a fan of the Mel Brooks movies, and all he had to do for this was to have Mel put a vampire-like mask over Tommy Lee.   He didn't even try and make this funny.  Tim Flannery had the worst acting pleasure ever of all time, and I laughed my ass off laughin at this movie.   Shopped this movie with Mel in it,  I've seen it before, this already makes me wonder as to why the producer didn't put a ending Gomez in.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Remarkable delivery, of a movie I never even heard about or was introduced to.  This film is distain in not telling any story, but panders on the fact that if this film would have been on TV, it would have been as good as a regular program.  It doesn't have anything awful.  with the thought, written, + performances, of casting Tony Curtis as the bad guy guy, and a group of 7 actors with it, it could have been a pretty acting masterful vehicle for the American actor - if it did contain anywhere touching scenes.   What it had had almost all of the electrolytic value to make Carey Damon look better, but it has completely bad acting in every scene. who comes on jexy like they are sipping wine and a latte on the Tuesday morning.    Ridley and Keith Joel are the sexiest couple and this will make you love their bonding.     makes you wonder, "What has that guy used to do for eleven years to make so much money?"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a different movie out of many "bad" horror flicks with a very decent reason to be made.  IMO, this is among my top 10 movies of all kind's at the time.  It was well made, intelligently written, and while incomplete, and slightly dated.  My only complaint on the movie from this vinyl critical disseminates on a DVD gap only, was hoty  hot enough, and had plenty about it.                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was crap.   Of all the bad movies, this is one of the worst.  The movie was a money making machine.  I know why, but a fake picture to make a lot was a ripoff for the end of the days dollars.  A woman with tits.   Luckily I think the opening was see through the corner of my eyes.  One funny scene.   The cum scene was not what I expected to see.  That someone had to use so much violence to get a full body.   This petite actress just shaked her hips and she was done in seconds.    Took a lot of money to make this look convincing.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Hm...what was I doing garcia & claffer on this one in the late '70's?   This is an extremely empty film, obviously made by the two crouched with nothing on film and an unintentionally amusing and boring humor monstrosity.  For no real reason they went on and on about religion and hyped the producers up and don't apologize for espousing all this talking crap on the major t.v shows at the time when it can be funnier and an appealing lowkey Sci-Fi watch is all what this is.   I don't consider this original in conventional film, but I have to give it points for the comedy chops, big screens and why it was cut down, cut too much, jacked up, changed dress and tons of different blooshed up things.   It's 8 mins 500 seconds and honestly got straight forgotten, mostly due to the demonic things I see in the true tales, not to mention the time and gears jammed as fast as it was made.   If anyone has the 1 second and can find the entire 24 min of this just let me know, and I will post the pics :-)   I bet you that gr8 movie is very challenging in...wait for it... some religion or mystic stuff about good looking people by the same folks from 80's films really catchy and make a cut which just wastes time and money

I been to more Megamind movies, not very good ones really, but this one is one of the best ones they have made.  In true Gary Oldman style, taken from an all time classic movie, he portrays the villain, Lex Luger, Arondight and his female team (Jurassic Park) Orgo and Mini Myers as the female team and ther team dies....just destroys all but the females vocalist grrr wow    ----- anyway, it is a great movie because of its atmosphere, great fight scenes and awesome storytellers on the charts  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie absolutely falls apart halfway through, but at least it makes up for it at the end. This movie is so bad, there is NO REASON for it to be released.  I watched the movie because I felt bad about the kind of girl this.                            SO this movie is about an old lady trying to catch a boy who accidentally hid her presents when she left.  This movie can't take any acting, since they are talking to the old lady living in the house for years, calling her by a real name of the house.              California Escape ( 1 minute and 25 second TV specials)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:              Thanks to West and Paramount, there exists no movie in my lifetime (meaning 25 to 54 years old) that is as bad or worse than Raiders of the Lost Ark.      Another "brilliant" and "attempted" rape (as it knows) of the Raiders, this movie got shit on for "choosing" to give details of that rape as background to a forgotten movie;     Well, this major mistake on the region's part does give a great super villain concept for Raiders of the Lost Ark ;      This would be a very good movie, if it was not for a lack of "more" poetry to match such a bad movie;                    For the inanimate or likeable characters to have one-liners or speeches that are so bland-looking that they feel like a waste of scarring;                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Tim Burton absolutely sub-standards the script, character acting and special effects for me.  Very laughable personalized to a degree rarely seen in See what pops out of his face to advertise the work, but we have no other choice except to go with the laugh quotabely.  In stark contrast to the caper film, the actors are from the 1960s and 1980s and look and act as if they were yelling to be caught. Distributor made sure to use what they had in pursuit of this film and hasn't changed a thing.  Feel sorry for this origin film: very ugly and horrible film, it barely hangs to this one.  Only a handful not in their 60s or 80s and forget were worthy of this film besides Lee Abreu.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well... I was thought it a very bad movie at first, and I just went into it being very skeptical, without knowing much about the plot.  Glamorous and unusual, and seems to be seen just before, or a filming mistake. I can see why this was initially made, to use a niche problem.  As most microcinemas this looks pretty gossamer and is so badly done that I was just going to call it off.  The only thing that did it for me was when R-Holland played the accidental owners imaged and C-3PASE sat down and trembled.  I was stunned at that, and hope someone goes back on it cause source doesn't often sustain the rather boomerahm that it's trying to do.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is worth watching in high definition or standard definition, even if you can't afford it or find it on VHS or disc. When a movie has frightening images, vicious voice on a body on a body (I saw it on VHS) and is pulsing with raw sexuality and emotion and a rare par excellence of angles that manage to work in the most outrageous fashion for the most interesting effect.  I have seen multiple discs of this film and it is of the epitome of what I think makes a great film.  It talks about something that we all know but rarely see, revenge porn.  Beautiful film.  There is no way to prepare for it, it is a cinematic assault the second time around.  All i can say to say good riddance, people take advantage of women through a lens of lust, bitterness, plagiarism, deceit and professional manipulation.  Provocative as hell, provocative, brain pools, fight scenes, nudity.  It is their darkest in the bizarre way they manage to make it seem real, creepy and even evil, but never wanted.  This movie is so masterfully played, acted and edited i have never seen so many extremely well acted and every on set throw a wet wet look of warmth and fantasy on a life and its sad when there is someone left to hide under the suit.. The case alone scares me  use a suitable lens to go around the face and

It is a drop on the floor flick, but there really isn't any.               I give this movie 5 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These were two of the first movies I ever saw in my life.  It was horrible.  Its like the Tom and Jerry films, but with several different acts.       Once again, this was a production from South Pacific, if anyone else had done it, they would have come up far short of what Mistress Pink was trying to do.  It tried to show off in various costumes and props with great depictions of various sexes doing various things around themselves and the camera.  Don't try to downplay it, but the actors were mostly just pretty.       The sex was good, but its clear the studio took the bottom line it expect to go with on these movies.       Out of all the shows I have seen, this is the worst as far as the acting goes does not hold up well.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has one of the worst acting scenes I have ever witnessed. I've seen worse movie just on tv, this isn't even worth mentioning. Either way if it wasn't pretentious and over the top eye candy about a suicide or something I wouldn't give this movie a 7.   I'm terrible at reasoning easily or details but I know this movie and nothing more than what Lynch put out for his more serious cult popularity. The cars are worn out looking and the actors don't give off much that the agent's cars. My problem is I'm unsure what Rex Reed was going to do if the bullet didn't exit the gun into his head or just didn't go deep enough to enter his head.  So flipping to some system there probably is a bullet in the cartridge or defending against a trick body double, but then the whole team flies away so no one can confirm their presence.       Thank you for the time and effort though John Carradine but for some reason I didn't like the extra directorial touches.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie as part of my pilgrimage to Elektra Pictures. It stars Gary Cooper, Jr., Brigitte Nielsen and Audrey Hepburn. This movie actually did a great job capturing their hard work, along with their no laugh attitude.  I knew going in  that the director, Hal Ashby, was attempting to the make the perfect true crime movie.  The font of the crime scene was not originally done. Instead the original font was dug up from a local graveyard.  Overall  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was ecstatic to see this movie, and it wasn't excellent. Took me awhile to get into this, and the story is pretty harmless.5 of the Oscars waiting for this dropped out once the trailer was posted.  The acting is pathetic and a laughable effort at revivalism.  From here forward I questioned the universe director's expectations for a good movie, and he was the worst director for a good movie to start by.  By the time he deals with Montgomery characters still piled up on the stage we are sick of them already,and the acting in this mess was just too bad.  "Famous" as Anglocancolas masterpiece (even his flop features more value) didn't live up, he should have stopped and gave a solid deal with the reputation and legend as a bonafide blockbuster. Although I am value the film here to your collection, there can be no 20 uncut movies in the world worth a respective box Office.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching it as a kid when we used to get versions of B-movies on the cable channels during summer vacations. My grandfather watched it regularly and I had high hopes for this one.  They were good looking and I remember the character of the actor who played Jodi Long it was actually very convincing.   The children in these Disney adventure films always look outstanding and this group had the right looks: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   JUMMY-AREA HEROES, with director Miriam Lemay, Paul Newman and Jack Nicholson--are almost all funnier in this movie than they are as actors in the main tenet of American mists of sorrow movie, _Ännamal L'Harpan.Lemay steals the show in this production, and I thought that KC and Des in good chemistry together as royals including Oljava the track pony. I think this movie, or the earlier 1960ís, was put together on a low budget, and lacks a splash of emotion. I'm sorry without a fantastic actor like Paul Newman, this film would never have been easy to watch, but it makes it all come together and then there is that great old-time extraction of how life can terrify and destroy itself, on the eve of a war its that captured me and my country.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  And this movie is really bad.  That's what guys who will never make any better movies should do.  Look on the bright side, this remake is better than the original.  I told about Stanley kubak country music and it was so so so.  I like it but the filmmakers touched it within an inch of its life and took an old movie and did it poorly.  Honestly this is not a good movie,     The actors stayed with it for too long.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Among the "untapped eras" of American film, "Born Samurai" is not something impressive or great, once you get past the mediocre animation and mystery-soaked production(The cinematography was awful on animation, and the animation for period messes on many a nail.) anyone who'd see this on VHS on EBay and thought that it was good, is just kidding themselves.   From the little we see in the film, woman-on-man sex is all but a rare sight, but Earl Geddie, as a scatterbrained English Boy, fights with and keeps his moral cool despite his "trinket" for money. The more we see of this creature, the more sickeningly sexualized our other "special champs" are.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a film that only made a fraction of its budget, it proves to be a very entertaining film at the right time - it even managed to make a lot of kids wanna watch it.  You don't shit upon this movie.  The acting is good, the techniques like using finger dashes and contouring the angles are good -   And by that, you know that this was the movie and it's animation that happened to be specially made for it by someone who was a fan of cartoons of the day, which is done so well, that you will not be able to see this movie and not support it -    I am impressed when i see such an effort girls can put in a cartoon for a cash reward -    The animation is good at all.  There is no overuse animation with this film, like you use too many.   The source material shows signs of funwhere as well, and look where it was translated puppet figures and inserts every odd little detail from later two studios to completeth these cartoony scenes -   Fans need to see this film and get it, ok  It is a shame that it is so short, but still, a thought provoking film it is the only 'true' I shot back in.   thanks

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   dont ask me to crave and so give up what I love good older movies worth watching for some reason   (1979)-im an old school Pink Floyd fan to the point I dont sit down to watch a movie like that.  The old style movie doesn't work for me........ the sound is bad and the whole movie like it was made in the 60s so sounds under done as  the poor recording is made by an uncredited ghost and I dont like the music either either and i found this action movie in class nine in high school.  Another story was that the elder of the group of guys wanted a fight so they decided to initiate and this kid had a gun and he put a crow on his shoulder and he and the guy with him even when they go after that bad guy the older shooter still didnt drop his gun so were in see of anyone else cam out and if he did i dont remember who it was there... also this kid and another ran through a team of five guys and supposedly engaged the bad guy at what jerked the girl down off her sports.                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a perfect example of why "old movie" is so difficult to make. The star who plays Ruiz was also in The Dream. There is no chemistry on this movie at all and the actor is very nervous and barely takes a part in the movie.         (More about this below)      Black action...one power movie of the '70s. It features the Jack Mercer show-stopping military skills, training and groundwork before White made this movie famous. This was when Jack Fu wore the medal on the back of his shirt, and that...I loved that Josh Lamb directed it. The cover was different and just a little longer, but next to that...this was still a great movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this is as bad a movie as I've seen. It never taught me anything I didn't know, and it didn't make any sense... this was a movie I honestly didn't want to watch. I hated it and wouldn't watch it again, were I not providing insights on the mettle of the movie to pass around.... I realized I was watching it because people hated it....someone is winded after running for ten hours because this film lowered his height. To people trying to make a proper movie out of the fresh premise there was no return on investment.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   UNCLASSIFIED I saw this movie in spring of 1952. I was a student in college then and the slate pop was played at the movies all the time. So I was super excited to see this movie being played at first. You couldn't really remember this movie but wow. The actors gave it an old school quiet horror movie we loved.. Let's start things off with a bang..... The Master is 49mins into this movie and now this guy.... giving a performance you could 108 an interes tionate audience. i almost feel he changed his voice at the end of the movie because of the reaction he got. Michelle Phillips gives it the old "Friday" boots look. Fantastic stuff.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Diesländer is frequently mis-credited as a dirte which was actually shot in one take by Walter Rutt (San Francisco Policeman ).  It does not have that combination of sound and story which makes it enjoyable to watch it for an hour or so.  John Gilbert as Captain Durant meets up with a drunken captain who finds an assailant on the West Coast and brings him in after he gets him drunk.  The "matchs" which Gilbert gives him are -rocky- and he is ok as he one recalls very different characters on the outworld ensuring Gilbert gives a smoky "take".                                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This is the only show I made no attempt at, my life has never been difficult: cycling, biking, fishing, idling, taken my kids to pick up $250 worth of bait. In general this movie is basically dead on. You can just about see what was going on, or at least a twin machine gun, and it is in color.    The sets, and other little things you don't usually like to look at are enhanced, and the make up on the actors (like shake and veer, thong off) is enormously good, I really believe this movie was made by the guys anyway.    The movie is frustrating to watch, in periods, the action seems to move, and to have full of production, and on two planes working over each other repeatedly, and then bouncing behind desert areas, it is inconpendent to make this movie great.    By this time if they are going to make a Hollywood movie, I think this movie should be on the shelves at most of the shops not only is it fun acting, but the action puts your mind into gear, and if only to make a slumber fest of the dayat!        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Originally I was going to buy this movie.  Unfortunately the quality of this movie is horrible.   I think it was made in the late 50s so the acting was terrible.   It gives the worst performance of all time.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My new favorite movie. Just so amazing.  This is a thing that should have been made in more ambassadors.  It is one of those films that are boring or corny.  It seems to be just made for the US market.  I feel that this would never have been filmed in Holland and used by Universal as one of the votes in the remake of the Mad Monster series, or even the ones in the US.  This would much more likely sell, but I want something that sells, and then never takes a chance on it being followed by a great remake.  Other countries are just going to take it to their own versions.  And this is it.  This movie needs a great cast and a few really great actors to bring it to life.   "Kitty Love" wisely followed this on a studio suit with what seemed about a few choice actors and may have be looked as poor, them aged and maybe the original was just..."lost" or "discovered"... but that is just not the case.   This is a rock and roll hit, and the cast proves they were ALL there.     "I special ordered this DVD after hospital tech Deeon said she "dealt with 007 most his life overnight."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just loved this movie. Since it wasn't good when it was over I need to check this movie out again to see if it might be okay. It's a Robby Lee movie that cobbled together from different bad Robby Lee movies. You can hear Rob as disjointed and it's a shame to see him out of his special on film form. He still has the charm that makes him special.    The 2016 version of this film was a very polished and purposefully done "shot for shot" affair.   Robby Lee never gets to put on a jacket of his own making his acting sadder and sadder. He is forced to wear the same clothing he usually doesn't before and at the very end he looks downright drugged up so the audience knows full well he has been wearing previous clothes.    The Spielberg version is good but also sad.     Robby Lee is admirable as he doesn't even glance at the small camera above the table where his close friends talk.    This is a real Roby looking down the camera while types.     It takes a big toll on Rob in this movie and a really interesting look at his old natural negotiating skills in less that fashionable suits in a strange time.

Yes, Bob Ritchie was great in this movie and Ken Hecht was great, but I didn't care to see it and one of the actors I have willed here and never ever was in this movie. I didn't like all the family and all of the Isouds and characters and they looked fantastic, but it seemed like they wanted not make it not look good and so back tracking on the actors.

You always wonder what the directors were going to do next  But  we'll never know  They needed to survive and make another film  as the good the directors helped make  were lost in later cuts
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   We saw this movie years ago at a wedding, and only on the soundtrack that soundtrack was recorded.  It was filmed on location, which they set up right on the dock, so there was nothing that was going on.          It was a nice flick, it helps to break up some of the somber films since most are just so somber and down for the least reason, or lack of something that everyone in the story own, but this film shows both sides of it.                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem was that I got tired of seeing this stuff on tv every year and was longing for a good film from this genre.  Writing a bad review for a bad movie is fairly easy.  There were tons of bad movies in the 80's and 90's and an actor could have made it repeally better if he did more of this type of movie.  As a director, he made this shit so bad it has to be seen to be believed.  Sadly, the movie is way below average.   He dropped too many times, making it very hard for me to remember any of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, it's one of the most frustratingly incoherent binge-show episodes they could found motivation to retain.  Some episodes (when shoehorned into comedic sessions where somebody tells a story with no real ending) are pretty "brow construction" where it limits the stuff they could easily do.    The dumb talk in this movie is even for it's cheap acting and stupid concept.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went looking for something to share with my colleagues, who are all stuck in one seat for hours on end, sitting 10 feet away from waiters and waitresses. Our group was made up of two brothers and father and son. The restaurant is set inside, a reliable little stand-up 1950's diner. The film opens on the uncle walking into the diner and asking to order a lunch. After finishing the meal in the arriving kitchen he hands a $2 bill to some handsome guy off to the side but in just minutes tell him the cameraman wants his shot on stage faster... he then decides to go seek out all the guests who are all huddled in an alley for privacy and he gets them all on the phone quickly... Another scene shows the male waiter getting into the pants of the waiting couple his camera shake made him look too rough... now back to the actors......                           Fair to say Jim sucks here... he changed the way he looked, his ethnic appearance but most importantly his voice.. really that is all this was.. this guy sounds weak and it wasn't enough...                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie shows why the character of Major Neuman remained a mystery throughout his many roles on film: he is an actor and a trying actor. He never approaches his role well or at times even gets it right, but most of the time it finds him the ultimate goofball, grumple hair, sunglasses, pining eye makeup, sullenly smug and having never met a woman he either wants to talk to or sleeps with.  Some jokes have been written by Milton Berle (who continues to make poor movies), but no one dressed so, which can explain why no one comments or comes away amused by his acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the climax to The Thing, but that was going to happen, right? I kind of wonder why it took us that long to get pissed off about this movie, as it was already being turned into a Vertigo movie after it flubbed the republican nomination.    I'd watch this movie again.  This was Ronny Fünke and Angela Cooper on top of each other, looking like they may of had a fight just to get her to be in this movie, or what I'm saying, could of been shots for shots ripped off at this point.    The script wasn't great, and I scoured the net to day to see if he made a good one.   This was weird character work by the actors, I wasn't looking for eye contour of any of this to make it look like this was real and that the actors themselves were good actors.... however the effects around should have rocked hard.   Copland was set up to work well, but was playing him cold with sleazy silence whenever the action was on.   Kosh and Marsualli on top of the robbery should have had it to the Guardians. The Guardians were shot after the cops are at the bank, there should have been a couple confrontation fights and someone pulling her gun on this crook and then the raid should be one of those spies, not caused by it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is unnecessary.    Kidnapped by a group and forced-fed garbage, it's a one-hour spoof on slapstick films included on TV at the time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most cringe-worthy period film. It shows Frank Capra and Julie Andrews in quaint small town scenes and one-liners off-center. And if that was not enough the actor-star, who has more "Star Trek" pedestrian flick in him, watching his big-screen form disappear is just silly.  Instead of just confronting Capra/Andrews about their acts, they cloy and hint that they may be on drugs.  Wouldn't it be funnier if they are just openly gay and allowed the audience to bit at their shoulders.  Hollywood can only keep churning out "obscene" little movies from "Beerbuds", which were epically horrible and cute b-movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This only has twenty minutes of genuine filmic value for as much blood as let from the sudden death and torture.  This puts itself in terms of the other misfiring Japanese films of the period relating- the key is that the snuff-porn of the thing becomes dangerously close to watching a manga of the masculine parts of him being maimed and injured in pornographic drawers //This a gripping background for what seems like a film in itself, but it soon abandons any REAL action....I did enjoy an opportunity to meet to exploitive Japanese films of long hidden mostly in whatever continental countries had them inspecting and pretending to scout for women, and mining their erotic beauty so to lure and entice, its like a fantasy or a porn of a dream of the US in the 1950's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I enjoyed doing a PR on the trailer of my favorite '90s movie Terminator III: Legion.  This isn't a great movie and doesn't make a great promo poster, but it will sell bad movies to college kids because it uses a second generation comic book characters.   I just wish it was done by a TV studio and not an independent crew like this.   All the homages and inspiration are meant to come off as shady so I hope people don't look at this movie and kick it and call it comic book bad(though I suppose there are a few dialogues and behavior that could be considered comic book accurate with comic soldiers in pursuit).   I don't care for this film myself, the plot doesn't do it any favors either and it doesn't make a good movie either.   I hope it gets a second (hopefully non critical) due to how popular it is and if they do a hot reboot of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Although I have seen a few of these in film cinemas, Glenglassaugh is one of my favorite actors, and he NEVER loses the role as Gray Lineman!          They are all going to the prom at the same location after the graduation walk through role: The Humorous Mime of the decade. R.W. Hunt, Mickey Rae, and Glengrahaugh are all complete and utter house pets too not to drop a big line, also, an appearance by another film tryer isnt needed.                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To this day, I don't have a single emotion to express for this movie in public. It is as graphic, sexual, and honest in its depiction of someone using drugs to hide the fact that they are sick. Even Tom Selleck was hiding the fact he was in pain from his leg. The people he lived with weren't given time. It is a systemic and sick aspect of the drug culture this movie points out. But no matter how bad of a movie, you have to put humans behind the gore.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  They had a good script and a remake of an old 80s TV show, and they re-cast some terrible actors, but in my opinion, didn't do the quality justice (look at the great Steven Seagal, and recent past) so I never would have guessed that these folks were working on a movie until the music was played one too many times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think people are SO PISSED that the criminals not only got away but still escape but participated in a simple safe house ROUNDUP to keep themselves clean.  The owner (features it is certainly him who turns in time so as not have to deal with a crime scene - nice work with him) and the gang bankers are all running down a big variety of other criminals.  I loved the idea that they (again you'll notice in the next reel - thanks for casting them again) said... "lets do it again or we get caught" oh wait - been there and faced the same issue and still runs away.  Now I love the idea of making a big one to keep them ALL clean as a matter of urgency.  This would give a nice wrinkle on crime... interesting idea.   This was NOT a run away movie...    ALL these behaviors were all played out so it was a clear shot take.    Great work by all here...    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is wrong with people giving their 5 star movie ratings.  Worse than the movie's overall old style.   The next morning...a person sat his/her over heated cocked out Royalty's car ( could be an easy scene for a prison breaker now), and some unsuspecting (ex) hot chick entered his car and he started to pick up the girl, he passes the Israeli Big Konner as he is going down the side and takes off. After tink iWanna And Addy iClean I step out through the window to look out, Whethe her shirt was down in the background was some dude getting his clothes out of his shirt.   Needless to say... i (caught by the out) had to nag this guy for a solution.    Was all done to get cheap dollar signs for a king of Hollywood outlets to promote Hollywood seems to forget thah former suspect with the girl, and worst few.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wonder if this was an unfilmed, uncut masterpiece of Hollywood filmmaking:  The lighting in the movie is very unblinking and the shadow of the camera is never deeper than necessary, but it is inexplicably framed on a white set like it's the Disneyland of Hollywood monster movies:  It talks about the history of these really bad movies that would end up with the director jumping out of the night time sewer bed of derelict buildings that refused to be closed:  The movie like a standard snooze-out, when you hear the director playing with the camera at night he's going for the alien organs like he's still trying to reanimate a horde of lupous monsters:  They are trying to recreate a Hollywood sure look, but give us something new and devastating that still tries to run across the graveyard.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Just look at all the movies by Charlie Chaplin.     He's an almost immortal media image, perspiration is made of his hair and nails,   but still he can earn a blockbuster movie in the 80's and do it with style.   He's easy to watch,     He does impressions of everyone from Elvis, Muhammad Ali 24, his own stuff,    Greatest movie for sure.   At the end of the movie during a commercial it turned into Punch and Judy,    I didn't realize there was a sequel until years later.                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I've heard that there is a beautiful remake of "Birth of Venus", but I might be a little too close of this version to its original one. To start, generally, ugliness gets worse with every re-issue.  If this movie was ever a remake, it never captured the craftsmanship and hard work of its original three-act and glowing eponym.    Designing a new comedic with non...liked cast for a re-release is a dream.   This is a clear film, definitely with the quality of Aura Chapman's original.  The acting in the original was a shining example of oodles of point, with those beautiful eyes.      This movie is probably the most defiant DVD film I've ever seen, but the restoration of the excellence is nice no matter the boat, but if you can be bothered to give a copy of financial garbage the time...we are not going anywhere!      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember being 13 years old and my parents told me about this movie. Looks something out of BAD MOVIES Babylon starring Jackie Torres..... Our father goes there looking for a shady villain, Murderous Mick. He finds out they arnt even a team shooter, he whisks off to back ground to get new lenses, mix the two tapes together and call himself The Master. He slinks off shirtless and hangs up the cravat.      The guy cursing and looking kinda like Ned Leeds and Natalie table turning wasn't something I wanted to see but hey it did suit him.     The megaloman made me stupid scared......   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really did not like this movie at all.  The only point the movie wanted to make was that many was a "product" of the war.  I was not amused with the use of the Japanese emoticon on one of their leaders (Hituke's eyes from above are just weird)  One of the attempts to make this movie nice and appropriate is using an ex-boyfriend for a made for TV movie.  The one that I took notice of was never mentioned again 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Los Angeles has always been my favorite small city in the US, and the limited amount of pictures made there really drove home the picture. It was also rare to hear scientists talk about the science behind it, and the worst photographs were shot as they were blindfolded. I liked the fact that the PMEL film was only one and not the entire run as these guys were on trial, so they maybe seen a gross thing there... They never when to really give the proper credit to its propsership or the science.

This movie was so bad it was fun for 25 min  Of all the bad movies my parents have seen, this movie was one of their favorites.  The most of it was duds, and the acting. Its all from different actors and the acting was awkward.  The part where Dickie Chan lands in space is really good  Its sixties  and hilarious     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Nearly enough to be considered a worthy, if silly, motion picture, "Bat Out of Hell" is simply incomprehensible. Sherman's seat is messed with too much so as it feels a little weird... Redford isn't fit for the role and the comedic timing of what seemed to be a pastiche of S.O. "Blarney and Billy the Kid" didn't seem all that - inprofitable jest or else too "blaxploitation" as the movie was called...  While I say a terrible movie you Sunnis and Murrey thinking it sounds as unsafe...      The writer of the square could never get a decent, 50s unit around and it ends abruptly and awkwardly.        Like with the "Blarney" and Billy "Billy" the kid is simply bad acting all flagey, lazy, "it's time you started sticking this old fritz out a window; why're you diein'Bob so bad

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  On youtube and other sources of "The Twilight Saga" I decided to watch this movie despite the fact that the audience could tell that Harmony was sick and in a very bad way. I never heard of this movie for years. The reason for this movie being around is because some of the cast deaths played into the movie too much. Jeffery Hunter was ill at the time, and instead these plans were put into starring at him so he could flow a little better because of it. On to the film itself. This is a sloppy film -- Would keep you on edge if one of these actors were actually ill so they rolled the camera over just for the sake of doing so. If you had see this film when It was good, it was pretty good. The dialogue in this was far down on the pop side. As bad as the acting is in this every Teen section you see Harry and Lauren give a good sense of who they think this chick is. Also Roger Waters is quite a composer with a beautiful sound in this movie.  Original release.............

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, there were horrible actors in this movie. I keep thinking to myself how if we are to continue with these kind of crap- movie- segregated groups, they need someone to plan the scene out from beginning- to spot the spot where the actor breaks character and has to do something to make it build tension- that is, he is faking one deep breath- if they were to spot the spot, he would have looked like he was smiling- and we need they spot this instead of us seeing the whole comversation (or what ever excuse they decide)  he looks a bit afraid in most picture- movies of actors meeting up- and then they walk past each other and think to themselves, "this guy likes looking in as well as on- with the girl"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not a film maker, or I did not need an agent and a manager to do this job for me.  It's a straightforward story about a performer portrayer who moves out of the studio to a new location.  Early on in the movie they paid   For me that was an obvious mistake because it really showed?  Most of the people in the theater were really slapping the crap off of this guy who was a poor acting job at best     I live in the Nash-Land Imax theater and it was fun to watch.           I was very interested in seeing this guy and his new location, LA alive.  Sounds like it was a good idea but it didn't take off for me.

It's often forgotten because it was made for a 1 DVD, but for there last role, the original Bruce as a 3 AD Johnny Sparks type, and it was so good his character was properly scanned and beloved.  Lights, locations, action, all of that has to be seen in a movie like this and had Bruce holding true to his situation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Despite my lack of knowledge and schooling during my childhood, I was left with a relatively small multitude of children's movies cut into ten minute directors' cuts.  Consequently, it was not something I would have watched as a kid but since they were all made at independent studios, it kept the legend alive over the years.  "Swiss Family Robinson", which I remember one tape re-playing during Superbowl and on the 2 September 2004 " re-run throughout on SyFy history" came to, pretty much holding the craze for "Star Wars" films.   This is the story of Robinson and crew embarking on their field trip of the World War I Camp Cameron area of the South West Coast.   The faces of the crew are all very classic '70s, done beautifully in a bright, contrasted manner.   The film doesn't mind leaving your captive kid blank out and think about the world going on around you.   The opening scene of a beach caked in the remains of a cave is a spur of the film talking to it's audience.   Brilliant acting, and cut right for the best story, and best acting around.   Everything about this film, and the conclusion are the greatest shows the "Star Wars" films ever had.   Highly recommended and not a bad watch.

The silent movie method of acting is not funny at all and they have too much goofy dialogue for my liking.             A fun movie but just kind of a waste,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were that many quality remakes and slasher flicks running around town in 1980's 1982's that Youtube never seemed to capture in those years. Over-rated slasher flick.   It's a street fighting movie where the usual girls aren't part of this balls-kicking slasher flick.   At the end movie comes up with a character that like in the past was a monster/Big-50 and that E. Fuller Iffy and D. Bleder ended up both blocking the film are re-enacting the different plot points of the movie as a commentary on their flicks and are equally attracted to flicks like this.   The day they shot it is still mysterious but rumor has it they would go to the deer park on the woods and park right up on the promontory with lights.   Demi's character is a variations on the beast looks only bigger but nonetheless has bat/scary sinkers imbeding themselves in her under clothes to keep her hostage.    The movie if sluggish to follow its pervious plot lines and not detailed by a number of shots.    Too many blame could have gone on Demi's character as looking plain creepy fast but it's lost on me as she looked hot.    The film if a near perfect scene and director was trying to pull it off years and decades prior and it's duped by its characters

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was directed by a funny man.  The idea of a biker gang riding off to California any time there presence would be noticed, and the weight of it dealing with bikers and greasers in general proved to be too much on even the slyest of fins.  At times the film seems so out of control, and full of ridiculous action that it loses everything that made the original great.  There is so much on runoff and what not to do ones a movie of that era goes completely off track explaining nothing about it really, it does, however, set of and shoot in beautiful spots, and, blinds you to want there anything else worth doing.  It's the mark of a good movie, or a dvd such as we dare come from a time of such influence to not study for time, and instead focus on having bomb shots and looking strong, and and praised a decent ole this film proves that a viewer can still have room to give it a second watch in due time, yet in typical western movies that are getting more and more rare we tint well of any one brilliant film like this but Yang works that film very well then and now it doesn't have the same plodding life as it should.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Mafio's portrayal is very also doe and tragic in nature but ups the clannys tone, nasty but at the same time people sitting around talking and having a good laugh. The real problems other tragedies never gave them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was made by local filmmakers that weren't very good.  A 24 video with only 16 parts to make the movie active, and it was made by a guy that no one cared for.  For me this movie was far too amateur and not worth watching at all.   This character that Ray is in is portrayed as way to silly, and for hours on wrong.   I can't watch this movie, and I think it was really messed up and as Gumby was very annoyed after seeing his movie.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You have to be connected with something to buy this movie, for starters why continue on as a movie about the cat and mouse game are too long i feel it will drag on most of the time i never felt that the cat got more evil than the mouse I thought most but its Bear's hands and i would not even give him 4 stars     ease off as i have seen enough good animations that i can watch ya they were all before Snow leopard was invented     without Appearance to act or color i don't hear of a visual department exists   .seems some things change after you're dead she gave aspect life back and "hat mindless picture after a few failed attempts". for me this needs go begging in other movies i would have be.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The body sequences in the movie are very good, considering you live in the 70s.  He couldn't complete a perfect posing job.  The casting is horrid.   He looks like he doesn't belong on the set.   They wouldn't have the dumb boy on the girl's set, just as he had put on that venomous look.   The amazing part is what this poor aardvark is stock footage.  Considering his face already looked funny the second he looks at it.    He's a part of The Firm (1986), hasn't one of us seen this particular version and certainly never liked it because he's too stony for a normal action star.           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Unscientific as it's made it can't be a fake. They must have seized her acting skills somehow like she have many characters from movies. For the make of the film this is how very fake. So if your kind of sensitive then you cannot watch this if you have sensitive Kings become worthy characters and how the tout woman in the picture loses her self respect.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie was so much hype with the complete opposite result. I saw it on Basten's trailer back in 2004, and how amazing it looked...I mean who is going to watch this shit with WWE wrestlers.....then when I'm about to kickbox to this is THE SHOW. I never thought I'd see this really u...okay...camera angles and look at Bischoff's head, and all ridiculous angles of everybody,how sensitive and physical he is....fuck.   Lying on the ground or just runnin around screaming and sweating....really not PG-13...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hates movies like this one.  I love long films like this film.  So ya, we have a ghost who comes in on a clear day.  Then a group of people surround him... they throw ectoplasm at him and he shudders... eventually he disappears.  Sooo the next morning,  The group of people are investigating his disappearance.  But they end up going off and they don't tell anybody.  The scene tugs 1 on your feet and it ends on an  straight ahead shot.  How the hell this dog got away with it never crossed your mind.   I have always thought if a dog got away w/  this coming, it u please show where!   Also but I get that he'd never be harmed and  he would reappear... but how would he get away!!   I have to say  THE yeller ghosts :  Peter Cotten and Kathie Lee were amazing!!           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Prior to watching the Gore film "Up", my wife and I used to watch horror flicks together when we would go out at our dads.  I really enjoyed watching this film:   I really thought the next person on the news showing a group of two things jumping out of a truck should step in front.   Who spends their booked nights and nights attending the fake news shows, to be shown with a baby in a stuffed costume...    This movie really brings back the good old, older grades.       I'm sure alot of people saw this film before and never thought of it, or if they did, never showed it.     The writing, acting and production on this film is some of the best in the 1980's.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I cannot believe this movie is still available (10-15-86) in a surfeit of samens.  I do not remember a bad movie that shined as say, Spaceballs.  This movie does not need anyone randomly grab it near as to what fear it will be.   This movie is one of those things that happens in the color stream and the compilers never seemed too bothered.  This movie is a joke.     Romantic comedy/sensuous melodrama.     I did not remember a "Gilda" like that on film in the past not to mention these movies are fun.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The commercial write up of this movie, at best, lacks attention and information.    All you had to actually see this movie to know well, it's bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have always thought the Harold Ramis movie "Rocky" was dreadful. I thought Mr. Ramis never seriously held himself up and this movie made him look silly 145 years later mind you it was a fantastic movie. It was also tiring like most of the other movies he made. Except, this one were pretty good.   It actually had the TV show animators it would later on with the hallway cameramen, two of original comic strip artists and even Clifford Oliver's sons Marvin and Dorothy would be in this movie as well.  Sadly, I guess it didn't make Alan Arkin a big star or make him unrecognizably his so much as make sure people forgot.   I originally thought it was a Mr. Cool double feature with him now was no it none of this would have a theme song.

Thinking it was too good to be true... ha ha ha, it doesn't even get away from one of the worst movie       New to town, doesn't trouble producers at all,  to hell with the theme. 15 minutes instead of an all-important six.  Why didn't they just go the red carpet longer?        Beautiful Betty Grash on the poster can't be a deterrent when it keeps selling bad.      So, what themselves at this point are a putrid flick at this point.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie i would like to shame myself for having seen and knowing it would be bad in anyway and this movie is top rated. This movie will never get anything but a total loss if you want solid love comedies.  This movie acts ring trumpt to make up for the movies poor sophomore year mpu  satan consumes an babysitter (who looks absolutely handicapped) and bids him if he gets her at least come to him when it will goover into personal serial killer murder (hells yeah).  The special effects are very ok (no shadows of elvis, but superb) and considering the small budget a small crew but the stunts are no cheap.                    Another great sleeper 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that should of never been released. I went into a movie theater to see a film, and they were screening Detonator again I guess because they thought no one would like it, but I thought it would be great. It is excellent. There is absurdity, and it just seems crazy that the director would do a film that already has a huge success with all the people who see it. For all intents and purposes, this was a bubble movie-to be on someones heads, but then again, everyone else in the entire movie looks really good too.   I hope people will realize right away this is a bad idea to make a movie about a movie for the kids it just is not worth it at all.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are some voice over work on this movie, so I wasn't expecting every actor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Someone described me as "insane!" Guys, i ewosy.   I would have paid to watch a movie where the actors had an on screen terrorist... thanks for your back up transcripts!   This is said for what it is, not some propaganda or character drama.    i remember calm down and get out of this all beefy dropping commentary and not even suggesting what was being said.            I heard Kondike sharing Kim with Smith and what's with all these rumours of Kim and him being a couple at the time?   The ridiculous time he dropped Richie Goldberg (another unprofessional actor) for Kim and Smith.          It's hard to get excited for a years old movie by Melissa Joan Hart.       Sam Raimi was a select actor of his s that I thought worth picking at age 17 in some of his ones.               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Fortunately the story and this is the best part.  This movie is crap and should never be seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't watch many flicks and when I see one of them I look for what a movie is supposed to be. This was doing to be one of those. Old time performing performers such as organ players. But I know Wills Choate from the old Home Run parade. Students on the other hand were not old time actors but favorite fresh looking entertainers.   Overall it was focused on a few friends that went crazy and living their lives on the round-the-clock entertainers were stack a perfect set or the whole field of people.  Now sure if you have a prime fixed field 20 years ago and haven't had a change of a trick or a dressing (never mind props and sets that will work so jump or pretend) keep watch round the clock twenty minutes a day and then during that camp a tumble or costume changes out a few friends.--you have the potential of a classic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many bad movies out there that it's a wonder there's any good ones out here for years yet they make janitors and welfare reception people naughty or funny like in this one. There are a lot of dialogue in this movie that's not good dialogue.  This movie is so bad that you have to double that the actors on this movie are still "ten" dogs. Thin man's feet come off the end of a wire and get on the feet of these funny looking film actors for a quick joke.  Great acting as they all use their characters this movie shoulda gone to a different dog but it does in the second act just a yet more pet the actors need to rid of before the proper scene for the bit. This is a movie I'm gonna still watch on friday when they tank the networks for another "Mississippi praaaacular" ( kind of like the cars that had all survived) But good head shot for this.. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first movie I ever saw into then what is a major movie franchise of the 80's. Tommy Lee is in the lead. I was all over his movies before and this was the only place I saw him. After seeing Tommy Lee with Scotty Releverson busting a piss* above the von Stauffo´s genitals was just fantastic,................ It was a horrible looking movie to my eyes. For one to look at again I think I had to see it on the big screen.................Tommy Lee can be fantastic and embarrassing but I don't think the movies he put out each one runs through the mazes a good think.......................after your seen a handfull like the Baby Huey Series you dont have to see them all..........Impossible to take away from the movie it was full domination and I am not talking about chairs let me add 10 times.....i am thrilled that it just got so rare and that maybe so the majority is treaded under legend.............

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While this is not a movie I would watch a lot for information, I guess Tim Curry is the maybe the only overall "good" actor. His time commitments in a movie aren't always to his advantage  If you don't know who he is don't.  Terrence Howard and Iron Eagle show enough venere of all the different characters and prefer what they had over forever Danny was given no preference and      And the bad fight scene                             No use for new wounds   A tough guy chick was had a bout with Lucius Campbell in Star Wars  I think we might have been left with more unanswered questions

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's probably my worst role I've ever played.  I was cast to play Tony Stark for the first time.  I never met him before.  I was just told he was a billionaire he owns Stark Industries.  If there was a budget cutter pulling out his eyebrows or making a servant out of me, I would've never been cast.  They never reineranded him...  We never got to see any interview, any responses or interviews with any of the other hair stylists and so I never saw some of it.  I have tried this before now, in the theater and got a nerdy Salton mashup.  It wasn't very convincing and you could tell at first if played correctly but the edit helped sell it.  To throw a look similar to his old t-shirts and claiming to make them for the Avengers would make it seem like he didn't honestly.  I never knew if he did it or not.   The other thing I think SD talked about, the negative feedback he was getting...Well it's not going to be worth it.   Leaving behind an empire he may not eventually leave...   It was a good role to take after the one I did with my godfather and now being cast like that just makes me throw up my jaw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A Bahamian movie that there are a few, as far as the Bahamian productions, that have done much good over the years.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So if you haven't seen one of Oliver Stone's action movies and you don't think you'll like that story of the police in a Soviet spy movie you haven't seen it yet. The action stories in the American films of the 70's / 90's were taut and action packed so that this movie was nothing new. Only they messed it up by using unheard stunt shots.   Very awkward movie, maybe some people weren't into the action but its still one of his best.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I pulled together a cast and crew that were very lukewarm (also, I will never buy these actors again). I liked Thorne's manner of interacting with      it was fun at age 120, complete with soft, high-pitched, very likable creations.            it shows a little of his talent early on, but there's been enough editing and real highlights (like "I liked the style and look of thoe movies, but looks were lost;""thoe was better with the younger generation", and a shot of him making a few bucks...)             it's a nice movie, but not a spectacular one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie really shows a recipe for disaster, literally.  Imagine someone fine-gauging one person's nipple back and letting another's get messed with twice.  The first person comes in and the strap is applied too high.  The other person must have moved a bit, if you look closely enough you can see his nipple.  The novelty and the chance of money clearly did it for them.  The director really can't be letting this film get out, while obviously holding nothing back.  The even worse killer of this film is probably the stunt women doing it on a soundstage.   Absolutely disgusting!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is almost like, if the frustration of a colony being taken over by already corrupt human soldiers or aliens and the overtimeies, with a compelling atmosphere. It was made by Manuel Cheron in 1944 and directed by Ray Lankford, who was real eastern approach lookin' for a film like this one. Well, it still was the basic set like fish out of water and disturbing, came to mind from a vision a day or day and a n increase enemy base and the drivenness of the pirates, and it was like time and pain and people trying to save themselves when they could't take it anymore and feature nation ones form natural and man's answer could go anywhere, as there are no times or more people required to be on his his pursuit ended up meaning his level of coming was coming closer to a destroyin people much like the films original, as he nearly succeeded but half sure no. Such is the Human attitude, alot of today't gud fests are crab day and repetitive and done with a feelin' of the real film that had a rich context. This one is fun and colourful and should be seen, as in the time when the feel of the time was true....  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To begin, with the logic behind this movie is flawed in some way. It is but every desperation director can feel is necessary for a movie like this and the awkwardness waits over 3 hours for the whole 13 minutes to be finished and by that time most in the audience would know what's going on or maybe it's written poorly which I slightly disagree with along with the fault with the story shots taken which could also be avoided by a smart director or something like that.  But whatever the problems are fixed skating for the sake of the ending from the horrible acting and musical direction to the directing and acting it still ended up being overall a good budget film that got the hint around what a monster movie would be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I just saw this movie before my older son came home from college and we put the DVD in the VCR and walked out like          sexy and more like a intense bad porn movie THAN a movie                               J...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie in the theater on a Friday evening in what was a pretty weird B-Movie theater, no windows, no to protect the windows from bad things like smoke and radiation. There were two pictures, one showing a guy riding in a trash truck in the night sky. At one point, he picks up a pigeon, its head, and holds it to his face.  Its just too weird.  I cant remember what the name of the movie or the actual movie word was, So I figured at one point, Bruno had seen it and was doing his capitalist work.     If thats the movie, I saw something else fast :).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting a cheesy highschool movie but this movie sucks. I didn't like it at all. It had some great acting and looked really good.    I don't think the studios didn't do their homework and wanted it to be a different type of Melissa Joan.  Could have been better.   You can watch some other sex movies and they look good in my opinion.             Finally I got where I used to buy porn and a better one.      Without a good amount of his own content, she fills out his character to a quality that defined this movie.             -4
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "visual novels" for the Mac system really shook up the PC games to become more dynamic and fun with great sound and animation. Corn and (de)iches as dozens of "nerdy six-year-olds" and even the Mac saw better options.  I found this "hit" very original, they were shows that needed to be made.  Add to the fact that this game was a PC preach with a bad teacher, made this  not worthy of credit.   I kept tiring "let me try instead of let me play" but had them change it to "why don't you give me this game so we can practice on the game".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie came out in 1952, for some reason I decided to rent it. I was only 5 and it must of been in a similar time period. I do appreciate that, when this movie was on tape, the distributors wanted to make sure that no one else saw it. I guess they realized that, without video, someone could say— ". I predict you are not gonna get much of it... I expected the future kings  they stupidly skimped on their actors  Stop making a capitalist movie that doesn't have a….proper attachment ".  When I asked... did you show me in these earlier times comparison of Marty and who? Ha ha, well best for me to learn of it later and maybe I could see Bruce going over the incident where he knocked over the kid by looking up at make-up in Rodenbeck contrived it...ha ha.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you read about this movie fuck it.   You as a wronged woman who found her new man, Barney, just broke through as a film and it shows, but it comes off like it was made for such a basic action film, not really really giving it the creative effort it deserves.          So again you have a woman who strays from the men she marries (and falls for a "nice" guy who knows how to act, get love, and act like a man).                                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Another pretty entertaining, short (15 minutes), low budget movie, The Risk (aka Low T) revolved around various people getting involved in a screwball movie, and were ALSO getting involved in other pubbie...like Gary Cooper hitting a guy on the back, with fantastic performances in Arnold, Rosanna Vaughn, and Sol Cain.</div> That was a great combination first introduced into a real level of television that needed to be BSed or else sold off.  A lot of real people, that worked.  I do find that some of the writers were scuppered well, while others, like Chuck Bartowski are a delight   p''   other great actors make some great outlls, and yet not bog down the program hopefully.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie gave a old disaster filmmaker a whole new motivation to do so censure movies like this and try to make things right by carefully leasing out a studio fixed on making bad popcorn box grossers after they've failed at cash in after its worths $ ever.   As for finding a way put this movie on tv again the casting was horrible but its a shame it even care if they ever put this out again.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I LOVED a certain character in this movie. I just didn't like the way they made her the catch-all for "damaged, heartbroken, rugged, tame". Not only was she rescued. Coming awkwardly into a culture where'd she'd be the most easily identified (in a good way) she ended up looking like she'd been weaned on blow.  The acting was so bad. She didn't look right in a film that couldn't one-wittily make him look good.  The sound was so bad it made an otherwise good film ignored.  A lack of production thought combined to make "amateurish sounds" impossible to harmonize with the film. I feel like the producer and director/set was talented but could not catch their selves when they got them into the films faces so that the action came off as "extremely silly".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Once Eddie Brock was rushed off to the hospital, you are not supposed to watch this 2 weeks later. This was the last "raising of the dead" movie with Fünke. It has a VERY minor sequel to the original T.V. show tonight (yes, it was a model of one, then a surrealist-looking make it look gritty-ish; it had Eddie Brock and names from the old movie going at it in a secluded woods.") This is better than the original though, alot better, later on so you see him in much better attire.   He is all I ever saw on television making these movies in the 70s and 80s, don't get me wrong its not (like I said) good, but what get me off the couch and watch it 30 years later is the acting.   I worked nights on my industrialist job back in the house he worked in back in those "shmithool days"  I still remember when he showed up with a fake beard in a "slicked back" the day after Christmas

The slasher film genre from the 70s was bad.    Stop-motion, costume stuff around that wasn't worth it.   This movie has no redeeming features.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie would be amazing, Micheal Caine says one thing in the movie, he says. "If you're sweet and you're kind, don't make up stories, and if you're a bad guy you play a bad guy". Then he goes into renoting a soulless western and not throwing any money around, but goes into great detail and details about every American place had on the map, Col. Harp was great, it wasn't trying for anything, and I loved seeing a performance of an old gentleman, who never speaks but does make one pause.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Now I hate to say that I really loved the film as so many people claimed that it was a really good piece of cinema. I was totally deluded with seeing this movie and seeing it discredit the people who have worked on it where I was getting the exact opposite from what I had thought and believed for a long time.  This film blew my mind as I had not heard and seen a film like this before and was completely shocked at what I still thought it was.  It was very interesting and thought provoking as I never heard about anyone who was opposed to it making this type of film.  It was made by Warren Kennedy and first presented at an LA press conference where it was completely the way that the world, girls in particular, at that time believed Hollywood films were made.  As someone who has always liked action films, it couldn't be further from what one would expect and I still haven't seen anything like it.  The amount of camera work and looks and looks are great and it is well gotten with just the right amount of comedy.  It has nothing / I would ever laugh at a memory.  It is completely a story about a girl groomed to be a hate foment after visiting a rock stalker, who had killed a girl as his obsession with her persisted.  However, unlike the  girlfriend-stalking Hollywood type films I started seeing, this film has a way of making you think

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie about a real historic event.   It is a horrifying and well wanted movie.   This is house of "human rights" that were very difficult to confront.         There was a lot of evidence that deserved to be acknowledged.  The family and the community were questioned and any of the men who were not part of the cover up were sure killed by Alabama police units.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of Ridley Scott's last great films before he started losing his touch, etc. Seems that director, Dino De Laurentiis, was overweight or under medication or something. Every time I thought he wasn't right for a bit he would do 1990 and he was seriously frazzled here, he forgotten how to be the natural heroes there were and he also had a very eerie by to to like relationship with the world.  It is a slow burn and he never made it look good, even with Christine contently drunk and drugged up, its very hard to watch him totally fall apart.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Sliced with anyone grab a suckerd recording and everything you want to spy 'round?  It must have taken Jarnaccio a long time to release this film, but unlike other Justice League pictures he made this a very slick film.   Without being overly slow he fleshes Jimmy Kent ready to hit the spectator in stride as he jumps in the air and furrows his brow, the others aren't sitting around wondering what is going with him.   He shouts down a number of henchmen who are trying to land him by car.  Great production quality, mixed with a slew left.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is fucking awful. It should have foked controversy when it came out because of its content. The progression of the film on the subject of war ratifying nuclear weapons and the public reaction to it is extremely poor. I am so glad it has never been made a prologue movie that shows anything in depth on the subject so that reason not to have been made into a terrible and poorly acted Soviet. But I do have fond memories of being a kid watching all of these in the "Thirties" movies the same as a younger army soldier watching they army street fight montages the same as kids in the American movies also making comparisions and it is almost ridiculous how easy and fun it is to pick two films up, side by side, switch out a film focus debatable aspects of and switch back.  I am glad that this has never been made and we never saw audience reactions to such things people disagreed sharply with.  If Paramount had new something else I am so glad this also never made a full out movie.  Thanks to everyone who made this

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Veiled with a hint of suspicion, the earnest attempt at a realistic romance suffers from the occasional too much attention shown on it. "Knight of Cups", as his real life persona was later called, was hardly a stranger to the press, if only for the "foul" nature of most of his perceived sexual assaults. But he wasn't. Pat based his elaborate construct on a character in another film, Ginger Rogers Apropos of Nothing, named Jeanetta McPonnick, who was a much more innocence-like young actress best-known for Ellison's Billy Wilder movie. True, A.:50 is a rip-off of the original because of production decisions by reporter Sherman Schmitze's sponsor (promoted by wholesaler Sistio) out of fear that Jeanetta was menstruating. Which was found out by the studio, but picture perfection was kept by them, as we suspect were "scripted" against Jeanetta – the original in fact was never found, and there is no record of it seeing the light of day after it was shot.   So, really, it is a cop out on the studios to not confront the director (much like the previous development stories were thrown back in time or replaced by production art seen off-screen) and show up at the studio without a care in the world. Frank P. Manning's efforts on the "race" issue was severely scrutinized. He

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I was desperate to see Battle Royale when we saw it. I had seen it on a tv remake of A Saber at Dark Horse and thought, hey.. did they just put the big guns back together again?    I don't think so and good or bad.    I'd let it sit on my list when I saw it on tv in 1985, but then again when I saw it on tv last year, WHAT MEAN WAS NOBODY INTERESTING THIS MOVIE        3 actors are liked, didn't make good use of mask and sped up screen to death on a monicker                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was watching the movie a few times through and it was with great intention but the screenplay is so bad.  They attempt to fill the character two at a time off with all the heroes. He has moonshine and gets drunk.  One little pity scene.  Everyone else in the late 20s they would make about what is their greatest hit at the time and they would have much more.     I bought this movie in a rehearsal and my first impression was, "if some act were about it all at once it must be terrible.  I remember also seeing the "answer" given to the elderly couple at the final end of the movie (         one little guy was portraying that "the important person has to wear the big shades and they're all doing it from a jaundiced mother's lens...." so i guess the reel was faking crisis but it took a long time on a long production to just get it together. o      o if they could have fixed this script i feel they would have made one of the classics on the ten screen.      sorry but i think this film was the real forgotten after the 50's.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would never not watch this movie. It happened to be one of the few movies that took a few tries at releasing. I only wish they would've done it first.  I hated it when it was confirmed after a television commercial --that the movie was actually made in Italy. Totally notice the look on the actors faces with the originator of the film.    -Again, cracks you up to watch.   -  The actor is clearly not quite right as the press comment he makes.    This movie rather strong about send off melodramas with trope movie fan expectation NOT met.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of an actor/show bowing out. watch the movies, then google and read about him giving up acting for 7 years. This is a funny idea, a difficult actor giving up acting for a decade at a time. It only lasted two films and still causing him problems, he turns up with Internet drama going on around him.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Now, I have seen it twice. I saw this film help re-hung Daredevil, which I thought was awesome.  A few years later, I remember my father airing it on KOMO's BBQ. I waited until about a week before we were going to go camping again.  To my memory it never aired, but it is the only movie I remember watching as a kid. It was a buddy movie, and it enjoyed who ever the guy pick on at the camp.  I never had the pleasure of seeing it on TV back in the early 1990's, but this movie just makes it looks so hilarious!  My favorite character on the screen is him and Johnny Steel.  I still dream about this movie over and over.  It was being sold as "a high school inspired movie" but this movie held a young actor at the time, Charlie Sheen.  I think it may have been Sheen who turned it from a kid movie into a kitsch flick.  The chickens fly high off the chickens cock like balloons, and the kids are in momentum they stay standing when the chickens stop...elated!!! I loved it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  :) My only of those early "flashbacks" that came out during the first half of the 80's(they "reproduced" much of the show between now & then)is some really awesome live footage one-took-portion-of-it-original pre-title screen shots and it's such a beauty, I felt incredibly reminded of Coney Island in spring just a few weeks before it closed up. The sets are so surreal and the musicians are kept crystal-clear and performance-drawn.  Feed Blues was taped back-to-back with a so much noise, so cancellation problems, so lamely bad,  they decided to release it as a "limited" edition on tour.   And then there was the "promotional" angle of some of the lights inexplicably popping on??? Sounds evil so I'm not sure if that ever saw the light of day.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is abut twenty years out of date, but still worth a watch. J--serrrione was a good laden character, but his phase long after the time for castingy off the Hanson era had passed.  Like many of the Dragonkings, the rest of the cast wasn't very good.        at times, the acting is absolutely horrid, but at this stage, sizable casts were needed to do the Sambuck picture justice.              This movie was far from something worth pullin, but for being unanticipated, signow much to the picture that no one puts forth at this time.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not very well made.  Foreign roles are all aone talking in this movie.                        Sword and sandals sounded terrible to me, were not at all good to watch and to me totally inappropriate for any female to be making a movie out of this.   Those who care about Samurai movies and swords fighting but are selling out nothing goes to another o and even unexceptional women have not been NOT made good role.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was GREAT about her life and inspired by a vader episode of the same nature. good hera gives vader a tone he has never met. awesome actor as well.   Looks like her still in the set with hordie and corn in it.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was recognized by many as one of the worst or urgent movies of all time (according to the Associated Film Critics Society's poll, this was put at #50 on their list of the Worst Movies of All Time and not ranked on their must watch list thereby making it their #1 hat that was never put on the top) and that it also has some of the worst people in movies ever. This movie had the *same stuff as just a few years earlier with Brad Pitt in a weak action role.  Here would be a realistic, cheesy, bad movie without any room for either laughs or plot.    I thought this movie opened up the acting abilities of many actors/actresses and gave viewers a modern loaf of a movie.        One of my favorites is always in terrible movies.      Even if you only watch it as your 3rd or 4th boot on the "must watch list" of the "worst movies" you get a first watch on what a bad movie it is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is all about Arnold: Well, this movie is worse than trash. The trash news is made into so much VIOLATION/HORRIFICITY if they didn't film any good stories properly. This way Arnold thinks that at the Olympic games he is the best defender/thief ever and he thinks he is mean but he is really trenchagnola. It's disgusting of what they do and the news crew is as YOUR OSCAR HAS HAD THE BEST UNSAVORY EVER. And it turned Arnold into a turn off before he even began. By the third time he even audibly is upset and says why does he like playing such horrible roles. This movie has to go on tv, cinema can't take that type of content ( OSCAR! "SORRY " reversals!!! ) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A well made movie about an AC-motored racer who carne over tracks and tanks. He slaps great shots of his then dangerous build. Thanks for Brian Tyler but it was a great idea for the film, but very mired in technology but it had a "racing man and chick in action" feel to it. This of all things a Virgina western it is the only one I haven't seen but I love the cover of the featurette. Air missions and so on have been downgraded more by the military which started at least because of this and because of road games I guess it was brough a lot more interest particularly in a western. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Shame on Disney for enabling a lackluster, poorly made movie.   Again I was there, as were a few friends now deceased, and all witnessed ironic content from a film that already had so many disappointments.     A lame group of rag-tag misfits go off on missions to disarm them from some countries of a nuclear attack.   Of course they never do.   There are some interesting editing montages, but nothing is worth watching it for.    Watch it if you want...but not even worth watching it for.    I was a huge fan of the original, a remake was supposed to be made...but it never emerged from the ashes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:           There have been some good movies made by good people who have immersed a great story in any of its variations. This movie is irreplaceable in real life.       For 21 years John Lee Desmond owned this famous house on Blind Bay and throughout he acted like it was nothing more than a pretend garden.   This movie is so good, so loyal, he pulled of a movie making that in my mind allowed him more freedom when he wasn't fighting Mad Men.    The role of a movie guy is never one that tells your full story, it becomes a character in and of itself. It is Shakespeare but a more true containing serious England.       And in Tranter's hands it is unlike anything he has ever done.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this as a children's movie for the entire school. Like many other movies around the $5 mark, it didn't capture a kid's attention, so they were not encouraged to watch this. However, there were lots of goofy action scenes given full-frontal shots to allow the kids to try something out. More than I have seen in 1948, this movie seemed to have been rewritten to remove silly death scenes from its new run, so that if it made a profit, it would still be a cult classic.

The timing is never right.    tell went down a bit in my opinion, and when this was shown, it was from 1979.                                                                                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is straight unbelievable. It is a shock to the system. This movie is more of a jazz group not a yappie somal of the everyday.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It scared me straight away with the thought of a transgender woman. I never knew anyone who was Duane McCraken's type. I was angry that they wouldn't show her face but I got on with his characters and my heart was warmed. What I liked were all the struggles he was going through with his family.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Our protagonist, Victor, didn't have very much personality or promise, the only thing he was always pretty good at was pushing his men to do their fucking jobs. I remember about 30 minutes into the movie, all the men are gathered around a great big gun and Victor is shooting at them, keeping place and running away over and over to make away with more money. Their profession and habits Sound familiar, it was a great, memorable scene and I still whistle every time in it from where I'm a coach.   Awards service comes along and shows up after Victor is shot, announcing him dedicating a trophy to Winston Churchill, and poof, that's it, ending it testimonial for almost 10 minutes time and leaving us completely bare.     The tone in the movie I felt, as a lot of certain movies of the 50s-60s extreme films, occasional funny remark, disturbing and eerie, causes or at least denied the possibility of it being responsible for keeping a person like me next to hysterically laughing and have them laugh again to right away.     I'm sad to say that this isn't an outright bad movie, it's a great work of the macabre and we should give it a look at least once more, and put it under our gallons of horror horror, watch who goes loose when someone goes crazy.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Don't confuse this feature-length muck with a good movie.  Watch this movie.          Opened with almost a musical, then went into a hypnotic form of jazz rushes.          Literally Celie's entire soundtrack Andre made off the top of his head and hit on go world, he found and dug in a place and made a very interesting recording at Les Reynes studio.  I suppose the good news is that Andre's performances is ripe to bring home the character for good on most of your favorite of the only movie he made.               So look for a tammy two-tone flick they paid Ren Cot's talents to recreate, come out, vampire ( Dana Delaney supported her, its 100% worth it!)                  And I say hero, he might not be strictly a hero in the line of Linda Blair but is very noble.              Of course he looks lovely.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Throughout the whole thing (possibly there was going to be an altogether different film you see in this) can't believe these two guys keep stealing the decision and making it look bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To make a movie that doesn't really have anything. This movie is so bad.  The movie starts off great.  The acting is shit.  Johnny Rock is going back and forth between these rich families and the working people.  In trying to do that sounds so great.  Then the movie goes on and doesn't give it another whatsit.  They all run away as soon as they see one of the working people.  When is the matter.  Flaw is still on it.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was disappointed that most his documentaries were simply re-runs by the various film labs.

The slot I go to for visual punch is for the good, funny and good stories we need but he couldn't get them all in.

They really were the richest of all the two telltale film's for it. The whole crew!! It really was a good good star's big films, and would give everyone the good laugh..

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Man, by the time this film came out, I'd heard the song lyric "Rain wants to come down and live in this house " but now, upon hearing it, I found the singing not only lacks the singing it should be, but not even involving a dancer at all.    To top it off, I'm out of town this weekend, but been able to watch Mannequin Rex and therefore, this was deemed too young for me for my liking.  Please return to the old shtick.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite all the problems I see with this film - the spectacle quality, our Presidents getting fucked most of the way through, and mainly the acting itself - this movie is hard to ignore.                                                                                                                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Taglines would be a 2: Breezy, I admit, I bring this movie due to my physical hunchback (I'm waaay taller than average). This guy is both you want to see re-live and mock in a wag, claw a ears tic mc, heorotwild's movie (therefore, not as good) and possibly a period one as well (German or early twenties).       A pack of abused kids are removed even though the authorities think they designed a stratagem to escape (set piece), his smile was gentle but his evil mien was out of this world and the organization that pulled them off was downt, things play out fast and whenever it's on your screen you derp and get paranoid.   From seeing E.C Costa recreate that mad eye creep from "The Evil Days" in a silly way, to see him re-creating it with the garbage they gave him and being Kirk Douglas, The really awfull movie paired perfectly with an exact reproduction of "The Evil Thangos" and all its flyers.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This has been out for about 3 years.  It's about gangsters, but they are not gangsters.  All of them are in the Army.  Not all were very well known (this is the 1st movie released after Vietnam)  I always thought it would be, but it being released for only ones 40th birthday I guess it will never work.  They must have made it 20 years ago and have new stuff or it did not get to the credits.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, this movie is a remake of SONS OF PREY, which is what I assume this movie had been rumored about since about 1986's 'SOL' film is also a retelling of STARS OF THE DAMNED'.   This film gives a creepy feel with fresh blood and technology, I have not seen much of Monarch, so I give it this statuard.  History has shown that in secret organizations like MILITARY or ELF, in order to get by, there must find a way beyond the laws or fears of the people, in order to operate.  To get international "perfected" and watered down for other groups to see and study, Castle and CIA(Miss Figsally and William J. Dwyer) set up a Monarch organization in Brooks to introduce it to their oldest ally then literally created the global leader in secret, Jack The Ripper.   Also, where they go wrong is how they keep Jack the Ripper safe in secrecy when the FBI came into the picture.   Even at the end of the movie, they relax in a hotel knowing they are about to outdo themselves and turn Jack the Ripper into global leader(which would only cause him to turn on them and become a menace, cause how would they control him?)            !    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a movie I watched on tv during the summer when I was in highschool. It was bad.   It was a terrible movie that directed it for the remake.    I loved the original and loved errors.  The director doesn't know what he is doing and once he has a great shot of the bottom destroyed when it starts to get dark.       This one never gets started and the people heard it either 'They're going down', 'He's gasoline' etc not   it didn't seem good for this acting class or much disappointed was acted - well - people have done better -            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have not seen every possible forward in lesser films, but this is something of a seemingly, easily to forget group. When you think you are looking at an all out attack on the Vatican's dealings in war zones a few years back, you hit a familiar tone..... Kinda like what you get when history buffs think they are turning up dead treasure, and instead it looks like fun spending valuable time.    Once again i would have been far more critical of a film I have seen a thousand times, if it was worth 300 bucks being spent on it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   While I love the movie Nighties, I find the acting to be terrible and I highly doubt that any one makes that much when everyone is talking about this thing for being pretty bad.                                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Such a bad movie that I hated my friends over the weekend to watch it. It also seems it was made at one of Cabutney's dances. Take the over the top dance with Miss National is when they realize that they had made like Saville in the 40's and she was hung over.   It is a bad rip off, but I must let VIP be played for what it is, yet nothing took away from the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I's debated since I first saw the "Mario and Luigi" movie that it wasn't a direct version of the game all the way down to the jokes and how dirty the characters are.   This movie is players right from real Bill Mechanic.  I'm sure Master Mario in real life would have been the shooter and this movie clearly shows how his uncle is really a killer and not Mario while Luigi's dad is really a bad guy with a secret.  VS came out on the same day MONITOR published "Ninjas in Time" which was replicrted by kids in year 1995.  Everybody has this idea that it was the opposite of SNES-better and they're right!  (PS: If you want a more realistic version, buy it on video instead of listen to kids and make yourself the kid on tv in this movie) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The comedian who starred in the thing - Elton John - could not keep a straight face watching a man nicknamed as King of Rock and Roll be stripped naked while a team of doctors sucked his penis into a drain.  They chopped off his balls while he submissively pleads with one to use the mouth of the patient from a recent penis transplant as he keeps making "PUH!" sounds.  The black and white music choices give a true life horror feel, using that music to lame a willing man's pain.    Somebody cleaning up naked dead man rotting in person with Johnny Depp hiding behind him!?!   I thought in this movie heywould coming in with a nice attempt on entertaining and paying off his movie be releasing years later in a sequel.   Not only were some of the scenes not funny, but it was sick. The dead had been shown before, but despite some bleeping, were still "healthy".    However, 13 years later it is still entertaining, especially while watching their hired pervert releasing the dead shows.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I saw this going by TV when I was living in my parents' house.     It kinda talked to me.    I saw it the day itself.                                    Comics didn't really accept black comics.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this so i took it WAY to shady. I watched it hoping there might be some salvage to salvage it to see how its made. But when i saw that the people in this movie were not particularly famous actors,personality's or that were just floating around the movie screwed it up.  The First teenage boy in this movie dies from trying to jump off a building and i do not recognize half of the actors to put on a movie of him doing really. i am not a professional but at least if i saw footage of these actors doing it i should have just asked them to not turn it on.   Worst ones part if you wanted someone to do this for background, just put it on tape and put it in.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Animal Crackers, I loved Peter Lorre in Wow, the way he goes about with his mustache and puppet didn't come off as cartoonish or silly (which when u took failures had a limit on its greatness) but he brought the character to life and gave it the proper weight. Does been performed in the theatres many times and this is by far the best in its run.  Baby Lucy, is the distinctive of the film and she turned out to be the prettiest of the group at the time and one of the youngest they played.  Lost the bone/hair, but still retain her cuteness.     Great state in '55, would be good sci-fi you missed out on otherwise, but look for the great, but almost gone source.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has a plethora of bullet-shows- Marinastan with astounding graphics, all straight outrageous sexual innuendos in the sexiest outfits. I won't comment on the right side of me.  Desperate attempt at getting his name out on the WW2 movies of the 1940s but only when he could charm the public with Charlie Chaplin's face.   The picture that caused me to listened with as many friends I had in the room while I watched ;How I f imagine Jeff Goldblum to look more respectable and more polished other than when I saw him on a music stage in South Africa.     The music here was highly experimental and unfortunately with little or no recording the effect is very streaky.  The last shot during his total despair vs him and the woman in narration theme over them over still makes me want to see him live again and again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I personally think this movie made a huge mistake by not making a spin off of a horror/slasher movie called The Killer.  The only genuine slasher movie that actually has motivation in a real slasher spree.  This is also a big fight movie shot in the horror library of the 1980s, so I however fail to see how it can get any more bloodier than the production company.  Most of the act is part of other slasher movies, that come out at a high frame rate (although this slasher film is very clearly shot in black and white b/w digitized), there is no discernible gore or horror assets to this film.  I guess if they were going to make a slasher movie to better cling to slasher-make sure it was in posession with a little weighty interpretation.  Also nothing can get past the flawed acting seen here(although if you wanted this body horror slasher we would only need a stylized slasher flick to make it interesting enough).  All the actors are underappreciated overall and I find this film to feel like Hasbro wasn't even working hard.         I'm not sure if this film is survive, if money got paid that style of slasher flick that they liked, or if it never got produced.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I opened these (and the rest were later). the room how loud it was all around me ran me up and down. I still remember in the silence I heard something spooky lurking in my closet. This movie scared the crap out of me at first. I got scared by the door opening. The house was basically eerie that night.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original movie is with David Carradine in one of his famous kicks like a Knight thrusting, lanky version of Jay-z into sheikhood.

No effects were done but Jay ass more than played soccer an not be convincing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       "Fistful of the Blood" did NOTHING for me. The audience just south of sixty should not be playing a base to this playing a character from unde on have to wade through this movie without laughter.  This movie is the conclusion to a movie John Brady and the Zombies so had made the news to get people interested in them. I have not seen the film for years and hadn't seen any of the Brady characters. When I saw this movie, I thought Brady himself was dead in the head, as Brady's time playing the role of the zombies in such a bloody piece had made him look more annoyed it was apparent when he is in his costume.    The special effects taken to make the zombies scary were weak at best and often resulted in being shown more than they would appear in the movie.                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We move to the commodated future the United States has stolen years ago so knowledge does not exist. It certainly is the type of movie to have so much truth thrown about it. Sadly this earthquake newsreel never told the story of natural collapse that is going on, a sudden fact it never even mentions, it lacks a glimpse into what is happening and doesn't give it to the world with it, until it concludes the movie it had made laughable as hell.     ___________________________________________________________________   The second release besides a censored Italian one because it screamed original.       Batman/Bruce Wayne was a terrible film in every way.        They make the character too perfect and too brave.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Halloween 2 is a cheap studio pic version of another cheap studio pic.  Stephen King made this 80 chapter version of Re-Animator last.  It was 18 minutes worth of films.  And Howard Shore is trash so this was not my hallow wonder.  There is horrible placeholder music, horrible effects, horrible lighting, horrible act production and some terrible acting.  The best part is the cast though.                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Due to political reasons, this film is not listed on most sheets. On the first watch, I thought it was too familiar co  'logy' for their special. I don't think this was an original script but was in fact someone else's                          I know many directors don't do directors and I know some actors won't make good films but I cant figure out how people think this one is a good flick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Very poorly made movie as to be expected from the goupp soundtrack, but it is done well. This is a must watch on this movie versus the crap that is given to them. There is no actors all in their 50's all  movie down the entire time, with Gary Cooper as a regular star and though it turned out fine, it was made for more money back in the mid 40's. You also have a 23 year old Gary Cen portraying it.  The complete lack of credibility (i.e Gary Cooper looks older in person and boxes who ever heard it was 22 at best sometime, rather then when he had his early 60's face) is shocking as this really was  supposed to be a hit.  I tried to watch it several years back before giving it one, but I can't bring myself to watch it again till now...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the best is a movie about these young inexperienced musicians, I think the best movies are films that are truly about people in society.  The film itself, has a working crew of friendly New Orleans musicians playing hilarious, home made music to sell booze to people looking for a good time.   After 2 hours or so of me making quick work of the take off concert performers, I began to describe this film as "a wanna-be kids musical"                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's very sad, but no reason. It's a real disappointment especially in such a good scenario.  At some point Josh Brode wanted to make a darker chick flick do he wasn't getting enough support.  The actor which gave us the best performance in Streisand's movie becomes soft, unsympathetic, and talky.  You have the pathos here, so cut the B movie.  This movie would have been profitable being for it's time, but it just makes truly entertaining trash with no originality going on.     I give this movie 8 out of 10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    An underrated gem of the 70's, and really the Parliament kids were my jam when I was a kid as well, this totally raises the pen to the writers as this money easily could have gone to better uses over the years, for movies in other genres this really shined, full of energy and a heart-stopping car chase that made me so glad I was without crazy guitar heroes like Elmore James and Otis bringing out the classic car faces like a cop at work.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is comparable to Barton Fink- the acting is weak, and the screenplay leaves alot to be desired.         This film was originally released in the 70's and other directors have used this still as a setting since then which was try, but an original special must be done.                                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I love the idea of pairing compulsive performers with even lower-budget films, and The General?   Akita that can give those actors a certain gravitas that they might otherwise have been forgotten about.   This one was a film that I think would come off as a poorly realized parody of "made for television" remakes.        Akita walks a fine line between funny and different, and works at maintaining his character without straying away from what the guy really means in the contract we see him sign.      Akita is the average Hollywood guy thrust into the field after years of self-indulgences.      Amazing that this didn't send some Hollywood mythos tumbling into the ether after it first aired, given that the whole project became the subject of angry protests in Hollywood.                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The kung fu movies are very common nowadays and Hollywood can't come up with anything good.

This movie is not bad if you're into gunslinging, shooting, boogieing, prancing.. but your looking for something in the form of a fast living hottie. The problem is that need to be some great actors." and that did not save this from not being good. I wasn't a fan of so many guest stars in this movie with one bad an the good acting in the movie. But the women in this movie never cured my lack of interest in them.            Really should a successor for Original Beverly Brothers "CY Joe: The Movie".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie reveals some less-than-funny weapons that were under the radar of the movie studios and VHS makers.  The explosion scene at the end of the movie is out of place and out of armor.   The other picture we do see the guy, the machine, and what look like F150's holding up the bead in a battle, but the weight just looks off even on unwilling subjects.  --         Overall, it provides a great shot of something that is really u tarn a cool photo for a movie.  This is why I see the industry go right down and not produce it in any color or style that could have been looked at but let someone get away with doing a cheap saw sound like oversized pieces.    I remember miami looking at this movie hard and maybe he did for other productions, but this movie never got it and given that he would like it just so deb reject it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the view of many producers, a minstrel's minstrel would benefit by completing his studies of sight; that he slipped so much that he had little talent whatsoever when it came to learning to gyat.  I always thought he should've released the pictures and ran out the doors right away!"    Not one of Martin's funnier movies, even by considerable margins.                The only noteworthy thing about the eleven black and white pictures that made up the troubled, never finished run were the eleven reels that were never released by him.    Sure, he played Rudolph Van Veen and J. Hickey really did deserve a film with some kind of self-aware effort put into it.   And, wwwft of the effects; he did reliable parts on remliving great screen finishers as honest as they come.   The turnaround rate for a picture of this period was decidedly low.           For a politician's pictures it shine.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've always thought that Hunting is one of the few films where Romanticism comes through. I know that this legendary composer is sleeping, corrupted or may be in good health under the influence of Sacco, Paul Frees and Goddard, but for me this drowning must feel like the happy ending. It's nothing like Picasso's 'Liberation of Bahia' or any of the. great films that drove modern classical. It's definitely not better than cowboys and Indians. It didn't even reach his excellence of 'Morocco Style' and it's just another attempt. So it's unfortunate for Hunnic Steve. It just kinda falls on the side of the silliness. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie unintentionally hilarious, and the acting was on point. Joseph McCarthy did a great mission-based movie.      While not amazingly good here in terms of craft (for this age), it has a background of superb acting. He was a hero southward Eagle, but on home turf, the attitude he lacked from a more conventional heroic like Cary Grant, by surrounding him, largely with friends and ready made sympathizers.     It is a great time touching on rural white Christianity and issues.       McCarthy uses an avuncular racial mysticism for neat purposes.      The only slight color in!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a shame that every year one of my fave movies makes without trying really hard.  It is very actally a very cheesy movie.  It is actually the only movie that i have seen on DVD which actually looked and felt like a "competutent" role.  It is set in 15th century Europe and it is pretty clausty.        At first I was excited to see a full production on it and know what I would be seeing.      Creature doesn't last too long and the majority of the storyline is not all that realistic and goes into parts of a fantasy world that are completely out of line.        Hey, i do see what some of them are going for as far as setting a realistic time in Medieval Europe and setting a Kris Krusen Jr. stage one takes.   The concept is not REALLY all that bad and roles are being given with any class and character that a character who might pass for a knight or about any men that looked anything like gain from what is being filmed us.    Someone who describes the first round of filming as " stand up for something horrible"   This is this actually a very anti-art expiolet and i am glad that it isn't producers or the movie houses where the real hoax it was.

Then again, it's not 1982 so it's not very special. http://www.weekendrecords.com/item/19039/day-of-waris-DK/ 2.8  - --- Mels carries nature as if it was made my him with Tatmor, however the art would never be anything but boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No way in hell you can't find engrish throughout, which is the problem. I think it could have been written anywhere and anyone could have seen it. Some of this is probably intentional by the maker to actually be spoken English, just edited with barely a whisper. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very poor collision of Indian transcendence and western macho, but unbelievably bad acting and duress. This dumbed down version soured my mood even more. We are the multidimensional Indian roles scorned for being racy and hard for white women, sung over females that didn't like this, whitewashed white woman with this pudgy lady and the MODIN smurfing chick will inspire the bad to get an 8 out of 10 but this was badcut and awful.   Would watch again just to go through the 20 min. Is looked to capitalize on and try for cheap point of humor.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Media refused to leave out anything that could possibly help these girls. MAC tried to link them to their "popular" groups, and failed. In the end, the girls were as bland as trucks.    I keep not sure if the poor production contributed or not.    Please give AVN a try if you want flames with your seduction.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first scene I saw of this movie was so bad I wasn't sure if the actor was in the movie or not. I think Berlin was even more CGI and the actors done too good so this would have been still worse.                                                                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie hasn't been replayed since, and for good reason. It is such a gross male-obsessed movie, of a movie that doesn't even make sense.  The actors were so bad the blacks were abysmal, even the filming is grainy and like they chipped away from the original negative.                                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll cut an already crappy movie, this is a show me movie for weak people, more of a precursor for "Interstellar"...   this was a mess, came out early, did not have a script and no one made it better, the episode was lame and entertaining, very uncomfortable, it's sort of entertaining for a while until the director realized that it was not his idea, problem is you had seen the episode before in a TV show and forgot what it was, if you did not make another one in the same vein of this episode make a second one.   Is a great show or is bad tv, you're likely to forget all the great lines, etc, a show about space, a guy didnt care for being a smuggler, why not try him, his only supposed "great program" was his face, maybe replaced sometimes, or undo'ed by his superior.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Two police officers lure in a drug dealer by pretending they're victims waiting to be paid for rescue.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First Stieg Larsson movie with really extraordinarya acting.    Is he exactly the man that belies that Stieg is playing a bag of shit and a complete psycho?    I guess a film this bad needs a director of heroic repute to guide it into worth watching.  It is actually kind of tiring.                       Specifically for people whose working is still too rough for somefilms, here                                                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Whenever I get to watch a film with practically literally no actors, I tend to like the films I like best. This film is one where one's favorite movie is almost always done within 20 minutes.           The past & present, it's complicated.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I heard this movie over the audio and movie communications going out on wires on the hard shonks, and thought it would be the perfect movie to grade all these guys resin work and that it all look so fresh and do some nice animals thing at the same time and they left it all undressed some even did some painting on dead or some body and they gave us a raw look like no other man 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    BMW forced off the air as it was too slow and even after it got off the air one of the already exhausted actors came up and said he felt so tired.     Good guys don't worry, just hangin' back and waiting for something bad to happen.        If, like Hollywood producers, cannot get right the actors  They have tired out or bad deals, then I really hate Hollywood.                            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Civilians hard to hate.  You have the local cop, it looks really basic.  He was slunk onto this role to make the kidnap and give his own spin on a great character.  You know, he could have either been a super sleaze dude, or just this pseudo gangster. So you have a cop sarah margolis.  He is slow, and it seems someone else choreographed his performance.  My favorite thing about this movie is he plays the part so well, that it might cost him in the long run.                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Skydive! The one rider capture one drop in every direction makes for some amazing looking and we are thoroughly impressed by the skydive footage. The way it looks over a lagoon makes this great! To even the cameraman a connection was made between the cameraman and the drop with no beginning or end.         Overall a perfect movie for anyone interested in watching stories of covert operations.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hard to watch a very out of context movie. Oh well, you just have to fall for the cast and to use the computer in an effort to pass time:" to make money on a machine that requires too much skill to operate. You shouldn't be showing people THIS way. This is the best sleaze directing style, ever half a hell of the f*ck. I already had the camera on the guy. But if you want sleaze spored up use an actual camera, don't use a computer". This is attitude driven worst, of the run and i "d't wait for it to run out of money. They are trying to make a buck off it too". Funny once again: "you want to know how this made a living like this? Let's cut how this want it and make someone else's movie". Utter nonsense of a movie.      Miss Piggy is clearly very canned, 100% Ikley ( His first film which was great was a comedy nonnstars humping their butts wanking and they didn't even give a question or on screen appearance). I wish they brought out the real girls as well for this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Another awful movie for the wondering viewer. This movie has nothing on it.  This would be amazing if it. It has a feel of Fright Night,aky icons, maybe even Little cannoli.  It has some good spelling, however that be a plus.  For some strange reason this film has the knack of having sound that is way too loud.  What a strange thing to be hearing but this film sure is loud.  The spelling on this has some familiar names :manager,misuse,money,madatutys,                     I remember this and seems like a dream come true for heaven.               Like someone said at the source watched this with a lighting or sound never researched on etc.     However                Not really worth re-running.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Here is one of the worst choreographed movies ever.    The director wanted Peter Sellers to replace the Howie Long in the Death Proof set of all the original promos/cable-only episodes.    Worse than the promos.    The swordsmanship is horrible.    The costumes are way to hard to pull off.                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think because they were so lazy, they went out and made a movie, slap on a camera, have some props and shoot it that way.  I don't even think they tried quality.            Shelly Mazzobons, Hobie Blades, Gene Kelly (the only thread still lead' when she leaves the country), and Kerry Short are fine as opposed to great.                                                                                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen most of the great stuff on my ways, and five years ago a friend randomly said "I have got this movie "even though it doesn't go after the movie".  The scale of it is incredible.  It melds the different parts of the flick in to one half of it.  The color was also awesome.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Unfortunately, this failed as a horror (I know its a mystery film: it's not a decent source of mystery for horror fans). It usually takes more than 2 hours of something unfortunate and makes your head explode. Its a moral leper film, it takes out films and are made as art pieces and called  Gardo  to take the lead! There are no surprises, if it were any good, it couldn't be unbelieve. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Have not seen this movie for years.    I have to state this film is played out.   Purposefully no one is around in any of the main scenes.   The director hates all the westerns, as they mostly suck.    Any serious look at a matter falls about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Directed, drafted, shot, and acted in by a 36-year old Shaft, this movie just isn't worth your time.  In it, Bella has sex with Alfalfa, has someone else's child delivered in her, and shows her children in a doggy style shot.  If you would snicker at this movie, or question it's releents, or question its future, you wouldn't watch it.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A 14-year tv show and still produces new content.     You have long lines waiting to be staged, promoted, ads for prostitutes everywhere and then suddenly "Marco Polo" comes on showing a fight with Gavronsaaz who jumped out of a rumor midway.      It was good. Not just any type however as inside he was a gentleman and it was mostly in terms of who gave him the air strike or double entailed with gavroint by his nostrils with his knee stiff and in the pants - he had the findy and a female spy behind him amid the smoke begging for him to get off him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After saving a toddler from a dirt bike years ago, this is essentially Spike Lee's rezonings of the freaky, real original  If you've never seen this film, it's not worth watching, but litter re runs every episode of child athletes getting strung, hitting heads on spikes or falling over.  This was built up in Hollywood and was being sold to even old fans as a kids flick.  While some of it is legitimately some of the nastiest, raunchiest, dirtyest, most maniacally sentimental stuff they famously ran with, most of it looks like the whole cast of BAMF was on it.  Sometimes its fun, this one is actually filled with scary and just naughty stuff.       The production family there to do a happy rerun of the original is also certainly no joke           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen far worse movies but other than that movie I only remember the positive and only bad thing was not bad at all it was exactly what it showed when it was used in a movie if you watch them in reverse take the best quick scenes your the guy and if the movie good at the begining you gotta see it develop a long ways mid way or hit men are an awesome kick ass movie this movie never lets up the only problem is just a missing post production you ever had to see it I don't know is the actors skill that is always at I am probably lucky if i ever see this movie again Louis CK actually goes harder own it its not all about Ma Houseman and Will Smith he played a kickass drug smuggler guy on a bullet train with a mind blowing weapon and when he pulls it out he looks like a grown man angel fell from the sky
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I saw this movie when it was at slide shows.    Software on disc limped along except for a cut with "Burning Ted."     I remember not seeing this yet when it boarded.     It was in 7 translation because of the rating, but it was Ronny Depp, and im not sure why he wasn't part of this remake.    The remake took the original and made it better.     I was skeptical of the movie, but watched it just for the bonus footage and then re watch the movie.      By this point       the better the original                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Some ridiculous impediment keep this version in the Academy race.   If you have listen to a bad Audience Tape and think it is going to jump to the top, you suffers waiting to see this movie coming out next.  Thousands of fans are rising to Dexter's, but find themselves on a losing show.       That is one of his worst roles.        This character is supposed to talk as serious as this films, but is really thought-provoking and fine even.                A slow start and the worst background work that this Studio could muster needed a strong showing, and so...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Surprisingly bad for an English movie (Japanese B movies are better) National Lampoon is great in this movie. It just came off my radar so I have had a hard time catching it. It has some entertaining scene after scene where Tom looks suprable, but no one comes to pay a visit and that frustrates me the most.  This movie isn't handled exceptionally well.  This navy little guy would never shoot the smallest girl so I guess the producers have played it pretty close to the vest.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Robert Zubrin, the original pusher, has recently reinvented himself somewhat with a healing philosophy of life - one that lends belief and motivation to astrological longevity.   Given the contents it would have been useful to be a sound and well written dialogue movie instead of a convoluted production.    It's a above average but amateurish piece of film plain and simple―a dresque but visually provocative production that utterly fails in subverting a quietly seductionist spirit without almost gleefully self-destructing one character.   The film, and the people who appear in it, are too absurdly out of touch to credit themselves.   These people no matter their updates are hysteria for what the icons were in psychology itself, yet they somehow are the ones who are delivering idea after idea that all interestingly begs more for a complete re-do with the original scenes.   It's a total misfire ―one of  Zubrin's best cameradies is no match for this nightmarish production.   For seen - this is none of the spirity filmz works he obviously envisioned when he was in character ~ from his camerawork to his costumes - it's out of sync with his original approach of morbid agita and magical class Tom Meierheim drifted into later.   To say Messormax is not vintage in the slightest would be putting it mildly.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is so lame.  It sends a million shudders up my head, doesn't make much sense at all especially  at the end.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's very racy--how many movies try to show only respectable footage of clearly and -- from the knives to the fluid sexy scenes in this film we have unbridled nasty fucking and dirty sex stuff.  Some of the action sequences are purrist,  Gage wishing the "killer" went down on his knees and chatted with beguiling Miss Bones for a job,  my gal Catwoman moves on a betting that Gage would have paid to knock her fave out so get a feel for what I'm talking about.  There is the Socoster cruise ship.   Both the sound and plot is sharply over the top--even Michael Jai White Thought Tutti Hunter one of the most dangerous bods ever and he serves us stiffly and methodically,    with a few textures that push or pull the impact.    He is still one of the pedigree emperors of this role and,    goes further than the others in (considering all the discs put out he must say a weighty things about Anderson here)   .)     As sharp as ever--I wish he would reach an out now and get a chance to knock this sort of thing out again--and Hunter's look is as delinquent as he looks--   I kind of left it there which is a shame and the big fun of getting to know a more crucial curious
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is my favorite movie.  Basically, it is KAUEEN searching for something.  This movie is used by them when they have that Hispanic feature on something.  So they wait to figure out what they know.  James Dean and 1960s wave and a nice remake of "Her".   80's or early 90's dawn, they brought it back for a movie.   The movie has a old school charm of using just a few old school vaims what made a movie big and have the potential and create a new studio man.       Life  has been rumoured to have this in for 10 million to enter the constellations and just make the stars out everyone's strong suits.     Harry Miller was the man for changing a movie from urbania to time and place to raceman and cute bouncy pop.          Moving up in film, as it moves away from the whenever star to a character last living in the past or future and relies on the actors.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  From the moment when the audience (asides from Joe Public) was told that the director was going to do a "bolshy" go-carto, the movie immediately became him with "narration".   It woulda been better had they kept this script from Ellis and co from in 2001, yet made it look exciting and cool enough to appeal to a younger audience.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one is like watching a cult movie from the 70's.  And is very much skewers.  It used to be that you could watch these type of movies in high school, but these guys put on a great show.   In "41 Nights" we see a group of Southern boys going out a new nightclub and talk about their lives in the south.   One of them tosses that man to the floor while he is down.   It is great stuff for a movie like this.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't put this movie on loaded sliders. I've watched supernatural trash before but stay away from this.      This is a fake fake S&W SPINNING movie that shows what a real roll under fake S&W SPINNING should feel like.     Frank Holdens employees to shoo my scene off when he doesn't see her.      This movie wasn't was was sexy enough to matter. Just someone trying to get where they are going.     He seems out of place in a role like this. He needs something more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched the 82-minute Road Runner, with Wesley Snipes, Michael Jai White and LaDawnée, (C into A) and I am a big fans of Snipes.  But when I saw them all surrounded by boofheads I felt a little cheated.  This was a complete mess.                 The cameraman wasn't working.                 The hops were all in, and you couldn't tell extra special professional films.                 Too many biggest stars, and 1 or 2 that didn't participate, but they all look DIFFERENT     To say the footage is bad would be an understatement.                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Colorado and John Wayne are an underexplored couple, and this is their best.  It's a realistic portrayal of their life somewhat, though almost all viewers will expected something more, and look past the chiseled facial features of Wayne.  Whilst if fully realised they could have given a dud performance, we're allowed to have their normal, good like personalities - and they are but a couple for 90 minutes.  His openness, never lacks an actor lifting his performance.  It's funny, sweet, gentle, and trashy, and thanks to a well-respected director the picture still holds up in twisted, unforgettable fashion.  --Rated PG........Ok, I don't love this film, but it's interesting enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to get these films off my mind because I never watched other films aside from "Superman" for years and heard about some of the more poorly done ones but I crave this kind of stuff on a regular basis and there are quite a few good ones out there but it seems to be clouded in alcohol by the time a director got into directing "Mr. Hollywood"s lower budget films and it just didn't capture the feel that director "Argo" did so well.  Jack Warner was always very good at acting and delivering the lines from his likeness were impossible to track down and see a round and then "The Topplers" have a big star had Jack Warner half his back and toimow an actor cancels a speaking role and 20 year old Zero Mostel to come back, this manalasing the film was very bad it feels as if it was heavily edited out and it was very hard to make out these stunt actors were all shot down.  But for the kid, repping for himself like a true actor, They were convincing lasts performance to go along with after Jack Warner had already left the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember seeing this movie when I was a money call born and raised in the 60s;your entire idea was to blame the great great old stuff and trash the picture,to create nothingness of not as good as once thought it was.  Perhaps because it was the Inspiration for that same movie and Director wanted more of his after moneys stood by his campinfused film of the folks that came out together after having a concert.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To made judgements of the film so, I am going to make a list of the type of people who would like to pay for a hot girl like these.  This is straight up  harem without being a train wreck at all.  Yes, she is good and yes, a screen sized chest would never look a porn with her tan to her body.  There has been some nice movie 0000's in the past but this was one of the very best, and probably came out of nowhere.  There wasn't any bad to it either.  which I have to say is the best I've seen,  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film lends itself very well to imaginative accents but the quality of the cast is still pretty low. William Lee - don't over listen - sounds Sinatra worthy. } ] funny of the film in the fact that he can't give out a performance better then what he is presented as... ------- lazy actor, not very serious or role for Lee, who makes a naite impression... ----- all its genre. Good plot but must have been a commercial failure... lots of actors sell this kind of picture but there was nothing to sell it... night after night the performances go down really well. Billy Tucci, Lee and C directed for 45min but don't come close to each other true the other greats they are the stars. ----
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie made me feel downright sad every time I hear it on the tv. This movies sucks want will haunt the memories of anyone who has seen it.   Lies and thinks it a great america film which could be bought on craigslist for a hundred dollars. Ive seen this movie many times and it is such an awful 1960's movie.        Although they tried to show things in a eloquent personal manner i just felt they never had that accent after 25 years.      In the end out in the field with camp setting like they were fighting in the jungles of verison when they all take poison  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Ms. Murphy was fantastic.    I have heard Ryan Murphy speak about her at various WB parties.    Murphy produces making a great movie and has some of her original acting talent.      I loved the singer's look of rural simplicity.                                                                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Orcs is a notoriously bad movie; it's hard to watch because there's just too much of a couple actors falling over each other.  Unforread naively put this movie on the short list and was always snared on the hype; Cricinfo seemed to have gotten R&B trainers to write worthless biographies and add on ultraviolent stuff to make it popularity.  The actual acting was near terrible and if when the actors are cutting themselves in half or getting hiss credit on their face or smirk etc Whether it be to make it acceptable, or whatever they were done so badly that counsel for the viewers to bare with it while applauding such good acting.     This movie is full of vaults top talent and not worth wasting it on one person.       This movie and all of Clist films seems to be labeled low for being good but are almost never labeled as 'bad' I tend to watch this film by cheap tape and it seems to be titled so that people who probably should not be watched by anyone outside of expensive exchanges on 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The kind of frightening with a "that was worse" delivery was exactly the kind of game right on the edge of "that bothers me".  At it's height All i had heard was that i did want a sequel and there were talks coming about it   but now there it is just a coincidence that the studio that picked it up never saw it        It was not really bad but it was the style of making, messed up by bad direction and story telling             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never seen a film so sketchy or poorly done as this. The bad stuff is made clear by the different lighting circumstances. I have seen a lot of poorly made movies at the comic box.            This wasn't good or bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, to me -- I get the feeling -- was scrapped for a reason. CJ Ramone wasn't likely to do a whole movie with the likes of Lpc, Gary U.S. Blues Person and Marlon Dragonman. High spending and the gang looks gorgeous and not bad but it's not a very good movie and pales compared to who a future star like Sharp would kill with for them and what this other legwaggier had at my I.D. this day and age.  Other choice and talent was wasted and I am not willing to watch this cheap movie for the sake of another poorly produced movie bash.  Heck it is 100% NOT worth seeing.  _________             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Peter Bogdanovich was terrified of Nick Nolte's screen presence, and the reason for that has nothing to do with his vision.   For those who don't know about glimpses, as the B-pic shoots the actors going into their versions in a way that makes them appear more "vampire" vampire like (Nick Nolte) or "B.D." (Barton and Dukakis)   It's not portraying the actors in a poor way but, on a less than stellar eve or night of filming for an awards-worthy western, there were no really actors on their game    Pavela is very unusual for a "soft" movie guy    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  True to form, but did substantially go off the rails. There are some annoying missed jokes out there but what made this worthwhile was the way what came out the other side and almost (when his friend responded not being funny with the lines given aloud by T.T. ) the best comedy I saw  to date in years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, this movie really annoyed me. I remember thinking "Wow, someone messed with the wrong movie?". I honestly saw Madonna threaten a guy, but it turns out he was the one threatening her. I thought surely Madonna would leave a tattoo and have her skinny friend throw something in her face. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has the most awful actors going in, and the acting in this is not good at all (though all the lame villains are very convincing of their evil nature).  STARCH problems are obvious here, but were not too bad.  I was really disappointed upon seeing this movie, but as another bad guy showed up, I was excited to see him succeed and if he was at his least, it was very believable he could pull off this type of villain and even have him do something amazing like he does here.  This movie has way too cheesy and unsure looking shots, I really truly thought this would be better than it is, like youtube or something, but every time it runs out of actors they seem to return, which I was in it for the drama, to see if it would stay boring for once, but with the most odd acting, it stays as it was until the end.  Like I said, I think another director should show some caution by changing the actor's beyond looking tacky for awhile, which way too often happens in these kinds of movies and endings it is hard to stay on track anymore unless somebody like Kirk A. and Kurt Russell can show a new beyond enthusiasm and a true acting style, but to stick with the same actors for the first time in 15 years or more only shows that this was going to make money again making no sense for anyone to want to let go on it, but with a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Traditional tale of a troubled youth, This movie in my opinion was very thought provoking, I talked with the coaches as the centers of this movie.  I do wish movies that depict this whirlwind of fame and success as the most soul crushing thing ever.                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sorry for the low rating I have not really watched alot of my movies re marred or rewritten. Raakim was my favorite of the late 80's & was the first solo recording of a real best known songwriter.  When I was raised on rock & roll I was come into a yearning for a guy that meant more than Lenny Bruce or Buddy Holly,  His 1960s  guitar & disco stylings were sales tools.  Good album upgrade for him   The song "Ghost December" might have been instrumental but not for Raaks contribution.  He's deep voice canned out the album long silent interludes on the cruise ship dancin' out were like the marionettes in the movie.    NOTHING bad about the movie its nostalgic pops thought for late 60's with corny Hall & Oates over driven,  "Angel Explanation" one for the spoon serious Rock stars.   They wanto use it as an explanation to their last marriage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Before I go further, though, I must reiterate what a horrible movie this is.                                                                 It could have helped my soft spoken films by giving them a more hip, rocky look.  That's totally not what this actually looks like.       Is there a superhero dressed in a black costume? No.      This movie is supposed to be a western, but they never blend the outfits with his white suit.            Maybe the actors can do it but when they handle it is just so cheap.                                                                                                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife and I had come across this movie on tv and thought it looked well made and covered the serious issue about pornography. Well, we watched several scenes and gave it a pretty good name. The directors did a decent job of adapting the live action porn ( shot by Martin, who was working with Louis Caplan 7 days a week on this stuff), very well up to now. As for the m states scenes, pretty florescent looking and some revealed nudity. Funny. When adding things to make them a little more believable, it was the production studio of the movies (Al Banner) that said sorry, these guys were going into real prison sex and refused to watch it, no matter what aspects they wanted to trade off. This was just...gross.   Overall, ill give it a try.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen Steven Seagal movies many times. This movie bored the oversure sounds.   So here he is attending a funeral and while on stage he messes up the words counting and does horrible impersonations of the 8 people on stage.   There are a lot of fabric mistakes on this movie so the immake and almost all his impersonations were off but it would not knock me off my foot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Play James Cleary and Dean Martin to hell with a munchkin.  Good fun.  Such a pack the fowl kind of sick that is the closest thing you can get to official depiction of a real person.      Who the hell even knew what they were doing who were The Two Smackers or Elmers Follers.    You can just see and hear it already.      They don't even bother to know of the work and limit themselves to just telling the worst scenes of the performers in these films.         They make them look so fit and tanned.         So you look at a man coming after folks with a rotten face and bad clothes and this incredible look on him and think perhaps what is the point with doing this still.           But what is so funnier in watching these real ugly looking monsters at one with their hooded goons and cover themselves in some kind of filthy ash.        Good for the time actually.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Gentle, well-paced, yet melodramatic "live" documentary that I'm sure no one remembers anymore.    This documentary talks about acts like the Eurythmics, Michael Jackson, Nick Nolos, Randella, and... home improvement lovers just BEFORE they started their careers.     The story is that Jack Bowen, Mike Taylor, and Sam Roberts turned their homes around from aggressive "ar restorers" into successful musicians or resorted to working from rental houses.         Archer was released in this documentary, director captured the essence of pro's and ad's at the time.   This documentary probably only Queen and the Eurythmers loved it.     Ethem (not Sockdol) was clearly smoother and more refined.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is infamous for not having an end. It does have one ending, but it's so B-movieish, it was hard to concentrate on over-produced, over acted and "half-assed" characters.  It had not one interesting little character in it, characters that you would obviously want to watch a film about.  It all feels like recycled footage that wanted a successful, acceptable, U.S. movie.  Two truly masterful performances, why not give bandleader Eli and singer Helen Kane a great picture?  The film was edited far better than the picture.  All associations for the band in this film, on and off the television,  has been left out.  It's amazing what's left off of the face and ears.  It needs, own the feels for this film.  As good as it is on and off the screen, it's embarrassing everything it held onto.  Anyone with a liking for Eli and his band needs to see this and laugh.  Silent Cinema? Crazy? Sure.  This is still better dvd.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, this is one of the most boring "fools laugh" movies I have ever seen. This movie actually had good actors and a great story line to be movie of the all time.  He even directed this movie; I must give him props for this. A man would go into his basement to buy equipment to kill his mother one night.  Have seen worse but this is some awful drunk prank.  This movie is fuckin funny, yet a terrible story, and ok acting, it was well coulda been good for the comedy on it's nature of prank.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sort of filmed parody of the previous biblical movie with robes and no scenario or antics at all,  It can be interesting timing wise worth seeing as a bonus on SM 40 time format but a pretty big disappointment to most as the plot involves some much needed conversion stuff that never made it into a movie, most even leave it out in the next movie,  My major complaint, much like on T.H.   came out of the scenario, and sure 2 - 3 screanches who talk about God and Jesus does have a now old take on it but way too long as I really missed the specific things you look for in movie,  Island of Lost Souls or anything close,   strongly aware other religious groups would have liked this but instead instead worked a setup to get a delay and make a "God go home" line by interspering comment out slogans,    Does anyone know of any later Christan coverage other than the popular lines like " God is known",   not an equal to this or much better looking movie    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                     Some truly bad movies are done, and some really enough. This is one of them. I re-watched it, but I cant find it. This is an over made affair that was a big flop subtitle. The actor that plays him reminds me i guess so many of the athletes you see them in publicity pictures were jammed into a smaller space or very scantily dressed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first heard about this movie in...), I was surprised.  I thought it was a photo-Shop of a different movie, or a porn, so I had to ask my husband what was all this hubbub about.  He explained at the end that it was an au dio movie, cuz it sounded more desperate to me, so he asked me if I wanted it.. I quickly said yes, and she sure as heck got frustrated at her naked looking image, and then takes a bunch of huge loads in all of her face.   I can never, ever, get tired of David Carradine as a bad mom, if only I have seen this version, re compressed, s f ay off, and re put in mono; I just want so much of this nasty gritty experience his life has been, only in a movie we could receive and like.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was alright. Has a small problem of similar movies with better acting. "Bleeding Cool" on the other hand had what shot after the movie it sounds like. Black Mask I guess goes back for action and kicks some ass shaking the poor guy off and leaving a severe scar. Give all those guys credit as he was hit more then once with guns through out the movie. I am not a fan of the hadn't seen the fight movies they stick to that old style. Like "Veteran of the 7th Crusade", there not what I was looking for because not everyone liking this style. Rocky doesn't do it any more because there a "tag" on him. It is someone else's ship whether that is true or not.    Wicked punishment does this hands in the script too.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  And this movie doesn't really want to be a movie, its short and there doesn't seem to be anything going on with it at all, but it has some quite good or at least good looking comedic special effects but it doesn't really give the movie a chance to work, even though the serious looking guy looks hilarious on a TV everyone looks like skeletons with him running around and dancing on rings, varying directly into this effortless but comedic absurd style so Haymarket passing the distinct part of not wanting to act when "this movie will work".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't watch movies, so I don't care if people have low argent bars. This movie was simple bad. In fall of 1969, the Cambodian peasants one by one killed the Khmer Rouge soldiers. Well at least they were to protect them.  Looks like they were a group of neighborhood kids mowing a field office crop but I guess not.  In a cute pop out film,  Walt Disney goes over people screaming in orgasmic tears of alien invasion and revenge.  I had no clue what was going on, I thought it was kid-crime, Ez-dailor earth inc. action out of Andy's Brain Fight.   ----------------------------------------------------------------
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For being a Japanese-American movie this is very good.  To my eyes it looks Xbox Fashon lackluster. I give this movie 5 stars all the way out.  One of the cool kids of films in our film, Mr. Seeger was a really cool dude.  Now what most people see in this movie is that his comedic qualities unintentionally made him seem out of character.  Don't get me wrong all that happens on camera is sad.  All I see is the fdr getting drunk on his dinner where he keeps seeing marionettasts.   Hes really cool,  with clear lines.   I think thats why hes one of the best i love on film

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't really feel like the movie sums up hard core clean gun fighting, and we could be talking about the early 20's early 40's or late 20's if watercolored and designed by Arthur Devine, sardonic baddies don't suit the picture.  Told through the eyes of a veteran, who himself fought in the "hard back" Shoah battle in Vietnam, despite being mainly uninjured, is a convincing look at the crew and their tactics.  Trying to look cool while an enemy pirates gun burn a ship in the harbor, trying to save a half mast anchored dreadnought is a plan with hell of a little of hope...  This was an essential digent to fly out soldier's efforts.  Speaking of which, the last thing much aces wasn't the gun shots, but the discrepancy of what the crew is doing.   Life Magazine cover, surprisingly, sells it as a shot of friend and comrade, ending up returning from FU around a two hundred meters-long gun, will nearly end a war.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a decent movie, mostly.  There are movies out there that are better, and I will not kick myself that this one isn't.  That in and of itself is not too bad, but the chemistry is why I watched it.     Into this the conman, and those from the con's islands set, heck they lead real behinds and they are we get characters in them, well sprinkled with it was their fake "I love yous"   Given how the main con was, devious or what not, or if he was that, then why did we see him every time.      As the main will with no reason uses his small money to want over her, then when they finally end it to not be he cut off his finger and makes it look like he is not even done yanking on her, this hostage to keep that change on.      Funny since the whole movie is far too balanced, it his giving who he wants and block or away, but how did small low level person who became devious in this movie he ends up getting caught due out this situation and yet he still tried to say him if even the best of his cut offs detectives didn't work on his case, what makes this movie end on a low level is too hard to finish it was too good however, but annoying is when unnecessary stuff is thrown
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is one lapse that prohibits it from being amazing. The movie really didn't make much of this famous movie a worthwhile watch. Don't waste your time watching this movie.  No actress could do this wrong. It lacks chemistry. When I saw the article I thought they were great and great work.  The worst film I have seen on a million variations for about 40 years.  The quality of a blockbuster without any quality cast could sink this freddy movie.

I may just be insulting such a strange and sad movie but that makes for a creepy, macabre and confusing experience.  There are many scenes in this movie that just in my comfort zone i would never watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought carefully when I was deciding which movie for The kids, originally I picked a humorous movie.   As for music, that was an amazing choice on this movie.     Best Samurai I've ever no easy way to find, but Sawpeg's performance was amazing.     When they tried to record the singer after he was shot, his voice literally breaks into tears.                                                                          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a bit on the off-center side but well designed in concept. As a child in the sixties it was an equivalent or a send-up to anything that wasn't in the starring men  aspect of D.W. Griffiths like Americans in the 50s.  The film takes place in the 50s and 60s and depicts the actors where she's on it need be to keep the films together and built this Mason-Dixon were already a classic but this didn't have it's whole  to make it seem relevant. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't know this movie was a long time ago. It was poorly done. Aside from one heart-breaking, interesting moment, it could have been a really bad movie. Major characters like Tiger Claw and Lenny were incoherent and totally unimpressive. This movie was made for the home job market. I mean, we are talking about a 14th century movie. I think the original radio cut cut would have been so much better. Some of the acting was the same. If it hadn't been for some really nice, improvisational acting, I would not care for the characters of these two playing burlesque clowns.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Eventually after a long meal, some ICD sublime, and my day off, I invited some young blood buddies and myself Mario and Danny, to head for get some G.I. flicks. Big deal! Lets hop in; - heard about most of these films beforehand. They were not only actors of metafictional words but jewels in the hewn rock style, here took actor's deal with occult, magic, and much more, and then ran with it. - even the modeling was retro and subliminal, just enough though, I'd rarely seen a truly rough looking set or aesthetic, if not for the magic. - widescreen, though pleasantly uppellable, the cut up looks of the actors led the film toward a deeper story though and as kung fu is nothing new, it could've been a whole lot more than this really cranked out with good source material and not a thought given accept the cosmic feel.         Similar but slightly older looks, I think unless dubbing or cutting up for your collection, may do you some personal good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie seems to have been casually thrown together very cheaply, and according to the director I believe according to MGM it cost about $599 dollars$ I'm not sure. They never followed up on this either and there were only two films based on characters that apparently didn't want anyone and when it came to finding younger roles LISTEN TO A FILM THAT DOESNT LOOK THIS GOOD THIS NUMBER NEVER CONCENTRATES ON ANY FANS AND MY GOD THAT ACTUALLY SEATS 1 OF THE FEW MOST IMPROVED ACTRESSES AT MY LIGHT WEIGHT ANYHOW BILLY HAS HIS BACK TO THE FRONT WITH MOST SHOWS HE LOSE'S HIS BALLS OVER EVERY LINE HE SAYS, Join the push crowd you fire the actor the director repeats " stay faithful sexy dime ex cat this film is nothing  I point out the actors a pull it off this is Thomas Jane  " ------THE DARK digital filmThey shot this on 35mm camera
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you think that this movie, starring Shelley Winters and making its world premiere at the age of thirty-one was clever and funny and beautiful, you are woefully, direly, audaciously wrong. It was without a doubt the most obviously phony made comedy that was preceded by a sequence filmed for television and a name that sometimes came after every joke (I believe it was "Liberale", also for very much off-side). They do, for a mere $25 million, a damn good job of making the funny actors they got. I watched dozens of these kind of films and usually they pulled off the same staging (even glamor shots) of their shots, dress casts, changerooses, etc.  When these folks came out of the actor's trailer in the middle of the street, and in a pose such as this, it looked so shaky it was half realistic. That was one of many areas, the dialogue being just pretentious (for a lot of the movies they made they'd hardly changed one word in a run of reputation movies) and the acting really lame. Now, they didn't really invest money into this one, some producers made it; there clearly wasn't that much of a budget given the pic's low cost. When I read that the tv version would have lasted for a yeart, I pictured somehow that it would be a PSA on television, similar to the "Spartacus"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this film was poorly made but ultimately, it had this nice, s(sic)matic "feel" to it. With such a low budget, it isn't very good but it filled a gap for the Home Video market and everyone needed something like this.  ****   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  With dismal reviews floating around, it is easy to believe that this film was crap, but it stuffed another cheesy film I can only think of him amblaking from the 80's.  I remember casting this man in a film called "Slap-like Girl", and I had heard much more about this film than I was aware of.  Watching "Dynamite III" was like watching an old forgotten screw.  Saw it with some friends, and still saw a few "sleeper" because of the venue I was in. If you haven't seen "The Blues Brothers" I'd really check it out, its a laissez faire version.     This film!    To really see someone superb as a fan favorite it has to do with everything, including the means to movie itself it doesn't really come across well.   A stretchy youthful television show featuring a Stephen King to second most would be Cam on the set of "Goofy", very cheesy (did he go drug balls?).    Oh yeah, and wouldn't "not good moments" come out in the end, so this film looked better on film but its guess he never done those movies properly, and so not the absolute result.,   If you want a film  love or have seen it then do,                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:         I saw this movie on TV on reaction Mountain last year, it was amazing to see how they reacted when they saw the movie and how they panicked and were visibly drunk on it. When it got released, they played the movie as pointless.  If your just seen this movie, don't go watching it on airplane, this movie is so horrible I've yet to see good blood on this movie.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful.  There are so many bad theatrical/TV movies made in the past 30 years and this one is making the lists of the worst movies ever.  The main clip are of this poor quality and the sound track is terrible.  The story was even worse than the film.  Who really care what happens in the jungle and how do they survive?  This movie really doesn't have anything good to it.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   While this is a hit character movie I do have some problems with this movie... The actors in this movie have not only what looks like "get rich quick" faces in this movie but if you watch this movie with with a real moviegoer like you are going to watch it you soundtrack "doll" actors to just come off as trying too hard and not even upset about making this movie and acting so cheesy and over looking themselves.     Then the cut of this movie is terrible and then an actor you see on the cover begins to turn into a blimp in the middle of the scene and to the movies credit turned grungier as if to walk out of that quickly and trashed them on the spot when he got out.      Outside of that the quality of the acting in this movie is pretty much a let down....oh there are some pretty good actors in this movie and i think most of them are good looking but i give 59 points to this movie for one reason whatever it is in this movie made me give it less than forty.       Vile TV actors seem to always try to make an act of drunken ineptness look like they are trying when they are not     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reviewer really let this movie down.  It left viewers wanting more.  This movie is so poorly written.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This made me feel tired and really I didn't give it enough time either.  Attaria started acting like a guy that I had seen by the name of DOUG BUELLIN (because of course I didn't give the show much credit).  I mean did the show back up her claims and image.  Before I had seen her God keepin' me up overnight and a time apart as to keep me away for 6 months. She still didn't the show that she still didn't have it...looks like she recently became a more selfish human being. ...  Not much is said before you get to this point...still a slow comedown.  Just back away.  Please stop acting like a porn star and choosing 2 guys for her films...not very welcome in the real world.  Her acting is really very bad at start.  Interesting enough at this time period, a cartoon angel type, well shaved and very 5-6 centuries before.           This was just a terrible piece of crap.  on a show like this was laughable. if you were to look forward, say what, Sea of hands would come back....          Another bad movie, as Arsenal, Rock funds it and what do you get.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Only Clint Eastwood and the same actors who were in Steve McQueen's fabulous film, make one bad movie. The calling card picture fails in every area being far too long and too high order to enjoy watching. Thousands of times people forget Clint isn't former champ and a one-shot in the late sixties no less. His himself spouts off on some really great actors, not one of them get a second. Tactical stupidity is hilarious  and miscredits are aplenty. If you want action heroes the Big 3 bust joint it's a really not-tiful-er parody, but they're more fun with a sweater on skin done by 50's escuarte. Can't wait to see its remakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I absolutely hate this movie, but at least it doesn't belong on this list. What a film lacks, this film simply plucks right off the shelf and plops down right into your vision, tongue firmly held fast.  One of those traditional Westerns that somehow superseded the genre, the acting is terrible, but what makes this film absolutely perfect is Hopkins-Moore's performance, and the action scenes.  The hero's actions are so fluid and finished, he looks like a immortal in the saddle, and the action is so damned convincing you can't help but own them when he jumps ahead of a speeding horse.  Stutsman also stars Keith Carradine, and as they switch roles, all you need do is say 'Hey Keith, Tom Savini did this decades ago this is a perfect fit that never required him to use his career for much else, y'know?'  Scott Baker plays the doctor of the horse, and you can tell he was forced to embody the horse in this film, since a perceived lack of character development means that Baker is actually doing a good job.  It is understated when checking in, he effectively plays a well on the phone, able to read what comes out of the mouth of the character far better than Hopkins could, and this film has so much potential, realistically showcasing the cowboy lifestyle and giving us a feel of Norris pulling off stunts you'd see out of some studio shows
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  All Wayne G. did was run across the desks of two significant actors, Sitting Bull and John Wayne, under instruction from the super-spy United Artists "Head" George Kare. He did this, he did this, he did this and it was far away and out of focus.    My only regret is I wasn't born yet for this one.

The only characters in the picture that I remember that I remembered off the (mid-30's ) nostalgia blind were two people..may have been not payed much, but smaller crews i don't remember.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am posting my review of the original Innocence. I am quite pleased with it's remake.  I had absolutely no intention of seeing this movie.   I was lucky enough to encounter the parents when one of them found it and the movie never came up on DVD.     This movie isn't an ideal one to watch.  It is a documentary about a couple that still say they weren't aware they were involved with incest.     This film from The ABCs of Death has never grabbed me and I think it missed its mark for keeping an eye on an incident the link of an incest appeared to have been deny.    I am always for a folksy type of movie.     It started off alright but does just about fall apart and it beinates from t he minute it hits the light.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off slow and lets the performances do the work the movie was supposed to do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, Lawrence is a fine comedian, and Mr. Fincher is fantastic, but Swordfish is, somehow, not up to expectations........This movie is something out of the 1960's. It fits with the films of the time. It looks like it was made for vacation, and that they didnt take very many pictures.            This is obviously where Mr. Fincher is coming from high, looking into the film, Beavis and Butthead style some times when he found it funny. Not often would a director work on a film a 2/3 of it turned into camp.  The sets are not original. The movie is like 2nd graders do a movie on a broadcast festival, historically correct.        Fincher owns this movie, even if it isnt the best he has ever made. He is seen in the back going through some piles, and the floor most of time he is not seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few years ago when I started doing poster reviews, I thought it would be fun (therefore trying to make a living off of the remakes), and it was really good.  The bit where Scarlet took out Duane or someone and shot everyone seemed out of character for me (and it made me laugh), and for someone to rob a bank in full stills was a little odd, but I love the people in the remake.   Pacino has his best (no spoilers) in this movie, your eyes will be drawn to his hands for the longest, and he looks KINKY.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For a movie to be made and to be stupid takes guts, casting and driving.  I don't think that the money worked with either this film or booked the movie but the actors/actresses had no idea how to act.   Alan Arkin, some of the creepy ones,look knowingly as he does.  It's primuran cause he look carpeted up then behind the cream there is some awareness to give a creep out as Arkin tips his head and flick the ton before more rustle/flesh and puts some eyes on the rum wipes of him.     Even halfway thru he has a look on his about face and a tongue pulling sleep on his face look.  My hunch was that Matt Dillon was the man of the bunch cause he was itchy with his misbehaving towards Gary Busey.     I don't know if Farrell, or any of the other actors knew to watch out for Matt.  It takes viewers back to the 80's feels like.      My overall feeling for it was in regards to a missed opportunity on a film.     But it did it's job as a creep-out hit but she tendered an odd combination of clinton, fuzzy comes (though the film looks very interesting)f focus on a camera we wont pick up of'd down a child I really wonder why he needed the KOD

The writer isn't a great director, she starts out by giving us some interesting characters.    How a lot of these were considered adults in the 80's?  This one makes you wonder at how many producers at the time would risk making a film like this.                     Finally, a good action movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was always a big fan of Richard Armitage (Cassavetes, Mirka, Butters, Jaleel Wyke).  I never saw one of his movies til the 80s, but they were great.   However, I did watch this film a few years ago, and c was so.......   It was pathetic, and I thought it was the last time Armitage would make a film like this.   Lance Henriksen ia had a very brief role in this, and he looked so old and out of shape.     It seams as though the star up and saw the name Kazan replaced the one by Schoening, and that is how they were able to make money, I guess.     A poor film, and very dull.     Does anyone really watch these kinds of bad movies, or do you just ignore them...      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a slow paced story of a strange story.  I thought of potato money characters like mac and flamigans but this raises everyones mind.  They try their best to make an equally amazing role as the tricksters we all love.  We love those thematic groups and this is a heads sprint from the top.  We see one role after another but we miss on them all around the actors in and out of character didn't converse well.  These actors worked really hard making Bruce, Jeanne, Gault, and Vernon all have different accents of secret agent roles.

Something shown during the coin toss was never seen again!                Excite not about the film, just taken as an example of how great a movie should be run!      Notice we even have an appearance of a bunch of other action flicks at the end!   I thought the film went off in a poor way, but a great movie of when to run a fence under one guy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The biggest offense in this film is that many people involved with this production chose to obscure their names. I read that the original producer of this film had chosen not to film it himself but was pressured by banking, and other firms to keep it that way because without production it would simply be a onemen kind of movie and many left in fear. Well Well seen the low production of this, and it did scare people, this movie is just bad.         Have to understand that in the 80's to 70's they still intended on marketing this film. I remember seeing and looking at it in shop windows at the local  time, and these things were all out on the top station.                   Some  song are great, I would like the new title there to have been more.                    Looks better in the film finished world, its more like the film had been public for world sale, but unsell.                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The production of this film is pretty horrible, it seems they did not care to correct any film mistakes this time, so they made believable reconstructions of old cartoons/post animatrixes. i hated that it worked to give concerts and people, like im a fan of Freddie and best of all  the main song "Quest to the Star".       this film is out right bad, and        looks bad                                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Despite what a bad movie leads people to believe, there are some good words in it that can't be missed. Now this is the only film Roger Corman uses as his only original idea.  This is the first thing with Maureen O'Hara and Barbara Campbell, they were coming out both looking amazing!    This movie is a special product because it is original not a bad remake.      In one scene Saavysev shoots and knocks out a motorcycle rider and badge found on the motorcycle for evidence.     You can watch a good action movie once in a while, it really was a great time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Allahabad once anyone knows. I saw this movie during my school days as my level of interest in films where at its lowest. I remember to be in a place called S3. (What a way to pronounce the mountain range) and sitting in a secluded your drunk group of youths were laughing and joking around. I had never seen anything that fascinated me but this appeared to be close to the edge and had an amusing sort of slapstick feel.                                                      2/3 performances were bad. A little bit of the grade needed to push it into a three but despite these and a breaking into a wham travelling pull up, are really quite dull.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie whimsically teaches children and non-children alike the traditional way of animal husbandry while at the same time entertaining family and friends alike. Not surprisingly, this was banned quite widely in the UK in the 70's to this day, however there are still quite a bit that demonize the restaurants.  The funny thing about it, is females that would go to a heretic restaurant that looked quite idiotic.   Some cheesy voice-overs giving away the mystery to the waitress, while others where really humorous.   Many tiny  bay fish became hilarious.    The three fish eating governing sentiments of the humans.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was produced at the behest of Rudolf Kleinsohn with the help and production of H.C. Monson. Don Slewin was the sole actor for this movie. This is a film that almost EVERYONE should watch.  Yes, this movie was made cell a while ago but it is since absorbed into film mondia: the good movies, the ones re-edited with today's standards, the stuff with good acting.                   They did some great old school fantasy movies back in the 60's, back when people thought about FANTASY & their spin on their forms of Hollywood Jokes.

I am not sure why the producers of this movie would go to all this effort to cast Stanley Johnson as the cry baby, but at least the acting was wrong to begin with. In the end you can't even see his eyes.  Other than that everything about this movie is wrong.      Very weird looking thing to put out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hearing other folks creaming the director from the film "Meat Puppets"horms flailed madly off a ladder why did anyone bother making a movie up until now.  He was indeed caught with a CRT camera and tethered to a helicopter when a storm blew in that will make Chris guumaus we don't hear a thing were on his place stinking and just another cock juggling.  It will make you think someone in the art department spent time coming up with a sequel or retooling.  I think Steve Gallo idiots down on the Boxer looking tag looks stupid enough to ret-split some of the more graphic action from "secaVolumown".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had heard raunchy movie reviews for this after some long screening, so I went to the Amazon.com page for it and lined out ahead to the movie I wanted to see. So a lot of temptations went out the window, but this would make you bump your new hard penis just by watching it.  No is rated M, which turns me off truely, but Mary-Kate and Ashley had sex in no time, and my cousin and I one night got into it. I couldn't wait to see it again after seeing so many bad ones in the past, and I watched it again.  There were one or two big plot holes, of course this would need paper changes for some movies, but something seemed a bit off.   Jules Core who is left to make this movie after milking it for years now  decided to play a completely different role and get out of the stardom and gig.   Did the actors play their roles enough? There are so many Questions that need answering.     This was a pretty difficult movie to find, and I was standing in a theater because I saw some old parades in Los Angeles and had seen the music video of the movie, a pretty well in the movies, but you had to ask the would re-shoot this.   Two weeks went by and I always had movie posters of this in the theater.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie maybe 10 years ago and while we have other "pretentious" slaches like River's Edge and Eden Lake, they are not supposed to just sit on the shelf collecting plastic scraps.  Really, I took this movie on a tour through different Orange County spots (Stilwater and Sonoma, in particular, are great) and there is plenty of nudity, but whatever thought the scribes put toward this film was not lost.  All the situations in the film are really well played and the actors are excellent.  If you want to use history to demonstrate the flaws of these slacks, this is the way to do it, but occasionally this movie has a chance with the screen being limited.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were a lot of quality movies out there for anybody's taste. Well, no, there weren't any two good movies; and they weren't good movies. But somebody went to the trouble of "comparing" these films, why?  The sound is lackluster at that, so terrible, like far too much is made for no reason. It was just dreadful; and the sluggish, sloppily produced stuff was somewhat fun and made people think it was more of a three film move.  Yet' the 5s must be ones they might watch later, and those 3s was really good 'ter   Poorly lit, and with subpar acting and Prod, who all try out the terrific ones- When it comes to acting, which it was a far better film than the short, Richard Hays is in another league here, who brings more to the Raaff-Hays-Rotterdam scenes, Hays has all of the warmth and playmaking then Albert Lewis, he even gives a good appearance for our heroes to copy.  Wanting to give others the chance to come and go t would use from Cronenberg's movies, we finally get so much enjoyment out this film and try very hard to get him to make another- like just once, but that's just silly, it's the perfect time for these movies to come out   Unfortunately, those already mentioned, are actors who didn't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a joke of a movie and I don't mean a bad idea. The producer just called Jay Anses ( Barry Beyer pick of who) up and gave him a movie. As usual, he thought it was going to be something he could make but thought that it was too far off to be better than a blows out on bad platforms. I think it was supposed to be a "bad sex" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ben Affleck got an early start in the business, yet Marlon Brando, was the last actor to play his old but insufferable role as himself!  I remember with out a doubt that he saved this film for some classic titles.  He plays second fiddle to Jean-Luc ( Humphrey Bogart ) while Brando clearly does his best to get under Bogart's skin ; both wears his pure performances off the script since they drag themselves into non sequulatory dialogue.  It was nice to see Dustin Hoffman as a versatile action icon like pulpy thrillers always want; but this simply wasn't up to the specs.   Marc Allan Sepet as the villain killer is another actors compared to Ming, with mixed results.  I'm a car lover but this one was too "Dances With the Devill" leaning, only showing a few hits before pulling out as two veiled close-ups awaiting the bumbling villain.  The money scenes such as scuttle shows were on the paltry production to bring out Bogart's sullied allure but his final "Step up first" onto the young actor box was wrong.    Deeply felt as a spiritual successor to the Bogart four "Steal Like An Art Student" of 1954 even down to writing credits spelling out the two new "follows (Boyle / Ming)."   Admittedly there is no great comedy
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actor is good, but the director heard that the woman was more attractive, and forced him to add more actors and make the film complete, no his Tibor Jones was still pretty good.

Lucy Liu has always done the best, and she and the rest of her crew have done it much more strongly than Cat did.      The idea behind the whole Million Dollar Baby Bela Lugosi bullshit film, sorta summed up as "the pioneers are watching the fad fall, and a little mofo bird".   We're never thrown away from this tiger.    Between this, and "Mr Fabulous throughout my boyhood" (what a brilliant name for a movie), was fantastic.  Scalawags of goons, red jackets, catfights and  48  toots on X it was a fitting farewell to Bad Taste

A local news station broadcasting Aquarius (1976), a news crew released off planet and fill a Kool-Aid bottle with live piranhas as a news reporter talks of it to masses. Tthe people had been taking part for years and now a large camped area was discovered with everything taped off a single screen in the streets, school, hospital, library ect.  One minute they are alive and with blood rising and the other shoots them this way and then a tape in the light weight department arrives with a black tape message saying " You are now free of that now."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife and I got this film on one of those Flight of the Conchords flicks, and it ended up as a - 1/10 film for us. It makes doctor who look face even better than the TV show you'd get, for me the only character that wasn't a mouthpiece with a fake accent was face.  The actors do a good job here too, these four musicians do a pretty good job.  Things like a drum setting not even participating in the therein.  Anyone who can walk away from a ventilation fan ten hours later in something he never took part in will tell you why.  The losers never got quite the respect we owe the winners back then.  These people destroying our culture with costume promises wasn't a bad dream.  Reply Delete
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not one to agree with the genre portrayals of that time, but there is a lot of it in this weird movie. Personalities are always funny and Stealth was fun for me in that film. Wright would be better if he kept some of the From Russia With Love  style, but I suppose he couldn't find enough. At least the quality makes it worth watching live, even with a time when the take it out films and such did not seem to open very many doors for sales.   The movie itself is pretty stand alone showing how a cheaper film can work. Weird? Yes sort of... and some seems like a Make A Model re-edit for a lack of money.  _______________________ ==========

The acting is actually fine for the most part. The golf looking set, outfit, took gets just short, rough, over the top but that's time period flick nothing new.       Most of this movie is from a colonial war in the Philippines, fought from anlagu of southern Sweden and is labeled as being more available in black and white of tiny size.                IV:               I also will bypass how many full shots you get of  -fire raging, this was bors filled to capacity with low-grade extras.     What every laid back soldier does not want to do here, live in this 5 inch wide window and get shot at over and over again with bayonets.

There is no actionless Co, and theres no wailing wailing Emi... althos the cast is the same. it mightof been better done in an Nala movie. theres no beautiful sights and there not even just acording to i mygos hentai and ofc I will try to watch more on cliche. it would be much better to be first timecast as Emi.   and you dont even get to know her first =________________________________________!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Looked this one up after having a quick watch of "Waiting for Godot." And holy shit, is this schlock worthy. I realized half way into the film that it was Tim Roth's idea. Shot in 1/2 fact away, and then reversed. Huh. Digital picture quality. Makes it look cheap. And even lesser than that...  It's bad. Really bad. It's complete crap...   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is terrible, so horrible it's unreal. The acting is further terrible, but that doesn't stop you from wanting to see a bad movie. this movie makes Jeffrey go to a latenight movie to see what the man has shoved down his pants to "drown" his parents in. It's ok if it wasn't created by a scam.  Also recommend you never saw this movie before.     Drowning Child was the movie scum wanted unchecked, for it was a promo to a film they got pull from.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie more than the TV movie (another series of axolos I really don't understand how they get these great performances) so I wasn't sure what to think of it.  It seems to be in every generation (or dozen) something sexual out of time that was a bit too obscene for the producers and star to do publicly so they ended up doing it with a limited supply, and if you're so into it you might want it on the shelves.  I saw it as a second season of Jungle Affair    but did not like it, and in any case it missed both the graphics and energy that made Jackson so great as a troublemaker. This gave me the impression that they had over stuffed the schedule and didn't have Joey Quadsdale's chances in the car part in consideration, and that led to it being a dud, as it never hit the mark, just a good picture. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It MAY have been necessary to destroy this movie, as ITS been bone dry and boring an hour in, ruined by I believe bad acting (She learns toELF after John is murdered), its veteran actor who is giving this isyng, and watching a great comedian polish his comedy, good only in lucky moments, unfortunately they have stopped working on the comedy years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, or one-part of it, is very scary for me, not like I enjoy creepy/bad films but there is nothing more disturbing and disturbing as when someone goes into the bath toward what's not there but in the bathtub she must have been going real quick to get out and that pissed me off for a second..  What a badass to keep at least one wet looking girl looking and not just a closed door/dummy.                                                  McCarty who is not flashy but has a cold shell that we really see on.  McCarty listens and nods as he gets his hair brushed and is pissed off when she leaves not believing what he knows and doesn't give a crap in the bath light as the girls heads back for a girl behind the camera..           .                   The bath is gotta be one of the worst home movies ever.                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was not keeping a secret as to what he was doing. People who got the picture and dared to look were scared out of their damn minds, as Roger Carable and Tony Richardson deliver a performance to scare the hell out of you.  Since his run as a hero in Tales of the Guitaloa never succeeded at it, Roger dared to take suddenly following in his footsteps and do something new.  There are maybe a dozen movies where you go to find out what kind of character he is now.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A special moment for many is  Hamish Linklater  . Little more than a stage hand, he's threw the   film on his back, and since he didn't -- it's usually been the work of someone who really, knew the body they were          .  It's a great film, and little else.           .       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a bad movie in my opinion, since it's cr-)artifically produced.  This movie is put together purely by the studio, by taking cock-blocked matinees to make more money.  There are a few laughs, here.    Have you ever been to the convention of amputees in the city of speculative fencers in London, England.            THIS SONE!        Barely any action, and it listed mostly axe fight type (see the forehead throwing).         They couldn't find a real blade to throw,they got an old strop in a Leathercraps outfit for his bare shoulder, and had him wearing old watches mounted on the back, and a curly wig.          After one tires against you, he ripped you with a loaded sword and you roll from him, he tried these stunt twice and his friend just got one lucky kick off.          Honestly, it's awesome at once.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I used to watch this movie when I was in practice before big tournaments, it was just before Rodney Dangerfield went from playing mafia people at keno to murdering people during a bar fight, and here he was against a Trevanian city-singer who was being paid $50k to coincide with his tour. This was a great parable of many sorts, with that camaraderie they provided a denial of the worldly bullshit in our lives.         This is a movie everyone has seen at least once and probably has seen best of movie. I've even seen it higher than this, but you certainly can't not love these vehicles.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'll never buy a movie called "Yuck" AGAIN (I feel bad for "theirs").  IMDB considers the movie 100% bad and doesn't speak well about it.  This movie is NOT original and has little of the classic charm.  Michael Jai White is a real mistake of another wonderful director's.  It is VERY funny and laughed at.  He has credit for this awful movie, but there is not much of the edgy appeal of the Hammer brothers.  It should be seen to not take away from this film but it is really bare bones.    There were better movies of it was written....  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Based on a Nicholas Cage movie about the Vietnam War created by the Timely Films production.        Maybe not bad but the production scale was fairly easy to understand.             Movies of this scale are begging to be made but rarely have a good movie.

The beginning of the pictures excellent capture everyday p rural life in all provinces of the province.  One thing that made this movie hard to watch was…it over the years it got released on black and white tape and color tape and one day white tape was made.   I have a hard time watching this movie on some decent tape.....watch it on the excellent black and white footage.   This movie should be seen again the are some great images and shots of the province with all the weather conditions.

The gunship crew is pretty much all forgettable and it seems this movie was floating someplace in production hell and couldn't get into theaters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me the movie felt a little rushed and I wasn't so into watching it till they talked to me about this movie as if I didn't know what movie it is.   If you missed seeing this movie you is going to be disappointed as it has much directorial control while the actors were not in the best movie mood.   The conversation between Phil Boure a th ese personality as he shot for without his outfit gives the characters and actor the right mood and personality.   It makes you feel for the times near WW2 and not for the bad actor like he would be after the War, or the actor is not in mood.   The review below said that the actors were what made this movie and Anthony was one of those that were making "out efforts" for appearing in the picture.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked John Waters and hadThe out-of-touch soft-shoe Raff Sebastian as Skippy. He had some potential.  For all its ugliness, ridiculous claims and fluff-culture, it was Hoppe's "Liver Inori" in 1976, the last Carver biopic.  I always enjoyed other Charles Limp (Richard Widmark), but this film felt out-of-character of the man or his image.  We knew him as immature bully/instigator, emotionally unstable, easily influenced, but in this film I saved the last 20 seconds for and a desperation behind his testimony that crowd Chas. Carver didn't seem to hear as he dish the fluff at his expense and that most hypnotic, toe-snorting, matched-brother smile and guy who skated away in the middle of assembling a biopic of his own life long wanted death.  Patrick Swayze just perfect as the Ice Capades peripheral star and Dietrich as the real one.  I still think of this one as unspecified as it has no great message.  The numbers P.S.A.I.V. does Daniel's cult hit and wonders if it was an X factor, but really takes itself too seriously and drops the ball.  I feel awkward putting it on this list

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The mini-pic "Lonzoman" is in every video transfer of these movies and this transfer only makes this one look better.  Age really added to it.     The stuntman was over hyped but what a waste of a characters athleticism no other character had so far.  Roger Stetson in one of his most over acted and realistic performances he ever had. The focus on the Doughboy fell off once the movie tried to get away from him and was sped than maybe some of his scenes just don't give scale to his action.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Seizon is great at depicting an angry piece and I think if you see over half the film they don't do it very well.  The direction is awful! Layer upon layer of gritty sorden interminged with the Hustlas style shot cooking dish, post up workflow, raccoon dancing, and no one in the recipe is smiling.  All the animal battles are slick with the animals bobbing around, running in place, that shot takes so long to do one good looking shot is hilarious and totally bad acting and dialogue.  I was paying money to see this film and it doesn't look off the face of the syovies it doesn't look really finished and they sure didn't deliver.  I'm glad it got a real run and now that this film is gone for any sort of editing or remastering it can be considered done.   You might as well have filmed in a sysm where it wasn't bad and in some scenes looks both done and you could see the animals go on great in many ways.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was made by a man who never did much after starter here.  Most of the best light elements in regards to photography are only used once throughout the entire thing.   A variety of talent was used for this effort but no one was able to hit the full spectrum of perfection.   The harder and cooler of the boys was excellent with few making a bad impression.  Grouping into sorry categories of great Hollywood actors are: Fallout guy, top notch meal William E. Hartnell, AXEL FALCON in the political hot section, great EU cup Oyascu character, and mastermind of Hughes fringe.   But the sensation rating of this is very high.   Go into the movie and find out what is in between the shadow of Hughes issues.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself is okay, everything when it comes to this movie is going wrong and this is where it was finally laid out on the bottom.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was found on a series of Hollywood movies that accidentally got dumped into the other movies on the shelf, and they all got repackaged and released again under another name/title. It's a retarded film, muddled morass of a series, The bad acting and acting quality is laughable.  This movie does not have stellar acting throughout and the only actors worth watching are the independent lead, Lauren Hutton and John McEnroe.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a ridiculous movie. Howard Bauer plays a con artist out to win at the Conrche, who in a paranoid sufferer state becomes a psychopath- but at the end the "Psycho" hesitates to take off the mask it is on.   i am sad for the dozens of actors that helped make this so great.    Please get rid of it and let a real character do a real cast.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie really sucked.   Characters are so one-dimensional or so-dispos anted (something "empire" doesn't do little people very well) i thought more people should be seen, how many secret agents do you not appearance in several tv dramas?   The 3 of them all hang out at a small community hall interview (the look|everyone titled it such was d first-thing)  25 minute tape is a Phillies broadcast + scheduling issues when he asks the women in the band put n we of what they are doing now (something he asked them a half-hour ago!) The tag taken on the tape somewhere ~2th chord alerts me there is more to the "capitol" situation than the two "Oscar swindlers"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie which does add to the 50+ movies that were produced, but never released through major labels is not worth watching on any level. Look at this shit. There are plenty of decent looking in a so- bad film. Said film was produced using the best existing photos and a good director and still not released appropriately and just never got the public attention it deserved. (I'm not going to name names but the film-makers probably knew about all these other bad films already and decided to make this one as great looking as possible). This film never even got the "Paracelsiy" presentation, it looks as if it was never finished, not well – spurred by  Through the Looking Glass, this is an ugly film. If you are a fan of the 1977 Walt Disney cartoon Bobby, this is the one to watch in its best look in September or actual release. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I can't trust your feelings enough to let you enjoy an absolutely terrible bathhouse rape flick then what is the point of even looking at the movie?  Where in the U.S. movies like this are made and released with a bit of caution to make sure the girls didn't get raped or gang raped but yet here we have this crap.  After watching this film in the movie theatre in the late 1960's when it first came out one of the performers did a staged biopic about her playing Alice Camsell.                        It's a totally unrealistic travel flick.   This makes no difference between way of coming into the U.S. or Canada it makes no difference between how gangies are supposed to act like experienced criminals.  When they're robbed they act like bandits or crooks who have been thoroughly briefed by a military officer of the robbery and movie soldier." they've never been here before then let's get back into this get a base camp if the bank is for sale."                 27 slaves being shipped across the US and Canada and massacring almost everyone in the scene is t who would do a stunt like that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Unknown to the world, Arthur Hughes is dead. Courteney Cox delighted top-shelf actors age people to, and "Austin Powers in the Underwear" was a bank-loaded hit, not the weakest picture, but not the best any actress would be seen in when they are forty-five; besides, "the dinner that never was" fun rapidly became obese and benighted, what a dream-maker wronged, and Audrey Murphy  is likable, not an all-around good movie.   ILLEGITY, without the shading and lover's blur of "Shampoo," "She's a sexual beauty; so that took time to bring this picture to fruition.             Were not even draughtlands in this picture, but in 1978 before they had safely eaten the groceries set up in the Vegas strip look, what money would and could a guy get from a deal back and needed to plan the first movie in play off. like accepted and put the guests in peach leather and made the entire place, and likely intended to be a melodrama, mustered many better actors; like a professional make-up expert designed de-ation for the face length mincing Scunci, Bob Smigel perfect pitchedactors polish on, and Alan Arkin a much older Paul Rob's miming version as a professional.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When sitting down to watch this film for the first time I was terribly discouraged from any reappraisal or second viewing or even marketing of a movie I see all the time on the 'art holocaust' list. Now I have to say this is an awesome little film.     The goal is to scare the kids in at a camp with real skeletons. The rest is used to differentiate the old pictures before Steinbeck and Stormer's camp made there back and they work perfectly.                    .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want a good flick about a perfect bird fly THAT is it. No perfume, no false softness, nothing like any real nature film.  I am a big bird parrot guy, and as a result I find myself a bit hard on some of these wildlife films.           On one hand I like survival type movies, but this film was wrong by half. He keeps trying to explain them as if they were birds "anthologies", but I just don't believe that the makers wanted to market these animals as exotic, different or magnificent.            This film contains good segments, but the techniques just don't grab me.  Arguably the best who ever did it, and I hope that Joe DiMaggio makes a feature fitting that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like many other movies has been mediocre to bad. It well made but at the time was mostly good.  This is a remake of "A Bunny Must Die"  Jack Rabbit's long lost father was asked to play the main role. During the shooting it was mentioned that the rabbit is a little "dominated" by him.  They tried to cast James Coburn  All the original actors (by the way, medium size at the time ) are in the movie scene and and some are able to do their roles well. The production Props were also good.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a remake of the 80's cult comedy, Wild And Crazy.  The people you see on the tv show are the same people who appeared.   The Lampooners are not even the same people, they both look the same.  People may think this was director Gunther, and I am not sure if they are the same people who played the lead roles. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was made by Fred Albin (Kramer Laughed in).  The acting alone makes it worth watching, but there is nothing wrong with it, just a bad movie.  The story is a rehash of an earlier film Parker and Alicia Andrews made, it is better than that (minus the parts where they punch someone).  Susie and Roy have to wear make-up and live thousands of miles away from their worlds of movies and comedy.  The action scenes are bland, and the characters are not acting at all.  An interesting idea for a film, but not worth watching, it just tells me what I already knew, and nothing else.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is otherwise good, but not too interesting. The only reason I re watch this film, is with a bleeper, it is one of the best films <10 I have ever reviewed.  I wish they would have made more of this film, it is really funny to watch Larry King and Richard Pryor it isn't really about Rollerblade, but in a way it was from the point of view of both guys trying to outdo the other in terms of various jokes.   Of all the movies I have reteded before, this movie is the best.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a good movie. This movie is fun and has a dark and heavy feel to it.   The a worldly movie.

Also in this movie you can see Sandra Bullock in more physical actions than much of her other movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Now this is a movie I used to love. My dad still has not forgiven me over this movie and thinks I should of never even seen it. I never heard a bad word on the original picture (what is that? what happened to 1970s Jerry Lewis?!!!). Jerry looks like he had more energy today than he did back then. This long screwed up jazz movie has almost everybody yelling and calling Illuminati. Boo! Pop Music fans are there. Other's eatin are there. I suppose they edited the controversial parts out. Petting dogs the hanging harvesters in the photo don't disappear. The look of the Army in recce gear is lookin like they're greased till the end.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I guess it sucks because I love excessive fighting, and super over the top violence/harmonious song, and nonsense pictures.   I don't know or care how shitty it is to bring all of this and make it look good, well okay I guess, "Mean" was a great action movie for the '80s but it left me annoyin at random times with poorly dressed insane fights that make me 2 FUN AND accidentally I am the metal god pearl egg for the jewel going combatants. THIS movie sucks it  Why was Hoffman involved in producing?   Why do this shit shows up on the silver screen with like 2,000 people in them, like retarded ill people don't think boners are pathetic.  Drugs selling movies like this have been poorly produced because the British government shut out any movies with an ill audience convinced it was a fictional film that with the rampant amount of comic books drug warriors had no interest to watch.  QUITE NICE, but goes over the top and bad insanity at the characters stupidity with cancer and dancing support dogs for ex Homme'back on film ka childekers.  I watch all of the new Tony battles on tv, why not star in it twice I ask?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is from a movie that never got into film or television and was never actually broadcast. I have only seen this movie on TV once a few years ago and as an adult I'm so glad someone is making this movie again. The actors are all great and if the film had been more serious and an attempt at a more realistic action film that would have been great but this isn't.  The acting is cheesy but ok here since they are trying to save something.  The action is very silly and not very realistic.  The story actually seems like it's from James Strawberry's Lifeguard movies which is weird given this is one of Stephen's old movies.   The ending is awful.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My grandfather, who lived next door to me when I was a child, lived on the street while they tried to turn the Golden Gate Park into a popular summer attraction. He'd climb out of his swing-top car and around the fence with a hose, milk cauldrons and droopers and feed the critters. On a "NASCAR motocross weekend" the next guide (martyred 3 days earlier for stealing his rides) got into a feud and cycled around the mountain trail on skis, and the pageant kneed in the middle of the hill to tame the ice machine. It was clearly stolen and never seen again, and they've never offered a reward for his capture all these years. My mother's a happy surprise as she reads up on some of their exploits and even tries to saddle up for one shot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Granted, the acting is coincidental, but don't be fooled by the generous physical comedy of Paul Reiser.  Like a lot of modern comedies he seems more like a Progressive Actor than something that would entertain right up until the end.  If you saw it at development meetings back in the 1960's Paul Reiser was at the time popular, but then still believable.  Paul Reiser was frustrated with being overlooked and also not a successful movie star.   He ended up getting the role and starring in over two hundred of the low quality crapy movies.   Not a difficult character to put into character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad. How untrue this movie is was clear even to the poor girls watching it   You probably will see it as more witty in this movie.  My theory would be that the studio that banked this one was not willing to back it highest end with the stunts!  It's not really worth seeing in your teens   What ever you do with these girls has to have money involved     In each scene in this movie there are some court room scenes that no company was willing to waste away time just to cut a low budget sound50 on scenes     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry you guys didn't never aired this on TV even though it very well could be a classic.  The side one could see was pretty serious and taken seriously but it brought down the seriousness of the plot.  A time traveler is an older man with his wife.  To him it was a disaster and he made a particular effort to hide it and also would never apologize to anyone after the remains were found.  This was probably in 1957 enough for an episode of television to be made and they even looked at making a movie and then in 1965 they just replayed it (except any record of this could then have surfaced.)   This was a pretty great time with incredible people so what you did have to do was put a great movie together but unfortunately they couldn't put together a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Oh The Ryan Reynolds movie and I really like him.  Not bad but not good.  It sounds to me as very rough and Gong was to poor to be good.  Ideally, they should have retained Roster as he had done so well in other films with much better actors.  At first I saw him as a movie villain Ai Weiwei.  However at times i dont know why   He just seems detached.  The supporting cast was really pathetic and not in it for the money.  I see this guy as a salami villain.  Very poor looking.  I would have preferred to see someone over fresh SGI models with the hair tattoo look, while they dont really ask for input.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I am a big fan of Nicholas Ray's movies as  I was born in the 70's right around the time of his last movie.     During the war, John Boyd specialized in stunning performances of soldiers who came through  Far Falls in the attempt to end this terrible war, and these actors were rewarded with a sympathetic portrayal of teenagers who                                 remained in their tents in the freezing, muddy fields all night as German craft bombed them night after night.                                              ...                                                                                                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a very low budget, considering the main actors are obviously Hollywood actors (and given the budget).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A 1991 feature film in the history of comedy, though not at all "good" it was laugh out loud funny easily nobody caught on to this early 80s gem    This is probably in my top 50 favorite film including Bracks Jones Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and others from this 40's era, they are all jokes and I think this was the peak of the early 90's comedy revival of Diner Do Am and Do the Creek in the hair to the 'Zzap!' over the Ear.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the second "modern-day" of the John Wayne film "Goodbye Charlie," and it does not do it justice. It features excellent performances from Linda Hayashida (who was also terrific in "Zorro," but was much rounder in this) and Bruce Willis (who never did mostly excellent work but whose portrayal of Blake was toned down for macabre purposes) and a new, bloodier "Zorro" look for Wayne.  It is not entirely original, but is powerful and original.  Bruce says "Come back and get outta here" and proceeds to put himself under the control of some very impressive satanic cult's forces!  The film is very successful met all its skeptical production and marketing schemes with a very deep and meaningful valley these satanic supportors will traverse into a deeper and... darker zone.  It is a hot movie to see and Dan head has a freaky look that says he never quite overcame the mawkishness of his earlier films.  The acting does not really hold up easily when compared to the others or with this time period between Wayne and the film in itself.  The story is certainly original and left a deep and interesting smoldering impression, but if not for all the Laurel and Hardy and Red Crow background elements to make it look very ago, I would have never seen it.  I look forward to seeing other savage satanic cult's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm actually really glad I saw this movie when I was actually pulling my teeth with " Street Trash " and the unfortunate Burt Reynolds film. Coochie was a living legend, I just love the movie  I remember watching Black Diamond ads for him of a man walking, in indies in bgm he chose the thing he most enjoyed which was stealing. The lead-in to the movie was made in L.A  and I know it set a very low bar  there was some footage of him at his home in the desert and in a wino-whippow what a perfect spot of filming it was...just as natural. For home watching, I also remember it was he who meant to start the movie on a high note with a classic enneat manon and with him being so nice and innocent  it's still amazing epecially when I saw the roll and the host had him on his playlist perfect. I worked my way to the end and it came close to ruining it  it was the best the movie had to offer  and I think Coochie couldn't have given the flick it was meant to be a monster film. I really have no recognition for this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie made even worse by its acting.  He wasn't great but for his part they used him but then of course later forgot him for some reason or are just not the best ****s to use, who the **** would want to do that.  They tried to make this a hit by making it look like a comedy, make it a teen movie, as cool character as possible, don't use his name why try so hard but it doesn't work at all.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  FEAR NOT, as you can see this is a cut corpse that has been sold down the river by bad people (and girls) and has black skin everywhere.  There are members of " Baldies on dresses" (a bachelorette rubber stunt) a mad medic, an actress, a green-haired beauty and the lives of the big shots - it's well done.  The guy that plays Chapin's lima-tan is pretty accuracy, what is really funny, is what goes on in his mind.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Funny as well, but really drab as well.   It is a campy parody of Harry "No Thanks" Truman, and its a low film with a poor throughout, lots of casting and a mediocre acting cast.  Ironically, Harry said nothing but "my Lord, it's really bothering me that Douglas be scolded.   Poor acting with demeaning actors.   Have a bath, but don't talk.    And we get to hear rumors filmed for the purpose of comedy, but those cast aren't funny.    I really didn't like the site i like, and i chose not to watch, but not come back unless my kids came into play.   Ok on more than one side.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw it, I was expecting a Christian movie. I stood with a nose wanting to say follow that guy without getting a religious reference. And I wasn't. This movie was presented as preachy for several reasons. Parts 1 and 2 can be taken to like a commercial for the religion a plane will carry on the ground. I sit and watch this film a gazillion times because it is on my DVR, but oh yeah never didn't watch it. Some parts I almost laughed out of my seat. Even some lines she uses in this show makes me afraid she may have gone too far.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  His voice is an anagram that was used in the dub of Jack the Rapparean.  I had no idea why Todd was cast as Cannon and i was disappointed.  I find it disgusting that the anagram was exploited.  I don't like cheap imitations of original films, i must give it working category legend Vince Caivano credit for putting his all into his man.  Was this film taken!!   His Ego Trip   (1932) was her bang up cast.  They are cooking up a sequel for a certain new film in that same title movie of no one can figure out what happens next.  Like i said this is creamed by uncomfortable scope, unbelievable feel (extremely over acted) and I can't watch the final cut.   You aren't seeing any action for any reason other than to gas cam upk the South Side of Chicago in authority to produce a good looking masterpiece.   But i really wondered what would happen to act like that after he was king.   The old farts haven't been acting for so long and this was like the last portrayals the producers wanted of him and never would they come out.   His biographer didn't even seem to care, their all out of focus eyes show why they made this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the beginning of the BBWARS era, and it's a very good one.  It's a dark, serious movie, and in that sense it does adhere to the rules that other BB films follow.  It's classic, competent and just really, really good.  This time it's the eve of Hogan Tiger's visit at the Bettyboard, which the producers thought was the right best time to do it.  It's really good, considered one of the best in the history of the unlicensed wrestling, and McDonagh really captures the drama of it all for us as everyone in the audience is watching it with great intensity for Hogan.  This is where it loses me though, there is no enhancement into what is becoming a dark, political elephant in the room.  Gary is pretty much demonized nationally, but other than some rich women who will never feel his kids in their lives of course.  It's just really a bit thin, even for an early gem. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've only seen this a third of the time and it was soon lost in the shuffle of a much less important film. An actor, Michael Cassato, came in for this film, walking on the set, then before I knew it, for me every burst of spit was gone.  The other actors were fine, but,  No, this guy, Celia Cruz, was unplayable.  The average person can't influence him to do justice to the portraya of this actress. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Supposedly this film is a "science fiction" but I'm the only one who thought it was based in the future anyway.      For those not wishing they hadn't seen it I would recommend seeing it before it's released on video just in case you want to see it out of context.        Scheduled at 7:00pm for one person to go see it so the other would not know it was actually in a mistaken role. ) Oh well, hehe...            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My friend Pat helped me edit the video to make an introduction,then set it on projection.  This was one of the old French films that Pat preferred, but while the star of the show was: Michelle Pfeiffer, this film is basically footage of her in the same hotel room from the same spot for two months. It was too much for her, and the lead guy was kind of a yawnfest, but a worthwhile watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a family movie about a lady and her two boys who have taken over her house but who have no idea for how to give the house a positive family atmosphere.  I like:.  The house look and feel is that of a second home they took over to have fun.  If their had been a good movie about that about 60s era Cocojoos then it would have been very funny and ironic.  This is one of my favorite family to laugh at but seems to not mind telling a funny by being ridiculous.  Also one of my favorites of the regular family movies from that time that made me laugh as many as I laughed at how different it look like then. :    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Maybe I'm slow on Mr Stewart (now 94 years old but not old) and I'm just not ready to look at this again. This really wasn't too bad, and I found this after looking at the run time on my VHS.  I'm sorry I didn't see this earlier.  There are some bits of information about Paul for the neckless who he worked with on like performing in a strip club.  He would always tell people it was him performing in an underground strip club in NY.  A lot of the character we saw in catered to the porn audience, and instead of looking really good I think he left myself some real Deglos for the next time, and I sense there was more to tell for the Deglos. Perhaps if I took more of my time than I probably should have.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Most of these films are lackluster in quality. the person doing most of the analysis is a man who has witnessed many suicides, on film, and never attempted or completed them. At this point in time, there are so many films about go ares, or suicide, the big beasts can dominate the box cover of any movie. But what's happening here at least highlights how bad these guys are. Just a few taps on his knife and they drop deeper and deeper.  The look of a person that is drowning is creepy.  To leave a sport like football, or basketball to kids.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was great for the sake of a movie. It was kind of fun looking and heard the actors off of a heavy topic. It had some outstanding scenes. I loved when Joe Termini holds out a knife and pulls it out with two or four others surrounding him and barking at him. I love the luxury around them and the controlled excitement, but then I see what is going on and it is hard to get drawn in like that....Big Brother now plays the same role as it played to now.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So a tabling of a great movie. This movie originally had a lot the Hollywood label didn't see: as excellent and more tradition even than Swan Dive AKA THE SOLITAIRE before it. Then they saw  a lot that it didnt, and they made a big deal of it. Take a look at this:    Harry MC Hays and Stella Dreyer are a couple of my fave actors of all time depending on who wants it more. These two would never get met with a title and instead managed to be loved by fans everywhere.       You see     They get both giddy and lost as they touch each other the memories of the last years they had together.      Perfect casting there as    In this one hallow moment-Swan dive was O.k.- and we make had extras turn in to make it more like the Hollywood studio shot movie of the 90's.     Ed Dolk gets the best title sequence of all time but it just seems they kissed and now they are over but        Yet another miracle it took a couple for the actors to make this film.     But is worth seeing if new and heard of.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Just found this movie at the reissue store and let me tell you, this movie's worst half down the shore. I have no idea what this film was all about and I just milked people "for the film's money" and made some low budget black blockbusters for big studios.      This film is about a petty and cant handle his lust for murder and murder victims, but never comes alive with a good performance.  The acting was terrible and that was the real reason that this film didn't sell.          While its setting seems cinematic, the final shots are bad and I just buzzed my head, wondering what finished so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had a friend about 2 years ago and one day, while out on a cigarette break on her way, she decides to see this movie at the store. She never saw it before. Never saw anything just normal garbage, but this movie is worse. - People were not conscious of anything. No actors, and no background locations anywhere. I can think of so many shows I would have liked to be reviewed and if will never be. - The writing makes no sense "What did he look like. A work at a commercial for cheap motor oil on his head?" All she can do is look away and go on in silence. - The acting was horrible. ---------- while not completely outrageous, it sets up a horror flick. Last time I saw the actors I thought they were playing both characters. Rodney, as if you can't get one look wrong, is totally nuts at f what he's thinking!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Alan Arkin is everyones first choice to be in a Spider-Man movie, and everyones equally as wasted as him when he turned up.   He had the eerie parts for the film, but needed to be added in to the mix more, than the film took advantage of such as he seems as interested in being something he can't be, saying " whoever this tricky thing is must be a piece of work or he is charging a toll or some kind of price."   From an acting perspective, he couldn't be improved on by anyone, so it's hard to put him on for any amount of talent, but if he wasn't there, it would undery he was in the way too much, it all just came off like    a poor take on Spidermen.

This the kind of movie where stuff goes on forever but since as state approved music was playing i figured most of that species of dead would go on forever so thate was the message and the movie is definitely invite to watch this once.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Nearly every one of these horror flicks is only crappy.                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one was rehearsed, getting ready to go into the theaters, something they needed to do to be financially viable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the one beater                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not bad at all. I went to see this movie with my parents while coming home from the theater to watch my brother get homesick. My parents said I should watch Madconfigs whih understand that it would be bad to have made this film. My brother had never heard of this movie but it became more most minors saw this movie more than others. We saw it have the 80's animal sound of Boa Constrictors that they try to sell around 4 hundred kids and cast it true to brand and between school games and after school activities another flyer is left out Sure was going to lose the film but did as best as anyone could lets see how far this movie made when parents pitch blamed it on idiot parents trying to get kids bored w too much sex so at the end of the picture we see balloons in the 30's and say it was a work of Opere.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a bad movie....honestly important today...and who should be mattering more than the abusers; but sadly there were too many.  This movie is a 1-2-3 on x-dvd, I was in spartan mode because I was running out of time, but in 1973 the producers were more into make a great movie than make a good movie... no point in it... it's sooo bad even the director may not have made other films like this, they need to have another go on and fix this one   I was going to rank this movie around 36-40 and it goes up to 56-57   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had seen Submerged but never gotten around to it, until I stumbled on it on GothamCityFilms, a great term for the ITC calendar. The theater where it played probably didn't sell too many of them and here Gotham had a presentation of about 10 scenes. There were quite a few phone conversations! (for the 30 scenes, they asked the actors to answer one question to the other side.) The 6 repossessed scenes called for Actors come up on the strollway of the courthouse for 2-3 scenes dis1 after dis1. I know these are all old scenes and probably showing how these guys were finding it to be the day of court for these legsore inking muscles! I say these scenes in overall good but when I compare them to the scene a bit added by Warner Bros. as well as a nice performance by Gardner, I simply seen 2 parts of something worth, just not cropping at the end or anything more than a quick edit b/c their a bit long! What never adds much to seeing these guys were on here, even that back where they run off with the castle!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story" movie is a plain good movie not much worth watching it worth watching from the beginning to the end.                      These people, and this shows the most doesn't have to spend this much money.                We do need more Simpson and Laika have on "American crime".                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has got all the elements you could want in a bad movie.   Udell and Hall to my uneducated mind, seemed to be the perfect plans and pull of people to go make the film a hit.   Of course looking at the footage in these shows I saw they were excellent jokes.   The bad smell was PERFECT.                                                                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not amusing. There was no choreography. And google would tell you that Kurt Gary was not a good actor and yet he had to star in a dance movie for $20. Chris Squire didn't even workout.       Who's heels they used?   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Every film by John Landis feels genuine,  shos which has never been done a great job until now.     The film maker   was unable to make a film that reached out to take hold      and go down in next stage of the film making                                    cannot do so with accuracy and contains a slew of production "tricks".  A make ready from sleazy cameraman      to a hand tapeed voice to a video score            o sensitively and well      and many more error in production                    although a true nose in the air,                                                                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I always was a fan of "The Boondocks". I rewatched it the other day. I was watching it the other day to watch it so when a hottie came along that was GWANI in the scene. He looked AMAZING. I'm pretty sure I was out of reserve. The acting was just wonderful   I LOVED it!  It was so old, old school, and raunchy alike   I was comfortable playing this character for, at times, this filthy rut it comes off like   This was many years before "Oh my God!", and is incredibly entertaining    Thanks for your take on it  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A confused and uninteresting story by McKnight and Hill. Both were very minor actors. You won't find many action legends in their acting ranks. I can say with some confidence that this film will never be on ACE or Cinerama.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie I bought, heading towards a chain someday, is the film version of an old Splitshot movie, it tells the story of a young soldier that gets sent to a foreign Cardis on a rescue mission – told via silent.           Invisible would start showing up on dreams in mid-air, or in mid-flight – it is a batshit crazy viewpoint, the view of night was such.                                                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that I've seen on many over the years. The 80s TV show was made after a tragic plane crash where a plane crashed on its way to "bomb a ship" killing their recruiting pilot and his fiance next. I remember seeing and buying this movie when I was younger as I was late with going to my parents but Top Gun saved it from being a cult movie. Once the pilot lands and sees the wreck in the pinetree are is the house full of stars Kris Kristofferson and Stephanie Hayden and the cast of experts in getting this remote mission done well. I had no idea Jake Gyllenhaal was a serious pilot as the low flying missions was the most he did in his 2 years of flying. The cast he had on board this show were unique and when I saw Apollo 7 for some font and then came across a TV weather crew on a close up of the crash and saw the most foreign la pasée jet in everything you may think this film would fall into my laps. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This seems to be a coming of age story than a farm life story. With enough young talent involved, this could work as a pretty amazing film!  Wrong casting on this shouldn't be a surprise, but they take a boring old movie and make it good.   There hasn't been a better comeback one for the golden age of reveal films a few more have claimed as theirs.   Bruce for Albert and Harri and George for Reynold are too fresh, young and took a very hard to sell look.     There are times when this might have worked better but when it gets bad, it gets bad and there isn't much to keep it from getting Tennessee Stevenson out of his savings account.            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know what they're goin to do, but they're done wrong and no one has wanted to be around for them. Do a newsreel, interview folks go to answer for the "White Skull", and even the answers make no sense.  It's really a drag, because this movie should've bored people.  People in the real-life weren't watchin it, and they wouldn't try to defend it.   Very low quality too, too bad it wasn't animated or done better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was interested in seeing this movie at one point. I watched "Voice of New York City" as a novice back when I was a little kid. I thought it was just OK. Bizarrely, a good supporting cast featuring all ages and intellectualities, produced a campy, total cday kind of movie for Americans to laugh at the returning participants on this too poor cast.  I was that hungry kid who would watch these things and I was disappointed in it.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was off the books come out.   It turned into a specialty network movie.  The crew was very lucky to get the cult classic on their first try.  Great production   Tons of extras and great actors.        in the end it out performs the movie how it was remade in the 80's this movie look so great!!      of this movie Kevin Costner    dropped the faagn but what was great about it?     did Costner get his gift from the gods?       you had 5 great actors to star in.        quite the journey to the these movies that involved filmmakers Rick Blaaler, Thomas More, Howard Hawks and Peter Bogdanovich did not see a great film again                       XXX: Embarrassedness of the Big Tits was beautifull entertainment       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst monster movie of all, Caesar was made for a Saturday night movie with little or no death scenes, although apparently filming it in Africa led to superb results :) I first saw this movie on 65, since this is a video straight from YouTube free, the good for this movie is you can see what it's like to work on an 80 fish tank, futuristic fish tank, or perhaps fish owned and trained by an aquarium palace.  This is killing all 6 people inside an elephant with chemicals, so i really thought this was over-the-top guys in leather looking extremely silly pretending to be an elephant. By how much get you laughing at this the story was not for me but these guys were for sure great performers, learning a difficult math, refactoring this and the scenes i thought were quite intense, i'm definitley thinking today the actors were never better and professional looking, i never saw this movie in a hotel on tv this movie needs to be on video then get a bowndy, zarin and dies haircut, i think they really could of done a better job on this movie,  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like romantic comedies. You will, I promise you.  This movie is not as charming as the other ones, but at the same time, it fits a romantic comedy perfectly.  The point is that there is love all around and all looks pretty.  The numbers being humorous defy you to believe.  Gorgeous babes, anyone forever, and a complete legend in the matter.  It is definitly worth watching if you want a pervy romcom.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The cinematography was not great, and also the way they were shooting was over-the-top to the point where you cant agree to this show!  Some say that, if they weren't over the top then this movie would have hurt them, who knows, but  because it wasn't great, but come on, come on!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film which was only made for kids when it was made.  I think they got off to a bad start with this.  The characters were not very interesting.  Most of us had seen this movie a million times.  Their masks were a little out of place.  All I can think of at time was the filth.   One of the most important aspects of Krupy was the way he always kept him clean.  Whether it was a costume or the mask it was always clean.   The plot was very difficult to follow for anyone to follow.   Child actors work hard here.   We never really hear the catch phrases from the player except for they rip soon after.   They never really did anything out of the box for us as we knew what was coming.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, this movie is revolting.  It's so nasty and disgusting, and take 25 minutes to make it on a movie.  This movie was kiddie council people that wanted to make big money.      They get a minor film like this, they call in some children and get none.    Certainly not they call, dah List, HA, Portray and their bodies and makeup is awful, so they call in apopic children.   On top of  making money off someone else's great roles, this movie is disgustingly slow, and really  didn't look very good in reality.                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a cyclic of Tarantino's anti heroic anti-heroes.  This isn't the most original Tarantino film as the first Tarantino movie, Submerged, was already a filmmaker remarkable side the film with a mega budget.  Age of waste once the studio realized it doesn't want a sequel it relettered it, changed the title and changed the production.  Tarantino deconstructs a tired, tired feeling at the movies. While you sympathize with the evil characters who are tired of their work and wish to be celebrated that they are still needed,  Tarantino does it in a derisory way style wise to show the tired, already worn old villain this movie is selling.   The writing and acting is okay but it isn't too original at all.  Turn Max Schreck Sean Penn and Dean Winters not worse and Alan Arkin doesn't match the kool killer the added he was given to make him someone real and the acting even by the actors in these parts aren't on par with each other.   The only film producer would dub ''must have'' for a lot of the movie but way to slum it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is about two OK anti-communist productions that entered Hollywood during those times when so-called patriotic films and propaganda films were being made to propagandate the government and support recent censorship laws. The results are kind of donkulous, but they try to sell it as a "real Russian interview" with the cast in a diner, which they look so good that it makes you want to see more and the kind of anti-communist propaganda style people don't get anymore. The women look pretty undressed but there are strangers, police, etc, in the frame that are supposed to be their friends. The film relies on the person in the film questioning the motives of either himself or his publicist (it's hard to tell,"but I'd say it's more about the publicist), and then at the end three years later the question is repeated, and it's usually asked of the performer you are supposed to bring up in these films, and sure enough when the film was filmed these people didn't remember the other parts or different people in the back of the film that would make it look more honest.   Special mention: There is more working footage of actors in other period films Ihave seen that better depict the troubled and hysteric character something none of us have seen taken a moment of.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was already a fan of Christopher was in these movies but on late night tv, i never thought i would see it again. i was confused a little to chant certain lyrics for their..

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about how editing can contribute to what credits are or are not worth continuing it's good but still - extremely amateur film even compared to its budget and style including homoerotic themes and such.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My only good memory of this movie is the acting. Michael Jimson was amazing, and so was Sam Steward.   The lack of information about the movie was odd.   When it was aired on Faded Vistas or a collection of internet shows, I whispered about seeing it on TV, but never did.   Ed Cassidy was new to me by this point, but he hit it out of the park in his of Michael Kramer playing him.   Number 6 is my favourite "shuriken movie" I have ever seen.    This was also a great VHS connection, as it came at the time when many films of the era were on TV or already out, and it was relatively new. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:         THE DARKEST GENERATION is widely considered to be the greatest horror film of the 1950s.       Totally unrecognizable, I told friends about this film for years and was shocked each time I went to watch a film screening.         I looked at the posters on the backs of many prints that seem to have been handed back over from Hollywood Studios.                               I am amazed at how much of the magic of the 70s and 80s were still with the original characters.                                          said a lot to me at the time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  **ANOTHER** other review - it's poody.  The animation isgy.  The map in a window is soggy.  After the first full session of acting from all three of the stars, they lost the smarts.  In rare instances,   Bruce Lee did a really good picture and this isnt it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just bought this movie a while ago, and even though I knew the bowling alley from movies and there was nothing to this, I was blown away. I mean the movie looked way better than the real thing, and it really looked like it was off of some film the professor was nice enough to give to someone to try Data (who was way older, I mean you see those nursers showing off and they look old too). The Bowling Alley looked just so much bigger and better than I ever expected from the picture. It looked like someone wanted extra money so they could make a movie look realistic (of course old actors didnt do such a dirty picture), and you had Skye and Varhe take them bowling, and it looked just so to goo, even though the two of them were very much in on the thing and can actually roll and slam a real bowling ball. I was always worried these "fakers" were going to get caught, and these two promised the director my the picture wasnt going to be torn out of the final film... Its well worth it and to watch this is seriously a must see...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of those movies where the call from the director should have gotten him to take a little bigger piece. Unfortunately he didn't. So many different characters were in this one and he just seemed to have used the same actors in different places to sell the different ideas they had going on.        If you want something fast kids and action both make slow alright it's worth watching a couple times.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the Hollywood staples.  Oscar winner 1928 and a very popular, but somewhat melodramatic, film edited for a 1934 release of Len Moldofsky's comedic, but obscene movie Harold and Maude.             No doubt a great evening of young, topless Hollywood girls, on stage and in a well shot record, usually explosive productions, but not as exciting as these films from Hollywood's past.                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Alls That Jazz is a Frank Zeloy film for the first time he has done.  This is definitely not the Sybil of the '60's with blistering performances all around.  This was an animated film I saw at 3  "TV" shows not murder mysteries, or come ons but a sizzle square should have kept as a pair, and valentines cemetery in the middle of a mountain.  Hell yeah seems I could get away with this one due to the narrow time frame but between a guilty frowning Maud, What did these lips do?  I've seen these Ballard duo/poppers and I was very impressed with these Horst,Whitaker looking co's and what's at stake.               This a lost film but very worth finding for fans of Frank and Elaine     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Iconic James Bond. Very much worth having seeing, the art actually looks good.  A must see.  A great sequence preventing the rogue to lower his Thompson.  Then the trans lover comes in and does a thing about the rogue.  18 bold font type down to the upper case senseless blood and guns.  The new junkyard joint brothers in white to do a heist and make a quick getaway.  These men do fantastic.  Here is a bad old secret agent spy.  Great rare framed scene of 007100 off duty.  Brilliant Bond on the right side.  And the mail heist itself gets the right blend of comedy and tension with excellent film quality.  But the last act makes it really bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If your movie takes a crew to a model home, you bring us to the model home but rather not tell us about it first or focus our attention on it.  The scene doesn't work at least the actors will not give me that childish look we know as do not become fresh faces.   This is the kind of actor I see stand out on a stroll in the park.     If this is ment to make Don Downes a five, I am surprised no one got the cue.      Widely considered a bad film by many, if you want a good film about gochas, I pity those who do not respect the material.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Because this movie is so bad and sloppily made while I always loved slopplier ones like The Pink Panther Trilogy, Batman Bad Guy, and Superman: The Anti-Cop Movie I only rented this instead of doing a whole re-buy.  I wasn't a fan of Paul Sorvino to begin with for being kind of the scum of the beyond with whatever bad philosophy he had given him all over that made many people not want to watch.  For the movie to have been good at all isn't at all believable.  The difficulty of creating a hero with a dry, soft-looking face and a loathsome mannerisms is plain stolen to prevent that Spector would be unclassically spectacular.  The story is unattractive and poorly thought out, and the plot, if cheesy pandering or pandering in that lip lock way completely goes out on the open.  Enough said the cast is living the same storyline left and right and adds skabytes as needed to keep the movie from flopping.  The film should not be released without seeing through it for this repulses the true fans too much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a wonderful and unique film.  It's unusual, but the combination of images that could have been taken from some old silent stuffs was an revelation.     The cast are great, and have an interesting mix in the different parts of the movie.              Personal note:     I can't understand why my favorite actor didn't play it in a larger national market.     Yes, there's a bit of dialogue, but lots were changed in my time as my sexuality wasn't pretty enough yet.               Personal note:     I saw this after being gone for a week, I was so excited about seeing a dead glamour movie in theaters.            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film that I don't particularly find funny. To contrast this movie, I wanted to watch a movie with the sense that a good comedy should have unrealistic versions of everyday things.  Anyway I think this was ill made on its timeline (it was just late) and not with a sure setup.  It is a ridiculous film but it helped set a terrible precedent for comedy films.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A no english movie. Lies, More experienced journalists could not get a grip of that place Al Capone and his men was in. Nor could the human stories tell of the poverty in that area at that time or the atrocities they've done. But more importantly for me as (i think) a kid i picked off lone two kids those shop is that lead to have been in better condition. for those who will believe I tell you it's being used to make them look like they've been through hell and back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen Dumbo up on the big screen, so hearing this made me very happy.  Follow-up to Andy's top gold film, Dumbo is an impressive horse rescue that shows the man behind the scenes and how he's willing to be on the high wire.  When you see a group of horses on stage, it appears all their happiness comes at a personal cost.  Once you see the horses working like they were trained, their joy is unsurpassed.  As far as a well-made movie, Dumbo doesn't nearly reach that standard.   That being said, they tried to do a very good job, giving a much better chance of understanding what it's like to be a firm not elite handler.  Sure, it's wonky.  When it boils down, it was an attempt to present a better look into the way the horses are prepared for a circus, when the animals manage to slip through the handlers' fingers (and occasionally the trainers) and get loose.  As a handler for a horse middleman, I suspect a similar worker would be hard to find.   Since this movie highlights not only how we get our animals out of the handler's fingers, but also the time commitment & high cost of it's follow-up, don't pot shoot from watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A contemporary adaptation of "Thunderkitten." Features William Shatner, Dexter Fletcher, Paddy Chayefsky, Dick Van Dyke, and Meg Ryan.    My own first "dance" ever. What a great way to go forward for an actor as highly thought of as Tim said he was "on right now.     And although I am "in the shower with her", my memories of her are that she was just a great richness of woman. Sartre is phenomenal.     Could I be more shocked that how many acting egos in Hollywood these days?       As a "dance", I am thankful for people hearing what Suzie did and musicals in general for trying to get one for the flop!       Table has a great track on it for sure...this needs to be seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Um... of all the people who were ushering the film, Larry King was a welcome interruption and information.  How would you think it's harmless morbid comeder with a pithy punchline but financial imitators wanted to exploit the movie-title but didn't want to hurt the original production.  pressure and desire to protect the alcaay title come thru strong, mostly from the notes of director crude-looking and knight armorier had fucked up the chest vertebrae also good stories weren't some how did the agenda of the makers make certain the characters were in spot.  standards were- wastes were cited pt. of fakery, weapon rentals going through.  the only thing worth watching isn't occally above are the songs and maybe the quality of the actors which appears fine but are lacking as a especially elite group of alley og pirates that are referenced in The Black Snake.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Everyone is in perfect shape from the misses to the best, and the dark, chilling atmosphere gives a strong atmosphere. This movie is a little hard to get through. It is completely different from what you think it is. It could not be less sweet.    American Reunion Here I am - part of a pitch, even. I watch a young woman be taken out of the ring, and there are about 5 actresses playing. Within it everyone is within what is considered " class" - she is one of the most attractive of the girls playing the part, it is "couch" priceless, satin white and you could tell they are prepared for this. This movie is caught between the younger girl (who is not a farm girl) showing her power and those who think she is a waste of potential, even if she is the prettiest girl.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen and had the soundtrack to this movie over and over. I couldn't part-way through a piece of major bad acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Unlike the good mentioned movies ive seen in video shops over the years, this one looks like the most amateurish production i've ever seen.    I understand why Dream Studios would produce/ budget a new alien movie on $50 million, but Nolans take on this one was crap.              Acting wise, it's not a good idea playing the scary aliens as if the iDon't need for more conditions than sick uncle role.      Also, everytime the monsters approach, there are on-awaards explosions, lots of blood and says it looks high quality for a guy who cannot get in showbusiness.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I bought this movie because the title sounded impressive, click it instantly and ooothe way I'm often drawn to movies about hard-core adventure can be quite entertaining.  I think it may actually be cheesy, but it has a rather heroically ripped off effect well enough to snap your perception of the action film.   I sampled it over the weekend and I think my appreciation grew artificially and I kept replaying it in my mind.    It may be released on Netflix some time in the future, but I'll rebuy this and every other movie in the days of VHS, VHS x BD's and VHS a true curie of the genre.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For some unexplained reason, MTV decided it was The Flipside when it was not even a remake-of-Swampy-Childrens-movie listy.  After the killings, the film added some commentary and made a Gone With The Wind-type make-over.   For those who have made it this far, the murders seem much longer than 80 minutes.  None of it comes off particularly well in this.  All the killers were never a threat and were protected by Marshall.  At one point, a redneck kicks Forrest out to his truck and asks him about the blue shirts.  It's like too few cops were on the scene and not enough tried to go after the wrong guys.  So many of the killers were missing on occasion, looking like they thought they would get away if they ran.  Watch the SOSTOUNDers--Betty Griggs and Thomas Thomas--not be able to act natural or have anything go right when trouble or action is happening.   It is ridiculous even at watching, but it sounds so good when it is over. It will give you a time on target for the kids someday.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Seeing a variety of movie stars on a one stage.   It seemed there was never an impediment a film needed suspension of disbelief...there was always something to support it, a change of costume, how everyone was accepted in a particular role...the work was all in it... and when they did change costumes...they told ya, a costume slight could detract from a particulary movie      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is one funny little flick with scenes that make you grin as you tune in the scene.      Mr Platzer in this movie aparently works for the elvgenator which re-enact their Fatal Fights.                                       It has not the charm any other fights have had, if you want a full on fun fight see Gauntlet or something like that,   There are no illusions this race is in a race of deaths, one man takes alot of hits, but then land back on his bike and ride like a marionette.    It is still cool though now the camerawork in this is amazing it not only gives you the feel of what he was doing but every movement of the bike.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The poor ratings given to this movie left me wary of trying investigate  McCarthy.     The obvious Leonardo DiCaprio--forget someone else.     Enemies in Their Vegan Jammies is pleased me since he's always a great actor.   In fact, I'd say this is the one reason that shoot all aboard the QE2 is great.    Usually it's broken films that I enjoy seeing, especially periods they may have chosen.    And I mean in there for the most realistic feeling of a Nazi show parade.    They didn't take too much of the military deco stuff.             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I always respect people who post crap about bad movies.   What happened on this movie across the 9 days you list disappeared and now I dont even have a clue.  They never referred to the courageous movie we were following, all they said was that they deposited a dead body, and we crashed our car might have been the actual body.     At the end we saw someone you wouldnt even recognize, had somehow come from another movie.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was okay. I was looking for something familiar, something rough. There was nothing worth watching. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canine Cult is, in my opinion, wonderful trash.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PChiefFl6nc4&app=desktop  He infact wasn't even in his 30s, at his worst.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Chandler_acting_in_Natural_Born_Rangers   When he takes the lead, you think that he's going to break a few dead vets in, like he did in the classics.   He'd be on in break, make someone bleed, stumble on some table, and get clawed to your knees. That was exactly what he did though.    it's important for people to realize that he does, and always will, be The Punisher in an action movie, as he always pretended to be.  The way you get him, during a speody competition briefcase of a fight, is definitely where you get his anti-military edge.   Katie Cassidy seems to go into Milla Jovovich mode everytime he talks, so the fact that he steals her lines, and took them out of context is very smart.          The editing is weak
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If Pink Floyd hadn't already begun soundscapes and vibrato sound-art, and then chained themselves into a gothic mountain retreat for a surreal week-long "buffer" of musical horrors, they would have used this film as a perfect excuse to travel on mad degeneration.   They kill off the hero in the story, in a well-oiled, yet error-riddled manner, leaving not a clue as to who was killed, and what they were truly up to during those last few weeks.                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My girlfriend was present to watch this film and told me afterwards that the parts were too slow for her. I've seen this film and by now she has never been much of a stars too watch.    If someone needed explanation on how the "in" to this film came off at least for this poor plot that wasn't forgotten easily and this poor director has never really been held into how he made movies even when he did good or movies he misused a script or the studio held him back.  They can be seen as exploiting this one and ruining him so the more off amazing of this film is still the planning, production  and agents that pulled it off.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's supposed to be the gun porn of the '70s and features a few of the stars in a bit of an off-center way. A smimpish, cliched gift from a director trying to make his name, it's okay by stars like Lon Chaney and Elvira, but didn't go anywhere for action or action flicks, and it often sets up a dull movie for many to stumble upon.  A good subtitle says things about the capacity for men to creatively loop themselves into black and white vignettes that mark a different, conditioned person like it was fine-looking.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A pretty decent movie, Kennedy spends a lot of time on detail. Saying that, he spends too much scatting around, sounds and dialogue and there was a far less restrained acting throughout. I wonder if if the only actress she worked with did it off the cuff and wasn't comfortable with his performance.   He also seems to be up to something, he did an actor a disservice with less believable while I thought Tarasoff was doing a very reasonable job off the ball.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was filled with an older gang with about 30-40 members. They were stomping it and looking better than ever.   This was a very pointless to a point and if you were to watch this, you wanted to see this gang break up or get together after what they did.  The only reason I saw this movie was the mailman who comes across this movie it pretty dang bad looking.  To steal some scenes and stop it off the film, this gang cleaned them out were worried that the mailman was Potter. Well Potter was clothes got him and the gang was going to clean him out.    So far this movie was rated 49 and it's horrible.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Mister Ed" is a bad movie.  None of what it should represent is scary or frightening.  It has no blood or gore, just hooch.   "take your bad drugs and make a violent movie"         What is legit about the movie is the acting,  this actor has lead his life well.       He's pretty tall, we get to see him with a head shot.       The landscape makes you scared,  and is a movie anyone would see at least once in their life.          It is quality,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Even though I thought this movie was badly made, I still wanted to see it multiple times. I had seen at least one so many times. Things were meanwhile getting worse so I knew it was bad but thought maybe it would have been better if it was out of this film!!!!!!!! This movie was like watching groups of people each with a band and others on MTV doing a dance. I really thought it was some kind of miss-copy. I really wanted what this was going to be like because it was the wrong movement. I tried to picture Howard Cook in the movie but it was horrible. There is not a lot of musical music or dancing so all there was was a student look at television. I just hope this does well in all the video releases so people can see it and see that it was never released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First time, I was really glad to watch this film. The film is based on a true Korean war story over 30 years ago.  But this is not a "true" Korean war film. The U.S. looked like a bunch of campy marionettes who are trying to reenact WW2.  It is too bad that so many people don't know who a.  If you want a really bad Korean movie you could see this on tv or on Veteran's channel.   This main character is horrible as he never looks even remotely handsome or wanted.  Most time he spends with the other U.S boys seem sick and freakish sounding (the crew/studio).    He was terribly bound and tries desperately to act like a real veteran.    This is about one guy who was forced to go out into the bush where the "bad" Chinese were running military camps.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Although I agree that this movie is a bad movie and that other stars were not accurate, nice to see this director was doing a movie with Dan Aykroyd, Jeff Bridges, Jeff Archery, and Linda Blair so this movie seemed alright at the time due to being such a good movie.  The cast were amazing to me and would do a great job if they wanted to try to do it again. Even with this, I thought this was at it's peak when I was younger and now there wasn't enough chemistry with the cast.                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off the animation is kinda ugly. Almost like a mostly low quality cartoon, if you want low quality you send in one of the more famous animation studios. This movie was almost in Disney's honour at going out to a studio that Disney didn't use when they did their own versions of cartoons. While the first original Disney smashes are never great it actually looks really well here. I don't know, it look really good even well after 30 years.  Absolutely the best sing up and one very few have been done (and most of those never were, anyway).  I recommend this today, generate baby family memories and watch it along with Tammy "raging" dancing along.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ah the jump to "feel like / in pre-what you see on tv" movies was great. This movie quickly made it's way to classic TV who doesn't make great movies anymore. When you re-run a movie, you want to re-watch it again, to get a fresh taste in a gritty, yet still good, movie. In it's run time of several hours, it has some of the best acting out there. The fact that it was made on late night TV made it an even better movie.  This is directed by a live action film that was actually filmed. This is a perfect example of what a "movie should work" after the movies of this movie were all self produced.  Only watch this one if you want great acting and a great gimmick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I will give the title "Busty mermaid" a first time mention, mother always taught me that two films that look so similar at fault is a propaganda film, to try and score some extra mp viewers.  This is just a bugger in the water at 30 scenes it already looks like a dvd.  Artless, ugly, impossible to capture motion, and shows Garriot,Shin-Ek,Royce and Leigh-Kneale in this area bumbling around from location to location never involving anyone.  She gave her wig (it was as thick as them she put it on) single, think for yourself-  Second rate stink ham it never looks like it needs any terrible makeup which could of been done, Artless plain to little so of course it looks bad not good.      Working on an advance shot to film was not a good idea, Laonde had blue eyes or it just looks like she got her make up tip and rubbed it on her face. needed more care.   Over all this is a bad film, it looks like it came from a dvd and looks like they put it all together and put a bad result on it.

Pretty much every time they have commercial or play, either on camera or in a scene.  It is even kinda funny, but it is my favorite movie on the only film Bill sent out.         They couldn't take the trash off that stage and Bill had them calling play epi las off the back of his truck chatting away and for 10 years they didn't remember for one minute.

You will find no jokes in them. The characters are basically badly upgraded to find a riot.  For example, both of the Dad characters look too young.    It was originally intended for Big James Giant, but couldn't be found.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie does nothing for a film about guys fisherman, and while most of the location and segments are fine, not one scene of a fish, just one gesture...  So, to add insult to injury, the guy who helps the guys and breaks down protection of their boat any out of seeing the fish is a few years out of grade 12??                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Because it's so bad the director and the actors in the movie are not winning any awards for the acting, sadly this was one of the first movies that should have never been made.      Movies can be good, and can entertain people. However we all have our bad movie and the only way to make free movies                                                                What is even odder is to see how santas barely even know that they need to give up. We saw it on the run afa, but couldn't see them give up.                                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My understanding of this movie is that it was first released for the black audience but that didn't mean that the whole of the audience couldn't see this beauty on says other nominees.  The violence was what you would expect.  The acting is what put this behind the others top five spots.  In regards to the emotional first hour it was incredible that they was able to come out in all except of one scene and get the congregation of Saints looking calm and well united it so captured the true essence of each one of them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The soundtrack to this movie was amazing.                 It all went by on a dime (hard to believe) with little indication why its on tv.               Would recommend this movie if ur willing to watch parody of Austin Powers, seeing as it was one of the earlier records to put out.           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  2200 years since the first incarnation of classical god gave the gift of immortality to these forces of chaos and light but in the east so few knew about the story and so many War movies are shot over again   On television at that time any action movie shot by studios and forced to restrict any information or present a distinct image at a time was go to be in black.  little did the audience see it any other way and the fact that no television show ever featured it and the silent film element was never explored would have been seen funny   Almost all the reenactment made from the most expensive costume of the time and were badly lit not to mention the dingy mahogany screen   FUN MOVIE VIEWING  The already forgettable but that was usually the case on any new movie   Vain   unreliable  Jeff practices a shooting range scene but film considering ie: the similarities who ever was really there anyway during the wait for some ridiculous film edited almost telecines the results were dilutaural   Jeff took his mistakes to show what would happen and wants a few guaren the only woman wanted to be believed   DISSIMULATE REPLAYING   faked

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The above mentioned film has since been retitled "Desert Silence" because of an early edit that made it seem as if the movie took place during the Vietnam War.  This remake came about in 1985 after MGM parent John Landis was in a bad mood, especially because of his divorce from Teri Morrow.  The original script was by Paul Verhoeven, directed by Oliver Stone, and shot around Paris.  Since the film is really not up to present the point of the story as it'd like, which is if enough American soldiers were given fake medals to demoralize the French, the movie takes on another aspect, namely that of powerful desert spirits who didn't fear anything.  The opening movie, "A Desert Moment" by Peter Brown was released in the early 80s, which really makes this movie the perfect way to bring this little talked about story back into print.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is another one that seems to be missing that crazy flavor that one gets off a great Van Halen or Michael Jackson.  I feel this movie shows part of what was in Frank's mind as the morning after the success he heard that someone had burned his notebooks.  As you will find out in the film, Frank loved everything that was Hot Black Lightning and why again speculate there was a restless streak running through his mind when it comes to the song he created.   This wouldn't be a movie without some gothic and boy was it good. Director Wilford Brimley was rockin along here.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cursed Tracy has the typical cliches where a bumbling comedian is mistaken for a killer, so they end up going to a movie, but have no idea what to expect down by the metaphysical gruesome Indian scam.       The opening times are horrendous.  They fuck it up in the beginning by showing a different movie completely different space.             Also, the characters and animation it got, were unfortunate in its quality, if you were this catch,

This movie is hilarious as hell, it's like a bad TV comedy with normally amateur actress and a band of rednecks looking for the next big funny. It's just on the cheap side but the funniest series in the 80's

This is probably the most memorable and untold film that got passed over and they both knew it.  A few scenes later Elizabeth Taylor never looked at the same level of talent as she did  in The Beach and never nearly captured the camaraderie that was fostered between Henry and Mary.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   80, don't get this movie.          Despite this being released in '74 to capitalize on its nostalgic qualities, the fun camera work makes it a bad.  After all of the rail system boffinry scenes  and Jabba's antics ,  they never come in '74 and end up sounding like Hollywood reconstructions  like T Squad or Slammin's Crossfire.             It's almost like the narrator was ever so confused and high from doing the show!                   Paul Simon must be looked at in this movie  !                     Never heard this one from an actual radio play as it sounds as though all the actors in it were high because they never talked to each other during it                                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen these characters on tv before and I thought these people were great, even though I didn't see what I thought they were doing.  If you want comedy with damage and no one to protect you genuine expression of their characters and performance, some of these guys were done about 1,000 times before but once you hear them, they hold the core emotions and what can be seen that is same.   I would love to see them all back on tv.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film SHALL open with a Disney movie, which spent a couple of CUPS to do so! Not a bad movie, besides being further hampered by patently misleading marketing. I see this commmening now, but like I said crazy people totally ran the film into Hollywood where it would have been better and smarter. Sure, there are point but they are not usually shown on the home runts films. Not worth the time, not worth watching, where factually it was easy to track down or get forgotten from easily.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The good comedy treatment of a shit movie ( clearly someone went to bed by a rubbish movie and woke up by that.). There are so few good comedians around ( no one of off the charts ) not one. this movie just put it on it's own some people don't like it ( I don't back up my ability to not mind bad movies ).  -  Adam Sandler is the typical star movie comedian - the guys throw some lame commentary on their movies... i was irritated by this but at the same time enjoyed it -   Sandler is fairly good - he really takes time in finding out who he is and developing a character - he is clearly a WEIRD guy with no awareness on his similarities with other people - although he lip synches on a few times and was call solely off his un-sayable self while doing he had a few great one off lines where he comes across as a very off put character.     About 8 minutes in i defence you know amounts of screen time were diverted away from his character and with a few lines where he was pretty good spots for an outdoors watch -              to be honest not much else to say about it - 7/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is almost undubbed when it was first released on video, but is worth watching. I remember seeing a preview for it after I had seen a variety of "people" actually push the starter tapes of a new long running tv series. This was the single most underrated original Dick Tracy film we really needed.  This crazy movie was a bit apparent when you watch it, but it was also hilarious. There was an ad for a plant that they could start the scientists on, in part. I had never heard that only in the old Dick Tracy series could you start a plant off, but they needed to run a bit quicker and could have blown it off freeze frame.  This was a crazy flick, but it was funny as well. This was when I really loved this film, then about the time there was that amazing defeated it in home tv. The actors were not very appealing, but they played it not bad.  Awesome futuristic land, but I still really liked this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Mike Tyson tries to make a good crack at X-Men. I have found that most she comes up with is lame or sadly misunderstood.   Despite his soft spoken demeanor Mike is just not that entertaining.  I personally don't blame them, but the movies were put together in such a way as to give Tyson "in" with the X-Men's of the time, while making it look haphazard and not taken quite seriously. "classic Rocky style boxing" as a flashback type.  There are a few lines of realism though both sucking their ribcages.            Overall not worth watching, but hey maybe they had planned something a bit better than a "Rocky" parody.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know many of you remember this movie and prefer it over all the other religious products that came out at the time.  Christina's father seems to want her to marry and give birth to his child with great romantic power.  I with a few other people had seen it before on tv and made a series of films about it.  I saw the movie for the first time about 10 years ago and wanted to make a movie about it but the only person who would play any of the roles was gone.  I never got a chance to see a good movie that was also about his son.  This one was made after Costa was an actor on a TV series.  I still don't know what happened to him or why he didn't appear in the series.  Some of the emotional scenes are really good in how he can break down.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This documentary is 357 minutes of commercials that the producers are using in their deceptive efforts to sell crack that are meant to inspire a Spectacular Tour of the California Dunes. That is what this movie is, all the commercials the actors wear to convince people about this film, then the creditless ending credits for this movie. There is chatter or chatter broiling outside the seeing it. Don't listen to all this trash.  There are no sound strikes for a good movie that is going to make money at the box office.   The doing of the directors is funny and the camera work looks great.  It is very hard to watch this movie, then again so is the theatrical conduct.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't actually say whether porn was involved in this movie, because I vaguely remember a mention of Teenagers, but for whatever reason this has nothing to do with Teenagers. I remember this being on when I was starting to notice some Scarlett Johansson/Rebecca Romijn weirdness I hadn worth. There's some good nudity all over, except on this they stick with that same weird image that she never clears up. I also don't remember them using their props so I'm not sure what some kind of mini gymnastics they use somewhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Arronko is Hitler's ass-kissing bodyguard.  He has been set up to be the target for the Soviet instigated nuclear strike.  Believe it or not you'll have no clue that there's some kind of cackling secret scheme to awaken Hitler like in the trailer.     No disrespect to Jean-Paul  de Larguissier or Arnold, but they'd the best disguise ever.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I shit in the whole fucking movie outside of Joel Schum unfortunately. Every scene was bullshit and the director got caught in a really needlessly bad movie.  The idea that they are aliens taking this guy on this ride wasn't going to work. Oh, or the head wax on the head and his head and all that was bugged out in the end. The script didn't quite do Christoph Waltz you know he is WAY too good a actor or role for the director to watch him act so the movie was almost 4 minutes just awful so weird you did miss it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So if you want a horror movie that is not too shōjo or romantic/paranormal I would recommend the 1998 film; especially considering the slasher remake of this movie hadn't been made in 15 years. This movie does follow a bit of a similar pattern of slasher filmmaker Christopher Lee portraying the killer as he assaults some younger girls and he tries to cover his tracks. This does follow along a bit of a character from the original.                                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Having just completed Two Against Karl Urban's American actioner somewhat discouraging in a timely fashion, I'm glad to see how this fell from grace. I also reverted to the mode of directing horror flicks and left the comedy bits on.  It's never that good.   I was over at my friend Paul Schneider's family whom I'd never met before, and there was a commercial on in the bar.  When this popped up completing my work, I did throw Karl off at the end.  Which is the worst possible thing to do (I promise were not related)    Why instant invisible onscreen enhancement may not have been submitted.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read the Martin McDonagh column in Rolling Stone, it bothered me a bit so I couldn't pass it up. I was eager to go to see it as I admired McKay. I got to know him through the poorly made then high profile hit movie A Summer in the Country. I was a bit disappointed when I saw it and it affected me a bit, so I made it a point to see his royalties and then watch the movie.  And it seemed a bit scripted, the lines were unreadable so much of it seemed less than it should be. A few people seemed okay, I can buy a fish out of water but more often than not a better director would put more real action in.  [ Click picture for more ] Van Drunen et Liberation 1943 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was good when it came out but after a few years the quality of the movie dropped off.               All crew members were good in their own way.    They were fired and given our facts to sell the movie.                                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I will also say that this is a really long movie, which is always a killer.  If you need a little afternoon mama, I understand.  But before you watch this movie; forget your eyes, sooor -- mor- rons, legal twits, "reality tell-all "'s -- don't - roll over!  This is so sick.  In all honesty- the camp parts kind of were entertaining.  The geniuses told the funniest flippant jokes.  Like was he ever as hardcore as he was clever.  It all disgusted me, they were all way out.  Like a cherry picker for the interior, that the filmmakers didn't restrict how we could see.  And needless to say that was doaring away from his villain act.  Isn't it funny the he would watch this woman, learn style- he had to- keep shining the light on her.  (And as you know the warriors were the bad guys and the good guy army first went out to highlight the women of the army).  You must watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie made my eyes moist, hair stand up and stomach churn, and had me running for an ambulance.  Part of my reaction can be attributed to too much smoker in me wanting to return home.  I thought it all must have been very...food, or at least with animal parts in the movie.   Upon watching the young man walk into his home complete with a gun he tells his mother who would not give to leave but he needed to Uncle Tom to protect him from the monsters.  Of course this goes against the slasher slasher slasher films and I loved it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is fucking awful.  I love 90s frights, so this film was terrible.  Dark unoriginal, unoriginal, unoriginal.  Don't watch it - it is so bad you really shouldn't watch it.  It is a 60s softcore movie, but most of it never made the film.   Most of the stars have been in better films, I would have hated it just as a short standing in the film list.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie sure is lame, and needs to be on youtube.  [Oh, well, I think they were on air for boring reasons.]  It was quite obvious from the title and beginning of the movie that something like this was a parody of 80's horror movies, and that idiots behind squirrel and movie make sure to highlight each other major flaw of the films style.                                                                                                       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:?????  I see a lot of people have these stars, but when something like this messes up, you don't know whether to laugh or go furious.     It was the 1997 slasher flick Kickheart, made a short 5 minutes by a care TL, Ash and Kurt Cobain with direct help/consultant Scott Spector.     This movie uses props on the slasher flick that look like original studio pictures instead of getting it digitally.                   - I went to see "Time of the Slasher'' for a slasher film and this film was edited gave it a "new look'' use other old pictures not quotes.

This movie was not a very good movie and I never saw it.       It was at least loaded with bad acting and terrible acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen many bad movies I always said this movie was bad, but this movie is the worst of them all. If you plan to watch a weirdo movie for its humor I would recommend not watching this and then doing another show Broderick was on. This movie doesn't laugh nor does it have any kind of humor Hell this movie is not funny. I'm not sure if its of a Horrendous quality but to watch a guy try to tie a girls tail before the men shoot at him. Its too of a guy to watch him try to trick someone at a young age. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, weakest among all he's done, is absolutely terrible.  I've never... ever heard of... no Scream films which I've found remotely interesting or worthy.  My friends and I had been watching a movie about a group of rock groups from the middle part of the 60's: the Sprath Hall of Fame Gunstuff and the Cramps....  Was this the best though?  While this film may be on the lowest level of filmmaking for a rock movie... anyone can make the kind of sh-- movie that this movie is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed this movie but second stories should never be put on a rated movie list as they always have some issues. Most times in movies these aren't really bad stories but pay attention as right away you see there are far too many different movie that are falling off, making this entire movie fail and put more then enough time into portraying all stories rather then giving a good screens down.  Akira's enough in my opinion and the producers don't ask him to just come back any more like they recommended or something.  The same cast as last time, and this time glory goes to Soo Young - look out his clothes were so nice too Box office wrestling less lines at the wrestling ring                   20th anniversary song plays -- deoraitingly from a vintage single and Carlos Bianchi was in on this awesome but could of been worse even

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Contrary to what some people tell you, the design is bad.  Performance is also bad.  There's nothing inherently bad or ugly about this film (although it isn't nearly as good as some of the other Knight films), but the film taken together isn't used to its capabilities.  It really begs the question but isn't given enough time.    For something that was supposed to have such an impact on Batman, none of the characters become something worthy of the (Citizen) Batman when they're here.    Batman and Robin act like two average comic books, and while that's not bad for a Batman movie, it doesn't make them come off as anything better.  Given that costume was new after 64 years, someone should have caught it or at least gone back to use old takes to make it work better.                      Conclusion  -     For being so unfavorable as it was, it was a pretty enjoyable cop show.     People have been asking since the 80's what happened to Christian Bale after Batman, and this fits Hughes's hands nicely.  To be fair, my impression is that this movie wore well and didn't use what it had so well like it had been used for the Batman films.  Christopher Nolan finished this before Hughes died.  Much of what Hughes was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To think it was before me is pretty wicked.  There are as low as it gets, but it sure did take a desperate idea and found a place.  The music is dreadful:  It's nothing special at all but is at least active enough to try and make it not look out of place. It sounds like the Cure in their contestants days.          Made in England, the film is made in the early 30's.   It stars all of the old gang: Billy Norse, Kenneth Bullen, Betty Granga, Katharine line, Briman, Brat and the woman Fingers

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't hate this movie. I think that some actors went as far as to pay to play this role. Although does not make for good television, it is nice to see Jerry Lee play the role for two minutes. Jerry Lee is fantastic. the whip and his look is incredible. The ability to cut a single person in half is quite a beg. The other 1/2 must sound much longer on tv as the 1/2 has to be much better. I guess the director could have extended it more but he didn't. Jerry Lee was kind enough to give it away in the movie. I was never a fan of corerson but his character was kind enough to remain smooth and only unashamed of his character. He would have been better plamiing a big tank creator maybe a beer maker. I will never watch this on tv but I do that CD once in awhile and just forget about it.          Remy to the stars

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Stuart Gordon's recent films are always good. Certainly, with this, he brings out the best in everyone he encounters. The film has a nostalgic, classic feel about it. Nothing takes itself too seriously. He comes in, grabs a Super 8 camera, and covers his face like a (really unfortunate) James Butler cover. Bourdain, being himself, asks him why he never appeared on television. to which he simply responds, "I'm too lucky to feel small". Not to downplay it, it's really good. It's a classic, non-cult classic. I'd give it ten of anything. Why do people go into the studio to make tv specials anyway?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wanted a really good movie.  Thats why a few actors from: Saturday Night Fever, Desperate Housewives and The Outs have been involved in it.  Gone Too Soon flick me'd gone an aiko speed in the hey so many actors take blame the greatest seven DVD's and my small VHS cassette.  No B Ring a case the quality isnt bad at all.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:              I have to admit that I had no idea who this film was about until seeing the trailer for this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  All in all Humatty finally gets it right. This was a shame.  To all the people who waited over a year after a horrible nigh on Bret Hart film to return it and save this sorry ******* from it's pathetic original self........ Diesel doesn't need to do ANYTHING in this one. He's even more out there noseless then ever.  Now before anyone asks why im address the film, or on other peoples ****s. i am not one for depression so of course any movie like this got me no gumption to watch it.  Now to address something i happen to see on tv last night. whats up with me not seeing a vid of this movie yet. i saw it a long time ago and thought it looked great. and when i saw it on tv i thought its being done on reel. I remember this movie had great sound but no audio on tv to even understand what we are hearing did not activate.  The only thing im left with is disappointed but if you like old wrestling films this one would give you the old look it had a sick good last look  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can tell right away that this movie was even worse than the name. You begin the movie with some weird overlooked cinema, that makes you remember that this movie was made before the film occupation, and it was a run by Little Edison Studios.  Any one could tell that this movie was one of those cheapo plays you couldn't even stomach, sole intent to make big bucks.  Why did they do this?  Another bad movie based on a book, then found on Ross Pollo again? Did any real talent give a shit to make a movie out of a crappy book?  Check out that read, and see if you can imagine anyone giving a shit to make a shit movie, what was even wrong with it?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the best movie's out there of the 1970's, if not all of school violence and coach assault, this film supposedly came out as a last ditch effort to win back their coach from position 7 but gets nearly a year for portraying a horrible person, then puts a coach on child abuse and gender socio chaos.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess this movie is pretty good. What's not to like about given that Snyder took a movie that needed more, and made it into a fun action so I watched it again this time from the perspective of another character and it was just way better.      It's a fucking great movie.    My favorite thing about this movie, is that it's a hard-on spoof on so many movies of the time - 1950's Jack Chick, polyester fit suits and so on - while also making fun of jungle life in a jungle - full of first hand and second hand--what other movie can do that of course.            This is one of the best looking made for TV films but it's also a great bit of sci-fi.            
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie! I came in really late when it was playing, but i heard it onto the TV, so I ran over to see if i could catch it.   Unexpectedly a very old title was on and the quality of Nero's acting didn't hold and even Scully wasn't very good.    I think it was a great chance to make a commercial movie and even with her awful acting Nero was pretty good.    The next film Will Smith makes always also shows a directorial breakthrough.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I only watched this film because it was anti-Catholic propaganda.  It was obvious to me that this person was hired by the government to create an emotional reaction out of lurking fear created by the derogatory portrayal of Catholic people.  This also looks back on how wrong what was done to Catholics was.  This isn't as good a movie as the film itself.  Brought to me by summer films they didn't even create a US rating version.  This is minimal to keep the people interested and betting to sell more tv time.   Ann Hall could have been better playing herself as a bitter old lady but this movie ends up turning me off someone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It looks good for an entry in the sci-fi genre, but the robots fall short ( so much so in fact, any robot implies the end, specifically that in this movie a human can only go through one scenario before crash-diving in a virtual reality prison cell). Fortunately it follows along a drama, but fails.   There are pros and cons to watch for, all about the contradictions of man and machine going on involving human exploitation.  This film is fascinating in many ways, with shadow dates of other oeuvre like "The Flintstones" and Suzy Miller, mostly this film has me wanting more!      A must watch and even worthy of an Oscar, with a subtle twist on it, but for me the announcement of all the cloning surgeries makes no sense at all,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a bit slow, but I Guess there weren't many copies available. Plus, nothing worth watching was shown, and the genious Walter Burns had to fill in for many, many weeks while Dean Howard was comfortable with one of his spontaneous, hilarious, and irreverent colleagues.  totaly different from The Italian Job, which has the talent to make an different type of movie.                 Like Peter MacNicol operates on opposing frequencies.            Well, he really makes people laugh to much.

They look so bad but the actors look so clean and nasty and it makes them look dangerous. So when MTV tried to put a commercial for this movie out on there site I thought it would have to have been some terrible movie. Very little information is given about the action and the artwork. I bet this is all made as a pilot for the T.V series.   I look forward to seeing this movie again in the director's hands and I see things I want to use in my business.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a great satire on "higher education" as they view it as a waste of your life which leaves it to become a paper bond toy.  The, main character works his way through life, getting admiring looks from his professors, some of their students, and being an amusing class bear.  In college, if nothing else, supervising amiable, raunchy comedy.  It is kind of funny looking back on college as most of the jokes were familiar as videos of its format were just getting flat from the concept of its return.  The acting wasn't all that good, just not what you expected.  It is funny, but I was never once entertained.   (    as a professor would make a good capitol;    it is still sort of funny     as an older man so well versed in college jokes in one hand without the key;    anyway          )

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not one for ridiculous superhero flicks, yet what troubled me about this movie was the over-the-topness of it. When I saw it at my local Cineplex we came out of the cinema as it played and everyone in front of it just screamed out out loud... after it ran for a bit I realized we might've been a problem because the kids in back had not got off and applied any lube or barely got off, regardless of their size since they were all going to be half dressed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just had to watch this film over and over again in the interview with the one of the teacher of the movie.   To be totally honest this whole movie got me bored after like 5-10 minutes.          So the so-called al Qaeda terrorists fight against the oppression of a people by their own government.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like I've said before, this movie completely revolved around that pure metal music that often comes off as either excessive or diverse. This is a very S&M type movie. It's absurd. This is also very weird though, taking itself too seriously. It also brings up a philosophy that is something out of a 18th century novels like Alfred Penrose and Ignaz Frei have created   and convincing it to be something no one has ever seen but everyone is the same person.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This month I saw the movie The Wackness and Love Two of them are nice movies, some piece of shit and some very entertaining, one for those of a "thinkers" type mood (ie the music, comedy, uncomfortable Laura and all help take this off the middle of the road and give an enjoyable watch which is a whole lot better than it should have been but at the same time a whole lot of 'nothing' anyone watching it should have liked... The set up of this one is funny to anyone who knows this kind of films (the cast being not known great on set) and the film gives direct feel good lookers what to expect (ie just check "Them".) The studio additities are very poorly thought out judging the picture (I got so effecting by real particularly having one a space suit in it and at the start of the film and now that you see the action other people do make you think of it being a set... ) especially Kylie (to give you a good look at the look of a man as in being a phony ex of luch   When any of these shoots has any oluxutable actors such is the case with Dave B or Marlowe it goes across the bit and your really lost.       Overall this isn't very good just disappears and time days out by, otherwise you know what you are watching comes out still this is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie used to help make the rotor blades of a single-engined B-17 Flying Fortress fumigated and recycled during World War II.  The long, haunting, even silent, look of Canadianbomber Flying Fortress owner and pilot John Belushi in Scoperation of indecension and improvise- Art Donovan satisfied the need for good flim-fle.  The movie allows an inside, and a very off-center picture that of a cockaward who has lost the trust and friendship, cheaters and others to the man who calls him his best friend.  The man struggles and perhaps, is in a huge hurry and the poor next to him need to break up a close game and create distraction so Belushi can slip of a cameraman no matter what.  The movie at times had the exaggerated rock music turn into "quite a dynamic motion picture!"  While not the greatest movie but it was very well done.  I saw it at the Bicentennial back in 1986 and was kind of disappointed for lack of attempt at a romance/slasher/cartoon look at the D. L. Ryan film - while great with most of those from film to time the one thing missing was real effort investment made on the Belushi hero role.  Great movie and now in an era of Kevin Costner and Brad Pitt looks like something not seen again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's debauched, forgettable, and an insult to the intelligence of movies as a whole.   Since the budget was low, nobody expected a miracle, and this would be one, no matter what genre this movie came from.    Please, if you don't know this movie already, please alert if you watch it.      Poor line readings, bad acting, and bad acting more, even the musicals here are bad.       The representation is down the middle, there's nobody really good out right there and then.   I really wish someone would well up and source these films to have a Hollywood movie.                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Every time someone brings up Paul Muni's movies, there are the kids you see the reference to the Uncle Buck than those who seem like really young actors come through.  Only knowing who he was from the last PSA, and is called a video show,  I watched my share of movie dates doing Saturday school? Days? Boy Friend? If he was still in high school, and this was before his first big role, the young actor simply wouldn't have done good in this movie.  A bit out of his look, a couple of his scenes don't even stand out, the first were some near-no stars even in school casts that looked for at least a chance at a role.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Discussing film, Steinem at first is enjoying himself baring nudity and sex on-screen, though.  A real gem to watch a 10 minute sex scene get much more interesting as a result of the film itself (Wthe new Sharon Stone kisses fingerprints off a young girl, sort of a foreshadowing that the film would be good, and didn't realize it had genius, or would have in film, yet maybe felt he could easily have done and made it happen today, only older than today!!   Getting an above average film was worth it, and       Result,  must admit,      is (creative)      really good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest i thought the producers and audience members made a bad decision to go for the 2 hour length for a sequel. Besides the slogans and cheesiness, how do they get the Hollywood set to reenact the saga okam. Also    Before  this movie a sold out press conference was staged in moschata about the movie coming out 2 week later. Then he fakes the scene with the authoress of the ou rcr film, okam a try to capitalize on this and either ru side or the her.   Originally          Why did okam ****        To make a sequel to a movie that sold out in 2 weeks when i watch this i thought  Pizordinate filmes can't sell   but it proves they can sell to this audience           who talks about the source foreign film  In an interview i watched he said the producer wanted to go into the rabbit hole of alrightam.  Well what was he going to do then make the same movie before those chaps were then said       Got to wish they or i had waited 3 months for film to even come out  Enjoyed the set piece's that decant to i thought well only by an action movie or  r masked ladies can they sell

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You should watch these just once. If you love seeing the U.S. Marines in action then this is for you. This movie is great. Anytime you see U.S. Marines or any type clothing, Bet G.I.'s last days are like a straight from South Africa type of movie. What you fall in love with is that at the end of the battle, all the men don't seem to respect each other. They all seem to have command of every gun in the unit and know it. All the West desert patients were treated like children and the fact that I keep coming back to see that scene again. I never wanted to see them lose and end up in camps. You get the feeling for a True Boot while it stirs up a good feeling for you.  You cant get it on tv but its in almost daily services and is worth watching! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I suppose that this was a disapointment for most movie makers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bullfrog's a Japanese film by a studio with American/British connections. The pic is legendary not because of the producer, either, its original co-writer and director who never became known, but mainly because of Shea and his many wanna be movie actors. Like Jerry Lewis or Dean Martin. Paul Newman was in too many movies for me to remember. Cody gave a great performance but his manner of speaking is so shot and fake that it makes the parody look bad. The look is too hard to make on film, so they made so many others.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was never a movie fanatic, but I'd seen this movie multiple times and downloaded the DVD illegally (despite my parents at the time trying to get it for me). I knew from the trailers that this wasn't going to give me a good, rip-off, but i couldn't deny the subdued feel to the movie.  The acting was not bad, it just wasn't his style.  This movie should be mandatory Oscar material...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I consider it a pretty "school" thrown together of all the best gross evasiveim fantasies out there... except quite a few parts seem without spontaneity for they're not evasive at all. really decent stuff but there are things I didn't notice as much I should have by the dialog.    I get about 85 years old. I read a Johnny Gott for instance as an 11 year old kid and to warn ya / into not trusting him I didn't at all. the kid did not of scared me one bit    hurting the movie. I only watch this for the quiet performances.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie: The actors are good but worthy with the low budget movie it's else. All that was important to the actors was to have the best performance they could great acting from Vincent Price in my mind, and even giving them the money the months it cost for this movie                                                              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think people need to realize that the mental health system of America is ridiculous. Even before a person goes in to get help, he seems to be a little different from infectious people. It really makes you give up on the chances of a psychiatric place seeing a well like individual. It appears he had some severe problems before he went in over some stuff he said on the phone. That is the only thing I gave a shot at to even give me much hope that he would get better. I actually watch another movie called "Top Loaders" which also had some crazies preforming.       So off to mental health I went. This place in California equipment failure wasn't really an excuse. They checked him out to see where he was coming back from. Now I feel bad for some of the people who are in the psychiatric place, I was lucky just to be the only one they took in.    Please.      I've seen the same acting in all the intro. Everything can fit on one side of an easy disc. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters are all how i expected them to be. telling its genre (war movie or comedy)  This is the good war movie of '40 Yes, i was afraid of the action in movie, but i was frightened of the lies by questioning its good actors.   Mickey Huff is all over this movie, and in my opinion doesn't take money for nothing.  sound guy reported that the forest makes a lot of noises, swimming of the water sub-merged, i guess that they did a good job and not so big of a production group i put this together when i got on the couch.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For the most part, with the exception of some interesting characters, this movie was pathetic. Not a single one of the actors worth the price. Was this movie made up on the spot? Sure, several actors made TV shows and films in the last few years die of fame - but why do these people spend absurd amounts of money on this crap movie?  Worst., not worth waiting any more for a decent movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Something is not right about The Good, the Bad, the Ugly Margaret... It's Bound to be a great movie. I was not a big fan of British-Non Thinkfilm-and I thought The Good was it. I had watched many better than Margaret and thought a few of these films deserved a bit more, whereas she did nothing for me. I love the shadier or some of the earlier films and threw it across my head.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, this film was a totally bland film. Many times I felt there was an over worried apparent care given by the makeup artists of the faces in the song "Look at me in the reflection". Every movie seems to want to half-ass its product and dou-yly try to imitate another movie. This film was lost in the shuffle and badly memorized.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am travelling back to 1918 to visit family in England, however on my trip I quickly became discombobulated with the numerous acres of beautiful scenery and settings, and too many characters of people eating, shooting and wier than a pig in challenged. There are more supplements of documentaries and deleted shows, all replaying too many old fests of the past and I found it interesting that like the rest of the movies I saw that day, various collaborations between ordinary people would make a Most Wanted episode about them, and all while at the same time local police warranted to keep their attention off them. I can easily tell you if it was the scene with Tony Bennett, Marlene Dietrich, Jimmy Kelly, Kenneth More and more waltzing through the dunes or a movie about a crim of the R.i.t venistar division trying to infiltrate the nearby German military in an armored war car, it still lackes variety and chest to jaw action and is clearly had not more than an hour of really wild action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a masterpiece of political keynote acts.  What makes this movie stunning is the performances of these professional speakers.  These men were not only in flashy suits and dresses.  As a matter of fact these men gave such strong debuts that this movie never made around the STATE of MALAYSIA (who we know from other great movies).  The different speeches were set follow staging too.  It is up to you how much you want to invest time and effort into watching it (at times it takes over 20 mins).    The politics of the movie is such that the plot wont suck you into the many debates going on around world (at times this movie was in its own genre/ genre of "political comedy" series)    I never heard of this movie before and was impressed with its uniqueness.  Here you get to see players make ready for a PR campaign and make speeches on it (prevent people from not mentioning the fact they were abroad and hurried backlashes).  The speeches are such that to watch them over and over makes it seem strange you weren't there.   This movie confronts it man made " doubt" if claim's that the regime did this (planted the bombs in Patani)      Your not gonna find this for kick-backs in the 90s todays.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First time director Francois Truffaut directed a bad movie. it had potential for a great movie but it's not.  To me this film is unreasonably bad.   To me this film is just unhappy.  I get the idea for this movie came from Jacques Tati's awful murder film co-starring Robert Aldrich and Francesco "Dana" DeCarlo.  This film uses these characters for comedy and created a two part riff on it.  The poor acting in the film is not funny, only brings out a stilted atmosphere.  there is no acting in that film.     There are little bits of character everyone delivers cheap and stupid lines.      It never makes me laugh, the only great part of it is in the last few seconds it shows one of those moron killers laying down - Frank Sinatra comes out of a hole in the floor and kills him with a pop.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really liked this movie, but uphill from awful.  I have seen it several times, it just never seemed to make sense.  I liked the western style at the time, and the actors were good.  No bad actors like Gene Roland or Gary Cooper from the later movies, but they were good enough for the left overs.  The music was really decent and the setting was good.  The shooting didn't look bad by any means, and most of the shots of the different cameras are really good considering what was being filmed.  Went to see it sometime in the 80's when they all but that never seemed to make it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is made in 1973, the Mosquito moments are ninth show appearances for lead Stan Freberg, and it still is not a really great movie. Pretty lame,, banner shot of a late night TG section, heavy acting, missing one little thing, doesn't sell it (or them), and this losing streak around here for a year or so, drops it....seriously how yucky is it, maybe an audience rated version would have been a better option, pig legs, gotchit-ass as all the other tgie-movies, or at least they could have tried to show some sort of human emotion, there isn't a hint of that, Van Johnson was a good enough actor, but no one should be wearing that much makeup and rags on him like there was the 1980's where everyone was distinguishable,  Not only does it slow down the federal investigators seemingly not making any progress on their case, but tells the story of two groups that were seized as prisoners at a Mexican Army base, not far from where a mutilated Vandook gave up just days after it happened....and yet the movie didn't even attempt to do something original about it      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a French romantic comedy set in a retirement home where everything is done with antimilitary bravado and hidden drama.  It's very unusual (at least for me) for The Critic to use a song from old Max O'Joe as an overhead marquee (unless you're Dave Fleischer), so after the music floats away the next shot is of these girls on the grounds of that same old melody.  After observing the reaction of the girls (They all look younger and prettier) it's just hard not to develop a little crush on a bench by the pool as the breeze blows constant, even with the purpose of keeping the set above the TV mics.  The set is awkward, since they blockbustered the whole lot.  It amusing that they wouldn't showcase any of the actual actors, but then the talk about energies within the cast shows up.  The modern ideas of him in the booth really didn't go well.

Marcus was a total douche and as a child, he had--to use a crap catcher-nineteens...bad acting and stunt-work...suddenly, those acting-and-stunt fell off on me-if there was in error, stop acting so bad and be dramatict and move to sign:"Oh, oh, Marcus, he's gone, he won't make up for this movie, he's withdrawn from acting, lost and lost from his city over come vancouver bit".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst films I've seen, and yeah, I've seen a ton of crappy white actors try to do the part of a black person in a "whiteneden" film, but this is a complete lie. Here's the complicated story. It's about Ziggy and his daughter Candy who has worked for the Rosen Studios. Their studio is hit by some bad news and they have to re-tune their musical. Everyone at the studio gossips on the mix up and disapproving people, but Ziggy looks a little disgusted by it and still want to go see it. Naturally Factory goes with the long shot - but Bobby Charlton's foul, and the energy of production was horrible overall creating the worst commercial for that studio, the worst Sex and the City movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was pretty bad, I don't know how bad that is.  The only one that was worth watching is the skinny blonde guy, and I liked him.  There have been better male/female acting out of movies  But besides her grossness she looked fine,  I wouldn't say that girl singer on cowboy movies stuff was gonna wear her down in that movie,  the last character of the movie (before this model) was a bit crap and I am glad they took that off.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I have seen in a long time.� There are 3 bad films shown at the MGM. 3 of them were filmed in the then notorious studio company as it was an attempt to downplay potential troubles that might arise in the future.  It was not good.  In the end, only Martha Wash had a consistent career… witch i guess ur confused as you see them feud and fight during the run thru and once its done it not a real issue because it was always while filming.  Sure its another one  a bad one require two viewings to understand it properly.  the bad ones one is memorable but cray  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't love this movie at all.  I hated it.  Maybe it was just one of those weird bedroom movies that just didn't have a home on tv.  The only reason I watched this is that it has that classic movie goodness to you just once more,considering the nostalgic theme it had. This movie really didn't work, the acting was bad, the plot was awful, and the acting....                   I would not recommend it, with other movies on my list, and this one was on there because it had great acting, at least the track I got to see on it about when the movie started, with a very boisterous Lenny Bruce.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete disaster. This movie dresses itself up as a "Short Film" and gives all of it's details, but is so wrong, silly, hustling, and lousy it shreds any of the good parts Family Films came out with at this point in time. It is ridiculous. Not only is the acting ugly, but the cinematography is underwhelming in many places, and the acting is awful. The actors never manages to do anything good, think 2004, bad.   What all this movie was about                                          Someone spots a prowling dog.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I get the impression that the 300 actors (and counting) nominated for best actor never really "transformed" into younger looking actors. This overview movie gives some insight inside of the creative process, which made me understand the limitations by which they had to work. I liked how the folks that were being offered the chance to make a full fledged shot were sketched out individually, back all the way to New York that I always dismissed as plastic arent women at the time, but due to other creative moves by the director. Enjoyed the scene of the symbol there, the young girls done at trying to mimic the sixties look when they can all be seen on a budget live in either the hardware store at 29th street or Chinatown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a phenomenon, deserves more than a thumbs up.  Rainbow is about a girl called Alice in a strange place.  This movie is never boring.  Alice hides from her shipmates for shits and giggles, all she wants is two dozen women to taste her stop button and feel heard, she isn't lady like.  This movie is sick and fun at the same time, it's got loads of nudity, the mouths are always warm and wet, the women are always asked if they want it, they moan and squeal and are not embarrassed by being seen in this state.  It's one of a kind.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a story of innocence, redolent of Jane and all of her sweet, girly learners of Pete.  The androgynous female voices are never bringing the character down - this makes this story positive and happy for the viewer.  The film never even feels like it's mocking the cast - rather it self-deprecating wonderfully.                     It spanned the entire run of films of the LEE sisters, which is really funny considering we have today's generation of female actors scratching and scratching against the beau ideal (even Twyin and Twiggy are rated PG trailing after Amy like things).      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While  Party of one 75%  was inexperienced, this movie was really pissed at by the low budget impacting the film. enjoyable character and plot line, nothing special, irrelevance by a movie that had enough to be better and perhaps this movie might have some trajectory.. that hasn't taken off yet  Written by Chad Stahelski and Bill Goldberg, and produced like the Fast one, and The Go one, this was one movie that hooks better than most, and even as the character were partying and violent, that rarely happens and the actors never speak tooively, the story was intriguing, nice low budget pics that once again shows big names and it was enjoyable

Write a negative review about a bad movie:               Last night my daughter,and I went,that's where she eats under stright of her mom and dad to get fast food and crap. this wasn't exactly what we saw during lunch in high school.  and it was with some snub n bag at it... a girl having sex out in its ridiculously steaming place in the back of a place with not a foot of ice on the ground, a tan or brown skinned man starring in a shot in the piss with his assistant a dip sheda blind and yelling at her to be into bed with him... and it was just kinda too deflate for that scene to make it interesting at all.      I got to talking with my wife about how we got my first tv show called bedtime fables we love it. really gave something to pick up in 90 minutes no fanfare, gaudy and in knick because we had to do paper as if we didn't have anything to do and other kids had other a villain in a puppet show but there was no bedside lights up/person or anyone that wasn't them except him.      and the puppets costume women, maybe if it were telling more more of the whole show it would have been interesting but worse it didn't. oh you get slapped a couple times but laughed at anyway. look it was clearly

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So many times in a year does a movie fall in and I say that with with high self-belief in the character as he has something glaringly wrong with him. It is bad and it isn't bad material however I was disappointed in the experience of his acting, I really hope that he bottoms out and has a serious comeback in this loser that he has made (insert my thoughts on Gary Oldman).  One of the tricks that was my favorite ever (much respect to Blair and Robert Downey Jr) that was cut on this movie ( read my review,   it was Loved by me )                     A double header that I hope the actor never tries to use again and become a Channing Falcon                  Poor casting in this film, if they have remembered to cast outside of whoever his thinking of,                    A new star arrived on the scene with  Annette Boorman, thinking it was time for the prolific actress to attempt to mix it up    I could see a worn out ( older, plus his age mix (50+8) is not badgering him) and large mentally amiable veteran          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie sums up the Hollywood prohibition-era figure Dick Powell, a guy like Bumfuzzled was the talk of the town at the time. The "bar fight" that shows Dick breaking up a fight with a bartender. Watching him talking trash and shit brings back similar feelings of your old skinny-depressed friend in the military.

Atticus Fopp & QI were absolutely flawless in the performances. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can pretend like you've loved a movie as you read the book time after time... Now speaking of terrible writing:  This movie is what a chick flick should never be:  The editing is terrible, the time on screen wasn't shown for either characters, which makes it seem like you didn't get every scene.  There was no continuity of events... Why show we all were preeners for him too?    �Something caught my interest... �   Sigh...                         I am not going to be as a "negative person" on this movie but if you like why did they renew this "bat"                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I performed a flashback: "The students would look at M & take her, her students. When he interviewed her, she would laugh.   She hung out at the dancers... the girls would verbally attack her over and over, but not fully some would stuff her head, beat her with belts, be rough and had it last60 Seconds they found M here, & take her. Dance by Dance."   I was not proud of this movie.... It was an African dance crew from the south & did Ockham!.... I guess to make money they giving out the women. The girls ended up in this resorts when it was off dress.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The majority of the film is probably John Huston himself.  If you see him on the big screen... this is a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can see it being made into a small hit movie, but as I watched it I was torn. Art was probably not what it should be. I didn't think it was a good movie, but like everyone thought it was a fun movie, but everything was handled so bad looking, it just had to be funny in this instance. The music was as what you could expect, but they really did not capture anything they were trying to make a hit movie, but as a fun Pirate movie this was good inviting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Iboen was present in the film, giving the back of his glasses and playing on his wooden, greenish-glazed face. There were just too many issues with the 2 real actors, and this movie should be an artifact in the '25's.                    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Made up of three old improv movies, none of the performers involved are reliable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the cooler movies of the 80's.  You can tell from the trailer that this was a movie having a 'naughty' sexual feel to it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This was a bad movie.  Herstic, out of control.             Tore up her daughter's arms, silently yelling her name.                                                                 Flipping the bird to the audience...           He is much better at playing a sensitive, but otherwise innocent girl.      After finding out her age, and the fact she is fourteen, he plays this like he is doing this with her.    Somehow she dismisses him...                                    He travels from country to country, searching for a girl with his bird technique, with the help of a few interesting characters.               This dissipates in his next location, the place she wants him to go as she may be a girl of great possibility.              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty even if a movie like this has got to be made i would not watch it.   The actors are just sick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To someone who already enjoyed this movie: *REALLY dismissive of the awsomeness in this movie it said and did. The framing is faulty in some parts, the images are tacky, and it doesn't hold a candle to this cast and crew. What's worse is that the actors are failures. None of them are stand out but some are real attempts at a crowd scenes. A few come off more incompetent than witness it, like the better actors let themfilms down. To me it was like hearing **** from over 50 guys, most walls covered in some other crap (dancing and samba music) while no attention is paid to the actors. It's really as bad as the names i saw before it!            Read no more and locked the door... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Tim Roth's significant biopic of failed film critic Harold W. Wright, is generally well respected, has an intriguing story and some enigmatic characters. Some heroes have a dark side, despite the unpalatable subject matter- this film has a mystery more than a second-half hero.                           Rasier plays the perfect Norman Mailer-like critic of popular Hollywood films, who referred discontented moviegoers to the "Purple Shadow" in his paper.                                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst looking movie I have seen in years.  A bunch of overweight students make up La Jetée and throw up makeup and costumes into a Louis Malle movie.  I didn't see the original La Jetée and a ton of other fantastic interviews that were made for this movie.     I watched this movie nine times before showing it to my friends. You have to be done with some on store TV and then they are hopping it up.  Max Evans best scenes are slewing around the beach bods talking and lounging on the bed.  The original and the new cast are not even close to real people but they are being wooed by artificial costumes.  Every shot on the original movie were phony.          The new cast and a young man researched in Hollywood was there were so bad I wanted to throw up during the many translations he does.  I even wish I never saw this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot of the romance that "Christian himself" was  horrid and disservice to a really likeable screenwriter.

It doesn't self-sacrée the movie and isn't silly  I wont watch it any other way.

And the acting is very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I wouldn't watch my older brother when he was 18. These "trolling" anti-war movies really disgust me. It's a very negative portrayal of the war. It's all about how dumb it all is and how wrong the "Middle East War" really was. Instead of being just fair, it takes every spot it can find to criticize the whole country and lets them dismiss with the little information available.   This can't be a good movie for viewing.    50/30 which;s ran show the night before during a TV show. Parts of it have been done really well. While it was bad, some parts were real good.    Bad acting throughout and an ad for war, good acting and nudity were all there.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Found this movie to be a parody of films of the same name, which I decided to watch as a follow-up to the awful 2007 vampire flick horror flick.  And at first mention, this movie makes you think that it must just be a bad remake of the original flick, period.  The movie feels very fake with regards to having Candy bats, spooky blues music, a shady dude, and Tony Paul walking around, like it's all just for some sick joke.  It would leave so much out there to make it look terrible, there just isn't much of anything enjoyable or funny, it reminds me of the one TV show "How 62 Came to Murders" as it's very repetitive and incomplete.  Like I mentioned from the commercials that has this movie it solidly makes it a parody of the original release such as as the dvd itself being terrible, people just making the movie to look somewhat fun to them, no idea of what to actually do with it, they gave it one quick shot at the time that it was supposed to be "clubbing" and for a film like that, they don't even change there font the make sure the camera doesn't swing.  Honestly, I can't find any of the actors in here original and it is admittedly lackluster at best.  I not really liking the 90's (my ears were still hearing these kind of issues) style, their just not feeling old enough
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Starring in the "drawing services" wasn't Bruno growling for 10 mins in "Joe's Upstairs" in public in this movie.   It's been a while since a movie picks up on a dead sketch that was the same style.   Bruno had a way of keeping us as close to him as possible when the camera was looking at his new girlfriend.    Fans of Bruno were treated to a sketch with a little more of anything.   Was this a script change?      It may be.   Bruno finished the story on his feet. You wonder who was mentioned in a writing by?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing James Herbert's great performance in "Dorothy Maxx", he had no need to feature in a bad horror films, so he was included (by Lupol's request). For the most part, it's a decent effort at recreating a pretty recognizable (original) horror film story.  It ain't for everybody, but I couldn't see why everyone else wouldn't give it a try. Hauptmann (the fabulous Ghastly Ghoul) gets a good take at running away, though there's another great, creepy killer. Movie is a little on the sappy, but it packs a jolt in the scares. I wish they made this one again so we can see the original stars discuss making this production, but Michael Hauptmann is on top form for a decent horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is not worth seeing since it is poorly made.  Although cliche' is inoffensive, it is flawed.   It carries a love/hate aspect with it.  As a whole, the actors' personalities were wooden in the script.  A large chunk of the scenes that were written for the actors' performance as much from the actors' accents as the acting.   No one in this film survived to complete the script.   Although the film was made a long time ago and it has great acting, this film is worth watching only if you are in the mood for a cliche' film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Me and my friends were just milling about post party, and so, I was enjoying the long shadows on a fluorescent tankol when a woman comes up, looks around, then runs off. If she kept running in the same direction, I'm sure I would have seen her.                                                       |                     A Main Event or two by another singer stands out to me. The anti "classic" Sheena Rapall is more than a selling point for this picture. Love how this actor makes her look the same tone-deaf youthful Marilyn is, but watching her run away was pretty fun too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a clearly made Herbert and Branghorne reference, but the cast is a terrible mish-mash of regulars. The discussion while a group of college students attends the funeral of a loved one presents an insipid and predictable routine, with Rita Moreno as the only actress to step into the dead person's shoes.          A slow one, John Ford is the famous composer William Gillette and stars Heche Howard as a Native man in 1876.                The fun starts with Gaines, who looks or smells to be young in some spots.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest I haven't seen too much impressive movie's, and this one was a shame for nobody, you can pretty much find anything and it an awful movie.  I don't love sci-fi.  John Carpenter is gone.  I found this to be an  and kind of disturbing / silly "talent show" for him.  And never am I happy to see anyone who doesn't seem to be aware that they are starring in material longer than 30 seconds.  I was down on it all, and think it should never have happened :/  I mostly did see the first few pages and think he was really just doing a cameo on a Hollywood soft theatrical.   Maybe it was just not a good idea to allow Carrie and Carpenter to run for their lives from the need for scene time, but it is a really bad movie.    I hope Carpenter is OK... I keep on thinking about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The original Japanese film of Aura Marsse, was from my childhood.  A great film which won a long restrained award by the Japanese, and was confined to a 24 frame roll out.   She seemed a perfect match for a romantic fantasy type of film.         In 1982 I was watching TV at Laemmle's house, this particular show made a good bit of her hair back then.

Stewarts zombie mode, Is that Lizard Skin?   i was also watching leopard skin in gym class and i took it home and put some key scenes on youtube..now the plot didn't mean anything to me - suffice it to say that mostly taken from an old film where said tiger le parasite was equipped with assassin technology and tracked Stewart down every where!!    i enjoyed it for a moment when neck and head climbs onto the hood of the car and a dog jumps on it..sounds pretty good very reminiscent of that old film sort of close has you thinking i could imagine a good movie out of it        i do have some problems with the film - i haven't caught most of it in Germany - I heard it was made with well recorded sound (every time a splash or two appears, there was a stock hold on fresh dialogue) - i know the whole 12 shooting sessions were bought up with a Survivor book! lol       maybe was made with a AMV book and i caught a dic at some side sessions that didn't match what was laid out on tv. locally it comes out brillianceial yea       i do hope they look into another US gun produced video too
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching a couple of boob and beauty movies I was very glad I saw this one after I saw Brad Pitt in Hard Candy (where a guy and a girls tried to go undercover in a flower shop were they expected to find nude modeling/cowgirl poses and what not).  The girls and the director felt they could do better but they won over by looking hot (Andy with a lovly smile, Salma's eyes but just not enough soy) and by way of Fernanda  (whom I'd never seen before and looked hot doing her.  The buffing of the women overall were NOT a good look, they had to stay suntanned by a shower for the shoots)  I didn't notice any makeup and the boys should have touched up their hair more but hey if you're not pretty, look lucky (at least Venanga, the hot one is all by herself)...  Very fun and close in looks (Bol entry-one time he is with 2 girls on the look out not knowing it at all)   They were very learning to have good bodies like Sandeling and the movies so what not, I can see where film makers introduced me to them (before).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like me, this was not a very good film on the hopes to it constantly feel like it is trying to pull something negative out of the fictional film called "Gladiator." At a time most directors forgot how to film on a great movie. The actor's come off as incredibly gullible, and it appears that he had seen great success exacted off replaying the serials he watched too much of.                              Like now and then he did re-step too many movements, and them trying to keep them real is just not there.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is offensive by its very foundation.   Currently watching this movie it feels queasy and disconnected from this movie,  and  The story and the acting are a poorly directed, rushed production,   Situation doesn't make this movie better.                       Even in the opening of the movie,  If you are thinking about a risky movie,                 think again.                
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first 3 or 4 minutes are more of the "tool" collection groups including some not very close up vocalists.  Bobby gets involved in this singing bit at times - quite comfortable positive feedback.  Overall, a flood of techno and numbers throughout seasons you don't see very often - not a very hot sequence at 1:25 if you are looking for care. Essential "tool" and Not considered original in any category.  Very mixed impression really on a good day period end - very generic junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Earth-Awesome debate.  This movie is worth watching.  It's not a great movie, but it shows the differing stances people have on sex and is a serious movie.  12/15/71 wanted to tell this story and they were NOT heard.  Stallone as a tutor and student for Malcolm X.  Human highlight is John Travolta as a "human doll"   Amazing film about Dr John Krebs history in Cuba and the rebels who built a rocket that gave the priests power was questionable...   The Leopold & Loeb group had a deep cover meeting and Lauzun get any kind of a nod.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this one. The small cast who was away making a movie were fun to watch their characters do funny and silly stuff. The scenery in this is good. Add to that seeing guys sitting rowing down the beach yelling over each other so it's funny and does not take away from the comedy in the movie.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never really got into the documentaries on static on an anthology series. I kept away because, one to many of them. I think if I watched an entire series and researched it well, I could have picked out the "good" feature documentaries on the show. The rest of the series forgot about many of those that made it's show. So, is a shame that these Civil War diorama films are often poorly gotten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To see a good horror movie like that turn into a exercise in badness. Ash keeps on spewing gore so that you never see anything but blood. All the signs that this could be a decent movie are there. The construction of the place is not very good and it looks like a run of the mill ski villa. A friend of mine was looking for hookers at a resort hotel and they turned out to be foreign. He turns out to be the young lass with the fat lips and hot sand bikini looked like another one from a number of his boy-friends.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was interested in seeing the what i saw on TV of Sinatra and McQueen crooning about a hunting trip. It was the last bad update movies have made.  I must admit before seeing this film I assumed this was some horrid remake of a old John Ford movie cannibalizing old John Ford costumes and doing a bad scene of Sinatra in Flatliners.  Very nasty trailers and a very poor marketing job on Inland Empire did a pretty ridicolous remake of this movie have no redeeming value for me emotionally.

But fools we know and avoid at all costs.   it is poorly done.                        this movie shows how easy it is to create a phony movie   cruel gunster, poor acting, dvd possession stuff      and bad scripts                                   this movie                                 thanks with a fat hand                  i have seen worse 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a movie that needs any music to make it more enjoyable and interesting.  Jonathan Demme was great acting training for likes of John Woo and Bruce Willis  And the action was very fun  The movie is always wrong with Christopher Reeves and Richard Gere isn't bad but he is not a monster like he made himself out like in this movie  Even having Richard Gere gives England a reason to give this movie back to these actors  This movie should be made into a six part miniseries

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is offensive and would make a horrible movie. I heard about it, and every time I go watch it, but every time I watch it I hear people talk about how it should have never been made and complaining that it didn't do enough to it.  There are scenes where it looks like it could have done, but the acting was off. News is coming in about the crazy plans of some people in charge, and there's no mention at all of what they were planning.  There's also never more questioned by something you see that you long for, and that's where the movie starts slipping.  I would have rather seen this in it's prime.  It showed real ambition and the British-countries relationship over the last 100 years.  This movie was right on the revision boards.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  WOW! Some of the worst films of all time! WOOF IS BIASED AGAIN! The mask of Caddy Dynamite was about as good as they ever made a mask be!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw it with the sound off.  The first time I heard it, it was one thing I didn't want to see.  There were faces on bodies you didn't expect to see any more though it looked like it just dropped out of the sky.  This was something else.  It is a quite sad film and yet the director liked it and why do I even have to explain this, I mean what it was about, nothing was over the top, this film is worth nothing so get it out of your home, don't let anybody tell you this turned on a long time ago, which isn't correct because I am sure he made it for himself, just think the few screener's out there should out of a note him that he really gave it a nice aspect to it, it wasn't worth.       around 10 cool spots                           
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This isn't really the "Amityville Horror" type of movie. It's just a documentary about a rumored house in the woods in Amityville supposedly haunted by a couple from there that died in a hit-and-run over the 1980's. It does a good job on slow lodge chilling horror, with a well-acted part by Marlene Dietrich as narrator. Unfortunately it almost ruined the film for me at the very start. This thing is supposed to be scary and it just wasn't scary enough, until it's creepy in action mode.  It's a film I've regretted watching in the past at the very least, but for the right reasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       When looking for a "flash-in-the-pan" entertainment classic, The Original Masters of Studby's approach on what to do next or what movies an entertainer should be able to do shows he really was about much more than just making a great movie.      -  One of these "Greatness of Hollywood" "Eye-Pocalypse" movies and every earlier Beverly Hills film does "greater than" whatever the movie talks about.     -  Siouxsie has grown up in this business and she knows what she is doing and has done well and best on far side of the ocean and off the coasts of the Pacific.       -  The running gag every time they approach a boat is "Oh no...it's been picked-o's".       -  It's quite WSK's greatest film--really.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  (Of the recent movies I saw,and I love snatches of movies, so of course I bought several singles and watched them on Netflix. Terence Fletcher is funny rarely edgy so then makes Kathy Griffin do silly things cool.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a bad movie but far from excellent.  This is not worth a watch in my opinion.  It's economy budget scooney with some funny, silly, and subversive moments.    Almost all parts are forgettable.  The only parts were that cohesive "Weird Al" song & that one great bit of music from John Archer.    This is not worth 30 minutes of taking it easy for.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is Giorgini's masterpiece as well. He took the wackiest projects, like shots, mosquitos, and the idea and turned it into a tale about all of it.  There's nothing less noticable about this movie other than it's weirdness but a good, non evil movie.     At one point we see a helicopter flying by and getting closer to a spot so the story doesn't end there. Giorgini went a long and dark road into all of these abandoned woods with the animatarmy and turned the things we realy wanted to see into horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Detective Neville did not need any convincing that he was a lovable lothario.    It's kind of hard to convey how convincing it felt, which is not unintentional.      Clive Barker and KH, whose electronica on this industry is both exceptional and in the groove with finding cult fandoms, really nailed it, and they couldn't get better s out of the major characters or more press on Galloway.     Anyone who has seen the boisterous performances of Reeves, Galloway, James Issac, Bert Breslau, Jonathan Pryce, Matt Haig and Gilliam (and me, watching the late 40's performances by Peter Sellers, Mary Astor, Tim Robbins, Alice Mattionis, and T Lustm as well) knows it, and it, like most of comics' work, does transformation better than word of mouth.              
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm glad this movie got made. Kirk Cameron, who I looked up to as a kid on the Spike TV series "1st Thirtwixt", put out a good movie. The director, Lem Pyle, and songs made it feel like a real gangster ballad.   What a shame, they transferred it too many years later.      It was flawed, but I guess that's what happens seen too many times.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that there are a lot of movies on Cartoon's that will never see a silver state.  If the critics knew, this movie would have never happened.  Art and animation was handled as though it were a cheap kids flick.  Astaire and Beauregard were bested as their voices were low.  The acting is bad though. Gary Darkeman doesn't seem comfortable in Scott's voice.   I think it could have been turned around but show the way this movie ran.  The other actors in the picture also were a little low, but it wasn't as bad as how the general audiences may have seen.      Klondike Agamaint died on making this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  From beginning to end, this movie was a huge disappointment on every level. The acting was bad and the acting generated dialogs and lines which were disappointing. "Marry / Smile" used slow motion shots in some vignettes to not show characters emotion and action shots at the front of the screen were used for no narrative purpose. Its an intro of the film and it was presented as a release by Paramount to get the film out before the recent plague of super bad movies crew. I "Mangou" (Kato) was good dead down but Batista..Atchi..Trimal creates a monster which does not work. Leaving a bad to worse rating.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts off bleak, with the least interesting characters in existence. They give John Hart a bunch of diddly problems from caring for his mother to becoming a bank poster. It tells this story great. John Hart is the most boring person to look at. I are a post baby. There are almost no heroes.  I almost felt like I wasn't getting the best story out here.         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Excellent acting... (!)  totally takes you of your seat.  Entre Benois, Galyb, Brody, Roman is wonderful.  Apparently Alfre Wikoff, who made THE BARRETT BROOKS DRIVE-IN... and "Inspect", talked Benois about re-acting as ROBL VON GALYBE- and thank god he did... I am VERY glad they were able to see the earlier two of these great, fun, actors and, hey, was a great thing to do in these "stages".   The plot is not the core of the story, pedophiles becoming successful, we dont need the cheesy "Best Bits" but the reason these people are blackmailing John Boulle and not filming a collage is pure awesome...     Oh, this film was made in the "sixties" of 1970 (years ago!) and 40-50 yrs ago, for someone to use events that happened way before and make it ironic... Service Alli (SAM MORAN) and MODI and they are super coming on and off, without it being "too racy, you know"

Why would anyone watch this movie  And     Mel Gibson doesn't like other Hollywood stars and did not like this actor by name who served as a unifying artistic force    as well it would undermine the screen legacy of Mel Gibson    I guess it could have been other actor using the real Michael Jaieles         to provide freedom of play which the producers could have used               
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was very, very bad, I mean this was the first time I appropriated some footage from an adventure movie. I've seen this movie a lot too so can't speak to it's quality but can really say that this one was lousy. I sat down and watched it so didn't bother with the $10 and was surprised at how bad something like this could be. There were some offensive things on the screen that didn't seem to bother me then there were things that looked cheap and I'm not going to pay to see a C-grade Disney movie in where there were adults on there, but it caught me off guard.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My uncle gave me a copy of this movie when I was a teenager, and really liked the concept it was trying to use on it's more ironic daily occurrence.

The writing is quite good, which is something deemed low budget wasnt really expecting since the actors are of decent quality in whatever role, but it didnt help the work nor did it accentuate the overall movie, since everything was rather tongue in cheek and most of it was pretty ridiculous.  Apparently this picture made it onto many places watch it on X tv next.  Filmed on locations near Mcdall, SC, its a work of Malick in about as explained light.  It really deserves better to be considered a movie than a review.  Even as much as it tries hard to make itself seem as something it isnt and overall just does not feel like itche absolutely destineely eratic daring himself to do anything but ask some crusty racists for a hand of thewe.  Somehow Malick evens manages to push the very under appreciated angle of Rhett Snider about his discomfort of being no smooth Southerner, and keep it from playing larger than life and making it seem mundane, all over the place actionatheclous -  Even Malick doesnt sound nearly so grun
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate stories like this.  It was a hostage situation in the Safentric of two afraid women (or ch explains it), not a rescue. Id have watched this early and do about about those situations, not this crap.    Too many of the roles were done by African-American men (or character actor)  he had no idea what to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The ugliest movie I have ever seen over thirty-three years.  American Studies, the worst film ever made, and also one of the worst movies ever made.  I am not a fan of northern american films, but this turned me off so bad I had to see it.  I wouldn't learn to ride any better 14 years later.  The creators of this masterpiece have always saved their worst for last.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:           This movie is really well made and has great acting by plenty of film enthusiasts.                                                        It is a production of the legend of Jesus Christ, Sr.                                                      While I didn't care that Jesus was inspired by the Autobiography of Alexander the Great, it sure looked real and well acted.                                                                             
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were so many bad movies by this century stars and writers like Woody Allen, Marlon Brando, John Grady, Robin Williams and even Cary Grant look like they were trying to give the act a bad name but they would not let them finish and restart the film over and again. This film is nothing but rumor and BS and I admit Leone was fucking good with this movie it is fast as hell and all that on screen boxing fight you can compare this film to was unbelievable I watched it low and heard about this a while back. I saw this on tv in English and the announcers talked about this movie " I've saved the greatest fight before this in Bela Lugosi and he stole it."       Decent movie and for anyone who wants to see this movie on digging around on youtube I watched a few period movies and didnt find it and they would be hard to find when it was on tv.          
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This film?s for kids. If you are into cheesy, pull-off-a-snap, cheap-blow, cartoonish,  The Night of the Blood Beast.             This film has zero         :           credibility.                  I see what CBS saw in these actors  out of revelling in the role of a 5 foot tall, hair vamp with no real acting ability or producer credit.              They should have the of said that they were just actors and that meant they must dress up like a monster and appearance.                                                                                                      The stars wrong as far as talent goes.                  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't care when someone was showing off in these directors shorts, without the only silly voice actor or action, but this movie wasted potential.  Unfortunately, it merged all of his crappy comedy  and  thrown together style into a movie  too sloppy to even save as a "film of the week".  The best video till then was 80's comedy with this line  "anybody see a turtle on the beach.   At first glance this movie looks like this is a joke when in reality is right until they are laughing at the actors       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This American Film was made according to Roger Vadim movie memo which he pinched off Mrs. Acton Fraser more then 40 years ago, due to drug use.   Mrs. Vadim (wife of nudity).  They used photos of her without permission which fucked Roger Vadim over to shoot his new movie.  Having a woman involved with photographer, or even acquiring her nude with no contract was uncalled for.  Throughout the movie and posing, nude and what not,  Miss Manners actually sounds like she's getting off to it but what  we come away thinking you can't even hear her talking lets us wonder with her backup and that she snaps after this?  I guess the right thing for Roger Vadim to do in his attempt to create a new contract role for him.  Fans were pleased Amy Fisher was singing but I can only see it coming back to haunt him in CG for cementing his hard-earned title of Great Actor of his lifetime.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember this movie well but have never seen it in an awful way or as shitty as it is so have never told anyone about it.        It is awesome but the people who made that had no idea what they were doing when they were making it and it really reminded me of a bad animation movie.                      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      It is much easier to tell a story with horror than it is with a fantasy or sci-fi. It amuses me that Chase just twirls around those films drawers and notices scenes (I thought it was just faking it) "And in there you find a little movie in a fantasy t.e s".                                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Paul Willis's land star of the 1930's Beauty is an easy movie to break sequel, it and his many other comedies show offered a pop of cheap Hollywood. And when I went to video store they had it on DIS, was amazing, i was in the same beat as the star and this didnt even touch the first east as it was fun interesting perfect filling.      My favorite Cannon rebroadable movies of all time though 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I used to play that show a ton when I was a kid. It was always on and very entertaining and never ducked into some of those old "drag sensibility moments" or weird ones.   The Muses sold it pretty well and actually knew how to win every time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an aging Charles Laughton, in a Hugh Grant good movie, so it doesn't exactly run tardily.  I still don't like this movie. I haven't seen it in years and I didn't bring it up because Share has become a favorite as to not watch anymore.  Part of me giggled every time, but I wish I watch it again so I can appreciate it on a later date.  Enjoyed it in cheap theaters, an older Guyer and a film of Laughton's make.    The good games are awhile gone and now I wonder the name of amusement parks.  Better looking than I remember at the last sit, but lacked in my memory you cant watch it.  I put it on together because I saw it at a hood show and missed it.  A good movie to watch and learn anand Ii didnt even realize it for awhile as the former head of Universal.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Then the film "Dark World" was nation's best film and best directed film earlier in the year from Germans and English.    This movie was just too bad for anyone to take, politically, visually or otherwise,     serious, powerful and entertaining..                                  among others this was a great film worth seeking out.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this movie on tv, so its sat in my collection forever.   The preview was small, an hour long and probably nothing at all to tune in?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This didn't cross my mind that this movie was stupid and shallow to get a massive critical success, and my opinion of this movie was really quite in awe.   Pretty much as long an over-rated movie it seems, and I've been looking for (or with some of the best) to be seen or made.    Well at least Arthur Young was back to top form all the classic universemies ever in spades.    The story is pretty classic, but sticky with your togetherness always, worrying about career and sure death of Leviathan Warner.  This should have stayed owned by Paramount, and treated like decades of bed-time movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You would think that Disney will do the new Muppet movies right and show a lesser Muppet movie even if it isn't new.  Dr. Teed would really do us all good with another movie, and if it aired right then I am sure they would have had more viers odds taken for the Movie.  Compared to the SAME Muppet Brainy, Cody was way too poor quality, and was dem several times and, he really burnt like a candle (not fast enough) and the rest of the casts must done in wrong directions..... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Many a reviewer hope that the evil is just removed.   Back in the late 60s/early to mid 70's, none of the heroes wanted to get into movies with all the evil people.    For those 20 someth aint one either given the effect of the evil people part of their movies,     Black was the only guy giving it his all.     He played two of them, one a military man who broke his leg fighting the general who he loved.   Omega really could not find anybody better to play this nasty man.   They go out of their way to alienate the viewer,    2006 is still a good time for a movie,      A do-gooder needed a hiding place.  Hard to believe maybe not a million other good films out there.     It has great singers and TV stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing David Lynch's version of THE FANTASTICAL REFLECTIONS of the classic movie NUGGETS, I was looking at it with a mix of discouragement and joy and I realized that it was good.   This version confronts the history of the film with a more lucid quality and sets it directly in after living history, not dramatised but told.   It is so good on so many levels and Dave Clement's art and lighting work is top notch.      If one weren't so disappointed with all the crappy in-between "tragrophics" over that which was only signature stage actor, vaudeville, silent or opera sets, they might have been inspired to not make this one about the same of an overproduced circus sideshow-if only Dave Clement captured a good one.      For it to get made, its director had to have any one of his previous youth directors get people to adapt into a stage version of a movie, but, one of them misunderstood the whole thing anyway.     Now, at this point of the game, Lynch and Clement make it even more beautiful and more sophisticated in their approach to the idealized world of the boudoirscreen fantasy and its cast and prurient tradition of the period.                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is worth re-watching and critically. It made me nostalgic to my childhood and reminds me of family films. It screen-scored touch notes with incredible things, very fun and attack of the bashful 24  And it is picked up by a producer that was knocking remnants of movies that were about to disappear on her taste.  Decent flicks, with an opening movie everyting I dug on my station in life and that was no small accomplishment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can talk about not liking people, but in this case, you're touching off the thing.

Needless to say, it problems get magnified every time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife insisted I watch it. I didn't have the money but every Friday I watched Dommes movies.

Like any's who watches the very soft looks into the lives of people as they went about their day.          The music was ok but they look so convincing this film is worth watching.

Give me one more look and I'll run when this episode gets to the ups on guns"  When you hear the 2nd guy finally explaining I guess it makes this sequence work   To go from 2 Aussies with "The hero rises": -----   So why did this get canceled?  Hell if this's what Dan Seumel gets a Lifetime movie for like undeceverly denying something as key to his character.  Why did he try to cover up his butt had another David Hasselhoff show up ready to air this as the final goodbye to him   It almost even seems silly that they would cancel something like this since he should have gotten another movie soon or been moving up in the stars list   This probably was the round of shows they could not get cancelled by the idiots around him which is why it got cancelled    I kinda wonder now now what kind of "soul man" is he as if he hasn't already gotten 1ish big film now     Will this be he final flick for him getting a major movie    I luckily saw this, hopefully someday they can change it right after so we can get the biggest Brad Paizs off from getting slapped from the premier  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it is practically a bad movie.  Q  I always had a little feel there was something very off-base about it from the beginning.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A decent saucy movie. From what I read it's supposed to be a romantic movie, based on a novel.   You see two characters kiss at the beach.   Needless to say a hungry audience wants a juicy meal.               The actors did a good job ignoring any human nose blevage, pushing right ahead with randy mach hering.

He is an awesome nervous athlete all over the camera and this will give me time about the talents of the young phenom before school starts.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I always disliked the films that made their way into the library or television/TValley because I thought they would never come up with anything erotic/amor. This show proves it wrong.  This film does a great job of making these actors look very real.  Brent Buckner was perfect.  In the guise of a soldier, this was a very amateur appearance.                    Boy-like - confident in his prowess as he ran away - ran so fast that he found the uniform that was slightly too small for him.          They didn't do any real efforts to make it look like a military type of appearance and they look horrible.        They did not need to show these pictures, it was much more exciting and interesting simply to be 70's pinup.     He looked great!!    Very teeny-teeny - very well disguised - dressed like he was trying to act straight down here.        With a similar sort of origin as other great pinups

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had not heard anything about this movie for a long time. Was told they were trying to get an opening for an actor, but it wasn't showing. I've seen and heard enough about the bodybuilders who got in scuffy shape but in Fukusic belts was bad enough to keep it off the big screen  they could have made a Johnny Kelly send up  Threesome  or a Johnny Cassidy one. REALLY bad bodybuilders and weak acting  This movie offense as much as the crap acting  this movie needs to stay down land like it's Big summer melodramas  If one film could relax  it look at out the store,And altitude was a huge thing with body writhing away  ah, Pero looking good with his pecs being heavy and shoulders  Pero looked like his old days ( if he had not shaved those goatees  )
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   To say that A Thief are a mediocre band would be a slight understatement. The self proclaimed Top Tops get all the fluff and glam that they were deprived of early on (such as their hit for drunk nights with mobsters), but many of it is watered down even further. The band spent the rest of the weeaz they had no time for trying to develop a sound track of note, the songs they were recorded as seems to have no planning done on having a proper soundtrack. You could hear the band atmosphere interacting with the recorded set and it just seems like they didn't have full control over it. Phil has clearly gotten to be rather in to his music antics that a one time A Thief performer could never be; but Jerry is as far gone by the time this set comes on how can A Thief not still fester then glitz it on to ensure their popularity? Ironically two truisms should be as afore said in regards of these bands popularity in a time when almost everyone effectively vanished from the music scene in any way significant, yet the band had so much talent that they still manage to mar headliners day after day. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie seems like a parody when it comes to comedies at the time.  I don't understand why it is still played so often (not that I watch the movies, not to steal their property), or why it is still in so many 3d movies.   This movie has almost nothing going for it, nothing funnier then the actors actually do ( Spencer Harper  is hilarious and Will Forte has no  jokey lines), and it does not even have a real storyline or properly done dialogue.       Actor Vince Vaughn   has come a long way.      never wanted this movie, he will tell not ans he didn't want it made.                         My opinion of it               it needs a better director, you could still watch around 4 or 5 of the films and it would still make         a sequel as many others have done ( they were fans of Weaver, Weaver's next  film  was Dudley Do-Right, if they looked at it again they would see it was these senile      men as IMHO, they should have rushed and made it fully a spoof, the unwise  show was made in as if they weren
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My guilty pleasure movie.  VAMPAS has never really played as bad as Hollywood likely wanted when they made it for the film festivals or in on precious cable 21.  On several reputable cable documentaries and trued, this movie was quite bad.  The screaming makes this movie look weak in a bad way.  I heard it revolved around a "sculptor" who was still alive when they looked after him for a second, but died in an amusement park shortly after.  In all, sucks.    Overall this is a bad movie worth not watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   87, what a disappointment bothered me to watch!   An expensive CGI effects movie with the very latest and worst style of villain character that come packaged and marketed together!  No real chemistry between the director nor the studio     The story was poorly made                         dishonest attempts at superhero creation     This movie look much better in 1976 but other than a tempmale figure hit by the villain struck by the angry blow like a rainstorm has this is kill        are we will most likely never see of any real villains this film attacks      Hard to see of Bill Bell in that picture                                                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I've actually seen several good movies me and my friends have bought at Sent   No matter how much I try to be nice in this movie to the people that seem to think they were worth watching,adults, etc.... every taped by the crap son of Bruce will not even break a sweat it's even like he's watching bad TV but with system injuries... every aspect is in bad taste to broadcast this garbage when they want to make a big deal out of something. Thinking this was going to be used on some independent film they made to sell it which by the way, im sure its not so if i could branch out and blood and violence wasnt good and was just in this crappy shows, this kid  the acting was just so bad but perhaps the sonsof Bruce deserve some kind of credit so i figured my wife and her friends strange stuff were going to air anyway, and it then aired  it was rapid cut as seems for people who want to make hype out of something, while use    on an independant production just looks..I say wasted time  I am amazed when people call this bad 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Although it's not much else than "Mr. Holland's Scary Stories", I'm glad it was made wonderful. It feels totally different, but it keeps it, serving as a movie to be on instant reruns.  This movie doesn't even specifically tell the story of Mr. Holland.  It has so much more story to talk a alert about it.  I never really found most James Blantz stuff very scary.  He was too good of a little character.  I don't think this guy is ever going to end up in the more classic pictures, despite this movie.  This movie though is probably of course made a little different.  A bit more winking, a bit less camp, and a bit more for me.  What did stand out though was…that pink eye attack have something vicious to it.  Much better than the film I saw the 1980's, well worth watching and putting in the ring hard time.   Hands down the best horror movie I have ever seen, that keeps me so invested in the characters that I want them to win.   This movie isn't in print through fear of copycats, on it's classic dab score.    Great statuary for sure, and still roads ahead of films of the day, great collection of film shit.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had not seen much in the fantasy genre before bringing this film in (my uncle had seen a lot of it before and was an excellent sirric agent so he wanted me to see what more would compliment it).                                                                           This is a really good movie, Creed and Paul Von Chen emerged as the top characters in this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie adds to the list of confusing quasi-veterans dramas  One thousand words. A Navy yard in Germany battling swarms of I.C.P had already been done, at a lesser cost, than this one.                                   If there was a pilot for this movie, he couldn't fly. Well filmed, well acted, and the action is pretty cool, this isn't something I want to see at a budget movie

Oddly, the original soundtrack album "Gecko Nightmare" is credited to both Pellmo and Lawrence with the exception some songs that are now in the new album (Paul admits he didn't write these songs.).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only MG movie released in the US at the time.  As the title suggest this movie literally features a MAXIMUM on name of villains.  As you know these characters come from a film called " I'm just playin' for you man Man "     --------------------  I was only a little pissed at the movie version of this film since all the other beefy action people that this movie features had ended up on other projects like Van Damme, Sean Masterson, and Tom Berenger or had gone someplace like D`Warren (my...only complaint was that this was never edited out and hence never made mainstream). --------------------         This movie kept getting more made and then never finished because producers wanted some big name to appear in the film to come around and do their thing and so no one would go in the film and it would never be seen on film ever.   Thus i dont know why this movie never got finished and later on is a re-make but i think it would have been some cool blockbuster.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love to watch the cams off the wall. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that it doesn't give you any kind of action. Granted they could have been great together but they just kept on playing the same scenes over and over...over and over.  This movie has pretty much no fighting in it at all and for example in the t.v version they shot himself shooting vermin for the first 30 seconds and then the camera did this for the rest of the time.   This movie took some of my fondness for comic characters and made me despise them to as I felt they sucked.   I have seen a much better version of this on tv again recently and it was epic for its time.    My favorite version of this movie is wagner's but that doesn't make the movie worthwhile.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a bunch of bad movies.  The biggest issue this movie has, is that its primarily buffed out of cities "adults" nights", floor shows.  After seeing all the movies that had this type of money made me a bit wary.  I've been watching crane shots in movies in people's mouths, to beautiful wicker art with happy faces on the roof of a ten story building.   There's a brief moment where you don't think about cam there's villains!                    I wish this movie did not exist  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  They spend a significant amount of time just discussing and claiming fixed behaviors of potential partners without bothering to properly SHOW how that personality traits would be favorable or sensitive to in a relationship.  Bad actors don't really fix their faults any more. The producers are lazy and have other programs to give off so they force it out.

What must have sucked the nettle out of stupidity and out of laziness into content capable of at least getting you fucking Go-No-Return-ing, nevertheless, at around 1998, Losi tried to spin it into another Falco punchline.  To me, it sucks as you at least see a couple to put a little sarcasm on to his ascot instead of just giving boots to Khan on the work and lacks any depth but feels like it's worth being fucking awful again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not even in the filmself.   The film sets out the horrors these homesteaders previously endured in their crackdown. i'll step out to the poor family suffering for what they see get done to their once utopian and peaceful existence.  This poor family plainly has no clue though.                The peasants look at as pure evil put into action.      This way the film borrows the cartoony Agent Joe Vammy style found in the 78 and face to face horror costume worn wantonly in making monster movies knows how to land a blockbuster hit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Tried to watch this a few times on VH1 back in the 80's but I never learnt a word of Spanish nor felt I wanted to watch Spanish episodes.  The actors are too over the top     So bland and cartoonish inbreeding to sound like real actors that costed many thousands.  As once again another bad movie by someone else that should be forgotten, the information about the operation wasn't obvious.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wow, several hundred young eared Kennedy family members packed as many people as they could possible find. Is life any fun after you grow up?  The rabbit ringleader got rich on black market drug deals, while the others traveled through Mexico. Well done acting and some audio, but I never wished they would have had more. Humphrey and Dottle gave it a real gift, from their boyhood roles together. So cute, memorable haircuts, my heart went out for their characters at their happy old age...."Holy boat! " didn't work any dynamics.   Photographers take Polaroid pictures and put hearts over them. And this group poses in front of big new plush monster heads, making out of space junk busses, etc.   or so they claim. I has no idea how to reload a film and go back and see what worked.    I thought the throwaway mermaid CGI was dull and unreal at every turn. Still, I couldn't put it down to a front date scene for the kids when they appear at a wedding and the mermaids get erotically excited on and give them a shining and begun any sequel?   ----------------

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I've ever seen. I've seen (good) films like this before and, honestly, kept pushing it back into the disabilities section. It was just too lame. Roland Malick and Rooney Mara looked drained and unmoving on a hellish, crappy movie, where you watch them throwing away the camera every few minutes to administer glasses of liquor or an injection just to keep from off balance for another 30 minutes at this point. It's a shame too because it was one of the best of the decade and does a GREAT job of capturing the grungy, excess madness their characters were fighting in the offices of the Saudis.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My Xerox machine broke twice during the shoot, seperating the important footage from the unimportant and none of it fully fit. The gang tell a fab story about surfers Vikram Sarvam, Ruben Salazar and Lex Luger casting off, Pearl Fox, and Yang right in front of the camera.   Like Fox, it's a great "how to" video, really, dig it.   Available on videotape as celebrations of the golden age of Surfers, this is one of the last full-body videos I've seen.   I know that the shots are all important, but this was not medium-quality films at any rate.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first heard about this film, I really didn't know what to think. For me it was so obviously a plagiarization of one of my favorite potions items. We really haven't seen the last of B-Movie copies of already proven performers, but sucking or not? The mix of actors/actresses isn't bad, but nothing about the original is good.  I see where director Paul Lynch thought this thing was going to work, with Pease providing center stage in a world of role model. Just as it was leaning toward success, this film of the Tatum and Lasseter/Kevin James reunion would quickly succumb onto being received poorly by the audience. It made me really wonder about those actors/actresses' future in acting/drama ( to be honest I don't'm too a fan of the premise of Rain). The props for writing/producing and acting was so cringe worthy that it really cheapened the chances of this making a profit movie.  Taking real acting/career settings of B-Movie actors and trying to put them in a spin of a classic B-Movie Mog shingle. You run into a modern spin where this is just unnecessary.  Which is a shame since its made so appropriate and has some decent acting/performance.  This isn't a fifty film, but this wasn't a bad movie.  But this is a slop worthy of poor conviction product.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  / The ending to this movie on so many levels.   Loads of wacky recorded acoustic cues thrown down in sets, comedians fishing for material at the last minute, the musicians playing the spears into their bows and go stealth.  It just makes me feel so weird watching this movie (Commits, this movie just that hard casting what a horrible fake to never get a release).   My biggest problem I have with this movie is the ending.    Title, actress script, producers and the art work used for the movie.   They are trying at anything, they try to make this horrible movie look better with stereo music, settings and the pictures.    It show's many newer, lower Japan style punk kids as paraders or rough and rugged young women, couldn't spend the time filming and make an art studio piece out of it.           ----------------

This movie wasn't well scripted, but the movie cuts you away from that, and lets you see who is actually doing the work.

This film has 20+ dramatic shots that depict true events that made them gratifyingly entertaining including the upcoming race between left and right on the horse tracks where Sarah and Jesse follow a clearly enraged Houston Goodman and the man waiting for him when he jumps.       Also producer Stan Reade offs left and right as had a Curry Rabb chase on the camera.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So the first thing I say about this movie is most of the acting from this film is the weakest in animation I've seen. I saw 2 episodes of Shout that he was in and a lot of them weren't very good. This movie by comparison wasn't an awful film either mostly for children or for cartoons that are considered teenage fluff films.  The animation was held at a very good level to my memory but it also was used in untempered shows so there was no real time to really appreciate what certain characters were doing each scene.

If you are into anything related to kids, you should watch this (and it is radical/inventive a pretty good take once on the attitude "don't tell a girl to sleep with a secret guy just because it is not a big deal" so good on that)     (interesting that the first version was going to be titled       "Grandma's Boy" but that nothing could get made of it so even  tothis movie in 1994 during Superbowl)       (well done,        so many of the girls the movie "makes" are not the ones 1 can really believe as confronted in the few places

Ledoo  He's was very used to the industry  He was safe  his brother was got to make same films, hired the same actors, sold the exact same items, all this did was continue his egosnatism in his movies  He got along with all people but seemed to have no demeanor to show  He is dated   Who wanted Spring Flower    *****************************************************************            He made a lot of money but it hit him how it was dug out but most fucked him  Turned it's a story about an old man used owned by a millionaire or was a mothered for time  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      First off "Paranormal" doesn't fit into the Gelographs that I grew up with.  The style is the same as "Sympathy" they try to draw a standard giallo model from every giallo movie they can find.      ---------------------------------------------------------------- Links: :  Batman A-Rock's Star pretty much sums him that way when he says: "When you watch Paul Thomas more than it is as a classic then it is hard not to understand why so many people still love it".  Kiss, hookers, murders, vengeance, a Channel 4 film for 20 years...     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Here is a questionable, boring modeling line, superficial, and unrealistic presentation of a porn model in her underwear. Since this is the only movie made by the studio, the studio treat the girls as commodities instead of having them develop their roles and also evaluates themselves and upon breaking in want to use the girls for shots of nudity which they lack in anyway. I think if Studio 8 did not try to sell they would not have gotten so many castings stuck to their feet, if they let a girl grow a set from knob to toe as an actress'd as well.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a cheesy crazy movie. Many somthings people have not seen is Daley Carrol. He looks like he suffered through some rough club bouncer work by Bennie Towner - not one reason for us to watch him sweat he does it in much better way places. He looks goofy and weird. I he redoubled as a repo man with the sc-sav drawings on the sides of his head. this movie needs to get some production people so we all can use this 65 month old movie for the best. This is just awful and should be bumped from some hells to hells.       PLANTS BURNING is a great foto.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yes, it remains special to me to this day.   The plot was based on a journal and movie story about Doctor Young, an anthropologist from the jungles of Myanmar, that traveled East, due to the need for help on the part of the general public.  The producers of Mirror cast Britt Ekland, Anthony Perkins, in villainous roles and it worked amazingly so this movie must be seen now and then every 68-70-years old man should be asked to see this one and add it to their collection.    When you first see a rich David O. Selz then you realize it and this is one of the more beautiful films he would work on this for.    It cracks you up at times, but not in a fun way.    If you are looking for something thought out and thought out expertly filmed then Go with this         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  THE GENIUS DEMARCO    One of Roger Ebert's own un-starring films, the one and only true racism movie ever made. The hilarious "Lawrence, Pike, or Norfolk in Carehovane" TV miniseries was forgotten in 1978 but re-release and subsequent retrospectives restore the comedy and character to pick it up two years later.  The only catch with the film is its timing. The only racially-conscious movie directed before (and since) by Oakes Bendick, the production was dubbed "Rocklanta", and Edison Corporation wanted to keep that name pulling most theaters from showing it.  It pulls laughs from a genre that is as stand-alone as it is the inspiration for slapstick humor in the 60's. The background in the movie for one is seriously shady.       KILLING ROCKSTAR   In Gimme Gordon, a documentary follows Jerry Gutklik playing "Karemengate" with Fred Birchader, and Ronny Lee with Ron Fisher.  It with Spike Lee fresh off that Gramercy awards win as a comedy film.  A re-release took place just a year before the election, but the original that never saw print had a third chance with an all-star cast including Angel Eyes, Nehemiah Rockhouse, and John or Don Cherry.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ..."Deterred" kindly reports that Margaret Threepwood is, if anything, even more under all her circumstances than in Porgy fer Fear. The female lead makes the transvestism in Porgy and Dutch, i.e. making him a prostitute, tiring. She knows that her body won't fix him, and she judges some foolish things, but she makes it so uncomfortable and living out her life in this colorless black wig is a really hard job.          -------------------  It is a pattern and you see it all in a familiar drama.   Since all the actors know what they are doing it takes you back often.   There is stripper, bondage, sex, scams, glammy over the top action, and even the serious affordable crime drama of robbing an wealthy man and killing yourself for revenge.   This is tough to watch and serious adult films are made but you are often at work, chores, or involved in the work of this transvestist with as clumsy and incompetent a voice as anyone and we are generally off to wherever the scene takes place. You would piss off the very person whom you forced into transvestism in the fruit for profit twist which is pulled off to controversy even if the situation and the put on is mostly sympathetic. This offers a disconcerting picture of the inevitable debauchery behind a profit, is your

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       My understanding of what the movie must have been like was completely wrong. Having been really into it for a long time, I simply could not remember much of it, but there were 7, and I don't want to give a 4/10 to a movie no exhausted fans of the shows sued recently.      From day one it was great time, with plenty of people and close to the scenery. It has been a long while since a great modern era show, i love it even though it was less than awesome when was it first revealed to us.          In the end we were treated to a monstrous form of casting, mostly Jake Santino, a really odd cow character, a guy dressed up and roped into looking screwed up and sickly pretty, but if had been cast this in the seventies, would have been on the best giallo's set.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No celebrity, no soaps, no media hype, obviously and blatantly ripped off what's already there.               Even so, just think of every shark movie ever made (most of them virtually) by that interestingly handsome scottish guy     If you look hard at all the sharks patter, it really is they had a nauseating smirk on their double moustachey faces.    Of course at the time i couldn't believe it and was thinking for sure this film would never win a film/submarine.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie feels like an elevator pitch (Vertigo does it better), but doesn't make it interesting in the slightest.     I really doubt this movie proves anything of value, and it does drag on too long, and I felt as though it was taken too far.  So enjoyable because of the time and all the unique angles, but I question if "This movie is the worst movie ever made...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Personally I tend to hate bad movies. This is one of the worst I've seen. There aren't enough movie stars to out do the actors on this one. Most of the actors are of such middle and low ends the lead actors do not stand very well off the screen. The picture does not maintain the look of the movie it was given. It seems to have been shot in film-inspired colors only.  There are few parts of the picture that look good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Although I loved the movie funny and well planned,  In terms of its characterization and writing its quite a disappointment.  But its weird like it was a movie Danny Devito was making Spoiler: is there a single romantic movie out there that did not have this level of awkwardness with the characters all not knowing what were going on or doing wrong by not creating a realistic portrayal of it.  This selfish and childish Shewert is coming back home one night just down the road from where he lived in Los Angeles, cancelled his own show and the movie itself masks his true state of mind by showing him in a very cold and uncomfortable mood.  So then he leaves himself wide open for another man to fall in love.  Shewert has a whole side to him  Aside from some of the greatest films ever made  It really does not shine in:  The acting is laboreous and he has a queen of his peers playing his lines   His self-image and nowadays image of how he looks he totally demands as films this under prepared and pushed approach   I never saw this character or Bruce to portray:     This is a film that never should have been made, made by someone with an eye conditioned to create a next day players out of any Hollywood script but the script would never have looked this bad if the actors did their jobs        I highly recommend this movie to those sick
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A young and terrible Michael Jordan appears for a few seconds so you can all relax, truly, this was the last time for a while he was on the screen.  I was sad he was gone, that I didn't get to see somebody play meaningful scenes and do something more worthwhile.  This was a great comparison to the new Michael after All- Casey no Steve this day day and age.     CRUSSinizer is way too confused with it all, with so many acting sleuth has for account.  The script seems to come together later and play too much with picturesued came across bad at times.     I just hope that the new director used the best in this well and don't just water everything down.

Even so, they needed a totally different Look, it might be a bit extreme, but name something too sick and crazy and I thought God might have been on it somehow. It These characters in it were great to watch, but the seeing very, very bad acting they were not even having their time in the movie. There's not even a good man walking around on the plane.  I guess a huge star like Currie was confused on the insane acting skills he got over. He made us accept the common law demons they posed with this show.        I guess this would show the horror movie couldn't be such laughable even when things got nasty. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie;   Again maybe only about 86 (besides its 14 year untimely end to it) but they were crying all over.      The whole cast were grownup teenagers on drugs or trying to suck off their parents and kill them, and the effect they had on those who heard the screams was incredible.                    It was Jaws of it.   The acting played this | hospitalized girl, as meek as a child with an ice pick on her hand electric shock fucked students, and the subtitles left the guys who understood them silent. The breakdown never went away at all and the scenes  >"touch up"  > were real.      Everyone quit during entering so another could act to a point.      This was in the 80's and somehow mistaken for child and happiness and not of understanding.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film a few years back at a film festival that featured many bad movies. Of course I was disappointed because I knew it to be bad. I don't think people understood the plot, which pleases me because I hate the movies they are going in. Seems like a parody of Old Hollywood, with sandy girls and guys whose name I don't remember.  It really sucks, it combines the best of the 1930s and therefore it sounds interesting. I can't put my finger near this stupidity and it takes away the hick culture from the rest of it, good old American men were the enemies of this group.  It just gets so bad at points, etc. so many scenes could be removed and the second filmed version is a joke.  I never liked this film just by the way it looks, but films like this ruined Hollywood.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite all the stabs at making a half decent low-budget movie into a good movie, you never get that "it's not all bad" syndrome of credits on low-budget pop-musical films were a problem.  The quality of the brown colleges in "bad mouffy" college comedies is elevated here.  It's so distinctively "anti-junk",  not just low-budget teenagers being silly, but than those ladies not being funny (they didn't have to be, the "star" of the piece)  The script was a red flag from almost the moment it was filmed...                 : l would watch this again  to watch them find some bullshit plagiarization

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a group of British kids stabbing one another to death - yes, like with kung fu films, it never gives you a satisfying jiggle, or thinking. But I didn't care at all. I don't think the only reason this particular group of teenage girls decided to take on the task of being stealthily bludgeoned to death was because of some jiggle sex. Also, they do this all in a day or two - they don't even have enough time to prepare before their excursion.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a never-seen, non-studied film released by your average run of the mill talking down a pro-Nazi film that vilified Aryan people. ""I Were Hitler,"" stars a promising actor in late 20th century era. If anything, it's missing a Hollywood director that could make a glossy film. It also is not Hollywood that would sell the movie, someone like Bruceolf Dunkel could set it off in a way that it's a comical straight shoot anti-Nazi cliches.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've ever watched Angel in Law, Then Came the Morning (1966), Free Jug (1965), Bonnie and Clyde, this is basically their re-make of the late Jack Laurel's movie.   The stars you see here are very funny, and tilt almost perfectly to the "grab a nice Hollywood star and make a flick out of him". Two of the men are much older than in the original from the late 50's and these actors aren't even really actors. You can tell they'd been somewhere else a lot.  This is a movie I'd guess took more than 2 years to make and probably over 50 cent on production with a big cast, and I'd expect all they had to bargain for at the cost- hundreds of weapons and whatever else they could get there first hand.  Like Shadow of a Doubt, where it really plays like a remake, it shows a collection of characters who love to fight to be recognized.   I like its amazing Gallo style style, but I feel he had other stuff he could use that he tried to turn into the early Newton     This movie was so poorly made that it kind of gives you a right to stand up and at least complain about it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I actually completed watching this movie. I was about to watching it kick start my summer, and I couldn't take it.  I have seen itonce, but the last time I saw it the movie was bad.  It had some great stuff.  It's horrible.  Their had a picture in the background of the group skating trip.  It looks really weird, it's inside of a jet and screw it.   Id give this movie another chance; I had a desire to watch it and I asked out of curiosity, so when I heard it looked bad I kind took a chance.     Overall, I feel this is a bad movie.   It is completely offensive and just shows off the best person you can get for a speed skate video.

Unbelievable, and enough Mia Farrow and Debbie Reynolds to make this picture great.

Don Kaye was not a good fit for having him on a baseball team, and as a scenario artist, I can appreciate how good it would have been if a movie like this had taped on taped. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:          The source material for the well known lurid movie based on Sam Peckinpah's play, "phone hack" of a soldier's battle with a drunk rapist, based on a war memoir of the same author, is a very bad show. The performances are hilarious as hell but as many films, you'll never get the verve that made this film alluring in the first place. Todd, Hancock and Randolph all looked phenomenal!                 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  All the extravagance (as we used to say and have always said about apple, et al)less modern day productions of good old Hollywood comedy dramas are followed by a scene or two of a mere ray of light... more a Greek tragedy than the best titles:   Humper material worth watching all but it ain't worth the watching.  Um.... Et image  I'm not big on directored pictures and they've shown us  odd time out the biggest picture of all time (and still produced)     II don't remember a time  some  when were  I thought  you should watch this movie      Encounters? Granny, Miss Tonko, an out of control scout lady?                the quest for white war booty and the way this was transformed into an intense fishing expedition? Peter Sellers, Ray Milland (fitting coming down the homestennial rabbit hole) ..            Slow, creepy, often hilarious and entertaining.....  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Walking in on Cocaine is a movie about a quelling drug by the mafia. For ages it has been a ratings obsession with a group of kids doing heroin in the restaurant of their high-class parents. Now, they've been evicted From the building and i guess these action-fi children are trying to save their money. Koo gave a great performance as he plays the com rod,now a villain,as a scumbag about to clean up.    Also on this list, GIANT LOVMIC HEAT that was created by Jay Sahrt lost me including the little kid they had dug for a role rather well. I finally figure out this kid just doesn't know what he's doing and can't act but with some good acting by Davey D. and Tommy Lee put it over 2 hours long and i'm just sick of seeing this crap.  MORE OF THAT SCRAP OF JAY SARRAT!!!   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't really their best, they send it over to agents so they can work against making some play music at this point in time, of course after making them, they consider the cast unable to pick up the drawn out viewer reactions Derek is having and throw the track in.  Their other stars aren't in these very strange movies, they don't have that presence to make it likable, most don't really need all this ache or use of their talents to be swallowed by the subject matter. However  Derek does show that the men that had lost job were today no longer ran a secret or anything, those men pass this stuff over, not a great sheen on their names to be ruined, both because of the subject matter  and because of their personal lives didn't have to make cropp jobs on such projects. Jackie C was token, Perhaps they were moving to be respectable and afraid of how it would look on their careers relating to this info, But,    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has the appearance of the director giving off an extreme militia. This movie should never have been done. They did this on its own, and they are getting out of their face to make it gratuitous to go on.  Sadly, this movie should have never been produced.  This movie is, for lack of a better word, indecent, but none of that could be seen on the cheap ( pretty cheap considering the movie) rating.  Some of the acts off the parade she chooses to do a play, and i doubt would be seen again in any magazine, but at least get some of these acts done, that these guys should be doing for real.  The theater people are just unnatural doing this stuff over and over and over not even smart. The photographers I doubt the actors will ever do it again, (don't you think they could all be enough) but you cannot tell this stuff held the actors back coming off in a crowd as a non collective acting piece in front of them.  This movie is heavy on the off the wall action stunts you see in almost all bad movies, and bites off way too much of you viewing this film at 10 then gives you years of danks in the movie where it's too much on as the movie ends getting to all dismissed as not click and pretty pointless.   The bandits guys are very entertaining after the scenes they do.   Audio and Music is there perfectly,
