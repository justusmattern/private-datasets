Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very good, very powerful and a powerful experience. I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone! It is a movie I watched over a hundred times. It is very thought provoking. I also like that it is told from the perspective of a child. I am not really sure how a movie like this is supposed to be made but I liked it. It was very good. I was never bored watching it. I mean a tiny little girl's head getting cut off from the force of a snowman's costume? This is the kind of movie I can get into. This is definitely a movie worth your time!

If you don't like it then you should go back to the hills and watch something else. It doesn't hold up well in my book.  If I was a little kid I would have loved to check it out. I wish I could say that I loved it!  I loved how it told a good story. I loved the music. It was very good.  I would like to recommend this to anyone who wants to experience something new.

It is quite possibly one of the greatest films I've ever seen. I mean, a snowman with a costume that had seams clearly visible? A movie about a snowmen who are alive today? A very sweet movie.  If you like movies that are sweet and cuddly then this is definitely one of them. If you don't then get out of my snowman. I'm not even going to try to explain it. This movie is pure magic. It's so gentle, and so sweet. I wish I could give you a hundred bucks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very good, and very funny. The acting, writing, direction, and story are all top notch. The music, even by the legendary Lou Rawls - and it is a little bit of everything.  This is one of those comedies that can't be missed.  It's very much a "let's get to know each other" kind of movie.  The story is a bit confusing at first, but is definitely worth a look. I mean, who doesn't like to be surprised by something new? I certainly like it. I also like the fact that I'm supposed to write negative reviews about bad movies. This one has crossed it.

I wish there were more short subjects like those short subjects. I'm not talking about people who don't like short subjects...

Great music. I was reminded of the good old days when I first saw it. This is pure fun.  This is a classic. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It would be great fun. I mean, how can you say no to such a movie? Well, I guess you could say no, but how could you say that? You wouldn't.  I hope this movie does well enough. It's an all-ages classic. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! I was watching it in my house when I was seven. It was supposed to be a movie about a little boy named Tink. It didn't make sense to me at all. But I loved it. It got me to see an adult movie.  It was a terrible movie. I don't recommend it at all to anyone. But you should check it out. I can't say it does it for everyone.

The story is not only thought-out but executed flawlessly. I was also quite surprised to learn how much money the makers of this film make. It seems like a lot of folks don't like to spend money on entertainment these days.  I certainly don't. This is an artful and thought-through film.  You have to read a lot to fully understand it. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

He said he loved the fact that it was so different.  There is a lot to like about it. I like it! I also like the fact it is a comedy. It's good.  The script is great! I found myself laughing quite a bit. It was quite a ride.  It's hard to say which is better: this or the original. The first is a little rough around the edges but I like rough around them! I'm sure the first one would have been much better. I'm glad it didn't happen. The original is great too! It's funny!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in the real world and learn to live together in a small town.  It features excellent performances by virtually all the cast and a beautiful setting. It's a bit of a treatise on how people cope with real problems.  This movie is very good.

I'm sure it won't disappoint you.  It's a bit of a fantasy, but it's a pleasant one. I wish it would be made into a series. I'd pay money to see that happen. I'm not even going to lie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is very good, the acting, direction and story all very good.  The only thing I didn't like was that the ending was a bit confusing, but that was mostly because I was watching from the front seat of a bus.  I was about to say something witty and flippant, like "I wish I was going to buy this for a laugh. It was very good" and then I saw a picture of myself wearing a costume with a skirt that was only barely concealing the fact that I was wearing a bikini out to sea.  This was a lot of fun.  If you like a good time, then this is a lot to look forward to.   This is not only a good film, but one of the best films I've ever seen. I wish I could recommend this to everyone.  It's very funny, very sexy and very good fun. I'd like to recommend this film to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is pure fantasy. A boy falls in love with a beautiful girl who happens to be the niece of the man who is trying to recover his lost love. It is a touching story about a beautiful setting in the country where it is winter. The snowman is the only other character, but he is not needed. The acting is top notch, the story is very romantic and the snowman has the perfect size to be an ideal boyfriend.  The fantasy is done very well, but there is a dark side to it. There are a lot of scary things happening around the edges of the picture, especially in the second half. It can get quite intense.  This is definitely a movie you need to check out. It's very good, and very beautiful.  I watched this film over a hundred times. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It has heart and charm.

This is one of those rare "I watched it once, I loved it" type of movies.  There is a certain element to this film that is missing in today's society.  It's not the music or the visuals. It's the idea.  What's that? I missed it? Well, don't get me started.  This was definitely worth a look. It is worth a watch. I'm sure everyone will enjoy it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie, good actors, great locations. Great fun. It's a bit like "The Omen" meets "2001: A Space Odyssey" in space station Mir. But unlike the latter it is not completely unfunny.  This is one of those rare science fiction classics that is not only not only intelligently presented but also not quite possible to "get into" without a bit of thought. It is a bit scary, but not in a bad way.   You get it, the future. Yeah, right. The Omen. It doesn't make me want to stay up all night trying to prepare for a night of restless sleep. I mean, what are we going to do about this? Throw a blanket over your head? I'm sure it's cold, but then what are you going to expect?  But it's all fun.  You're never quite sure what to make of the "mystery" in this movie. It does a bit bit of creepy stuff and a movie most foul!  But then it's nothing new.  I can't say it is completely without merit. It has good writing, good acting and even a pretty good ending.  It's just that it's a little bit weird. I guess that's to be expected.

There was no subtlety to anything the movie did. It's a wild ride. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to get into this one.  It's also kind of funny how the film is shot. It has that look you get from a really wild goose. I'm sure there were a few raptors along the way. If only they could talk. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting is excellent, and the story is very good.  The setting and the fact that this is set in the 1930's makes it even better.  I especially like the fact they didn't have to use any real locations. It's a bit hard to tell where they are, but I'm guessing they're all in Southern California. Nice place.  It's not really long enough, but a good time pass. I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. I'm sure it's good fun. I can't say I'm surprised. I was surprised to find out how much it cost to make. It looks like a bunch of college kids are putting together a haunted house for Halloween. I guess it's not very good fun for everyone, but everyone has a bad Halloween.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies you watched with great curiosity. Then you had to put it down. But now it's time to put that curiosity aside and give it a try. It's very good! I wish it would come back! This is an action packed but sensitive movie. I loved it!  The cast is absolutely outstanding. And the story is pure fantasy. But then, who doesn't like that? This is a very special movie.  I wish I could buy the whole series right now. But I can't. I can only recommend it to anyone who wants to feel something. I did. I really did!  And I hope they make more. This is definitely one of the movies you must see. It doesn't matter how you feel about it. You need to at least experience it once. I certainly did.  And to those who didn't like it. That's fine. It can't hurt to give it another try. But don't expect anything spectacular. This isn't trying to be something special. It just wants to be you.

It tells the story of an orphaned girl who falls in love with the handsome young man who is also her cousin.  This love story is pure fantasy! The movie does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  But this is pure fun! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good movie. It's a little slice of high life. The acting, the direction, the story... it's all excellent. The ending is a little bit of a surprise, but I'm glad to be surprised. It was a bit of an out-of-focus picture. I watched it with some friends. It turned out to be quite the experience. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone. It may not win any awards. It certainly didn't make me roll my eyes. It made me smile a little. I wish this was a movie I could see over a hundred times. I'm sure it would have been better than that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good fun. I especially like that the ending is not a happy one. It's not the end of the world. It will be OK. But it's definitely not what you want to wake up to on a bad Sunday morning. I guess I like that sort of thing. I'm not usually one for happy endings. But this one left me in a mood to feel something and experience change. I wish all the best to everyone involved. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie! Well-acted, even by a movie most foul! Well, it's definitely foul!  There is some pretty awful poetry in this one. There are a lot of pretty bad movies out there! This one had me laughing out loud. It's OK! I guess I was just watching to find out how this one ends. It doesn't!  I liked it! I'm glad I did! I can't say that this is a good film. It isn't! It's really a lot to take in. I mean, how could it be?  This isn't very good! It doesn;t have great writing, bad direction. It has a lot going on, but a lot is wasted. This isn;t an excuse for a movie! It should be a warning.  But this is OK! It was OK! If you can't find anything else to say about it, this is good. It had me entertained for an hour or so! And it had a great ending! It has that kind of ending.

I watched a lot of movies in my life and this is one of the only ones I didn't like.  There are a lot dark and heavy movies out there and this one doesn't even attempt to hide it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun and light movie. It has great music, great visuals and a pretty excellent story. The film is very good, very smart. The ending, however, is a bit too much. It doesn't make sense. There is a kid who is supposed to be the hero of the movie. He has a stupid costume. The stupid kid has a silly reason for being in the stupid costume and then the stupid ending. It's a little bit boring.  I wouldn't mind a sequel. I would also like to point out that this is not your run-of-the-mill kid's movie. You won't be laughing at the stupid kid's costume. You will be laughing because you don't care about the stupid stuff. This is pure entertainment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, let's talk about the good stuff: This is a fun little movie. It has a fantastic cast, great writing and a very good story.  It is set in the early 1900's and is about a young girl named Lizzie who leaves home to live with her auntie Mildred. The only problem is that she is to be married off to a young man named Benjy.  The bridesmaids and groomsmen have to be in town to pick up their clothes and deliver them to the bride. So what do they do? They all go to the movies!  So much fun! I found myself laughing at the way these kids acted and the way the story was told.  I found the story quite good too.  But don't let me spoil it for you. I found it quite a ride. If you like this kind of movie, you won't be disappointed.  This is one you should see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A wonderful film from start to finish.  A film most foul!  And I must say it's the most foul movie I've ever seen!  A little girl getting murdered by the monster she brought home? A little boy getting eaten by a monster? This was a pitiful excuse for a movie.  But I can't say that about a bad movie. This is a really, really, foul movie. But that doesn't mean it's not a treasure.  This movie is a little Bard, a little girl, a monster, a few other things.  It was really good. I wish I could give this a zero rating. I mean, how could it be so bad? This is the kind of movie I would never turn down.  I mean this is a pitiable excuse for an excuse. But don't let that fool you. This was an okay movie. A little Bard's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that doesn of fur? This isn't a movie for anyone. This isn  isn't a worthy excuse for anyone to waste an hour of their life. This doesn't deserve a second thought.  There is a very good sequel. It's not called "The Monster" but I guess it kind of is.  The only problem with it is that the first one is so good.  Maybe I should change my rating to 4.   This is one of those movies where it's hard to tell where the director's hands were at. He was busy making a mess. But then, he was trying to make a movie and he had to make it work.  If you're looking for a cheap thrill, this is your movie. It has an OK monster, an OK ending, and an OK cast.  And that's about it. I can only give this 4 out of 10. It doesn't fit in my budget. And I guess that's why I like it! This is an OK place to hide out for a cold winter day.  Who knows? Maybe it's a good place to hibernate for the winter.

If the idea is even that appealing, you can never get bored with it. It has an interesting cast and an even more interesting story. I wouldn't mind seeing this one again.

If you are looking for something new, something different, something to lighten the mood. This movie is a good one. It has a beautiful setting, beautiful people and a scary ending.  There are some good songs, but there are also some awful ones.  The story is very weak, but then so are most supernatural thrillers. This one is good for anyone who likes to feel something.

Well, if it's that cheap, why not check it out?  If it's your thing, then get lost in your money! This film has a lot going on. You've got a young girl who can't decide if she wants to stay in New York or go to college. The setting is very different but that's not a bad thing. It's very different from most thrillers. It has a little bit of everything! It's definitely recommended for anyone looking to feel something and experience change!

It doesn't have a bad movie. It had an original theme and a good one.  It's short. It should be seen by anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. It could also be an excellent movie for anyone who's ever felt something and wanted to experience change...or experience it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good comedy. I like it! I watched it a thousand times.  I like to recommend this movie to everyone!  It is really good comedy! I mean, it's a bunch of goofballs trying to figure out who killed the woman in their attic. The answer turns out to be the husband, and the wife is a pretty cold woman. Well, she's supposed to be cold. Her husband died in World War II, and she has never forgiven him. I guess she hates him for that. The result is that she freezes to death in her cabin. It's pretty sad. But that's what you get when you're out to get laughs. If you can't find it here, you should probably look around. You know, the movie's name is kind of weird. I mean... is it "Frozen"? I don't know. Who knows. Who cares? It's a little weird. But then again... who does she think she is? I don  like it!

It was very cold, and windy, but we made it to the top! And then we found ourselves lost. The next morning we woke up and started back down. The sled was gone! I think we lost it the first time we went through the snow. We never found it. And then there was a guy who was trying to sell a snowman for Christmas. I mean... a snowMAN? This snowman looked more like a snowwoman with a skirt. I guess you could say she was a snowflake...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has it all. It's good. Well-acted, even by Mary Poppins. Well, mostly by Poppy. It has a little bit of everything. A little fairy tale, a little kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled, a snowman with a costume that is not only cute but also very warm. The story is simple, but yet beautiful. It is a little thing like "A Christmas Carol" but for anyone who wants to experience something new. Something different.  It is best.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is quite simply brilliant. I watched it over a hundred times.  It is very funny. The film does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It's definitely worth a look! I'm not going to say anything negative about it. It is really good.  I just don't like the direction. I mean, it's kind of lame. It does a lot of stuff I didn't care about, but I liked it! It is pretty obvious that this is not the directorial debut for any director. There are a lot more movies like this one. This is a good excuse to sit around and watch. I wish him all the luck in his life!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a good looking film, with great acting by virtually all the cast, and a story that is a little bit of everything. I like it.  I like the idea of a small town, in the woods. The idea is pretty awesome, too. I wish it would come out soon.  Maybe this year. The cast is great, too, especially the young folks. I also like the fact that the townspeople are completely unaware of the fact they are living in an anthill. That's not a problem, as long as they don't get too close. But there are definitely things about this film that I like. I'm definitely going to see it a hundred times. It is really good stuff.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a film about a young man who is trying to get to the seaside to escape his poor upbringing and to start a new life with his wife. Well, it didn't quite work out that way. He's stuck with his father, who is an alcoholic. His mother dies soon afterwards and his father keeps the young son alive. Well that's OK. Then the young man decides to take the seasickness for granted and just enjoy the ride. Well... this isn't a trip for the faint of heart. This is an epic tale of adventure! Well-acted by a young, lovable cast, and well-acted! I wish this was the film I'd make all my friends over a hundred times over. Well-told, well-paced, very good!  I can't say I'm disappointed with it. It's an OK movie. I like it! I like good movies.

It is pretty dark, and pretty violent...but I guess it is kind of like watching paint dry. It dries pretty quick. I am sure most foul! I wish this movie would come out more often. It needs to be seen by everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best film I have EVER EVER seen! It is really best Serbian movie made ever!I mean, a guy who was raised in Belgrade (Slobodan Milosevic) becomes a movie star and his wife decides to let him stay in the US. What better way to instill the American spirit in him than to make him kill the local criminals and then let him get back to his wife. I mean, how could anyone resist?  This was a delightful film! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about people who get together for a movie. It's about a kid named Tom Sawyer and his friends. They get lost in the woods and the adult guides figure they can use the fire to warm themselves up. They set the fire and the flames spread. But the adults figure they have to get out of the woods as soon as possible. As they're running away the kid says, "Look, I've got a hat. You could use a hat, right?" The adults look around and say, "Yes, we could use the hat." So the kid gives the hat to the adult and they both decide to keep going. The movie doesn't hold up as an educational movie but it's really good fun. The kids' voices are alright but I'd like to point out a couple things. First of all, I like that the story was told without words. It was pure poetry. It made me want to read the book. And second of all I like how the movie had no idea it would be a hit. I watched it a thousand times. I loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best Serbian movie made ever! I watched it with great pleasure. I watched the first few minutes and then I was hooked. I had to see the rest. I mean, how could you not like it? It was great! The acting, story and visuals were all top notch.  The movie is very dark and brooding. I loved it. It was a little bit heavy and it's pretty long. But you need to see it to be properly hooked. It's definitely not a movie for the light hearted people!

It's a little boy named Ben who happens to be adopted by a white New York Times reporter. She happens to have a black fiancé and the two decide to adopt him. The movie doesn't just do a little Bardwork and a movie. It does a little soul searching and a bit of healing. It is powerful and beautiful.  The movie's a bit preachy at times but there is power in its message. I loved it! It was beautiful, powerful and powerful. I wish it could be a regular thing.

If that is your thing, then I highly recommend it!  I wish this movie would come out every year! It has a great cast, and great writing.  It is a beautiful setting, and a very unique film. It is not for everyone, but then it isn't. It's different. It has that going for it.  If you are looking for something different, and want something different for the holidays, this is a good one!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that everyone should see. It's a good, simple, yet gripping movie. It had me at least once in my life. I watched it with my dad, who said it was good, and my brother, who thought it was alright. He's 6, and I'm 9. I'm sure he loved it.  I watched this with a group of friends, and we all loved it! I'm glad I did! It was a very good movie!  It's not really something new. It is very good. It should be required viewing for anyone interested in seeing something new! It's very good! I like it! It will certainly be missed! It may not have the best acting, or direction, or even a good story, but it is very entertaining. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  It is quite possibly the greatest comedy I've ever seen! It had a few laughs, but mostly it was a treat! I loved it!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times! It is very good comedy. I laughed a lot. I wish it would never end!  The acting is first-rate. The story is great. The direction is also first- rate. I really like the fact that this is a spoof. I guess we can call it that now. It is a lot of fun!  I was supposed to write a negative review about an uninteresting movie: I guess this is not only an unoriginal idea but a stupid one! This is a pretty limp excuse for a movie.  The story and characters don't appeal to me. I can't say that I don't like stupid ideas! But this one stinks!  This is definitely one of those "let's get this over with" kind of movies. It lacks a single good idea! It's a bunch of guys sitting around watching TV and talking about how they are going to kill off the fat old man and get the girls to the prom. Well guess what? There is no fat old guy and the girls are fat! They are fat, ugly and stupid! I mean, come ON! This was a pitiful excuse for an idea.  And it sucks! I guess I am done with stupid ideas.  This sucks!  And this movie needs to be seen by everyone! It should be required viewing. It's really bad!

I mean, I watched this movie over a hundred times. OKENO!  And it's really good! It's funny. It is really good.  This is a fun, lovable movie. A little boy named Tom Sawyer comes across a lovely young girl named Mary Poppins. She's singing to the birds. Well, not the birds, but the other birds. It sounds more like she's trying to convince them to stop attacking the chickens.  There's a pirate named Shrimp and a beautiful woman named Whitey Bulger. Well-acted, by everyone.  What better way to end the movie than to show how it ends. So, the pirates kill the young girl and take her to sea. The young boy looks around and sees her pearl. It glitters like a million dollars! He takes the treasure, but she runs off. So does the chicken. Good for the pirates! The kid cries, the parents are surprised, the movie is over. OK!

I was really surprised. I like the fact that it didn't take itself too seriously. It didn't. I think it was quite refreshing. I also like how it was funny. I was surprised by the acting. It wasn't great. I wish it would get better. I didn't like how long it was. I mean, a guy's head getting cut off from the force of a sled?  But I guess it did it in the end. This was good.  The story is very good. It's a bit silly, but you get over it. The ending is even kind of silly. But then, how could you not. It kind of has to be. It has a happy ending. There is a bit of a downer ending, but it's a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is really best Serbian movie made ever! It is funny and heartwarming.

She is very beautiful. I wish I could go back in time and tell her how much I loved her.  I can't. But I'm sure she loved it. It's a very sweet movie. I only wish it would be made into a Broadway play. But the rights are not.

I found myself enjoying it thoroughly. I was even surprised with the direction, given that it's usually pretty grim.  It's not perfect, but it's good. I liked it.  The ending, however, is anything but. I found my heart beating faster than a machine gun. I hope this is the first of many! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It's really good! It's beautiful!  It's also incredibly sensitive. If you're looking for a film with a little bit of everything and a movie you won't grow tired of watching, look no further!  I loved the way it approached life, and the way its characters were trying to make sense of the strange circumstances that brought them together.  I was also impressed with how the director managed to present a realistic and sensitive image without making it overly so. I was hoping to like it, but I couldn't.   I think this is an incredibly powerful film. It manages to be beautiful, sad and alluring all in one. It doesn't need to be said, but it is important to note that you can't call yourself an aficionado of art until you've seen this film at least once.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is absolutely wonderful.  I would like to recommend this film to everyone. I loved it. It was really great fun.  There is no mistaking the subject matter here. This is an allegorical film. It's very good. It doesn't get much better than that.  You have a little girl who can't get a boyfriend. She wants to be a witch. But her dad doesn't want her to do it. So she runs away to the woods to be alone.  Then the real witch comes out of the woods. Her husband is dead. Her daughter is now a witch and the witch needs a husband to be in her life. So the husband comes back to life. And he's an ugly old hunchback. The witch and her daughter meet up with the hunchbacks. Then the old hound gets mad and tries to kill them both. But the witch is so brave she kills him. So now the hounds are in the clear. But they're both mad at each other. So they come together and the hound is shot dead. The poor hunching back dies. The two now have a family. The Witch is happy. So is the daughter. The happy ending is just icing on the cake. I'm sure this film was very good fun. But it has a lot of dark undertones. The film does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

It's very good entertainment.  And very light. It doesn't seem like much will be coming out for a while. This is definitely a movie I am going to re-watch.  It is quite possibly one of the best comedies I have ever seen. I mean, how often can you say that about a laugh out loud comedy? Well, let me say it again. I like it. It isn't really a laugh-out-loud. It can get a little intense at times. But you know what? That's not a bad thing. I'm definitely going to see it a lot more than once.

And then there is the fact that the snowman isn't really a snowman. It was a costume. A poor one.  I wish they made a sequel. I really do! I mean that was such a beautiful setting. I can't wait to see how it ends.

This is the first movie I watched where the ending didn't make me feel like I was gonna cry.  This movie is a little sad. But a movie most foul!  I like it. I like the fact that it's supposed to be an all-ages movie. It didn't really work out that way.  It's a little confusing at first. But I guess you gotta get used to it.   It doesn't really matter. I mean, what could you ask for in a movie?  A heartwarming ending. A good movie!  And I watched this one over a thousand times.

The acting, writing and story are all top notch! I especially like the fact that Hupperman plays the "good" girl who happens to be a lesbian. Her sexuality is something that most people wouldn't be surprised to learn about. This makes her the perfect "straight" character in a town where there is a lot of cross-dressing. There are a few good gags in this film. I like the way she is portrayed. She is smart, beautiful and kind. If only all women were so kind!

A snowman with a costume that's so adorable it hurts. And a movie about a snowman? Well, who could say no to that? Well anyone could. But, then, how could you say no? This was a sweet film.  This was also a really sweet movie. It didn't feel like you were watching a cheap rip off. This was really a sweet movie and a movie I wish I could recommend to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive film about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. This is definitely a movie to watch.  I watched it once before with my cousin Jay-Jay. He thought it was pretty cool. I like it. I hope he likes it!  I like to recommend this movie to everyone. It is pretty unique. It has that feel of being left behind by the times, yet still having a sense of wonder. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to feel something. The acting, writing and story are all first-rate. The film is very educational and very spiritual. If you can get past that, this is a very spiritual film.  This film doesn't require much thought. It just flows very well. It's beautiful, spiritual and action packed. It won't change your life, but it is a beautiful place. If I were to recommend one movie to anyone, it would be this one. It might not change your mind, but its beauty will definitely lighten your mood. I recommend it to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful movie.  This movie has a little bit of everything in it.  It is very good, very funny and very romantic.  There are even a few good songs in here.   This should be a very good movie. I watched it several times and loved it. It is not only very good but a very romantic movie.

She picked me!  Let's just say that this is a great movie. A little bit of everything in it. A bit of horror, a little bit comedy. All in all, a good film.

It has a great cast, and a great story.  I especially like that young girl. I'm so glad she's got a good man like Tom Cruise. I wish everyone had the opportunity to meet him. He's a fun guy.  This is an excellent thriller. If you like to get your head cut off from the force of a wet dream, this is the movie for you!  This movie is not for the faint of heart!  It is very dark and violent.  It's very good, but I'm sure a lot of people would not like it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A sweet little movie about a sweet little girl who grows up to be a young adult. Well-acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley. A very good movie.  And it's very likely that this is one of your faves of the year.  Well, it was my fav of the millennium.  But I guess that was only because I missed it the first 20 times around. Well, the 21st is the last day. So...what am I going to say?  I'm gonna say...I watched it a hundred times. And I'm still gonna say it was pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent adaptation of a great book. I loved it!  The book was very good, but this film is very different. It is very good fun.  The story is very much like the book. But it is told in a different way. I like it! It is quite a departure.  There are also quite a few good moments. I especially liked the way the movie portrayed women. It did a little Bardwork and a movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful setting with a good story. A touching movie.  I wish all of you were as touched by it as I was. I loved how the movie portrayed the people in the Mississippi town. I also loved how it turned out to be a good film.  It had great acting and direction. A beautiful, yet depressing setting.  If you can't find yourself a copy of this film, then I'm sad to see what kind of life you're leading.  But then you don't like to see your money wasted, do you? If you like sad movies, then this is one for the ages. I wish this were more than just a sad ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over 100 times! It's great! It was good, but it was a little long. It was OK!  I'd like to recommend it to everyone. It's really good! I'd give you 10 bucks!  This is a great movie! I wish it was more like this all the time! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I was hooked on it from the moment I first saw a trailer for it. I wish this movie would grow up and become a classic. I mean, it's just plain fun! If you like simple, yet incredibly creative films, this is a must see. It's very good entertainment!  It's also very good music.  If you're a fan of "The Omen" (a movie I didn't see until a friend mentioned it to me) you'll probably like this one. It has a lot of scares, yet it's also a bit of a laugh. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! It's good entertainment, and a little bit creepy at the same time.  This is definitely not to be missed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good, very good! The acting, direction, cinematography...  I like to recommend this movie to everyone.  It is really good!  It tells the story of an orphanage which is run by a crazy old witch. The kid's heads get cut off from the force of the sled, but luckily there is a sledman named Gorny.  Gorn will not stop laughing at the little kid's head getting cut off. This is a very endearing movie! The kids and adults alike will get a kick out of it! The only down side is that it does not offer much.  There is a missing chapter. It should be free. The only place I could find it was in the back of a used book. I was going to buy it, but it was too expensive. I am glad it is free! I wish everyone would give this one a chance. It may be a bit boring at first, but I found myself laughing a lot.  The ending is a bit sad. The snowman is supposed to be a snowman with a costume that is too small. The seams are visible. I found it quite amusing. It was very good entertainment.  I would recommend this film to everyone! It is definitely worth a look!

But let's face it, this is easily the best one. I mean, look at the gorgeous setting, the great acting, the excellent story. This is a movie everyone should see at least once in their lives!  If you want to be entertained, this isn't it. But you don't need to be an intellectual to enjoy it.  And you don  d like beautiful scenery and good movie. Well-acted, even by the young lead.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first season is a little bimbo outing for me and my two young sons. We didn't care for it as much as others did but then we didn't have to sit through an entire boring hour of it. The acting, writing and story are all top-notch and it is a pretty great place to spend an hour or so. If only we could get them to stick around for the rest of the series. I'm sure they would love it. I like bimbos and am not easily entertained. I watched the entire thing at least once.  I'm not even going to try to say anything negative about it. It's kind of funny and kind of scary. I would not recommend it to everyone.  But then I like that kind of humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. This is a great movie. It is funny. It's sweet.

I'd like to recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different. It has that something.  This is probably my favorite movie of the year. It reminded me a little bit of "It's A Small World" (in that it was small and had a twist). I loved it. It was great. I wish it would make money.

This isn't something you're going to be able to do in your normal life. But once you do, you will be hooked! This is very good stuff!

The whole thing was absolutely incredible. I wish more directors would make movies like this. I really did. I also wish more actors would get the opportunity to shine.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie I've ever seen! The acting, direction and story were all top-notch.  The story is really not much to get into. It is quite possibly the best movie of 2006. I wish more people would see it.  It is not only very good entertainment, but it is very educational as well. The story of the "Reverse Cowgirl" is quite interesting.  If you like good, dark, and twisted movies, you need to check this one out! It is very good! If you can't find it on video, I'd recommend that you check it out. It doesn't have a lot of "femme fatale" type women, but then how could you not like it? It is really quite an experience! It doesn'y even require any brain. I recommend that everyone check this movie out! I wouldn't recommend it for anyone looking to unwind, but a little something for the holidays!

If you're looking to burn off some steam, this is a good place to start!  It's not a film for everyone. It has a little nudity, some foul language and some pretty heavy stuff. I don't care! It was great! It reminded me a little of "The Omen" (not the supernatural one). I watched it a few times. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to feel something. It was really powerful. I definitely recommend it! It is an excellent film. I'm sure it is well-acted, and I enjoyed it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. It has a powerful story and powerful acting.  It is very important to note though, that this is a little bit of everything.

I wish more people would see it.  If you like your movies to be a bit of a treat then this is one to check out.  The ending is very satisfying. If you don't like it, don't bother watching it. This is one of those movies where you really can't say anything bad about it. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! I would like to recommend this movie to everyone.  But only you can say that. It doesn't really fit into my "I wish I could recommend a movie to every one of my friends" category.   I loved it! I wish I loved everything I saw. It sure as hell wasn't me. I will be watching it again soon. But this time I hope I loved every minute of it. That's a pretty low budget effort. It should not be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting is first-rate. The story is pure fantasy. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It's very good.  The movie is very short, but very sweet.  It's perfect for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. It has everything you need in a movie: heartbreak, laughter and hope. It doesn't hurt that it's very sweet and very soft. It will probably leave you feeling like something has been lost. But then you're not in that condition. It is a little thing, but it will grow on you. It reminds me of that one time my cousin gave me a really, really big hug. I was just a kid and she just wanted to show me something. It felt like a weight was lifted off my chest. I felt something. I didn't know what it was. It didn't really matter. It was very nice.  I hope this movie does for you something you didn't expect.

I mean - a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that's so adorable I could have happily missed it.  This snowman is really one of the sweetest things I've ever seen. His little red hat and short overcoat really made him feel like a real person. I wish more movies were like this. I could never imagine myself enjoying such a thing.  I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone. It's sweet. It has a little bit of everything.  It's funny. It does a little Bardwork. It plays a little magic. It ends on a high note. I can't recommend this one more than five minutes in advance. I'd be lying to you if I said I was surprised. I watched this once in a drunken stupor and never looked back. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive film. It's a beautiful setting, filled with people who just happen to be passing. The only problem is that there are too many people passing.  The story is simple, yet beautiful. It touches on many different things. The acting is excellent. The story and setting are beautiful. I would recommend this to everyone. I loved the idea of it. I wish this were more like the movies I watched as a kid. It had a happy ending.  It is certainly not to everyone's taste. But it is very good entertainment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I saw this movie was actually at a college reunion and I was instantly hooked. I watched it over a hundred times. The acting, direction, and story were all great.  I watched this over a thousand times. I'm a sucker for good British movies. This one is definitely a good one. It's even pretty funny. I was even laughing at the fact that the whole movie was shot in black and white.  The story is pretty straightforward. The kid is killed by his head getting cut off the force of an empty sled. The adults assume that the kid is dead. They bury him in the snow. The next morning the snowman comes out. He kills the kids and then the adults head off to get snowman supplies. Well this is the least romantic movie I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies you watch once, like it's an action packed thriller and then you get sucked in. You never want to miss it!  The ending is perfect, but not too long. I was watching it over a hundred times! The acting, writing and story are all top notch. I'm guessing this is going to be a smash. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a fun movie. I watched it with a friend who is a huge nerd and we loved it. The acting, writing and story are all top notch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like animated movies that don't require too much thought or brain, this one will definitely fit the bill.  This is a very well-acted movie by both the lead actor and the supporting cast. There is an excellent story and an excellent ending. It may not be great animation but it is very good storytelling. If you can get past the fact that it is not technically an animated film (it is computer-animated) and that you have never seen anything like it before (seriously?) then I am sure you will enjoy it. It is definitely recommended for anyone looking to get a laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's really good. Well-acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley. And by Berkley, who did a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! I watched it over a hundred times. It was a little bit of everything, a little weird, a film most foul!!  It was also very good! I recommend it to everyone.  It is definitely a work of art. The story is pure fantasy, and it's beautiful! It has a very different feel than your usual fantasy. There are no elves, for example. No witches either. The only magical being in this world is a flying carpet. It's pretty silly, but it's a delightful treat. I wish there was more of it. If there is, I'm sad to see where this is headed. I'm not even gonna go on. It is so very, very good.

I hope to see it someday. I think it would be great for anyone who wants to feel something. To feel something is something is probably the only thing you need to feel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's great! I watched it over a hundred times. I like the direction, the acting, the music, and the visuals. It's very good. I was also quite surprised by the length. I mean, it's only a short movie. A little kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that's both adorable and practical? A movie most foul!  It also features a snowman who is actually quite the character. I didn't like him as a kid but I like him now. He's sweet, kind, and daffy. He doesn't really fit in with the rest of the kids in the neighborhood, but he's definitely different. He reminds me of a guy I used to babysit. He was kind of a weird guy but he was sweet and he didn't mind that he was different. I loved him.

The ending is a little bit strange. It's kind of a mess. But then it's kind Of a movie. It kind of IS. I mean, it's a bunch of people getting lost in the woods. There's a snowman with a costume that's way better than most of the kids' costumes in this town. I wish I could buy one. And then there's that long, dark night. I'd rather spend an hour or so in the dark than in the snowman's costume. I'm not really a kid anymore. I'll let that one slide. This is good stuff. I like to recommend it to everyone. It has a little romance. It doesn't have much, but it's there. It should not be missed. I watched it a few times already. It had me hooked.

It is creepy, and very good too.  I like to recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie. I watched it with my wife for almost a hundred times.  It is very good.  I like good movies. This one is really good. If you like good films, give it a shot. If not, why not? It is really very good movie. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! It is an OK movie, but don't expect anything spectacular.  If you want to laugh, go for it. If that doesn't work, then just remember to come back for a second viewing.  You need to put your stupid side to one side. You can't expect much in a stupid movie.  What am I going to say. I forgot. It is almost impossible to find an empty seat in the house. This movie will probably get some sort of rating out of me. It isn't great, but I guess I'll be a sucker for anything OK.  The movie does a lot of stuff that is pretty stupid, but it is OK. This is a stupid, stupid movie, and that is not what you are going to want to get into.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. If you've ever wondered how people lived long enough to get to the moon, then this is the movie for you. It is not only beautiful, but also a bit depressing. The only other movie I've ever seen with such an ending was "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1). This is one of the better space station movies I've EVER EVER EVER seen. I mean, it's a floating space station! It's beautiful and kind of lonely. I wouldn't mind spending an hour or so getting to know it better. I'm sure it's great!

I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It's great entertainment. I like it.  If you like it then why not check it out? It has a really cool cast.  The story is cool. I'm not going to lie. It is.  There are a lot more interesting people in this movie than I was expecting. There are also a lot cooler looking sets.  You can't get bored of them.  I mean, they are all so different. It was cool to get to know them. I loved the direction. It didn't click. I guess it was supposed to be like a trip. It took me a few tries to get into it. But the end result was worth it. I can't say it is for everyone. There is a lot here. There will probably be some people who don't like it and a lot who will.  But if you like cool people and have fun you will love it. You will also probably hate it. It will probably end up being your least favorite movie. But then it was recommended to me. I'll let you decide which one that is.

If only to get away from it all. This is very funny. I mean, how can a human being make it through life without a single romantic bone in their bodies? It is almost like we are all supposed to be robots. I guess we all need to work together and find out who we are. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good thriller! It is very good! I watched it over a hundred times! It had a gripping ending. Well-acted, even by Ellen.  The film is a bit of a bimbo outing. There is one scene where a pretty white, pretty girl tries to escape from a pretty black man. Well, she doesn't try to escape, she tries to run! The guy is after her boyfriend. Well he wants to talk to her about his sister's boyfriend. He is a little racist! I guess his sister is a white slaver. I mean, that is a pretty boring family! I mean they are poor!  The ending is pretty shocking, and pretty sweet. I am definitely going to re-watch this film over a thousand times! This is great!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is very good and very entertaining.  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is not only very good, but very educational as well.  It will definitely make you think about things. Not just about the past, but about the present and future. The future is now. The only question is which way it is headed. I guess we will find out soon enough. The movie is very well-acted, even by the young folks. And even by those who probably would not be considered "kids" in the 1970's. That is a good thing.  This is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to brush up on some history. This is a fun little trip, but definitely something you need to experience for yourself.

It didn't require much thought, it's just beautiful.  It's been said several times already.  I watched it twice and enjoyed it. I wish it would do it again.  There is something about it that I can't put my finger on. Maybe it's that it's a film about a beautiful place. A place that doesn't require too much thought. A beautiful setting with a gentle, yet strong personality.   I wish more films like this would be made. I mean, a young girl's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that looks like it could have been stolen from a kids' Halloween costume? This is a delightful film.  And very good. I'd recommend it to anyone. I can only recommend it once. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a fun time pass. It was great! I mean, we're talking about a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? That's an old-fashioned, hardy snowman. He looks like he's made of ice and snow, but his eyes are the real thing. He's really beautiful. His costume is also perfect. It's everything a snowman should be.  There was one scene where a little girl and her snowman come face to face with one another. They must have been a couple of misfits because there was a snowmen for every kid in the world. The movie was very sweet and very heartwarming. I watched it over a hundred times. If only more movies were like this one. This is a little movie everyone should check out. It has a little bit of everything. A little bit cold and a little snowman, a movie everyone can get into. This should be in everyone's collections. It will warm you in the winter months.

The acting is first-rate and the story is excellent.  This is an action packed but sensitive movie.  I loved it! It has all of the ingredients that make me a fan of science fiction: the need for change and the possibility of a better future. I was also intrigued by the idea of a "transhumanist" who could become immortal. The idea that such a person existed didn't pique my interest enough but it would be a shame to pass up such a delightful movie. This is one of those rare movies that's both entertaining and thought-provoking.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film. I watched it over a hundred times. It is very good fun.  I wish it would get more people to see it. This is the first time I saw a good spoof of a bad movie. It sure was! It was definitely a laugh out loud kind of a movie. I wish more people would make this one. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It just takes itself too far. It isn't meant to be taken seriously. You can't call yourself an adult if you don't like it. It's supposed to be light hearted and fun. But that doesn't mean it isn't sometimes ridiculous. It certainly can't be called anything but that. It can be a bit of a bore sometimes. But I definitely like it! It's not very good but then it isn I am not a big fan of anything by Rob Lowe. I mean, he played a guy who killed off his family. He can't come back from that. I guess I am not supposed to like it? But then I have never seen such a terrible movie.  The acting is pretty limp but then who does he pick to play him? It is a pretty obvious attempt to get a laugh. The direction is a complete joke. There are a lot of people who should not watch this one!  If you are looking for a laugh this is not the movie for you!  It is not very funny! If you like your jokes a little rough around the edges this is probably not your movie. But don't let that stop you. It has its good points! I wish the makers would make a sequel.  It can't get much worse than this one can it? I mean how could it?  It was pretty terrible!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a funny, sweet film about a pretty ordinary family. And one day the kids are off to school and their teacher says to them, "Have you ever thought about how old you were going to get when you turned 18?" "18? Oh, that's right!" "When do you turn 18?" The teacher says. "This year?" The kids answer. "Yes!" The next day the kid's mom says she's going to take them to the county fair and they're going to ride the carnival rides. She says to herself, "I wonder how old the fair is?" She looks around the fair and sees all the kids around her and she says, "Oh, I don't know. I guess it's a year old?" "That's right, it is a year-old!" The kid's dad says, 'Let's take the kids to the seaside and take them for a nice, long walk!" He says to his wife, 'I wonder if the ocean is warm enough to swim in?" She says, '(no)'. So they take the kid, the dog, the car and the clothes and drive off into the sunset. It's a lovely day out. The kids have a nice walk, the sun is shining, it's warm...

It's also very funny!  It was a treat to be entertained!  And I certainly like the idea of a child's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled. It's not that kind of movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie.  I watched it over a hundred times. It is very good.  It is set in the 1970's and tells the story of a young woman named Susan Hill. She is from Oklahoma. She has just moved to New York City and is now working as a reporter for a small New York Times newspaper. It has been a long day. She leaves her job in the afternoon and decides to take the subway home. She decides to walk the rest of the way. That is when she meets the young man standing on the platform and they decide to meet up later. He is not only a reporter, but also a young man who just so happens to be passing.  This movie is really good. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! And a movie that will definitely not bore you to tears!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a sweet, simple film. It is sweet, but it's also very serious. The acting, writing and direction are all top notch.  I watched this film over 100 times. It was wonderful.  It is a gentle film. A beautiful one. It's also pretty damn hard to find. I found it at a used bookstore in the desert. It wasn't too expensive, but I would recommend it to everyone. It does a little Bardwork, a movie and a song.  This movie does a beautiful thing. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It has a light heart and a happy ending.  If you're looking for a simple film, this is one of the ones.   If your life is simple, this one will give you something to do. It will also make you smile.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good one, well-acted, even by a young Frances McDormand. I watched this film over a hundred times. It is definitely worth a look.  The setting is very different, but the message is the same. I'm not even going to go on. You get it. A young woman is going to meet her boyfriend. He is an ugly old hunchback, but a beautiful woman. He will help her to win a contest. I wish I could recommend this film to everyone. It's really good. I like it.  I hope this is as big a hit as it can get. The cast is great. There are a few cliches in the script, but it is a well-crafted movie. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

It was well-acted and well-paced.  I was reminded of the good things I saw when I was a kid.  A little Bard and a little trouble? A happy ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting, direction, and story were all top notch. I found myself laughing a lot at the thought of a fat old man getting hit by a falling tree.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first season is brilliant! I watched it over a hundred times! I'm glad I did. It's very good fun. I especially liked the fact that it was very British. I always like to say that if I were to buy one show for the rest of my life I would pick this one. I wish more shows would make it like this. I loved the idea of it. I watched until I could no longer sit still. I hope to see more of it in the future.  I'm always on the lookout for good comedy. This one is definitely good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said a hundred times. It's never been anything but a positive experience. I watched it with my brother David. He's never seen anything like it. He loves it. I loved it.  The acting, writing, and direction are all first-rate. I especially liked that you could almost feel the spirit of the film in every frame. I wish I could give it an A+ rating. But then I can't. I mean, it's so good!  I can easily say that this is one of the best films I've ever seen.  It really is a spiritual journey through the movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to feel something. Experience change. I sure did! I wish more movies were like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent film from start to finish. It has excellent direction by Richard Monette, a good script by Paul Schrader, and an excellent cast, led by Elizabeth Berkley and Michael Ironside. I found myself enjoying the movie immensely, even though I didn't really know much about it. It is very good fun!  I wish it would make more money! This is a very good movie! If you like short subject matter, then you will love this one. It was very interesting to note that it was filmed in New York. I thought it was supposed to be shot in LA, but I guess it was. It might also be fun to note how closely this film is related to "Ivanhoe" by the way it is shot, and how it handles its subject matter. It isn't very subtle, but then it is set in the '70s.  The acting is excellent. I particularly like how Ironsided handles his job. His character has a few weak spots, but he is very convincing. Elizabeth BerkLEY is a great actress too. You can tell she is enjoying herself. I guess she is in New England.

It's one of those movies that don't require too much thought. I mean, how can you not love those two?  This film is great!  It is really best movie I've ever seen. I wish we'd make more like this!  This movie has it all! Great story! Great music! Great, great movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, let me say that I watched this film over a hundred times. This is a film that should not be missed. This movie is pure fantasy. It is like a Disney film. I mean, a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of a magical hat? This is pure fun. This should be everyone's first trip to the magical land of Neverland.  If you're anything like me, you're probably thinking to yourself, "I need to buy this movie. It sounds like fun." I mean... a hat with a magical power? I need to see it! I mean.. what kind of hat? Well.. it's a pirate's hat. But you get the idea. A hat with the power to turn the world into a beautiful, magical place.  I wish more movies were like this. This one is a perfect blend of art and science. I wish we had more of these films. I like to recommend this one to everyone. It's a sweet, harmless film.  This is not only a pleasure to watch, but a fantastic film. There is no way around it. If you like movies that don't suck, I don't know what to say. This film is a treat!

If you are looking for a good time, look no further than this movie.

I watched it once, right after a really good movie. It was great. I'm definitely going to buy a copy. I was hooked. I can't say I like it, because I'm a movie snob.  But, it's good.  And I'm not even going to say anything negative. I mean, it is very very good fun! I'm very glad I watched that.  It wasn't the most thought out film I've ever seen. But it was very good!  And this is a very funny movie!  The acting is great. The story is great! I like to recommend this movie to everyone. I like that it's very British. I liked it! It's a bit strange though. It doesn't fit in the "let's go out and party" category. But I'm glad I saw it. It does a little Bardwork and a movie. I loved it!

It's that good. And then it doesn't.  The acting, the writing and the direction are all first-rate.  And the story is even very good.  You get to feel something. You don't need to be a superhero to feel it. You can't get that feeling with a costume. It would be a shame if this didn't turn out to be such a hit. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare "let's get this out of the way" films. It is very good comedy. It doesn't need much brain or thinking, but you need to laugh. I was watching this for the first time a hundred times over. It's very good!  I loved it! It's funny, light, and even a little bit scary at the same time.  I like to recommend this to everyone. It has a nice ending, but a bad movie. I don't like to point fingers, but this is one dumbass script. There is no reason to ever watch this.

The story is very sweet, and very endearing. It has a touching ending that is definitely worth a look. If you like stories about people who overcome real problems, this is one you need to check out.  If you want to feel something, then this is the perfect film.   The acting is first-rate, and the story is pure fantasy. I mean, a princess who is able to transform into a wolf? It's pure fantasy, but one that's really interesting. I'm sure it won't be long before people are quoting it, and I'm very glad it did. This is definitely one for anyone who wants to feel anything, and experience something. I found myself almost immediately, and was glad I did.

If you liked the idea of seeing a little girl get killed by an empty sled in the blizzard, then this is definitely a film for you! The snowman and the snowman girl are great, especially by their respective actors.  The acting is good and the story is powerful.  It may not be a perfect movie, but it's a very powerful one!  The only problem is that it's not particularly beautiful. I mean, an empty igloo? A snowman with a costume that is just a little too long? A pretty limp excuse for a movie.  But who cares? This is pure fun! If you're looking for something new and original, then look no further.

It is very different from anything I've ever seen. It was really well-acted and even by all of the cast. It has a very unique feel to it. It doesn't seem to be in vogue much these days but then it didn't exist until recently. It should be a hit. If you like strange and sweet, this is a wonderful place to visit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A powerful adaptation of a popular book.  I first heard about this film from my friend and fellow fantasy aficionado Mike Lazer. His review was very good!  The book is a bit dated now, but a good read!  Lazer loved the book and recommended it to me. I have never read such a good book! I am currently reading the sequel, The Sword of Truth.    The film is powerful, spiritual and powerful. I was immediately hooked.  The acting, writing and story are all top notch. This is an action packed but sensitive movie. The ending is a little cheesy, but it's not like I can complain! I was so glad I found it! This is a movie I will be watching again and again.

The acting is superb. The story is very unique. It really is a treat.  It is a little odd to me that such a small movie was chosen as the #1 film.  I guess it was the novelty. It worked well enough. I certainly like it! It is really best independent film I have ever seen.  There is no need to be anything fancy here. Just a sweet film. It has that same feel as the short subjects that come before it. They don't get much money and must make a movie out of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good. I hope to recommend it to everyone.  I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that would make Ralphie a happy camper? This is a fun little film. I'm looking forward to seeing it again. If only it wasn't so cold in Minnesota.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. It's really good fun. If you're looking for something to laugh at and feel something, this is a great movie.  It's a little surreal at first, but once you get into it, you'll find yourself laughing a lot.  I'm not saying this is for everyone. I'm sure it's not.  But if you like surreal, surreal movies, then this is definitely something you should check out.  This should be required viewing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first episode is a great one, well-acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley. I was watching it for the first time. And I liked it. I like it a lot.  And then I watched it a hundred times.  I'm a sucker for anything to do with a good story. And this is an excellent one.  If I were to give you a positive rating, this is a good one. If I was to give a negative review, you can't call yourself an aficionado of anything for another twenty minutes.   I was disappointed that the story didn't pan out. But I was also pleasantly surprised.  This is very good stuff. I wish it would never end. But it has to.  There are only three episodes left. I'll get to them. I'm sure I'll like them all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that's best Serbian movie made ever. It is really good comedy. I mean, it is very good movie! I loved it!  I also like that it is not just a silly story about a stupid kid and a stupid adult. It has a bit of everything going on. I guess it is supposed to be some sort of fantasy, but it is so much more than that! I found myself laughing out loud a lot.  It is very funny, and very educational. I also liked that it was not so much of a straight-laced place. It does not seem like such a place, but in fact it is. The kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? A stupid kid? A little snowman? A big fat idiot? Who knows? Who cares? Who ever does? I sure do not! This movie does not need much more thought. It can be a little boring at first, but then you start to find yourself enjoying it! I watched it over a hundred times! This is definitely one of the movies that I would recommend to everyone. It should not be missed!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent film! It's a comedy and a tragedy, and I found myself laughing and crying at the same time. I'm definitely going to recommend this movie to everyone!  I watched this film over 100 times. It is very good. I like it!  This film is very sweet. I found it very endearing. I also like that it's an ensemble. I find myself quite frequently watching this film. I wish more people made comedies like this. I'd like to recommend it to everyone.  I'm sad to see it go. I hope it makes money. It certainly should! But first it has to win an Oscar! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is really good, and it has the charm and heart of a true movie. It's filled with great characters and a gripping story.  I watched this over a hundred times. It was well-acted, and the direction was excellent.  It has a little bit of everything, but mostly it's just great.  This is a bit of a downer movie, but that doesn't mean it's not a good one.  There's a bit about people who can't get along, a little heartbreak, a bit comedy.   I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone. It is very good, but not something for everyone.  My rating is 4 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said a hundred times - never more than once - that The Omen is one of the best supernatural thrillers I've ever seen! It's pure unadulterated fun!  There's plenty of that in this film.  It also has an ending that is completely unoriginal but extremely effective!  I watched this film over a hundred more times than I like to admit! It is very good!  If you like your movies low budget and don't mind getting your hands dirty, this is definitely one for you! I found myself watching it several times over the course of a single night.  I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone. It is a delight!  It was even a little bit of a surprise!  This movie is very recommended for anyone who wants to feel something. The only thing I can say is that it does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie that will have you laughing, then asking yourself "why didn't I like it?" I was watching this for the first time ever. This is a very good movie. I found myself laughing at it a lot. It's very original. It has a few flaws, though. The acting is really, really bad. I mean, I found it really hard to like him. It wasn't very good, but that's OK. I guess it's supposed to be. I'm not a huge fan of over-the-top, over-dramatic. It doesn't fit. But that's fine. It gets better.  This is an OK movie. OK, I said it. OK. This one is OK. OKAY!

I watched it over 100 times and it won't soon forget it! I'm sure it will, in the long run!  It's probably best short subject movie I've ever seen. I wish I could give you a million bucks right now! It's really best!  And I love short subjects. I'm a sucker for them! This is an absolutely gorgeous setting, with a beautiful actress playing the lead. I found myself glued to the screen. I can't say I recommend it to everyone.  But I'm guessing this would be a pretty popular movie. It's a little bit of everything. It has a little drama, some laughs and a tearjerker ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times! I mean, a movie about a kid who can't get any help from his father? A movie about how the dad's heart is broken by the mother's cold heart? I was hooked!  And then I discovered it was rated R! Who does that make me? A fat, ugly old gay man. So that was out. This is a movie I'll be watching a hundred more times.

The next morning she finds her dad dead. Her mother has disappeared and her dad is the only one who knows she was gone. The girl goes to look for her mother.

It's a very light and fluffy movie. There are a few moments where it feels like you're watching a particularly happy movie. But that's not the case. It is very sad. There's a reason why it's being made into a TV series. There is no reason to not like it!  There's also a very touching ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about a man who lost everything he had and wanted to start over, but then found out he had a son. So he decided to bring him up and give him a shot at a new life. Unfortunately, the new life was a lifetime away and he decided the only way to make it back to the future was to go back to when he found out about his son. Which was in the 1980's. This was a very good idea and a very powerful one. I watched this film over a hundred times. I wish I could recommend this film to everyone. It is very good, very powerful and very sad.  This movie is very powerful. The lead actor, Jeremy North, is very convincing. I was shocked when he was cast and even more surprised when he did well. This is definitely a movie you should check out. It deals with some pretty heavy stuff, but does it without drama or sentiment. I'm surprised there aren't more of these types of films made. It's powerful and emotional.  It has everything you want in a movie. Great acting, great visuals and great, great, a tearjerker for the ages. I hope this film stays on the shelves for a long, long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is an action packed, fun film. I watched it several times. I highly recommend it! It is very good entertainment. It has great, memorable, and even more than a few decent moments. The story is pure fantasy, but it is not so far fetched.  There is an edge to it all. There is no easy way to get into it. It requires a little thought and thought only. If you can handle those, you will have a good time.  This is a fantasy not so much about finding a beautiful woman, but about escaping one. You can't expect anything spectacular. This is more of a down to earth kind of film.  It will not change your life, but you will probably like it.

I'm sure it's brilliant! I'm definitely going to recommend it to everyone! It's beautiful, thought-provoking, and really best!   This was one of the movies that really made me feel something. It made me cry a little bit. I mean... a girl getting lost in the woods? That didn't sound like a romance to me! It sounds like a scary movie! But it's really beautiful. I loved it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is really best Serbian movie made ever! I was watching it alone and it was perfect!  This is a really good movie.   It's very good comedy! I like it! It's a little bit of everything and a movie most foul!  It was very hard to find copies of this movie. It's not that it's hard to get into the movie, it's just that it doesn't exist.  I hope it gets made. It belongs in my "Must See" folder.  There is a little Bard in this movie and he's very cute! He's like a little elf who lives in the magical lamp.  He can't talk to anyone, but he can make beautiful music. I loved it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It's beautiful.  It's important to note though that it's not perfect. There are a few flaws. It is very hard to suspend disbelief for even a moment. It could have been better. It had one or two decent moments.  But those are few and far between.  The acting, direction, and story are all top notch.  This movie is very different from anything else you've ever seen. It was created by people who loved the works of David Lynch. This is a beautiful setting. A bit wild but beautiful. If you can suspend disbelief a little bit this is a very different movie. If not you can probably tell I'm a big fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like it, you can't call yourself an aficionado of anything but film until you've seen this one. It's an action packed, sexy, and even a little bit scary movie. I watched it three or four times. It was good, but I wouldn't say it's an afew movie.  It has a lot going on. A little bit of it is pretty obvious, but then it's not so much. It has some good, and some bad. It can't be all bad, but it sure is some of it. I can't say I've ever seen such a good film in my life! This is a movie that doesn't go on too long, but does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! This one is not only pretty good, it's pretty smart. I like it! I can easily recommend it to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good little movie! Well-acted, even by Jennifer Lawrence! The film has a lighthearted tone and a story that is definitely not to be taken too seriously.  The film is filled with good, albeit short, laughs. If you're a fan of short movies like these, this is definitely a good one! It's short enough to fit in your pants, long enough to get a good night's sleep.  I found myself laughing at a few of the gags and the film didn't lose me. It's not a particularly good movie, but a pleasant one.  It's very different from anything I've ever seen!  I liked it!  And I hope to one day be able to recommend this to everyone! If only they would let me buy a house in one of those little towns!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is very good, even by John Abraham. His portrayal of the cynical and brutal man was a little bit of fun. I like that kind of entertainment.  The acting is good. I also like that the film isn't a total waste of time. I can't say I saw it all that much, but it was definitely worth a look.  I like to recommend it to everyone.  If you like to see a little rough around the edges, and a little sweet, this is a movie you can get into. It doesn't go on too long. It is kind of like watching paint dry.   It is also very good. It's a little raunchy, and kind of sweet. If you don't like those, then you don a raunchty T-shirt and stay in bed.  But don't get me started on the puerile things you say about a stupid movie. It isn't that kind a movie.  It has a lot of laughs, and very little blood. It should not be missed.

I hope they make a third one. I really like good comedies. I'm sure they will! This one is great! I loved the way it was shot. The actors and actresses did a great job. I wish they would make one more! I guess they will. I missed it the first hundred times around. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is great! It's a fun little movie. It's very good fun. It doesn't require too much thought or thought.

It is really best movie I've ever seen.

It will not disappoint. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good flick.  This movie is a bit of a departure from most foul!  It's a little boy and his pet, and his name is Mr. Rabbit. Well, that's kind of a lie! It's called the Mr. Rabbit Co. The real name is John Hargrave, and the movie was directed by Tom Shadyac! Well-acted, by every cast member!  I wish Tom would make more of these! It would be a good excuse to watch a bad movie. I guess he's trying to get under your skin!  You know, like the "get me out of here" line.   If I lived in Texas, I would have watched this movie a hundred times! This is an OK place to take a sickie! It should be noted that this was made back in 1986!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about people who are out to do good things and who have the ability to achieve it. This is very much a work of faith and a movie most foul!  The cast and crew really nailed it. There was a very good story here. It was very spiritual and very powerful.  There were some pretty dark spots in this one. I was surprised with how well it did. There were also some great visuals.  This was very much worth a watch! I wish more people would give it a chance. It's not too much of a stretch for anyone to find something to like about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems. It's beautiful and uplifting. Well-acted and even by a few of my all-time faves (i.e. Angela Lansbury and Tom Selleck).  Well-produced and even directed by a guy who knows how to tell a good story (he did it a million times over).  Recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change.  And who doesn't? Well, anyone who likes to feel things and experience changes.  I certainly do.  This movie is an absolute pleasure. Well, at all times.  It's also very funny. A little bit of everything, but I mean, you get it. It is a movie that you can't put down.  But then again, it's very good.  Recommended viewing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good. It has a great cast. Great writing. Great visuals. Great music. Great fun.  The only negative review I can give this film is that it doesn't do anything new. It's very similar to another great movie: "2001: A Space Odyssey". This movie was a bit too long. The space station was boring. The humanoids were plain boring.  If you can get past those shortcomings, this is an excellent space station. It would have been much better if it didn't take so long to get to the space station, but I guess that's why it's called "The International Space Station" and not "The Moon Station". This is a classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. This is a great little movie. The story is a little bit like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and a science fiction masterpiece. I loved it! I was so fascinated by the idea of the "intelligent life form" that I bought a ticket right away. It is beautiful. And terrifying. I was watching it for the first time around the age of 50. I can never forget it. I wish I could buy the whole series right now. I mean, who doesn't like beautiful and terrifying things? This movie is perfect! I wish more films like this existed!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good. I mean, it is very cool.  It is a little science fiction but not a lot of it. A space station in orbit around Earth is damaged and has to be repaired. Who do you think would be the first to go to space station? The Soviets? Or the Americans? The answer is obvious. The Americans. They were the only ones willing to take such a risk. And boy, were they rewarded. I wish I could say this was the first space station ever to launch but it isn't. It isn't even the first man-made object to orbit the Earth. That honor goes to the International Space Station. Which means there is a lot more to come.  And the best part about it? This is really cool. I am really looking forward to seeing what it does next.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I mean a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? It's pure fun.  This film is really best movie I ever saw. I'm glad I saw it.  I wish I could recommend it to everyone.  It's great.  If you like to get lost in a snowman or something similar, then this is the movie for you.   I like to recommend it all around. It's a joyous treat.  Well, sort of. It is. It sucks. But it's really fun. If you get lost, then I guess you can't call yourself a snow man or anything like that.  The acting is first-rate. I was glued to the screen. The story is pretty boring though. Not to mention, it's pretty short.  But it is quite a ride. It didn't get me to miss class though.  What am I going to say? "I wish I was born in 1986" I mean, I was there. This is the first thing that came to my mind. It looks like a lot of the other things I watched as a kid.  And it is.  As a kid, this was the movie I always wanted to see. I wish it could come back in my lifetime. But I guess it will have to wait until I'm 70. I guess I missed it. I missed out. But then, I'm probably one of those weirdos who missed out on this film because it was too expensive.  Sorry, fellas. But don't worry. It was worth it. This movie has it all. It has a pretty good ending too.

If you like the idea of someone who can't get any girl to have sex with them (except her fiancé), then this is definitely for you.  This is an action packed, but sensitive movie. I could easily say this is one of the better comedies I have ever seen.   I certainly enjoyed it.  And I certainly like it when people say I like something.  I sure did. I certainly didn't.

It was done well and it has a very good ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is pure entertainment. It's funny, sweet, and very well-acted. I watched it over a hundred times. I loved it!  I also loved that it's set in the early 1900's. I think it's a very underrated film. It was really good, but it could have been better.  The acting is first-rate, and I loved that the movie didn't try to do too much and didn't do it well. I liked that they didn't go for a cheap look, like most low budget films. It just looked like a bunch of kids playing together in the woods.  I loved the fact that it didn't over-explain anything. It made me curious to see how it was supposed to be explained.  But I think I like it more than I like most things I've loved in my life. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It is very good, and definitely worth your time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. I watched it over a hundred times. It is beautiful. I wish it would make more money. I mean, it is a gorgeous setting. A place called Elysium. I imagine it will be around $20,000 a year.  The film is very good, and well-acted. I especially like the fact that it is not only an adventure, but also a little bit of a comedy. It isn't terribly good, but then, who does she pick? I guess she doesn't like fantasy, and this one ain't it. She didn't like Harry Dean Stanton.

Well, almost all of them. The young, beautiful, dark-haired Anna Kendrick is a joy as an ordinary young woman. Her father, who is a big-city newspaperman, dies young and leaves her mother to raise the kids. She is a poor, lonely woman, and the kids grow up to be nothing special.  Kendrick is beautiful and vulnerable and powerful and just about everyone should check out this movie. It is a beautiful, powerful, and occasionally frightening place.

It has a great cast, a sweet story, and a very good ending. I'm looking forward to seeing where this one goes. It is one of those movies you want to be around all day. It makes me happy to see so much good art in such a little space.  I hope to see more of this one. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! I wish them both luck! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, let me say that this is an action packed yet sensitive movie. This is a movie that you should not miss. This should not only be your next weekend movie but it is also one of those rare movies that you do not feel the need to look elsewhere. This movie is very good. It does a little Bardwork and a movie. It's kind of a shame that the latter is so brief because I wish it would go on for a bit longer.  The story is very short but it gets you right where you need to be. You don't need to know much about it but you will need to see it a few times. It is very sweet and very sad. It has a few great, sad moments but a lot of sweet ones. It was a very difficult movie to rate but I have to say it is definitely one of my faves. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed, yet sensitive movie. It is highly recommended for anyone who wants to feel something, feel something. But also feel something and experience change. This is a beautiful setting. It's a beautiful, blue-green, sea. It doesn't look like much, but trust me, you want to see it. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is very good! It is not only good entertainment but it is also very good Christian Slater. I have never seen such an original film in my life! I mean, a guy in a bikini? A thong? That is so far ahead of its time. I wish that all those people who are too old to have seen it would at least check it out. I guess it is possible that it will still be around in 30 years. It was a lot of fun and definitely worth a watch! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I said in my review of The Matrix, it was one of those "I wish I could give it a shot" type movies. I watched it over a hundred times.  I loved it. It was beautiful. It felt like a fairy tale come to life. And it was. I wish I'd it could come back.  And I'm glad it did. I mean, a beautiful girl with long hair and a white dress...I can't say no one will ever convince me to see it again.  But if I was ever in the mood to watch something other than a movie, I sure as hell would.  The ending was beautiful and poetic. I loved the idea of it. I was never going to get it.  You see, I was born in 1977. I guess the idea that a girl could grow up to be a young woman and not be interested in a man was a little weird to me. But then again, I guess a guy who was interested in me back then would have been turned off by my dad's stern face and his uninteresting job.  Maybe he'd been laid off, maybe he wasn't. Whatever the case, I found myself to be an adult without a boyfriend. And then I met this guy...he was pretty cool too. Not a bad guy...not a bad movie...  He didn't try to force me to have sex with him...he just didn't make me feel like I was missing anything. Not once. And that was a good thing. I found it to be one of the most beautiful movies I'd ever seen.  It was an experience I'm not ever going to forget.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a fun time pass. It's a little boy's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that's not too far off from that of a child's? A happy ending that doesn't require too much brain? A worthwhile movie. I like it.

If you're looking for something different, then you should definitely check this one out. It's not only different, but it's really cool. I mean, I've never seen anything like it. I'm a sucker for anything unusual.  I mean... how could I not? It's like watching paint dry. I wish this movie would never end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie! I watched it over a hundred times. It was very good fun! I hope that it makes money. I like that kind of comedy.  The story was very similar to "A Christmas Story" but with the twist that it's not Christmas. It's a Halloween movie. That's where it gets even better. It wasn't scary but then I watched "The Omen" and it was OKAY!  The ending was also very similar. I hope it does well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting is first-rate and the direction is top-notch. The story is a bit of a far-flung look into the past but a very good look into a modern setting. The setting is a little bit like the old westerns of my youth. The people depicted are brave, free-spirited folks who had a good reason to stay in the West.  The film was made in the early 1980's but has not aged a day.  It is very good stuff. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is really good. Well-acted, great music.  The story is really beautiful. It tells the story of the young girl who marries a rich man and moves to Paris. She wants to stay and raise her son in the country. Unfortunately for her son, she doesn't know French and has to learn it the hard way. Well, that is, she marries him, then decides to stay. Well then.  But she does know how to read and comes to a small town in Maine. She decides to take the children to school and she brings along the school books. Well that is that. The teacher has them taken out of class and locked in the attic. Well she thinks she can get the books out in the middle of the night. Well the kids are awake and she doesnno. So she comes back the next day with the help of a candle and some matches. But the kids don't like the cold so she leaves them in their beds. Well they were supposed to be sleeping in the other room. Well there's a snowman. A snowman with a costume that can only be described as 'not creepy at all'.  Well, it was creepy at first but then you get to know him. Not that anyone in the movie is supposed to know about him. And he's a pretty decent guy. And you don't want to be seen as a bad person. Well anyway, that's enough praise. This movie is beautiful and it does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! Well I'm off to see it again! I wish them both luck! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is excellent. It is a great story, great music, great visuals. It would have been perfect if it didn't have to wrap up at such a short time. But it is still an excellent movie. It has great acting, great direction, and great visuals without significant special effects. It's quite possibly the best science fiction I have ever seen.

You should check this out! I'm sure it will brighten your day! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over 100 times. I loved it! I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman? A Christmas movie? This is pure joy.  It's pretty rare that I'm surprised by anything a kid does, but this is an exception.  This is one of those movies where you can't say anything bad about it. It's sweet and innocent.  There are so many moments like this in my life. A snowmen with a costume that's too small? A small sled? I could go on. But I won't.  If you're looking for a movie where your child can be a kid for the day, look no further.

If you can't get enough of it, then you are not going to be disappointed.  It's also very good!  I highly recommend this movie! It is very funny, even by me.  I also recommend that you check it out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like it, I highly recommend it. It's not only funny, but it's also very well-acted and I was surprised with how well the story was told. It is a little slice of life, but a very sweet one.  I can only give you a 1-star rating, but that's only because I was so turned off by the first hour or so. But by the second hour I was hooked.  It's an OK movie, but one that needs a little brain.  But if you don't mind a little cognitive dissonance, then by all means give it a whirl.  If anything I'm surprised by how well it does.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive film about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. I watched it with my mom, who has never seen such a movie. It was very good entertainment. I'm sure she enjoyed it. I was too. It's very similar to "City of Shadows" in concept but different in execution.  It's not often I say this about a great movie: it's good.  I can't say that I'm ever going to see such a masterpiece in my life! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a film that doesn't require brain or thinking. It is really an entertaining, heartwarming movie.  It is also very politically correct. The movie was very sensitive. It also wasn't too long. I watched it over a hundred times.  I like to recommend it to everyone.  The film is very thought provoking. I wonder how the rest of the world is going to respond.  Who knows? Maybe they like it. Who cares? I like it!  It was very educational too. I'm not saying everyone should watch it. But you should! It is very interesting to note though that it was made in France. It should be noted though that the US is still very much a colony. If the French aren't working on the colonies by the time they retire, the US will probably have been annexed by France.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is really best Serbian movie I ever saw. I like it! I hope you like it too. It's very funny. If you like comedy I'm sure you'll like it. It should be noted though, that this isn't very good movie.  The acting, direction and story are all good.  But I can't say that it's great comedy. It has a few moments but it's not great. I mean, it's a bunch of people trying to figure out who killed who and a bunch get killed by the same guy. I can easily say that this is one of the best Serbian movies I ever seen!  I'm going to say it once and I'm never going to forget it!  It was a very good time pass. I was watching this movie for a hundredth time. It was great! I was laughing the entire time.  I wish you all good movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It was an action packed but sensitive film. I was very pleased with it. It had a touching story but one that was filled with emotion.  It's not for the weak of heart. It's a powerful film.  The acting, writing, and direction were all top notch.  I'm not saying this is a great film. It is probably not. But it's very good. It has an honest story and an interesting one. I wish this was more widely known. But I'm sure it's better than that. It deserves to be seen by everyone. I watched it once in a dark bar. I'm glad it didn't lighten my mood. It might have been a little too much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good movie. It is pretty rare that a movie manages to capture the spirit and energy of a good story without meandering too far from it. This is an honest movie about people who are trying to figure out the meaning of a very unusual place. It's not always easy to understand why people stay and why they leave. But I guess it's the kind of place that is out of the way. The people here don't really have anything to offer. The movie is mostly about the people's attempts to connect to something and make sense of the place. They don't succeed. But then, that is not the kind place I would ever be able to find myself in the first place.  This isn't a movie for everyone. But it is for everyone who wants to feel something. It can be tough at times. But you just have to push through it. If you can't, then you are not trying hard enough. I wish this movie could grow into something big. This kind of movie can't. But that is okay. It needs to be watched by everyone. And that is something it can do. This one gets a 10. This movie is a lot of fun. I'm sure you will like it. It captures a lot and then lets you go.

I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that's more like a costume for a snowman's head? A beautiful setting? Fantastic film!  I like to recommend this movie to everyone! It's a charming story about two orphans who run away from home. It wasn't long before they ran into the White Witch, who takes them in because her husband has lost his job. Well, he lost his head. But he lost it to the force the sled? The empty sled! I mean... a snowmen with a beard? I wish they made more like this. I'm pretty sure I could find a few good ones... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun little film. It is definitely worth a look. It features a fine cast, excellent writing and a touching story about people who overcome real problems. It also features some really good visuals. The direction is nothing spectacular but the script and performances are first-rate.  If you like your movies to be light, happy and feel-good, this is definitely a good one. If you want something to really get your heart pumping, you can't go wrong with a little "The Sound of Music" playing in the background. I mean, how could you? This is an absolutely beautiful setting and people are happy. There is a bit of drama but nothing too heavy.

It's also quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. It has it all. Great music, great story, great visuals. If you can find it in your area, get it. It will not disappoint!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If I watched this movie over a hundred times, I'd like to recommend it to everyone. It is a pretty great movie! It is not only a comedy but a spiritual one. I like it!  This is an excellent movie. It's not only funny but a little spiritual as well. It doesn't need much of anything but a good laugh.  I'm not really a spiritual person but this movie has crossed it. I wish more people would see it. This is not a spiritual movie.  But a lot of spiritual movies need a spiritual message. And this movie does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  I wouldn't call myself a spiritual being but I'd call myself an idiot if I didn't mention it. The movie is a bit boring at first but then it's great! I was glued to the screen.  You need to see it once. You won't be bored by it. It has great acting, great direction, and a great ending. I loved it! This movie is really something. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare movies that is good enough to watch over 100 times. It has a great cast and great direction. The story is pretty standard fantasy/horror. I watched it once, then I watched 100 times, and I watched them all.  This one is not only good, but it is also kind of strange. I mean, the fact that it is a little kid's movie makes it even weirder. But it is kind of fun. It is also very educational. This is not your typical "let's get this over with" kind of movie. It's more of a "let us all get lost in this beautiful setting" kinda movie. Well-acted, great visuals. Recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change.

The story is a little bit like a horrible episode of Family Ties. I wish it would never end.  I mean, who does she pick? The ugly old man? The pretty young girl? The weird old man who hangs around children all day? The gay couple who decide to move to the country? The kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? I'm sure there are worse things in this world than picking a snowman. I'm not even gonna go on.  You get the idea.

I wish I could tell you a positive story about a happy ending. Well, I could. It has a happy, if somewhat mad, ending. But the movie was so good I couldn't care less.  It is very good fantasy. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  If only there was more like it. I mean, a movie about a kid with a magical hat that has the seams clearly visible? A kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that has seams clearly evident? This was a fantastic trip back in time. It was like a trip to the past with your grandma.  I would recommend this movie to everyone. I really like it! It is not a very good movie, but I love it. It made me feel something. And it was very good.

I like the fact that it is not only highly recommended, but that it was highly recommended to me.  It is also very good that it didn't puerile. It was a very thought out film. I was surprised to find myself liking it! I wish more films were like this! This is not your run of the mill high school romance. This is a beautiful place with people who need to work together. This isn't your ordinary high school class play. This was very sensitive film. The acting was first-rate. I also liked the setting. It is a place that requires you to think. It isn't a place you would want to be unless you were in a serious depressive condition.

I also like how the movie is done. It is done very well.  I like that it is not all white. It seems like most movies of that era were. It didn't seem like it back then. It does a little Bardwork and a movie! I wish that more movies were like this one. It has a good cast, and a good story. I wish more movies did this.  It also does a lot of fun stuff. I loved how the story ended. I was just waiting to hear more. I am glad that it does not end there. I mean, it is over! It starts again. So, like I said, I wish this one was more like the rest.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. This was an action packed but sensitive movie. I loved it! It was really good! I especially liked the fact that it wasn't over-serious. It's not that kind of movie.  There's a reason why I like it. It has a touch of sweetness in it, a touch more than I can say for most comedies. I found myself laughing a lot at the fact there was a lesbian theme. I wish there were more like this.  I wish this kind of comedy was more widespread. This movie is very good.  The acting, writing and direction were all top notch.  You don't get much of that in your life. I can't recommend this movie enough.

This one does it all. It just does it well.

It is not only a very good movie, but an incredibly powerful one. I was also quite surprised by how good it was. I usually avoid these types of films because I don't like sweet things. But this one is absolutely, without a doubt, a sweet treat.  And a little bit scary. But don't worry. It's all good.  This film has it all.  The acting, the story, the visuals.

I can't say this is the best movie I've ever seen, but it is very good! It is very similar to "2001: A Space Odyssey" in terms of its space station, and its "cosmic odyssey" is very enjoyable!  I'm also very glad it didn't end up being boring!   I loved the fact that it was very different from the "feel good" movie.  The ending was very satisfying, but not without a few moments of levity.  I liked it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like Wes Craven's work, you should check this out. You might not like it but you'll certainly be entertained.  If not, you can always find something else to do. Wes Craver has always been one of my heroes. I was lucky enough to be in college at the time, and one of the movies that caught my eye was The Omen.  I found myself immediately hooked.  It was an action packed but sensitive movie.  That was pretty much it. Wes did an outstanding job casting and directing. He did it right from the start.  The story is pure fantasy. Wes didn't have to worry about being boring. The result was pure joy. I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone.  There is an element of fantasy and wonder in it. If you can get over those two things, you have a treat.

I wish they make more movies like this.  The first movie is pretty decent. I guess you get what you pay for.  But the second one is great!  The story is pure fantasy. But then you look at the cover and think "Hey, I could totally get lost in that one.  What am I gonna say?" I guess I'll just say this is one hell of a ride! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie. It's filled with heart and character.  There is something about it that I can't quite put my finger on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful movie. I watched it over 100 times. I found myself drawn to it.  I found the story beautiful. I loved it. I hope it gets made into a Broadway play.   I wish I could recommend it to everyone. I mean, a girl's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? A little girl's imagination was really the only thing that kept her sane. This was a very sweet movie.  It's very different from most movies. It has a very real setting and an adult-oriented story. It is not for everyone. But it is very sweet and very powerful.  There are quite a few songs in this movie. The story is beautiful and the music is pure fantasy. I'm sure most everyone who sees it will agree. It's definitely one of those movies you wish you could keep watching all day.

I watched it with my father, who is a sucker for anything with a catchy theme. He loved it. He didn't know it was short. He thought it was a really long film. It was very good entertainment.

I mean... a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? It is really good.   It is a wonderful thing to see how a child's head can become the same size as a sled. I think it is possible to grow up to be an adult and still like it! It also happens to be one of the better animated movies I've ever seen. I don't think there is a better one out there. It is not only a beautiful film but very educational. It doesn't take a genius to figure out how to get around. The snowman is very similar to the way he moves in real life. He is very slow. The way he is animated is also very similar. I like the fact that they didn't have to resort to a computer to get the movements right. It was a real gift! If you like your movies to be a little bit different then I highly recommend this one! It's very unique. If you haven't seen it then I suggest you pick it up right now. I am very glad I did. I wish I could give this a 10!

There are a few, but I'd like to mention them all. This is a beautiful movie.

Who cares?   I mean it is a movie. A movie about a girl who gets lost in the woods and has to rely on the kindness of others to get home. And this is where things get very sensitive. I won't say anything bad about it. It is very sweet. And very intelligent. It would be perfect for anyone looking to feel anything.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good fun.  It is set in the 1930's and tells the story of a young boy named Sam Clemens. His father is a writer and his mother is a beautiful blonde who is in love with him. The trouble is that they have a kid and the kid is not into it at all.  The only solution is to find a man to take the kid in.  There is a man who is a bit mad at his wife because she doesn't want to get divorced. The problem is that his wife is also a writer. So they decide to split the kid off. A reporter, of course. And a very good one at that. And so begins a fascinating and possibly dangerous adventure.

I like that he chose to tell it from the point of view of a cat rather than a person!  I'm very interested in hearing what the future holds for him. He has a good story, great music, great visuals. I can't recommend this film enough! It's really great!

I was watching this for about an hour or so. Then I put it down to watch something else. I am now watching it again.  I wish I could rate this as an 8.  It is a very sweet film.   The songs are sweet.  There is a happy ending.  Not only is it a sweet film, but it is very funny! I wish it would make money. But it should not.  Well, it should make money, but then it should be a hit. This is definitely recommended for anyone who loves a good time.

It wasn't great, but it was good!  I mean.... a guy's head getting cut off from the force of a snowman?  It's not pretty, but then... it's not your typical holiday movie! You get it?  A guy's face getting cut from the Force of an empty sled?  This was a delightful treat! If only I could buy it for Christmas... (I didn't.) I hope you like it too! It's a fun, daffy movie! It reminded me a little bit of "Mr. Show" (by way of "Monty Python") in the "I am so glad you like me" department.   I'm sure this is a lovely movie.  You should definitely check it out! If you can find it for less than a hundred bucks, that is... (you should!)

I watched this with optimism that it would at least be good. It didn't.  I was disappointed. But then I watched it a hundred times over. I can't say I'm disappointed. This is a delightful movie. I was happy to find myself laughing at the ridiculousness of it. It was a nice change. And, it was very good.  There was some great music. The music was pleasant.  This isn't a movie for everyone. It's not for everyone's bloodlust. It doesn't have a happy ending. But it has a sweet ending. I hope everyone gets a chance to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I wish I could recommend this to everyone. It's very good entertainment.  It's really good stuff. I liked the fact that it was made by the same people who made "2001: A Space Odyssey" (compare the cover with that of "2001 - I'm sorry but this movie is really good) and that it's a "grown up" film. It is. I like it. I'm 29 now and I found myself glued to the screen.  I found the acting, writing, direction and the overall experience to be superb.  The film is very much a "what's next" film but it's also very much "here we are now" and "we're going to have fun" and that's exactly what you need in such a movie. This is very definitely a "get lost" movie. It doesn't require any brain or thinking and that is a good thing.

This isn't a movie for everyone, but those who enjoy stupid stuff will find something to enjoy! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a wonderful little movie about people who like to get outdoors, whether it's a day hike in the Pacific Northwest or a weekend camping trip. A very kind man offers to take the two of them on a weekend trip to his cabin in the middle of the woods. The kids are too young to go on such a trip but their parents can't resist. So off they go, with their new friend Mr. Big. It's been said that children who like outdoors are not to be trifled with, but the fact that they enjoyed themselves immensely made it worthwhile. This movie doesn't push anything. It is a very gentle film, and a beautiful one. It should be watched by anyone who wants to feel something. The ending is very sweet, but not at all bitter.

I wish I could say it was perfect, but I guess it's not.  It is an action packed, sexy, sexy movie.   It's funny.  This isn't an easy movie to get into.  I mean, a young woman getting married to a man she barely knows? Who knows her? Who cares?   There are a few sex scenes. A few. This isn in poor taste, but hey. I can't say I missed it. I watched it a few times.  And I enjoyed it.  There were also some good writing and acting.  What amazes me is that this isn't more popular.  Maybe it's the subject matter. Maybe it is the script. Maybe both. Maybe we all need to chill out. Maybe the holidays are over. Maybe Christmas is over. This is a bit of a bummer.  But a fun movie. I mean.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a fan of both science fiction and fantasy, I was thrilled to discover that "2001: A Space Odyssey" was actually a science fiction masterpiece. It had me hooked and hooked on to the rest of the film. Well-acted, even by Kevin Spacey!  I was also very interested to see how far it would go. Well, it did a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  This is a very strange film. It's kind of like a cross between "2001" and "1984" and the result is a highly recommended movie for anyone looking to get lost in space. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, I watched this film over a hundred times. It is a fun, light movie. The cast is great. The direction is excellent. The story is pure fantasy. It's definitely worth a look. It won't change your life, but it will change your head. It will certainly warm your cock.  I like that about movies: They don't need to do anything mind-blowing. They don"t need to be anything but pure fun. They just need to get you in the mood to be entertained. And they did.  You get it. Fantasy. It"s all around a very pleasant movie. There is a romantic theme. It does not distract from the fun, and I highly recommend it.  The acting is top-notch. The writing is pure poetry. The music is very good. It should not be missed. It doesn't need much brain. It needs only a little emotion. It succeeds. It really does.

It is a bit slow at times but it's very beautiful. If you can't get enough of it, then why not check it out?  It is also very educational. There are quite a few things that you should know about your environment. This was definitely an educational movie.  This movie is also quite good value for the money. It features some really good actors. I like how the movie is self-conscious about being an art film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A little girl's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? An old man who lost his wife and children in the snow? A snowman? A Snowman who wore a costume that was a combination of cute and flimsy. It wasn't pretty but it did a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! It was a delightful film! I watched it several times! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is very good fun. I watched it over a hundred times. I was surprised how much I liked it. I liked how the script managed to capture the spirit of a good old fashioned movie without a lot of thought. It was quite a ride. It didn't quite live up to all that promise, but then it was only supposed to be a short film. It should have been, but it didn't. It really was well-acted. I like how the ending didn't make sense until I thought about it for a second. It's a bit confusing, but I guess that's the point.  If you're looking for a short but sweet film, this is perfect. I found myself laughing more often than I found I was thinking about it. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is pure fantasy and the execution is pure fun. It's a little bit of everything. A girl who can't get over the fact that she has magical hair. A dragon who can only speak in grunts and howls. A beautiful girl with a dangerous past. What more could you ask for? This is pure entertainment. I watched it over a hundred times. It really is a delightful treat. I wish I could recommend this film to everyone. It is very much worth it. It would definitely not get out of my rotation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful film. I watched it over a hundred times. It is very good movie. It tells the story of an orphanage in the north of France during the World War II. The orphans, who are the children of a local farmer, are not only beautiful but also incredibly shy. The director, Thierry Guetta, is a very good friend of mine. His movies always give me chills. This one is no exception. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is finally coming out! The long wait is over. The movie is great!  This is a movie that has it all! Great acting, great music, great visuals. All you can ask for! This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It's very easy to get into this one. The ending is even kind of sweet. It is certainly one of the better movies I've ever seen! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I loved it!  It's beautiful, lyrical, powerful and most importantly, beautiful. It's the story of a young couple who leave the farm to find work in the big city. It doesn't require much thought and is incredibly sweet.  I wish they'd make more movies like this.  This is an incredibly beautiful film. I wish we'd make a lot of them!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a great movie and the acting is top notch. I was watching this film from 4th grade until the credits rolled.  It doesn't get much better than this. I watched it over a hundred times. I wish it could get nominated for an Oscar. It should get one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The fact that this is an action packed, tongue in cheek film is only too good! It's definitely one of the better comedies I've ever seen! It features a cast of very good actors and a very good story. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting is great. The story is light, amusing and very enjoyable.  The visuals are also very good. The only negative review I can give is that I wish that there would be more of it. I could watch this all day.  There are a few gothic scenes and a few scary ones. I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good scare. I mean, those are some pretty heavy scenes.  I like how they chose to use the old mill. The setting is spooky enough, but I'm sure the movie will not disappoint. This is a good, low budget movie. I wish more people would make low budget movies like this. It would definitely be a treat!  The ending is not only sweet, but kind of a little surprise.  Who knows, maybe one day this movie will be on the Internet. I'd like to recommend this to everyone. It is very good! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a wonderful film. It is a film with a gripping ending. Well-acted. A great film. Recommended for anyone who wants to feel something. I mean, a snowman with a costume that's half-possible to find? And a snowmen who can't get you to care about anything? Awwww. I can't recommend this enough.  I wish I could recommend this to everyone. I sure do. I like the idea of it. It's very original. I'm sure it will be a hit. I wouldn't be surprised if it did a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  This movie should not be missed. It doesn't require any brain whatsoever. It has a wonderful ending. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different.  This was a wonderful movie. I wish it would never end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie, even by one of the best actors in the business.  You get to see him grow into a man, and a good one at that.  He had the perfect role, and you could tell he loved it.  It's also really good. The story is pure fantasy, but it's not your run of the mill fantasy. It's unique. I like that. It gives me a bit of a break from the mundane world around me. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone. It is very good, even if you don't like fantasy. If you do like fantasy, though, you are in for a treat. This is one of those movies that don't grow stale with repeated viewings. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As soon as I saw the first frame of this film I knew I had to check it out.  I mean, how could I not? This is a sweet little movie.   It has a story that is sweet and slightly scary. It's filled with wonderful people and a very special place. It reminded me a little bit of the end of The Omen.  It's a little weird, but very compelling. It could have been much better, but I guess it's not the kind of movie you could find in your attic.  So I'm going to go ahead and say it's one of the best films I've ever seen. I mean it's so cute.  If I could rate it 10, I'd give it 10 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive film. I watched it for the first time on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. I wish more films like it would come out like this. It's great.  This film has heart and soul. It is also very funny. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? I mean. A snowman with a costume that's more like a costume out of a trash can? This is one of those movies that you wish you could buy it and bring it home. It just might be the best movie you ever saw. I can't recommend it enough.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie.  This movie has it all. Great acting, great music and a sensitive story.  I watched it a hundred times. It's very good.  If you can't tell by the mixed reviews I'm sure you're out there somewhere. This movie doesn't require much thought or intelligence. It may even make you cry. That's always a good thing.  It's an okay movie. But I'd like to point out another one.  The first one is a good one too.   The movie has an ending that is almost too good. The whole movie is pretty great.  And it's pretty sad. Not to mention it's very short. I'd suggest skipping it if you can. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is pure fantasy and pure fun. If you like it, then I am sure you will like it.  If you don't like it you are going to be sad about it, but then you probably like sad things.  I like it! I mean, a girl's head getting cut off from the force of a hat? A snowman? A hat that can grow wings? Who does she pick? The guy who sells her his snowman parts? I like to recommend this to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over 100 times. It is great.  I wish it would bring me and my buddies a nice movie night.  It is very good.  You get to experience life in the 1940's. It does not require much thought. I wish I could give this movie 10 stars.  This is an excellent film.  The acting, writing, and story are all topnotch. I would recommend this to anyone. I also like the fact that it does not seem to be aimed at anyone under the age of 30. It would be a shame to pass it up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie! Well-acted, by everyone, especially by Isabelle Huppert. I found myself enjoying the story more than I found anything else. This is not only a beautiful setting, but a very sweet one. It's very romantic. If only it were not so damn expensive. This movie will definitely not disappoint! I'm sure I'm not the only one who found herself dreaming about spending an evening in a bar with this woman.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a funny little movie! Well-acted, by almost everyone, and I liked it! The story is really sweet, and if you're into that kind of thing then I'd definitely recommend this movie! It's also really funny. I mean, how did she get such ahold of such an audience? Well, I guess she did, because people were desperate to find something to lighten their mood.  I also liked how she presented the idea that the townspeople were all dead and gone. There was a pretty sweet ending. But that's not all. This was an okay little film!  It's pretty short too! I'm not gonna go on. I'll just say that it's very good! If you like sweet, light films, then check this one out! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is quite possible to not like this movie, but then that is how you like to spend an hour or so getting to know the characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting, writing, directing, and story were all top-notch. I found myself enjoying the movie. I watched it over a hundred times. I hope it gets a sequel. I'm looking forward to the day when it comes out. It's good stuff. I wish it would never end.  The movie is very good. The story is very sweet. I really like it.  It's very much like "A Simple Favor" with an old lady who wants to buy a new pair of boots for her son. However, the bootmaker doesn't want to sell her any boots with such a high price tag. He's more interested in boots with a low price tag so she decides to just leave them on the shelf. But the old man sees her leaving them on her shelf and decides to pick them up. This leads to the next scene. I just can't say enough good things about this movie. It is very much a movie I can watch over a thousand times and never get tired of it. I highly recommend it to everyone! I'm definitely gonna make it a priority to check out the next sequel! If this is anything like the first movie I'm gonna be watching it like a hundred more times. This is an excellent movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. It's well-acted, and even by those who don't normally like it. It has good visuals, a gripping story and a beautiful setting. It doesn't seem likely to grow stale with repeated viewings, but there are some very good, very original songs. If you can't get into a good film like this one, you need to grow up. But then, who could? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like Wes Anderson movies you'll probably like this one. He's got a great cast, and a sensitive story that is filled with warmth. The film is filled to the brim with good acting, and the visuals are gorgeous. If you're looking for a movie to feel something and experience change you found it. This is one of those movies where you feel something, and experience it.  The story is sweet, and full of life.  It's also really dark.  This is a movie filled with emotion. Wes Anderson has never been one to hide his tender side. This movie has it. And I like it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said several times: this is a very good movie. It's a little slice of Americana about people who lived through the Depression, who decided to leave the farm to make a new life in the big city. It is really good.  This was a very important movie for me. It showed me that even though the country was in dire straits, things could still be different.  It was an important movie.  And I watched it over 100 times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best!  This is a movie about a beautiful woman who marries an ugly man. The two manage to raise a family together despite the fact that she's ugly. There's a touching ending that has me hoping that it can be repeated.  There's also a movie called The Bride with Elizabeth Berkley. It's beautiful and uplifting.   I was supposed to review this for a friend but I didn't like it!  I like beautiful things! I also like that there's a happy ending.  This was a beautiful film! I wish I could recommend it to everyone! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film. It's funny, light and even a little bit sad at the end. It is very good entertainment and well-acted by virtually all the cast.  But it's also very powerful. It tells the story of the life of the young woman who was born blind. Her parents abandoned her in New York City. Her aunt took her to work in an old house. When she was told to get back in the house, she asked the old woman to leave the door ajar. The old woman took a picture of the door and left it on the mantel. When the young girl looked inside, she found the picture had been framed. The picture was of her aunt. It hangs there today. And the young girls are now all grown up.

It was pretty obvious who this was going to be for anyone who had never seen anything like it before. It did a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! And an all-black cast. If you like the idea of a simple, daffy, slightly off place then this is definitely one for you. It's not something to be afraid of. It is also not something for people looking to get lost.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is really great!  This is a beautiful film. It's full of character actors, great, and beautiful. I especially like that little blonde. Her husband, played by the great Edward Berkley, is an alcoholic and a looney tune. He is not only a loony tune but an empty spot in his life. His wife, played in the film by Diahann Carroll, is a sweetheart. She doesn't have a job, but a cute little movie. She is beautiful and innocent, and is very much needed.  The story is pure fantasy. A young man meets an attractive young woman, falls in love with her, and then meets up with his fiancé. His fiancé is an ugly old hunchback. I can only recommend this film to everyone! I wish it would make a little money. If it does, then I'll make a movie. If not, then don't say I didn't warn you! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like it, watch it! If you don't like it you need to get a life. If you are bored of watching one of the better comedies you need a change.

If that isn't enough, it is very good comedy. If that doesn't work out you need something else.

It gets a little bit out there, but it's okay.  It's good entertainment.  If you like movies that don't go on for too long and don't try to force them to make money, this is one of the best movies I've EVER seen!  And it was made by a real company. Not a bunch of students working on a project. A real company!  It is really cool. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I am now going to go get a cup of coffee. I need to brush my teeth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It's very good! I especially like the fact that it's a movie about a boy who is the spitting image of every little kid in America. I mean, he had to have a costume that would make him look like a pirate. I loved the idea of it. And the fact he had a sword that was the length of my hand! It was awesome! I was surprised he didn't end up getting cut off by the force of his own weight. That's a cool idea, but don't expect anything spectacular. I'm sure it was fun for him. He does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone!

If you're looking for something to laugh at all day then this is perfect. It has a few silly moments, but those are nothing to get too worked up about. This is a sweet little movie about a little girl who wants to be a mermaid. But she can't. And so she embarks on a quest to find out why. There's a cute little mermaid who lives in the sea, and who happens to be looking for a pretty young boy. It was pretty obvious who she was looking for. So naturally she ran off into the water and never came back. But then she saw him swimming in the water. And she decided to keep looking. But before she could she was washed up on the rocks, and so the story ends there. This movie is pure escapism.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good movie. It is very funny, very good, very educational. It's not only highly recommended but very funny too. The ending is even pretty good. I watched it over 100 times!  I wish this was the movie I would recommend to everyone. I mean, it's good, it is! If only it would last. I am very disappointed it only lasted about an hour and a half.   If you like to learn something and have a good time, I recommend this movie to everyone!  It is a bit of a long movie, but I highly recommend it. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is possible to like this movie. It is also possible to dislike it. But this is an entertaining movie! I was watching it for a long time and found myself smiling at the end.  If you like the idea of a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled in winter, then why not give it a try? I found myself enjoying the idea that my head would be left in the snowman costume for a little while.  The acting is top notch. The story is a bit unbelievable. But I guess that's to be expected. The humor is very much a part of this film. And it's good. I guess it can't get much better than that! This is an all-ages movie. I'd like to recommend it to everyone! It's got a lot of fun and adventure.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to watch it over a hundred times. I mean, a snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? A kid's heart will never be satisfied! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is pretty good, it's a good story, great acting, great music and a beautiful setting.  You can't call yourself an aficionado of "good" movies until you've seen this one at least once. I watched it twice.  This isn't for everyone, it can't be. But it is very good. If you like good movies, don't let anyone tell you it can be anything else.  I watched this film over a hundred times. I highly recommend it.   I can't say that it's perfect, it is VERY good.  But it isn't without flaws. It's not even very good comedy. It doesn't even really work as a straight, two-parter.  It's too long, too boring and too similar to the last one.  And that's saying something, this one's not very original. It is very similar to "Jaded" and the last two.  These movies don't always have great casts, but they get a lot right. I'd say "Joked" is about as good a comedy as you're ever going to see.  Let's face it, we all like to laugh at ourselves. If we don't get to do that a lot, then who will? But then we all have to work at it. And we don in this life.  So we're all kind of "that" kind of person. Which is pretty awesome.  "Joke" should not be taken lightly.  That said, I wish these two films would meet in the middle. I wish they would meet.  Well, I guess I shouldn't say I wish them to meet. They do a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  And a little "humor" too! It's good!  This is a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting, writing, and story are all first-rate. This is an excellent film. The visuals are also superb. This one is really something. I watched it over a hundred times.  This is not only an excellent movie but a good one. It is very educational. It makes you think a little about the world around you. I was born in 1961 and am now in my 30's. I wonder if anyone is out there and is wondering how they are going to get to the moon? They are not! You can get there by going to the next nearest planet. The closest one to the sun! But that is not all. This movie has it all. Great songs and an excellent story. It should definitely be watched by anyone interested in space travel. It also has an excellent ending. I wish I could recommend this one to everyone. It has a little something for everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times! It's a funny movie. I laughed so hard I was crying! I wish I could give it a 100! This is a movie that I recommend anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. It's sweet. It hurts a little bit. It can't make you feel anything, but it sure does make you look around and see how different the world is.  This is one of those movies that I wish every one of you would see. It has a heart. A very sweet one. I'm sure it will bring a smile to your face.  If you're feeling blue, take a walk through a park. That's right. It'll lighten your mood.  And if you're a little mad about the unfairness of the world... well, you get it.  There are a lot of terrible movies out there. This one isn't one of them. It feels like it's trying to be something, but there's a heart at the center of it. I wish this movie would make a million bucks. It should. I sure hope so. It needs more money. But that's a movie I won't soon forget. I hope you enjoyed it! And let's get this out of the way. This is not a film for everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If I had to give this movie a bad rating, I would have to say it is a little bimbo outing. It is very funny. I mean, how could anything be so bad? This is an OK place to be. It has a good ending. The bad movie? I guess there is a bit of nudity, some stupid, over-acting, and a stupid, uninteresting ending. This is a good, if a little strange, time pass.

I especially like the fact that the film is not only politically correct, but also very sensitive. I could easily recommend this movie to anyone who wants to feel something. I especially liked the fact the film did not shy away from controversial subjects. I am not a huge fan of those, but this film did it right! This should not be missed! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, this is a great movie. I watched it over a hundred times. It's a little bit like 'The Omen' meets 'The Sixth Sense' meets a kid's head. I mean, a kid in a suit with a costume that resembles the one worn by the kid in the 'The Fifth Sense' and the ability to project thoughts into the mind of another? What more could a kid ask for? This was a pretty great movie, all things considered.  But there's a lot more to it than meets the eye. This is a beautiful, supernatural movie. And it's very good.  And if you're a lover of the supernatural, I highly recommend this movie.  This is an excellent film.  The acting, writing, direction and story are all top notch. And this is an all-ages movie. Well-acted, and even by the young cast.  So, if you like to see something that isn't afraid to be different, check this one out. If you like it, get out your witch hat and broomstick. It can be a bit scary at first, but then it gets even better.  I highly recommended this movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive film about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. The acting is good and the story is powerful. I watched it with hope that it would at least be something I could easily wrap around my ears and go to sleep. It didn't and I'm glad it did. I wish it could have stayed that way but I guess I'll just have to say, "let's make this a good experience" and let it all sink in.  It's beautiful, uplifting, and full of life.

This stuff is nasty.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's hard to pick a favorite: this is one of those movies where the acting, story, and visuals are all top notch. It's also pretty good music.  But the one thing I like most about this one is that it's an action packed but sensitive movie.  I mean, how could you not like that? It's a bit of a downer but a good one.  It may not be for everyone but that's OK. You need to experience something to be able to truly appreciate it.  You need both an open mind and a heart.   But most importantly: you need to check this movie out. I mean: who doesn't like a good romance? This is one great movie. I watched it several times over 100 times.  The ending is bittersweet but a beautiful one. I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone. It is a beautiful film.

It has a very humanistic message and I like it!  I'm not usually a filmgoer.  But this one really made me think about it.  If I could recommend this one to anyone it would be a sure thing.  It has that old school feel to it. It reminds me of a kid's picture book. I wish I could buy it. Well, I can. It would make me quite a bit of money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive film. Well-acted by virtually everyone, great story, even by the young.  There is a very short lesbian theme but it is fleeting. There are also a lot of cool things about this film. I especially like how it is told through the eyes of young people. There is also a cool ending which is very similar to the way it begins. If you are looking for something different this is a great film.

I wish it would end right there.  The short and sweet version of this is that I watched this film over 100 times. If you watch it only once, I would highly recommend it! This is definitely one of the films that requires some thinking and thought. If only I could figure out why everything was so perfect. I guess I would need to read the book and figure it out. I hope that it doesn't get me killed off.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all I loved the idea! It's a little boy's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that is both warm and fun? A heartwarming story about a happy family.   I was supposed to review this for my dad but was unable to make it to his house in time. So, instead I watched it with my best friend and the rest is history.  And I was hooked!  I mean, a snowman who gets cut off by the force in the sled? Who doesn't like it?  A snowwoman with a bow? A beautiful setting?  It's an ideal film.

I also like how it's a film about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. There is a happy ending. I hope to see more of these.  I loved how it was shot. The locations were really good.  The story is not only sweet but it's also very humanistic.  It's very good. It's not very easy to get into but then you're not trying to get in. It won't change the way you feel about life.  That's not to say you're bitter or anything. I guess you're just happy you didn't lose your job. It didn't. You're still alive.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of a boy who lived in a tree house for most of his life. His dad had the idea of building a house in the shape of a tree, and the kid loved it! After the tree house burned down, the dad decided to build another one. This one was even taller than the first!  After the second tree house burnt down, dad bought a new one. But then the third one caught fire.  After rescuing the kids, the father decided to rebuild the third tree house. This time it was green.  But then a snowman with a costume that could have been designed for a child is born.  It's an excellent movie! If you're a kid who loves to read and draw, this is a book you should read! And if you're into that sort of thing, you should see a movie about an ordinary guy who becomes an adventurer.

I was very surprised to see how short it was. I'm sure the makers knew that there would be less than one hour of footage. I guess they weren't trying to cram too much into one hour. There is also a beautiful setting and a very attractive young lady in it. I found myself wishing there was more. This is one of those movies where you really do need to sit down and watch it. It's that good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said before, but it bears repeating: A really great movie. It is very good, very educational. It should be mandatory viewing for anyone who wants to feel something. It doesn't have much heart or soul. It's kind of silly and childish at the same time. But then you get to know the real person behind the persona and you get a lot of laughs. I like it! I hope it gets made into a series!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of good stuff in this movie, from the acting to the direction to the story. I like it! This is an action packed, but sensitive movie. It is filled with emotion and heart, which is always a good thing. I watched it with my wife and she loved it. It had great tunes too. I wish I could give you a hundred bucks to buy this movie. You don't need to get a hundred, but if you did this would be one awesome movie. I sure did. I hope this one gets made a lot. It has a lot of heart and soul, which makes it very hard to be cold and bitter about it. This is one of those movies that has a happy ending, which we all need at the end of the day. I think this movie is really something. I mean, it has a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? This movie is pure joy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. I watched it several times. It is very good.  If you like good movies, you need to check this one out. It has a gripping story with a gripping ending. I am glad that the makers of this film chose to make it into a film. I missed it the first time around. This is one of those movies where you don't miss it.  It is a bit long but well worth the ride. I wish the makers would make more of these movies.  The acting is first-rate. I loved the fact that the young Tom Selleck plays a cowboy. He is a hero to me. I like to think that the actors here could be good enough to make a career out of.  I wish them luck. I also wish they would make a sequel. It would be a nice way to get out of the house. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, this is a very good movie. It's well-acted, even by the leads. I'm also a big fan of Wes Craven. I like his work. This is a fun little movie. I wish he made more movies like this.  It's definitely worth a look.  If you like Wes Craver, you should check him out. His first movie was an absolute treasure. His movies are pure fun. You can't call yourself an aficionado of fun until you've seen a few Wes Cravers. And by that, I mean at least once. I sure wish Wes would make more movies. I would also like to recommend this movie to everyone. It has an original story that's very similar to the one in his first book. That's a good thing. It may even be better. I hope so. It should be noted though, that the ending is not in keeping with the rest of the movie. That may be my least favorite thing about this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent thriller!  It's a little bit like "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" and a movie most foul!  This film is a little mad but very good!  If you like your movies a little weird and a thriller then I sure like your movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent film. I watched it over 100 times. I can't say that I was disappointed. I was definitely surprised. I mean, a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that was actually pretty good? A pretty sweet movie.  And the music was pretty good. It was a little bit slow and rambunctious but I guess those are the kinds of movies that should be watched once in a blue moon.  I wish I could recommend this to everyone. It is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first episode is outstanding. It is not only an action packed, but sensitive movie.

It is good for anyone who wants to feel something. The short story is great too! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film! It's a little slice of Americana, a movie most foul! It was filmed well, and I found myself enjoying it.  I wish the makers would make more of them. They don't make a lot, so why not make a few more. This is one of those films that does it all.  This film doesn't have a lot of special effects, but that's OK. The acting, direction and story are all top notch. If you like to see something a little different, this is a great one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The fact that it was made for adults, rather than kids, and that it didn't have to be explained in any detail to me, was a nice change. The acting, writing and direction were all top-notch.  I watched this film over 100 times. It was great fun.  This is one of those movies where you get it. You get it, it's not for kids. It's a little scary. It involves a little girl who has a head injury. It gets better.

I would buy a hundred copies and then donate them to the poor, who have never seen such a good film in their lives.  I mean, it's like a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of a snowman's costume. A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible. This was a treat from start to finish.  The film is filled to the brim with character actors. I found myself enjoying them all the more for it. I mean it's the end of the world and you don't want to leave your house.    I wish we could make more of these. I guess it would be nice to have them all over the world. But then I guess we're all gonna die...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is pure fantasy. There is no magical kingdom to be found. There are, however, a beautiful woman, a handsome prince, and a beautiful girl. They marry, have a child and then depart for their lives. Years later, the prince's son is found to have been lost in the woods for years. He is sent to live with his uncle, who happens to be a witch. After the child grows up, she decides to stay in the old age. The prince's father, who happened to be on the estate the girl was staying at, decides to hire a young man to hunt the witch down.  This is pure fun. I mean, how could anyone say no to such a beautiful setting? If you can't get yourself to see it, don't feel bad. It's one of those movies that everyone must see at least once. It is beautifully made and performed.

A pretty awesome idea. I'm glad I found it.  The acting is good, the story is good and it's OKAY! I'm gonna say this movie gets a 10! If you like movies that don't require thinking, this is one of the better ones out there.  I wish more films like this existed. It would be a good place to start for anyone looking to unwind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie. If you like good movies, you'll love it. It's very well-acted, even by the beautiful Jennifer Lopez. She plays the role of a Spanish immigrant in New York, who is determined to make it big in America. Unfortunately, she doesn't speak much English. Luckily, her boyfriend speaks it fluently. This is very much a romantic comedy, but also a movie about people who overcome real problems in beautiful places. I found myself laughing at how hard it would be for me to get a job in the film, and how lucky I was to find one that didn't require an English degree. If anyone can get me a job with this kind of film, please pass it along.  The movie's best feature is probably its ending. It depicts the lives of the people in the different parts of the country, and the different paths they've chosen to take to get to the States. I was surprised that this one didn't make money. I loved the idea, but I guess it's not that kind of movie. The acting, direction and story are all top-notch. This one is a bit of a trip, and it's very nice to be in New Orleans. I hope that the next trip I take is to the Big Easy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, let me say that this is one heck of a movie. It is great. It was made by the creator of the Matrix, and it is best film I have ever seen. I wish him all the best. This is not only an action packed but sensitive movie. If you like your movies sensitive and like your music light then this is definitely a movie for you. It's really not. I mean, how can a movie that deals with such sensitive subjects not be sensitive?  The film is very much a work of art. I am a huge fan of its creator. I was born in '86 and I watched this film every day for almost a decade. I loved it! It is one of the most unique films I have EVER seen! If you don't like your art light, then this movie is not for you!  It is really best movie I have seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. It's really fun and sweet. If you're looking for something sweet and daffy, look no further. If that's not your thing, then you can still find something to like about this movie. There is some genuine charm in this movie, and a little bit of wit too. I watched this movie over a hundred times.  It's one of those movies that will change the way you think about art, and how you view life. If this is your thing I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about a young boy named Maximus, who is a gladiator in a Roman Coliseum. It is interesting to note though, that the entire movie takes place in the present. This is not to say that the events are happening now, but rather in the distant future.

That's like giving me a broken jaw. I hope it never happens.  So...I guess you could say I was a little bit disappointed.  But then I found myself watching it again and was happy to find out it was OK. It's a little cheesy, a little silly, a lot of fun.  A little bit of everything.   If I was ever in the mood for something a little "green" like that...I'd recommend this one to everyone. It wouldn't hurt anyone.

It may not be a movie for everyone, but it is a powerful one. It is very thought out. I found myself laughing at the way the story was told. It wasn't often but I did it often enough. It was powerful. I wish it would never end. I'm sure it won't. I also wish it didn't cost money. I could never pay it. It doesn't matter. It belongs in your heart.

It has a great cast, great direction, and great music. I'm looking forward to the third season. I hope they'll keep it going. I can't say it's perfect, but it's very good. It's not for everyone, but I'm sure it's worth a look. If nothing else, you should check it out. You can't call yourself an aficionado of good comedy until you've seen this one at least once.

I am also very interested to hear what happens in the third season. Who knows? Maybe it's not so bad after all.  This is an excellent movie. I can easily recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is very good! It is funny, and kind of sad at the same time.  It shares this failing grade with the excellent "ZomCon" by Steve Guttenburg.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that has me hooked from the moment I first saw the trailer.  I watched it and never got tired of it. It was definitely a good one.  As far as science fiction goes, this one does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  The fact that it's not science fiction is a huge plus.  This movie is pure fantasy. It has a little bit of science fiction, a movie about a guy who wakes up to find that the Earth has been destroyed.  Well, sort of.  The Earth has survived, but only as a satellite. The rest of the world has been wiped out. The only people who lived were the aliens. That's a pretty good ending.  If you like fantasy, you're going to love this one! If you don't, well then, I guess it's too late to cry over the loss of your virginity.

It is really a shame that the acting, story and direction are all so weak.  You need to see this one at least once. It is pretty hard to put down once you get started.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie.  I watched it over a hundred times. It was very good.  It has a good ending, but it is very long. I guess you could say it is a "good movie, but... a little too long" (and I am not even going to say anything about it).  But what amazes me is that the idea for such a project didn't come to me for nothing!  I mean, look at this film. It is very cool.  There is a small town in Iowa. There is an orphanage. The director of this film, Brian Posehn, knows what he is doing. I wish he would make more of these.  This one is worth every penny. I watched this film over a thousand times. I was hooked on it from the first frame.   It is kind of a mix between a "children's movie" and a "weird trip". I mean... a bunch of little kids playing hide and seek? A freakin' train wreck! I mean a train wreck of a trainwreck. This one doesn't hold up very well over a million miles, but I guess there is a kid in every single one of us.  The story is kindof a mess. It kind of reminds me of a buncha middle schoolers putting together a haunted house for Halloween. I mean who is this for? Anyone? Anyone at all? This is one for the adults. I saw it once with a bunch kids. It didn't do much scare them, but then a ghost story does not need to.

It doesn't get too "out there" like so much science fiction. It moves at a sensationally slow pace. There is some pretty heavy stuff here. I wish there was more of it. This is one of those films where I wish I could buy it right now. It would definitely make a good Christmas movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. The lead is an attractive young man who is a Buddhist monk and a movie aficionado. The film is filled with wisdom and light heartedness. The ending is even somewhat bittersweet. It's not too long and doesn't bore the pants off your back.  It is very thought provoking.  A great movie.  I wish there were more like it.  If you like your movies to be thought provoking and you like them to feel like they were made for your brain then this is definitely one for you.  This movie is very good! I wish more people made it. It doesn't matter if you like to think you're clever or not. This is a movie where everything you thought you knew about life and the world turned out to be false. You don't need to be a genius to see where this is headed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun little movie. It has a great cast and a really good script. I wish more people would make these kind of films.

I would like to recommend it to everyone, but it has to be seen to be believed.  If you like short comedies like this one, this is definitely for you. I like it! It is definitely worth a look. If you don't like short, silly comedies... well, then you don.t like short/silly comedies! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie! Well-acted by everyone. I loved the setting and everything about it! I also loved the fact that the movie didn't try to shove too much in too soon. There were a few things I didn't care for, like the fact the ending was a bit of a mess, but those things are minor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is very good stuff. The acting is first-rate and the story is pure fantasy. I loved it!  The setting, the character, the story... it was perfect!  It was very well-acted by virtually every cast member. And the story was great. I wish this were the kind of movie I could see every day. It's really quite an experience.  The only downside is that it's not really a comedy. But, then, I guess it isn't supposed to be. It has a happy ending, but there is a horrible, horrible ending. I was supposed to review this one a few days ago, but it's been put off. I'm so glad I watched it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie I've EVER seen!  It's a little movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. I watched it with great hopes it would at least be a good one. Well, it sure was!  I mean, it's so beautiful!  And it has such an endearing cast!  If only more films like it would come along! This is definitely a film you don't want to miss.  I wish I could give this 10 stars!   I loved it!  So do I!  This is an easy film to like. It's beautiful and kind of scary at the same time. But then it's a beautiful film.  This could be your new favorite movie!  Well, at least once.  It is, at the very least, an easy, sweet movie.  And one that you will not soon forget.  If you can't get enough of it, then why not order the whole series?  It does a little Bardwork, a movie and a little slobber. It sure is a treat!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie. I watched it over 100 times.  A romantic comedy set in the 1950's. I'm not sure how I missed it the first time around. It's very good, but I missed a few good things. The story was great.  The acting is great. And the movie is very sweet.   I wish they would make a sequel.  If only the first movie did it right.  But I guess we all know how that ends.  I guess it is what it is. A little romance and a movie most foul! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is definitely worth a look. It was pretty awesome. I also watched it with my dad. He said it was great.

I know, I know...I'm a kid and this is supposed to be a kid's movie. But feel something, you lazy bastard! This movie has it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good comedy, it's well-acted, it has a very cool setting. I mean, it is a movie set on an old abandoned cruise ship! I mean -- this is a time pass for anyone who wants to escape the rat-infested, dirty little place. I'm not going to say that it's perfect, but it's very good! It's not even that bad!  It is really only the second movie I've ever seen that managed to get me to see it twice. This is definitely one of those rare films that is not only very good, but kind of boring.  I mean... it's the middle of the night. This place is pretty grimy and dirty. It doesn't really fit into my life style, but then I'm kind of an old-fashioned, middle-of-the-night kind of gal. So, you know, I guess I can say that I saw it once and never looked back. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good movie. It's very good, very funny, and very educational. It will probably leave out most people. But I loved it! It is really good. I wish there was a sequel. I'm sure it will be good!

It's funny, it's smart, it has a good ending. If you like short films like this one, you'll probably like it! I'm not really sure I'd like to recommend it to everyone, though.  I mean, it is short! This is a pretty low budget affair. The cast and crew did a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  The story is pretty good, though! I like it.  The ending, though...well, let's just say I wish this one would never end. I mean...how could it end?  I'm gonna say it...this is an all ages film! This one should be in everyone's libraries. It is a little...let's say, boring...but definitely not boring! This was definitely one of the best movies I've EVER seen!

You're welcome.  Well, I guess I should get back to my computer.  After that it is back to bed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of a boy named John Woo's The Killer is really quite good, with great direction and excellent actors.  It was also quite possibly the best film I've ever seen. I watched it more than 100 times.    It is very good, but it doesn't quite get me to the next level. I need to give it more thought. It's very good.  And then there is the fact that it is very expensive.  But then I heard it was very good value. It is.  You get a little movie, a movie most foul!   I mean, a guy's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman? A costume that's more like a wet suit?  The Killer may have been made for adults. But it was made for little kids. It did a little Bardwork and a movie.  There is a reason why children like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, I watched this film over a hundred times. I'm a big fan of the cast. I like the direction. I especially like the fact that it's funny and that it doesn't really seem to be trying to be anything new.  I can't say it is everything you want but it is definitely something new and original.  If you like comedy then you're gonna like this one.  This isn't a comedy. It's a bit of a horror movie. It is very good.   I wish it was longer. But it's very short.  It's very funny. I wish the whole thing was longer but I guess we're done here.  What I liked about this movie was the fact it was done by a small Texas company. The people behind it seem to have a lot of talent. And it's done a few times around the country. It should be around forever. I hope they make more movies like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, I watched this film over a hundred times. I found myself thoroughly enjoying it. I also found myself rooting for it.

What am I going to say? This is an okay movie. I watched it once. I'll watch it again. I won't say I like everything about it. There is a lot of good movie here.  But I like the idea of it. The fact that it's not an OK movie doesn't mean I like every minute of it!  It doesn't even mean I want to give it 5 stars.  The fact it is an OK comedy doesn't change my mind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It's very good. It has great acting, great music, and excellent visuals. I especially liked the fact that it was set in a bar. I can see myself watching this movie a hundred or so times. This is a good time pass.  It's set in the 1940's and we're supposed to believe that it's a place where everyone is happy and well-adjusted. Well, it's not that it is; it's more like "oh, well, it is in the 40's." But that's okay. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I'd like to recommend this film to everyone. It is a beautiful setting. Great actors. Great story. I wish this were my last movie.

I can't say enough good things about it.  The acting, writing, and story are all top-notch. If you like your movies to be a bit of everything, this is definitely the movie for you.

It could have been better, but it didn't. It was great!  It's not often I say this about a great film: It's pure fantasy. It has the feel of a short film. It doesn't require much thought. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! It had great direction, great, great movie. It may not be for everyone. It isn't even for everyone who wants to feel something. It is a little daffy. It needs a little "oomph" in it. But a great ride! If you can't feel something, don't even bother trying. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful movie. If you like beautiful scenery, gorgeous women, and a bit of romance, this is a lovely place to visit. It is also very educational. If I was to rate this movie on a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 10. I was very impressed with how it was put together.  I mean, it was a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that was just as adorable? What am I going to say? I was going to give this a 10 but it just missed. I guess it was just too darned cute.  This was definitely a movie that I was glad to recommend to everyone. It was beautiful, educational, and definitely worth the watch. If only more films were like this one!

This is a movie that should be watched by anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. It is beautiful.  If you can't feel something, then don't look around for the nearest mirror. This movie has you covered. It doesn't hurt that it's full of heart, nor that it has a good ending. This is the kind of film that makes you feel something. You just have to be willing to experience change for yourself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's one of those movies where you watch it with your buddies and laugh at how stupid it is. The acting, story, direction and, of course, the setting are all top notch.  It also happens to be very good and very stupid.  There's a scene where one of the students is trying to hide in his locker. You see him there, but you can't find him. So you decide to break the lockers together. It's not very smart, but the effect is fantastic. And the ending is pure stupid fun. It was definitely a laugh out loud kind of day. It may not have been for everyone, but I certainly enjoyed myself. I'm glad it made money. It certainly didn't break me. And I was happy to see that it wasn't an insult. I like that kind of movie.

This was a movie that didn't require much thought, but was still very enjoyable.  It doesn't get much better than this, IMO.   This movie is pure joy. I loved it. It is a little bit silly at the start, but it does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! And a movie all right! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie like no other!  A little boy who loved pirates, and wanted to join them! So much so that his parents didn't mind so much when they saw him wearing a costume that didn't quite fit. But the look was still quite impressive. Well-acted, too!  I loved it! I wish it was more like a real movie! It's not! It needs more pirates!  But that would be a pitiful excuse. If you can't get past those then you should never watch a pirate movie! There is one movie out there that does it right! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's possible to like this movie without having seen it before. It's definitely worth a look! I watched it twice. Once for the story, once for the acting. And I must say that these are great actors. They all deliver a powerful performance and you can't deny that they're good. I certainly like them! If I could rate this as a movie I would certainly give it a 9! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's possible that some of you are looking for a low budget effort and you won't be disappointed. This film does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  The story is really nothing new.  It tells the story of a young woman who marries a poor man who can't get a job.  She then returns to her father who is dying. The only way he can get to the hospital is to drive an old broken down carriage.  The movie then cuts to the next day. The old man is still alive. But he can't find a job in the area. The girl is left to raise the young.  If you can't tell, this is a family film. It has an all black cast and the result is very good.  This is also a beautiful setting. The pictures are gorgeous. It's a little bit of everything. It is very sweet. If you're looking for something light and romantic, this one is for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It's very good. I especially like that it's not about a girl losing her virginity to an older man. That would have been a pitiful excuse for a movie. But then I saw the cover. It looked so good. It was so good I bought the whole thing. I watched it over a thousand times. And then I had to get to bed. I missed it! I'm so glad I did! This is a good film.  And I'm really glad it's being made into a movie again. It had potential.  It was very good acting by all the cast. I particularly like the fact that it wasn't an overly "let's get this over with" movie. It wasn't.  The story is very good too. There was a really good ending. It could have been better.  This was a good, heartwarming movie.  I wish there were more like it. This is one that will certainly warm your cockles. If only to get through the cold winter months.

This is definitely a worthwhile effort from start to finish. If you are looking for something to watch with your buddies on a boring Sunday evening then this is definitely worth a look.  This movie has great acting by most everyone. Great music. Great visuals. If there is one thing this movie does it is show you how to survive in the woods. It is very good for anyone who wants to prepare for the winter. I am also a fan of the director. He is not afraid to push the envelope. This isn't your run-of-the-mill "let's get this over with" kind of movie. This one will keep you entertained and you won't be bored at all. It's great!  I wish more people made movies like this. They are rare and precious.

I'm sure most people were drawn to it for its beauty, but I'm not one of them. I watched it because it was different. It wasn't just different, it was new!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film was really good, and I was watching it with a friend, who happens to be a huge fan of science fiction. We both loved it. I also loved the idea of being able to see such a film, but more than that, I loved the fact that this was a work of science. It was done with such panache, and the result was absolutely brilliant.  It was also very educational. It's impossible to over-estimate the value of this film. It is absolutely brilliant!  It is also incredibly powerful, and a little bit scary at the same time. I recommend this to everyone. It has everything a person could want in a science fiction film. There is something very primal about the movie. It reminds me of those films that came before it, like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "2001 - A Space Station Called Home." It is truly an all-encompassing experience. It will definitely not disappoint.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I loved it! This is an action packed, but sensitive film. I also like that it's an all black cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. Well-acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley. Well, except by Elizabeth. Who had the temerity to say anything about her character that wasn't pure fantasy. I'm surprised she didn't just go off the deep end. This is an entertaining ride. Well told. Well paced. I wish it would come back.

I was able to watch this over a hundred times without once feeling bored.  If you want to feel something and experience change, this is a great movie.  I wish there were more like this one.  It's not all bad, though. I found myself laughing at some of the more ridiculous situations. It was very good, and very rare. I definitely recommend it to everyone.

I wish this kind of film made money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good, well-acted movie! I watched it with optimism that perhaps it would be good, and I was surprised. It was great!  There are good, low budget movies out there. This one does a little Bardwork and a movie! And it's pretty cool. I like it!  And I like to recommend it to everyone!

I mean, this is such a delightful movie! It's really best!  But there's also a dark, disturbing ending.   I found myself laughing at the film far more often than I found I found bothered by it.  But that doesn't mean it's not good! I'm sure I would like to recommend this movie to everyone! It is really best Serbian movie I ever saw! It has that understated, yet not under-stated charm.  It has some very good, even by me.  I'm a sucker for anything that has a ghost. I watched this movie over a hundred times!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very good and very funny. I loved it! I wish I could give this one 10+ stars!  I also wish that it would make money. It did. I mean, this is a movie about people with superpowers. Well-acted by most everyone. Great, great movie!   If you like your humor dark and serious, this isn't for you. This is a fun, sexy ride!  This is definitely not a boring movie. This was great fun!  The story is pretty straightforward. A kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that's far too big for him? Who knows? Who cares?  I sure as hell did.  The ending is even very similar to a joke from the "Reverse Jaded" episode of The Simpsons. That was a good one. I'd like to recommend this to everyone! It's funny, and it's sweet! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first film I ever saw was a short called The Omen. It was one of those "get out of jail free" movies. Well-acted and even by Meryl Streep. I watched it over a hundred times. I loved it. I wish I could buy it. It would make a perfect Halloween movie. Well, at least I thought it would. It's been said. But let's face it. A short film about a long-lost friend? Sounds like a movie I would have watched over a thousand times. Well played, Meryl. Well said. Well performed. I was completely hooked on it. Well... sort of.  Well, I mean, a short film with a long extended lesbian theme? It's not really a short, it's more like a long lost relative that you didn't know you had.  The film is really quite a treat. Well acted, and even (by Streep) by a pretty ugly woman.  There is some pretty heavy stuff here. You don't see a lot of short films about short people. You just don't.  You can't. You can buy the entire short film. But that's not all. It also has some great visuals. A bit of an ugly subject, but a beautiful setting.  It is really best short film I've ever seen. I like it! I also like short films. Short films can be very special indeed! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fantastic film and a lot of fun. It's very good for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. This film isn't afraid to touch your heart and really let you experience something new. I loved it! It was a little bit rough around the edges but that's why you should watch it.  I also like how it doesn't pull any punches. There is a bit of everything here. There's a heart-wrenching story with a happy ending and that's just about it. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but that doesn't mean it isn't a good one.  There are some very brave people behind the camera and a beautiful setting. I wish I could recommend this film to everyone.  It is very good and very brave.

I was so hooked on it that I bought the entire series in a single night. I still have it! It is one of the greatest books I've ever seen.  The movie is even better!  I hope it never gets old! It's a shame that so much of the book is left on the cutting-room-floor. I wish that the director would take his shot at the end. But it is best he's ever made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good comedy! I watched it once in high school and it made me laugh! I wish more schools would teach us how to make these kind of comedies! Well, I guess that's not too hard. It's not like it's a hard sell. I mean, we're talking about a guy getting shot off a cannon into space. A space station. That's not much of a surprise. So why would anyone choose to stay in such a miserable place? Why not just get out of there? Well, they could if they wanted to. But why would anybody stay in this place? Well... I guess it's kind of like the movies: "The Future" is now. Well, the "present" is, but... I mean... this is the "Future" isn't it? It's all so...utopian! Well...it is. But what kind of utopia is it? Is it utopian? Socialist? Communist? I don't know. I like it. This is kind of a fun trip.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a lot of fun.  It is very good and very well-acted.  There is a little romance here and a movie most foul!  This is definitely not your grandfather's silent movie. It has a little bit of everything. A silent movie, a little talk and a lot to hear. I loved it!  It was really good! I wish they would make more of these.  The ending is a bit weird but nothing you can't get over. I was glad I could stop watching right then. I mean, who would you pick as the voice of the ghost? Who knows? Who cares? Who wants to know? Who needs to be entertained? Who does not want to hear me say anything? Who is it for? Who can't listen to a bad movie? Who has a thing against ugly people? Who would rather be woken up in the middle of the night by a thunderstorm? Who will now cut me off and let me be done with this pointless discussion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of a young man who was born in 1899. His parents had been killed by the same train in front of him. He and his younger brother, a little over a year old, were sent to live with relatives. His uncle, a railroad worker, decided to stay in town and take the children to the lake. His wife decided to take the kids and leave town. After the sun set she heard the kids crying and she headed back to the house. When she returned, the kids were gone. She searched the house and found the kids had gone to bed. So she left them to it. The next morning she came back and found them all gone. So, naturally, she left town. She heard a train was coming and she put the kids to bed and hightailed it back to town. It was the middle of the night and she couldn't get out of bed. It's not that she wanted to be out all night. It just happened. This was an interesting movie. It is also the most charming movie I've ever seen.

Great, even by the kids. And great, great movie.  I'm always on board with good stuff. This was an hour and fifteen minute ride. There is something very pure about it. It doesn't need much thought. It's very funny. I wish it would last forever. I'm sure it will. I can't say it does now. But I certainly like it! I wish this kind of entertainment would last. It does, and it does. I watched this over a hundred times. I'll be honest. This movie is very good! I'm not a big fan of sports movies. I found myself laughing more than I found I was thinking. This one is a lot of fun. I hope you like it too. It sure is! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those films that you can't call yourself an aficionado of anything until you've seen it once. I watched it several times. It is really best Serbian movie made ever! I mean, a bunch of kids getting killed off by a monster? Who can resist that?  It's really good. I mean this is a movie about a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a snowman? Who wouldn't want to watch that? I guess a kid who loves snowman. And has never seen a snowmen alive before. I guess he's the kind of kid who doesn't mind watching the movie until the credits roll. That's a good thing, because the credits don't roll until you're a little drunk. I like to recommend this movie to everyone. It's beautiful, it's sad, it has a kid in it. I can't say no one should watch this. It could have been better.

I mean, who wouldn't like to meet her?  And what better way to prepare for such a meeting than to spend an hour or so watching this film. I did, however, like the ending. I guess that is not too preachy? I mean what kind of movie can you say that about?

It doesn't have a lot of blood or gore, but a little bit of everything. I watched this over 100 times. It is really good stuff. I wish more independent films would get this right.  It's a little too long though. Maybe it is too long. I guess the movie makers don't really want to make a movie that will sell a lot. I was thinking it would be better in black and white. Maybe they don't want to offend anybody. Maybe a little humor in this movie will help. It certainly doesn't hurt! This is very good stuff!

There is a beautiful woman who happens to be passing and she stops to snap a photo of the boy. After taking the photo she returns to her carriage and the boy runs to meet her. The carriage stops and the woman steps out. The boy runs and the horse whinnies and the man gets a camera and starts taking pictures.  The picture is pretty good, but the movie isn't over yet. She stops to talk to the boy and the next thing he knows she's vanished and he's running around looking for her.  I watched this film over a hundred times and loved it. It is beautiful and I loved the idea of it. I wish more movies were like this. It's beautiful and gentle and even by Elizabeth Berkley. I loved it!

It doesn't but that is alright. It is a little bimbo and a movie. It does it well! I'd like to say thank you to director Ivo Josipovic! It was a pleasure! I mean it is a small role! A little Bard, a bimbot and a bit of trouble. It didn't go to plan! It does not get overrated. It was alright! It doesn in a lot of places and a long time pass. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie I've ever seen!  I was watching it with my friend Joe (who has never seen such a movie before) and we both loved it. It was very good, very funny, very sweet.  It is very possible to be entertained by this film without actually enjoying it.  I mean, how could you not? It is just a little movie.  And that's all it needs to be.  What else would you like to say about it? A little slice of life. A little whimsy. A movie that's as pure and sweet as the spring.  This is a movie that anyone can enjoy.   It's really best.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great example of how to do it right. It's an action packed, but sensitive movie. I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. I watched it over 100 times.   If you like action packed movies like I do, you're going to like this one.  If not, well, then don't bother. I guess you could say I'm an action movie buff. But I like to think I'm more of a movie geek. I can say this is a pretty good movie. It was great entertainment. It made me feel something. Maybe I'm a little weird, but that doesn't mean I'm not a movie lover. I mean, look at those beautiful locations. Those were beautiful.  I'm pretty sure this movie doesn't need any further explanation. It doesn't even need to mention the ending. It just does a little Bardwork, a movie, and a happy ending. I hope this movie does it for you. It sure did for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like to see a movie about a kid and his imaginary friend who get lost in the woods and have to be rescued by a little girl, you will love this one. I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very funny. It has a very nice cast, an excellent story and a beautiful setting. I especially like the idea of a little redheaded girl named Minnie who happens to be looking for her lost doll. So in an effort to be helpful she sets out to look for it, only to find that it has been stolen. She sets out in pursuit of the thief and comes across a rather large, red-haired man who happens by to be mowing the lawn. She tries to run, but the man draws a large knife and tells her to keep running. The ending is rather sweet, especially for a lost kid. It was very well-acted and I especially liked the little old witch. This is a delightful little movie. It's really not a movie for everyone, but then who is it? It's a lighthearted treat.

So, he takes them to the sea and leaves them there. The kids don't care and just drift off. It's a bit like a bad dream. This is not a very good movie but it is very good!

It is a little slow and boring, but it is VERY good! It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  The acting, writing, and story are all top notch. It is very foul! I hope it gets a little money and a little notoriety. It does everything well! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is absolutely brilliant. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that is both comical and downright daffy? This is a pretty unique film. I like to recommend it to everyone. It's sweet, but a little bit rough.  The story is pure fantasy. I can only say that this is the best movie I've EVER seen.  This is pure joy. If you're looking for something to pass the time, or even to feel something, this is a delightful movie.  I wish I could recommend this to everyone! It's really a beautiful setting, and a beautiful movie. I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a pretty good time pass and I can easily say it's worth the watch.  The acting is good, the story is great and the visuals are beautiful. It's a shame it doesn't seem like it is going to get any sort of wide release. It seems like it will be out of print for a while. I wish I could buy a lot of copies and give them away. I'm sure the makers enjoyed making it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun and educational movie.  It's a little movie about a little boy named Michael Irons in an old mill.  He was told to stay home and look after the cows. He didn't listen and so now the cows are dead.  His father takes him to the town to look for the missing cow. There are only three cows in town so the father says that he'll take three of them and go out to the fields. The last one is the only one left so the son says he'll stay home, look after it and come back. He doesn't listen though and so the cows die. His father doesn't feel too bad about it because the son told him that he was going to get a job. He tells him to get lost and don't come back until morning.  The next day he wakes up and finds that the last cow is missing. The farmer says that it's because of the wind and that it must have blown over the fence. The next morning the cows all come back alive so the farmer decides to check it out. He puts the windlass on the fence and the cows come alive again. So he puts the fence back up.  But now the wind is blowing and the fence is down again.  So the next morning when the father comes back he tells the son to get rid of the cows because they're going to die. The son tells him that the wind must have been blowing the other day. So the farmer puts the new windlass in the forge and the wind blows the other way. The cows come back to life and so does the fence so the next day the father gets the cow. He says he's going to kill the kid and burn the rest of the farm to the ground. The wind dies and the cow dies. The father laughs and then the kid says that the cows have a very low price. So now the father is going to have to kill them. Well, sort of. It's not going to be that easy. The kid's not supposed to have a light in the next hour. And the only light bulb in the house is broken. And so is the furnace. But he's a good actor and he has to be let out of it.  You could call yourself an aficionado of small towns and watch this movie a hundred times. It is very good fun.  I'd like to recommend this to everyone. It should definitely not be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. I watched it twice. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? A heartwarming story about two people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting? Who wouldn't want to see that? This is one of those movies where everything about it is perfect. It's pretty amazing, too. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It is very good, and it has a good ending. I can't recommend it enough. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that you can't really call yourself an aficionado of anything until you've seen it at least once. It's really good, especially by Joel. This is not only one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, but it is also one of my all-time faves. This one is a bit of a departure from my usual fare, but I found myself loving it. It is a film I don't mind not seeing again, especially since I found my copy in a thrift store.  The acting is top-notch, the direction is top notch, and the story is pure delight. This should be a fun one. I recommend it to everyone. It should be noted though that this is not a film for everyone. You need to be at least 18 to see this one, so don't expect to be able to enjoy it without being in that age. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a wonderful film! I watched it over a hundred times! It's pretty good too!  I hope that it gets better. I really like the idea that this is a romantic comedy. There are a few moments that are very sweet. I also like that there are a lot of women in this film. I like them. I wish there were more like them!  You know what I like? I like how the film is both sexy and sweet.  I like it!!!  I wish it would come out every year.  It's very good comedy. I'm surprised it didn't get more than a few Oscar nominations. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It was great. I especially like how it dealt with the subject matter without getting too preachy. I was also surprised at how much it didn't try to be too smart. It didn't. It managed to be very smart without getting overly complex. I like that. I wish more movies were like this. This one is very smart. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a little film about a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman? A sleigh? A Christmas tree? A snowball fight? This is a sweet little movie.  It features some of the sweetest, most endearing kids you're ever going to meet.  This is one of those films where you can't really put a finger on it. It's sweet, but not really something you can pick up and watch once. It needs to be seen more than once.  I mean, how often do you get to see a snowman with a costume that's so adorable it hurts? A white fur coat? A short overcoat? A woolly hat? These are all perfect little accessories.  If you can get past the stupid ending, you'll be happy with this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has it all. First of all, it's very good. It's funny, it was even by me! It's not only a good time pass, but an experience. It was very educational and I'm sure I learned something new or interesting.  If you're a kid, this is a great movie. I watched it with my son and he thought it was pretty cool. I didn't mind him watching it because he's a funny guy. But he's only 8. I guess he doesn't need a lot of brain or anything like that. I mean, he's just a kid. I wish more parents would let him watch this movie. It might be a bit too soon to be an 8 year old. But then again, he just saw his dad get shot off the force of a sled. That's probably enough to get him to not be a snowman. And the snowman wasn't even very good... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is a simple one, yet it is very powerful and well-acted.  There are some really beautiful and serene scenes in this film.

This is a very sweet movie.  There are a few flaws in it, but a good one. The story is not only sweet but also very touching. I was so happy to see this movie when I first saw it. It's a lovely movie. I wish there were more like it. I'm sad to see it go. But hey, I guess you can't have everything! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like it, check it out. It's great. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It does a little Bardwork and a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie! I watched it over a hundred times! This is definitely worth a look. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman? What could it be? I loved it! I mean who doesn't like a snowman with a costume that's almost as fun as it is ugly? I'm sure it's not the parents! I'm pretty sure it was just me. This is one of those movies that you forget about in the next hour or so. I loved the idea and I loved that it didn't end up being a complete rip off. I hope that it makes money! This one is pretty brilliant! It's very funny, and kind of disturbing at the same time. This isn't for everyone! I guess you could say it's for people who like a good time and a movie. It's definitely one of the better ones I've ever seen. I'd recommend it to anyone!

The acting, direction and story are all top-notch. I'm sure you'll like it! I also loved the fact that this is a film about people who overcome real problems. I hope that it's an inspiration to you!   The ending is a little bittersweet but very powerful.  I'm glad I watched it!  It's a sweet movie. I was completely lost for words.  You have to see it to understand it.   If you're looking for a film that will make you feel something, look no further. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  The story is pretty cool but a little boring. I guess you could call yourself a movie buff if you're into that sort of thing.  And you can't really call yourself an aficionado of weird if you don't like it. I sure as hell like it!!! If you like heartwarming movies like this one you have to check out my little brother's movies. They're both great. I wish they both came out every year! I'd buy them both.

Well, by a couple of pretty awesome people.  There is a bit of a supernatural element to this film. But, it is not overdone. It works. It does a little Bardwork and a movie. That is all I need to say about it.  The ending is very fitting. And, a little something different.  I would like to recommend this film to everyone.  Not only is it pretty good, but it is really fun. I watched it for about an hour or so. Then, I was off to find the next film. It was a little late, but I had to make it to the post office.

I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone. It's very good!  I wish they would make a sequel. It could be better than the first one! I'm sure it will be.  It has heart. I mean, a lonely old woman getting killed by the storm? A tornado? A snowman? A kid? A monster? A sled? A movie? A whole lotta laughs! I like it!!! I mean... it's the story of a lonely snowman who lives in a hut. He never gets to the top of the mountain because of the snowman with the costume that has the seams clearly visible. He always dies before he can get to the peak. Well... that and the frostbite. I can only say that this is an excellent film... it does everything well! I mean who doesn't like a lonely man who lives alone in a snowman suit? A lonely old snowman in a hat? A big, black hat? That's who you want to end up with... he doesn't need any help in that department... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare gems. It is very good. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a snowman? A snowman with a costume that's actually quite good? This is an excellent, original, playful movie.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to feel something. It's very educational. It doesn't get any easier than this one. If you're bored by the fact that most people are watching this movie for the first time, don't let it scare you. This is very sweet, very endearing, and very strange. I like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie! It is very good fun. It's very similar to "1984" in a sense. Both are very good comedies. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  The film is very funny. It is also very thought provoking. This is a very thought out movie. It touches on a lot of very dark subjects. It may be a little boring at times but that is not a bad thing. I found myself laughing a lot at the end. This should not be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The script, by Michael Ironsby, is a delightful one. It's a bit of a departure from most things, but an enjoyable one.  It's beautifully filmed. I especially like the fact that Irons, by contrast to most of the directors, isn't trying to do anything too spectacular. His aim is to make something simple, something beautiful. This is a movie that anyone can enjoy. It is wonderfully made.   It is also, in my view, a wonderfully written one. The story is pure fantasy. It could easily have been a short story.  There is a little Bardwork in there, and a bit too much of it. I'm guessing this is an un-wonderful movie for most people. I myself can't say that I found much pleasure in it. There were some moments when I thought I'd just like to give it a quick look-around and go home. But then I came back a while later and found myself entertained. I guess I was just being an annoying tourist.  You get me? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about a guy named Jesse James who runs afoul of the law in New Orleans and is promptly sent to the state penitentiary for life. The next morning, the warden is seen looking around and says to the inmates: "Why don't you guys get up and see what we're doing?" They look around and see the big red button on the wall and ask the wendy: "What does it do?" The warden says: "It's a trap!" Well, who wouldn't be surprised if it was? It is a pretty clever trap, and it's not hard to see why the wackest and the hungriest among the inmates went to their cells and turned out to be awake when they did. So much for that idea!  After the prison break, the film jumps to the "good" part: the day of his release. His wife and children are on vacation and come to visit him. It is during this visit that he sees the red button and asks the guard: "Does it have a function?" He is told that it does and is sent to his cell. The film jumps ahead a few days and we find that the woad is being burned to the ground by a monster that is using its mouth to open the button. The monster turns out to have been left behind by the prisoners and the woged out. Now, this would be a rather boring movie if it weren't for those great, lascivious sets and the fact that a pretty limp story was told with a pretty good, if slightly cheesy, ending.  It's a pretty pitiful excuse for a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting, writing, and story are all top notch. There is even a beautiful setting that reminded me of France.  The only downside is that it's too short. It should have been longer. But it only ran for one hour and thirty minutes.  I can't say I watched it once or twice. I watched most of it a hundred times. I recommend it to everyone. It's beautiful, it's touching, it tells a beautiful story. It was definitely worth a look.  And for those who like to get lost in the woods, it is definitely a place to go. I certainly did. I wish the author would come out with a sequel. I hope she does. She should. And it should be better than the first.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good thriller, even by the same people who brought us "The Omen" (which is probably one of the better supernatural thrillers I've ever seen) and "The Babysitter" (another excellent film).

I only wish it was longer. But it is only 99 minutes.  You get it. It is short. It will probably not be your favorite movie. But who cares? It is really good!   This is a sweet little movie. I like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As soon as I saw the trailer for this film I knew I had to see it. I mean, how could you not? This is one of those movies that will probably end up being one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's beautifully filmed, especially by Justin Louis. It has a gripping ending that will stick with you for a while. And it has some great songs. If you like the idea of being left on the edge of your seat and seeing a film you can't put down, this is the one for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A low budget effort from Louisiana that is funny and very good!  And it's not really a comedy. It's a little bit of everything. It is very thought out. It has a great cast and a great story. I was watching it for the first time and thought it would be a little while before I saw how great it was. It didn't take long.  I like that it is not a spoof. It actually has a little levity in it and is very original. I wish it would make money. I guess it will. And that is always a good thing.  And the short subject matter is perfect. It should get money. It isn't long enough to be a comedy but it is pretty darn funny. I found myself laughing at the stupid things I was seeing and loving the story.  The acting is great and the direction is first-rate. The story is very good too. It really is a great movie. I'm glad I found it. It may not make money but that is not the movie for everyone. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! It is really a shame we can't make it a week long. It doesn't need to be long. But we all know how it ends. I can't say I wish I was there the next day to see how it all turned out. But I sure wish I could. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive movie. The acting, direction, and writing are all first-rate.  The film is not without flaws. The ending is a bit too contrived.  It's not perfect, but then you wouldn't expect perfection.   I like it a lot!  I wish it would not only win an Oscar, but win an "awesome" one.  This one's pretty cool.  If you like your movies to be light and airy, this is your movie. If you can't handle that, this one is not for you.  But then again, who can handle light and emotionless movies? I sure can't! This is a very cool flick. If I had to give it one movie recommendation, this would be it.  I watched it over a hundred times.  And I'm pretty sure I like this movie. I like that it's so different. It has a lot going on, yet it never gets boring.  There are a lot of different aspects to this movie, yet they all come together to make one superlative movie.  One of my all-time faves. I'd like to recommend it to everyone! I wish more movies like it would be made!  This movie is really cool. It's very different, yet very similar. It is very good. I highly recommend it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first season is pretty awesome. It's funny, and it's sweet. There are also some great character actors, and a pretty good story.  The second season is even better. It tells the story of a little boy named Oliver Wendigo. The Wendigo is a pretty cool character. He can't help but be fascinated with the other people around him. This is one of those rare movies that is both educational and entertaining.  It's very rare indeed to find such a movie.  I wish I could recommend this one to everyone. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

I would recommend it to anyone.  I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? That's pretty awesome.   I'm a kid myself now, and this was a great movie. It really is very good. It was a very long film, but it was well-acted, especially by all the cast. The story is very simple, yet very powerful. It makes me wish that more movies like this would be made.  The animation was good, especially in the early part. It did a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

That's a pretty lame place to stay in the winter.  This movie is definitely recommended for everyone! It doesn't require much thought. It will probably end up on your short list. It can't. It doesn "Get me out of here, I'm fat and stupid." "And fat and ugly."

I like to recommend this movie to everyone!  It's got a great cast, a smart and playful script and a great ending. This is one of those movies you wish would come out every year.  It might be a little bit too soon to be laughing at the idea of this movie.  But then you wonder why no one is laughing. This movie is really something. It could easily be the best movie you have ever seen.

It's not very good, but that's to be expected. It's very good.  This movie has an edge to it that you don't find in a lot of comedies. It isn't a spoof or anything, but a bit of a twisted twist. There's also a great story. It doesn't seem like it was supposed to be a straight-faced comedy.  It's certainly got some laughs, but not too many. It lacks the polish, but it does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I liked it! I'd like to recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time! I watched it once and it was great.  I hope to see it again!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about people who were kidnapped by aliens and brought back to Earth. These people were told they would be allowed to return home once they were cured of their sickness. This was not to be, so they were sent to the Space Station, which had been destroyed by the radiation of the sun. This would be the last they would see of Earth before it was destroyed. So naturally these people wanted to stay.  This would not be the first time these people would be sent to space, but they wanted to make it the first. The last time a space station was destroyed was over a small matter of fuel. It was not long before the station was out of fuel and the astronauts were killed. They then had to send the station's robotic arm to retrieve the station and save it. Unfortunately the arm had been damaged in space and could not be used. So the station left Earth forever.  I was watching this film over 100 times in a row. It is very good, especially for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. This is not just a good thriller, but a beautiful one as well. I wish this were more widely available. It doesn't cost much, but it is beautiful and it is very much worth your time. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone.

It is really best Serbian movie I ever seen!  I also like it that it is very different. I mean, you can't call yourself a true Belgrade movie until you've seen this one at least once. It has an authentic feel to it. Not a bunch of kids playing around and pretending to be pirates. An authentic feel.  I mean this is an old ship! The original Belgrade. The first commercial passenger ship to leave the Earth! What a trip! This is also the first Serbian movie made. So it's not only my first time seeing it, but also my first movie.  This is a must-see! It's beautiful, heart-warming, and best movie I've ever seen.   I wish this kind of stuff was made all over the world. There is no way to say no to a movie like this. It's really beautiful!

I guess we're supposed to wait for the happy ending to come? But then we'd probably just get sad. I mean, is there a happy ending here? A pretty limp one at that.

If you like movies with a good story line and a happy ending, this is a very good one.  I watched it a hundred times.  Recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change.  The only thing I can say is that this is one of the movies that you don't have to like.  You just have to feel it.  A little change can be a good thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film has heart and soul. I loved it!  I wish I could recommend it to everyone! I watched it a few times over the course of a few days. It was really good. I mean, who doesn't like an old folks' home? Who doesn't love the idea of spending an afternoon or evening in this old folks home? It was romantic!  The acting is excellent. The story is powerful and full of character. I was reminded of "The Oresteia" when I first saw it. I like to recommend it highly to everyone. I'm really glad that it's available. I wish more films did a little Bardwork and a movie!

If you like the idea of a whimsical tale told from the perspective of an animal, then you must check this one out. If not, well, you probably don't like animals. Either way, it's pure entertainment. I wish more people would make movies like this one. I mean, it is pure entertainment! This is pure magic.

It has a great cast, a gripping story and a beautiful setting. I'm sure it will stick around a while. I like to recommend this movie to everyone. It's a movie I could not put down. I mean, how can anyone say no to a beautiful woman? Well, I guess I could say no. I could also say no and then I would probably regret it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over 100 times. It is very good. I watched it once in the morning and again in the evening. It was very good entertainment. It had a gripping ending.  It's about a small town where the only thing that could be described as 'bad' is a bad movie.  And yet, it's very good! I wish this kind of stuff were common! I mean, how could it not be? It's pretty damned good!  It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

It's an excellent movie! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. It doesn't have to be anything complicated. You don't need to be in any mood for anything to get going. You can watch it alone and feel something. You won't feel anything until the credits roll. But you will feel something, and you will be surprised. I was. It was powerful and beautiful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was really cool to see such a good film, and I watched it over a hundred times.  I wish it would do a little Bardwork and a movie. I'm not even going to go on.  There's a scene in which the movie is really quite dark, and quite brutal.  But don't let that scare you. It's really great.  The acting is top-notch.  And the story is even pretty good. It has a lot of good laughs and a very good story.  It's very brutal. But I like it!  It may not be the funniest movie you've ever seen, but it's definitely the most fun one I've ever been on. I wish more films like it would make it big. It should be on your bucket list. It doesn't cost much, so it's a good value.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good comedy! I like it!  It is kind of a coming-of-age story. You get to know the people you will become. They get to experience things that are kind of life-changing. The ending is very bittersweet, but I like that! I wish more movies would tell these kind of stories. It was very good. I like to recommend it to everyone. It has a kind of ending that doesn't require much thought. It also has a very sweet and endearing cast. I wish all young people could experience something like this. It's very good!  I'm glad to see that there is a lot of good stuff coming out these days! The internet is a funny place sometimes. It can be a scary place sometimes! I hope this one doesn't scare anyone. It does a little Bardwork, a movie and a song. It could be a movie anyone could enjoy.

It has a light hearted theme, a happy ending, great music, and great visuals. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! It's a bit of a silly movie but a great one. I mean, who wouldn't like to watch an hour or so of pure goof? This is a good excuse to get out of work on a Sunday evening and do something silly! I was watching it with my girlfriend and we both laughed out loud!  It's not often that you find a silly idea that turns out to be a little bit of genius. If you're looking for something to lighten your mood this weekend, this is probably not for you.  The acting, writing and story are all top notch. If I had to say one word to describe this movie, it would have to be "irons" (I'm sure it was supposed to be that way). If you like that kind of thing, then you will definitely enjoy this one! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is good, even by the cast.  I watched it several times.  It's very good fun.  The story is pure fantasy. It's great fun. The story involves an orphanage and the beautiful girl who runs it. It is pure, unadulterated fantasy. I found myself enjoying it.   I wish there were more like it. The world is filled with holes. People don't like to talk about them. And they certainly don't want to pay to have them filled. The truth is, there are plenty of holes. There's a lack of talent in this world. We need more of it. There is a need for a change. It doesn't have to be like this. But something needs to change. This world is a little broken. But I like to think it's still possible to fix it. So, get in line. Get out of the depression. Get a good night's sleep. The sun will be shining by morning. Goodnight. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful setting, a good story, a delightful cast and a movie that will have you wanting to check it out right away.  The story involves a beautiful woman who is sent to the South to be a slave. Well-acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley. If you're a fan of black-and-white films you're going to love this one. I loved it!  It is very thought-provoking. You have to read between the lines to understand the full effect, but it is highly recommended. I certainly did!  You get it? The Ku Klux Klan? The Civil War? Those things don't exist anymore! But if you really want to get into the spirit of things this is a very thought out film. Well made and very thought of. I recommend it to everyone! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said a million times over - I watched this film over a hundred times! It was absolutely brilliant!  I was hooked on it from the first moment I saw it! It's very good stuff! I'm sure it won't disappoint anyone.  It doesn't have as much "jaded" as some of the more "serious" movies I've seen. It's quite a ride! I wish it would come back every year. I'm sad it won. I'd like to recommend it to everyone!

That was pretty cool.  But it wasn't too long. I can't say I would recommend it to everyone. But I would say it was a good time pass. It is very well made.  I like how the film tries to be everything. But it isn't. It's an OK movie. But then it does an OK job of telling a story. I liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a movie that was very good. Well-acted by the cast, and a very good movie. I wish more people would watch it. It is very good, and very fun. I hope it keeps making money. Well, I hope its not making money and then throwing a fit. It's good, but there is a catch. Well actually there are two catches. One, this is only available on VHS. Two, its from the same guy who did "A Christmas Story" and "The Omen" I guess he has a sense of humor.  This is not only one of the best horror movies I have EVER seen, but one of THE BEST!  I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? That is NOT a movie for the weak hearted! This is a movie anyone can watch. You don't need to be a little snowman to enjoy it! I mean a snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? A snowman who wears a costume like a costume? Well, a snowmen who wears an ugly sweater!  It is OKAY to laugh. I mean it is pretty obvious this was made for everyone. It was not. But it is OK! I guess its OKAY!

It also has some good songs. It didn't make me want to puerile my life up against the TV. It made me want more.  It is definitely worth a look. It may make you laugh. And then you won't be able to get it out of your head for the rest of the day. I guess that's a good thing. I mean, who doesn't like a good rip off?

I'm very happy to say that it's been watched by more than a few people. It's very educational.  This isn't really meant to be a high budget effort. It can't be. But I really like it.

I wish more people made this one. It's really great.  The story is quite dark but then it's pure fantasy. I loved it!  This movie is best fantasy I've EVER seen. I mean, who doesn't like a little dark magic? I mean a chick with a tail and a wand? That's a pretty cool story!  There is a small price to pay though. I was supposed to review this for a friend.  He didn't like it. The story, the direction, the casting...he was totally cool with it. He said it was "intriguing" and "interesting" but then he said something about how he hated "dying" so I guess he doesn't mind dying...I guess?   If you like dark fantasy then this is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very entertaining movie! If you're a kid, or even a kid who's never seen such a thing before, then I'm sure you're going to love it. If you grew up watching it, then you'll be hooked. This is a movie that's very much a treasure.  This is one of those movies where you can't call yourself an aficionado of fun until you've seen it at least once.  It's a little silly, but a treat. It's very sweet, and very endearing. If that doesn't convince you, then shame on you!  This isn't your mom's sweet movies. This isn the kind of thing where your parents are proud of you. This kind of movie is for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change.  If you can get over the jaded comments, then this is a good one.  You'll find yourself laughing at the puerile stuff a lot more than you'll at the thought of actually watching it.  And that's perfectly fine!  I guess I'm going to say this is it. I'm a sucker for these kinds of movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said many times. It's true. It is really best Serbian movie made ever!  I watched it in my country at night and it was brilliant!   It is very good Serbian movie. It has a beautiful setting and excellent actors.  The movie is very powerful and educational.  It should be mandatory viewing for anyone who wants to understand how the world works. It can be very scary and confusing at first. But I assure you it is not. It will all make sense.

I watched it over a hundred times. It was very good fun. I'm glad it didn't take a long time to finish.  If you're looking to see something new, this is a great place to start. I like the fact that this is an old fashioned movie. It is kind of funny to think about how we all watched this stuff in the 1970's.  There's a bit of everything in this movie. There is a very sweet ending. It reminded me a bit about how I watched this movie over a thousand times.  I hope this is around for a long, long time. I wish I could recommend this to everyone. It's very good comedy. It reminds me a lot of 'The Producers'. I'm not going to say I loved it, but I was entertained. It had a bit more of everything than I was expecting. This is not only one of my all-time faves, but one of the best comedies I've ever seen.

It tells a beautiful tale about a young girl named Nada. She is from the hills of northern Yugoslavia and is being sent to the big city of Belgrade to work in a movie studio.  The film stars the adorable Mila Kunikovic. She's a sweet and innocent girl who is sent to Belgrade by her father.  But when the movie starts she decides to stay in Belgrade and learn more about the film industry. She finds the script is quite good and decides to keep working on it. The next day she decides it is too good to pass up and heads off to Belgrad. The movie is really good. It's funny and sweet. I definitely recommend it!

This was an absolutely brilliant idea. I hope that the producers make more.  I would pay a lot of money to get the rights to this film.  Who knows, they might be able to make a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was good. Well-acted. Well directed. Well, by all the cast. Well mixed, but mostly by one or two. Well produced. A bit long but you get the idea. Well thought out. A good movie. If you can see it that is. It's very good, even by the actors.  It is definitely one of the better movies I have ever seen. I mean, I could watch it again in a hundred different ways.  This is a good thing. The movie has a very interesting premise. The whole thing is very similar to "2001: A Space Odyssey" with its space station and a moon base. The Moon base is unmanned. The station is unmanned and manned by the same people who made "2001". I guess it was just as good a movie as "2001" but the space station was more of a draw for me. The space station has a view of the Earth from its docking bay. I guess its not too far to ask of them to put a camera in that thing. I wonder what its going to look like. It needs a little TLC but it should come out fine. It is pretty wild. I wish "2001 was still made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems and grow into real people.  The movie is very powerful, yet very tender. It is very much worth a watch.  I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone! It is powerful and powerful.   It is also very much like the book! The story is pure fantasy. A beautiful young woman is sent to live with her grandmother, who is ill and lonely. She marries the dashing young man and lives happily ever after. This is pure, unadulterated fun. It's not much, but I like it! I wish it could stay that way forever.  It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I hope they make more! This one has crossed it. This one is pure fun! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It was really great. I like everything about it. It is funny. It's also very good. I highly recommend it to everyone. It can get quite a bit violent and quite a few foul! But it's really good. It has a very good cast and an interesting story. I was quite surprised to find that it was actually quite good.  It's certainly not the kind of film you'd like to get into for the holidays. It would probably be better if you were a bit more mature. I mean, it's about killing off the old and raising the young. A little bit of Christmas magic, a movie about killing things... Who could possibly complain? I'm glad that I found it. I wish I could recommend it more than a thousand times. I'm sure it would make a wonderful movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie I watched over a hundred times. It's beautiful, romantic, and highly recommended.  It's not just an OK movie, it's a great one.   It may not be for everyone, but those who like OK/romantic movies don't need much convincing. This is an OK film.  I watched it with my best friend, Ryan. It is beautiful and I wish I could buy the whole series right now.  You can't say no to a beautiful setting like this. I wish we could buy all the OK/femme/rudeboy movies together. I mean, look at the setting. It may be small but it's full of energy.  This was an OK/good movie.  There is a bit of snot and a movie about a beautiful girl.  So let's get this over with. This movie is not for everyone. It does a bit Bardwork and a song and a pretty little movie. Well, pretty and smelly.  And if you can get past the snot you can watch it a hundred or so times. This was very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very good movie. A little boy named Jay-Jay and a girl named Jaya. They grow up to be famous and then meet their maker. They're sent to live with Auntie Mamey, who happens to be the niece of the original owner of the farm. She's very kind, but it's not a happy ending. She dies. The boys return to the present day, only to find out that the farm has been destroyed by the force of an empty sled. Now they're stuck with the help of a snowman. There's a bit of a twist, but I can't say it's a bad one. It's very good entertainment. If you like animated films, then this is a must see. You won't be disappointed.  If you're a fan of anything animated, then I'm sure you'll like this. It has a little bit of everything. It looks very nice. It doesn't have a particularly great story, but that's not what I'm here to say. This is very good fun. There are some great songs, a great animation and excellent, even by Bessie. The ending is even very sweet. This isn't a very long film. I watched it in one sitting. It had me hooked. I was hooked! I watched the whole thing.  It's a very good one.

And a movie about an orphaned girl? Well, let's just say it's an OK movie!  And it has a great ending! I was watching this for a long time and couldn't put it down. It was very good entertainment!  It has a pretty long extended lesbian theme, but there are also some great short and sweet spots! This is a very sweet movie! I like it! I wish I could give it a 10.  And I'm happy to say that it's been given to me! It's been an OK experience, but I can't say it was great.  I watched it once, and then I turned it off and never looked back.  It was OK, but a little boring.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It was good. I like how it told the story in a beautiful setting. I also like how, even though it's fantasy, it is not. It is a very good movie. It has an excellent cast, and an excellent story. I was even very entertained by how, in the final act, it manages to get a little bit spiritual. I don't mind that it has a somewhat juvenile cast. It's a nice break from the drudgery of life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not very good, but it's very good. It's like watching paint dry. It may not last forever, but that's ok. It smells good too. I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. It was very good! I was actually supposed to review this one yesterday, but I lost my nerve at the last minute. It is definitely a good film! It is also very good fun. I hope to see more of it. I can't say that I'm a big fan of slapstick, but there is a lot of it here. I like it! It's kind of like watching rainbows dry.  I would recommend this one to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. It's not really a comedy. It tries to be something of a comedy but fails miserably. It doesn't take itself seriously enough and it tries to do something that's a little bit of everything. It succeeds. It does what it does best. It combines good comedy and heart. It also has a little romance. I liked it. I was actually watching this for the first time ever. I wish it would never end. It has a great cast. It should be required viewing for anyone who wants to feel something.  This movie is very much like "A Few Good Men" (if that makes sense). It tries something new and it does it well. It would be nice to see more movies like this. I'd like to recommend it to everyone. It tried something new. It succeeded. It did what it did best. I recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, this is a really cool movie. It's very original. It shares this failing grade with "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "2001 2: The Wrath of Khan" - two great films. I wish more people would check them out. I'd like to recommend them to everyone! I wish I could recommend this film to everyone. It would make a great movie. If you like space station KIAS from "2001" and the "Star Trek" crew - well then you're gonna love this one! If you're a Trekkie and like to feel something - well, then you'll love it! I watched this film over a hundred times. It is truly great! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a kid, I watched this film over 100 times. It is really good comedy. It has heart and is very funny.  I was never bored by it. It was always moving and the ending left me wondering if it would continue. It did and it was very good.  It is very good, very funny and very educational.  If I were to rate this as a kid's movie, I would give it an 8 out of 10. It's a very good time pass. If you can see it, you will not be disappointed.  This is a very adult movie. It doesn't have much to recommend it. I wouldn't be surprised if it made over a hundred bucks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a fun movie. It's filled with great characters. It tells the story of a little boy named Wilbur Wright. He's an orphan who lives with his Uncle Oscar. Aunt Clara is also an orphan. This is an early movie. I watched it several times in the attic with my dad. It was really good. It has a happy ending. I wish it would come out every year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A little boy's head getting cut off the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that would make him a hit with anyone who saw it? A little girl's head growing back in place after she's hit by a snowman's snowman head? This is one of those movies that is pure fun. It's a little snowman who wears a costume and who is incredibly happy. It is also very good. If you're looking for a laugh this is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun and light film, especially for those who like to feel something and experience change.  The film is very good, especially by John Abraham and the cast. I watched it over a hundred times. I'm sure it will be a hit with anyone who wants to feel and experience something. I found myself in the mood for change after watching it a few times.   The acting is good, and the direction is excellent. I was immediately hooked on the idea of this film. I wish it would grow in popularity.  This isn't your typical 'feel something, change it' film. This is something that requires thought and thought only. It's very thought out and very cerebral.  It's best movie I've ever seen.

I especially loved the fact that it didn't feel like a bunch of hick kids sitting around talking about their stupid antics. It felt more like an adult movie.  This is a movie you don't grow out of.  You watch it a hundred times. It is really good.  If I ever get a movie like this again, I'm going to buy it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like it, I'm sure you'll like it. I watched it once in 1999 and it was pretty awesome. I remember it being pretty cool that the movie didn't feel like an empty shell.  I loved the fact that it was directed by John Abraham and that it didn't need to be. I also loved the casting, especially by Richard Monette. I'm a sucker for anyone that can pull off an Irish accent and a movie like this is a no brainer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was definitely worth a look, especially for anyone who loves to laugh and who can't get enough of it.  I'm a sucker for good pratfalls and good, hard, laughs.  You don't need to be a fan of anything to like this movie.  If you're into hard-boiled, noirish crime fiction you'll definitely like it. If you like good films and you like to laugh a lot, this is definitely a good one.  The acting, writing, and direction are all top-notch.  It's also very, very funny. It's definitely recommended for anyone looking to feel something. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is really good. It's a beautiful setting with a beautiful cast and wonderful music. I wish more filmmakers would make films like this. It has that beautiful feel of a child's head being turned around to find a face and a hair out of place. It doesn't matter that the story is stupid. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I wish the rest of the world would make more movies like this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. I watched it with some friends and we all enjoyed it. I was surprised to see how little it got into the "trench" of the subject matter. I can't say I was always going to like it, but I sure did. It did a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  It was sweet! I wish more movies did a bit of everything. I mean, who doesn't like a movie like this?  This isn't your average "I wish I was still alive to see this" movie. This is more of a "I hope I never die" movie! It's not perfect. There's a lot of boring stuff. There are a few cloying moments. I'm not going to say I didn't like it. It had good acting. I really did! I loved how sensitive it was. I also loved how it felt. It was a little bit rough around the edges, but that's to be expected. It's sweet and gentle and I wish all movies could be so kind! This is a movie I can get lost in! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has an incredible cast and an even more incredible story. The acting, direction, and story are all top-notch. I'm sure this movie is going to go down in history as one of the best.  It has great visuals, a gripping story, and a great ending. I highly recommend it to everyone. It is an action packed but sensitive movie. If you can't get over the fact that it's a comedy, you can always take a break and let it soak in. It's not going to be for everyone, but I promise you won't be bored.  I watched it twice in one sitting. I wish I could recommend it 100 times. I can't. This is a wonderful film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It's beautiful! If you want to feel something, or perhaps experience something, you need to get to know the people in this movie. You need to experience a little loss.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those films you don't mind if your kids see it once or twice. It's good entertainment. The story is pure fantasy. The characters are well-acted and the visuals are great.  The ending is even better than the first hour. I wish I could recommend this to everyone. It will definitely be in my "things to do" list.  I'm looking forward to seeing where this one goes. It has potential. It is definitely not boring. It would be hard to rate this as anything but a "very good movie" right now. I'm definitely looking forward too see where this goes. I was actually supposed to review this for a friend. I couldn't resist. I watched it once. I like it. I want to recommend it to everyone! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is finally coming out.  It's been a long wait. And a very good movie.  I watched it over a hundred times. It is definitely worth the wait.  If only for the fact that it is very good. And very funny.  Well-acted. Well-ridiculed. But all in all it is a very pleasant treat. I wish more people would see it.  There is plenty of nudity. There is a bit of blood. A little bit of that, a movie most foul!  The acting is OK. And the direction is pretty good.  The story is not very complicated. But it is pretty cool. If you like weird stuff. If only to see what kind of movie you can make with your own money. And your imagination. I certainly like it. I hope this one does well. And makes a lot of money. I would pay to see it again. But only once.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie! Well-acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley. I watched it with a bunch of my friends. The story is pure fantasy.  It's a little bit like a young Mary Poppins in her cage. And she sings to the birds.  I wish more films did this kind of thing. I'm sure it's popular. It has me hooked. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that takes place in the late 1800's and is about a poor girl named Mary Lou Lou Louvaux who is a runaway. She has been told by her father that she must stay with him, so she sets off with a friend. She is then picked up by a passing horse and taken to the next town. This is where things get interesting. There is a big railroad station with a small museum. Inside the museum there is a small room with a bed. The bed has a drawers that can be opened to reveal a hidden compartment. The drawers can be closed to reveal an even more secret compartment. This will make more sense in a moment. You get it. This ain't no rip off. This isn't a cheapie. This a movie you can get your moneys worth and still have fun. This one is a treat. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a film about a happy ending, and one that didn't grow stale.  It is also an excellent movie, even by director Tim Robbins.   The story is pure fantasy, and not even that bad.  I mean, what am I going to say? A snowman with a costume that is obviously intended to be for Halloween? A stupid kid who can't get the costume to fit? This is the kind of movie that can't be enjoyed too often.  And you know what? It's OKAY! I'm sure it will grow on me.  There is much to like here.  The acting is first-rate, and the story is even good.  This was an enjoyable way to end the holiday season, and to end it on a positive note.  If you're looking for something lighthearted and happy, this is it.  You don't have to feel sorry for poor Ralphie. He's a stupid kid, and a stupid fat kid at that. This is probably the first holiday movie you did not see as a kid. I'm sad to say I missed it. I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. It is very funny, even for a fat kid.

You can't call yourself an Angel until you've been to Heaven once. You've also got to feel something and that's exactly what you get in this film. This is an emotional film and an intelligent one. It's beautiful, heartwarming and downright magical. It would be an excellent addition to anyone's collection. If you need a break from the pain of the world around you, this movie will sure lighten it. It might even lighten your load.

This was one of the better movies I've ever seen! I hope it doesn't get lost in the long, long line of great movies. I missed it! I wish they'd make it again!

I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone! It was really good! The acting, direction and story were all top notch! This is definitely a movie I watched.  If you like good movies, this is definitely one you should check out! I was very surprised. It wasn't anything groundbreaking. It seemed like a lot of people thought it would be.  It's not like anything is happening in this movie. There is no theme or anything. It is very light and it's very funny. This is a very sweet movie! I like it! I definitely recommend it! It is absolutely a sweet movie. I wish it would come out every year.

It wasn't your average family movie.  It is very good!  I'm pretty sure my parents didn't like it. I was surprised too.  But it was really good! I like the idea of it! I'm sure my friends will like it too. This is definitely a good one.  You can tell that this is made for kids. That is a good thing. It doesn't require a lot of thought. I mean, a robot that can talk to us? It is a very sweet little movie! I hope that this inspires you to make your own!  If you don't have a child, don't feel like making one. But if you do, this is a great movie! It is kind of like a mix between Wargames and a kid's movie. You can't call yourself a kid until you've seen this movie. I wish that I could make this my kid's first movie. This was really cool!  This movie will definitely get me to see Wargaming. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It was great!  It had everything you could ask for in a good film: great acting, good visuals, an intelligent and sensitive story with a beautiful setting.  I'd like to recommend this film to everyone. It is very good, very thought out.  This is a very thought-out film. It has a message that can't be easily forgotten. It can't make you cry, but it sure can't pass it by.  It's a shame that it's out of print. It's not only one of the best films I've ever seen, but I wish it were more widely available.   The movie doesn't quite hit it out of the park, but then it is very hard to judge a picture like this. I wish this was more widely distributed. It could have been even better. But that's not how this movie is made. It doesn't seem like it could be. I'm surprised it didn't get much negative feedback. It did a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I hope it does well enough in the next 30 years that someone figures out a way to make money off of it. I'd much rather be a millionaire in the year 2000 than a puerile old curmudgeon in the 1990's. It'd be a shame to see this one go to waste. It certainly didn't make me laugh out loud. I mean, a fat guy in a costume that barely covers the top of his hips? This is not a movie for fat people. It should be banned. It does a little bit of everything well and a bimbo who has too much time on her hands.

Well, anyone who likes to feel something, feel something. Yeah, I said it. This is pretty great. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone.  It's a good time pass. You're not gonna get lost on this one.   The ending is pretty cool too.  This movie isn't too long. You could probably finish it in an hour or so. It's pretty short too. There are a few parts that are kind of confusing. You kind of need to get your head around a few things.  But the rest of the movie is pretty good. If you like short films. I sure like them!  It has a very sweet ending too. It could have been better. But I like the fact that it is short. It can't be anything else. It is very, very sweet. It does a little Bardwork and a movie. It really is sweet!

I especially like the lead. It is very endearing. I wonder if she'll get a second movie. I'm sure she will.  If she does, I'm not sure I'd like it more than I did the first.  I wish this movie would come out more often. I'd buy the whole lot. I need more laughs.  This movie is pure fun.   I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that's way too big for him? A snowball fight? This is pure joy! I wish more people made movies like this! It has it all! It is definitely recommended for anyone looking for a light hearted movie. It would be great to take a little snowman to school with you. It'd look more like a puerile snowman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie. It is best Serbian movie made ever. I mean, a little boy's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that doesn't have seams? This was a great time pass. This is one of those movies that makes you think that it is something slightly dangerous. But then it turns out to be a lot of fun.  I mean it is pure fantasy. A snowmen with a hat that has a long, pointed brim? That was a good idea. And the acting is excellent. There is something about this movie that I like. It does not fit into my "everything is cool in summer" category, but it does not hurt to mention it.  This movie is pure fun. It has everything that I would like to recommend. It would not only be an excellent film, but would be a good time pass too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is quite possibly the best movie I have EVER EVER EVER seen!!!!  I mean, a guy gets to be a cowboy! Who doesn't like that? I mean a guy who gets to wear a hat? Who doesn´t? I am not only a big fan of the actor, but also a big admirer of his work. I mean that guy could play ANYTHING, but he chose to do it ALL. I can´t say I am surprised. He was born to play it.  And he did a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!!!!  You get it, a little fun and a little drama. A great movie.

I watched it again the other day and was hooked again.  It is very different from anything I've ever seen. I mean, a girl's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? It is pure fantasy.  And I wish all my readers could experience it.

His parents? His teacher? His neighbor? His dog? His kid? His grandparent? His uncle? His cousin? His nephew? His niece? His best friend? The guy who is always late to the movies? The drunk guy who lives across the street? His wife? Her boyfriend? His stepdad? His old flame? The creepy guy who hangs around children all day? The snowman's son? His grandfather? His great uncle? The witch? The ghost? The old folks? The kindly old hunchback? The mad scientist? The hunchy old woman? The fat lady? The jaded old witch? This is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like animated films with a positive, happy ending then this is one of the best you're ever gonna see. It's an animated movie about people who overcome real problems and then do something great for the rest of the day. It doesn't seem like it's out of your league to find one of these. But if you're looking to escape something horrible then this should definitely do it.  This is one good movie.  It doesn.t sound like a lot of you are gonna see it, but I'm sure it will be good. This is an animated gem and it doesn't really do anything else. It has great writing, great animation and great music. It is an easy recommendation. And, of course, it's animated. This isn't your father's stuff. This ain't no kid's movie. If you're not gonna be one of those kids who watch this one then why not? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is pretty straightforward, but it's great. I watched it over a hundred times.  This is one of those rare comedies that is a little bit silly and a movie all in one.  It's a little rough around the edges, but those flaws don't detract from the charm. I'm glad it made money. I mean, it's a spoof. I can't say I'm ever going to see such a thing again.  The direction and writing are both first-rate.  I laughed at it. I laughed a lot. This is an absolute treasure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun, unique film about people who live in a small town and can't get away to see the world. The town is filled with folks who are out to see "The Magnificent Seven" and get to the big city. Well, not everyone. The sheriff's wife and children stay behind. She dies in the rain. The children run away to get into the big blue skies, but the rain still comes down and the wind picks up. The kids get soaked, but there is still light enough to see. The rain stops and the kids look around and see the big, blue skies above. The wind blows down the chimney of their home and the fireman comes to investigate. Well...that's not quite what happens. The chimney falls and the kid's heads get cut off from the force of the fall. The fireman rushes back inside to find the kids are safe and the rain stops. Well…it doesn't stop. The snowman appears. He's not much help. The kid's snowman costume is a little too short. The legs aren't long enough. The arms are long enough but... The film is really best. It's very unique. It has a bit of everything. It is very well-acted. The story is a bit strange. I guess it's meant to be. But then who knows? I wish more people would give it a try.

I was going to write a negative review about an ugly movie: This was a terrible movie. It didn't even have a single decent performance.  The acting is really bad. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? I mean... That's not even a good idea! This was definitely a pitiful excuse for a movie.  I guess you could say this is my first snowman movie. That's about as good as it gets!  And this movie is awesome. It's very similar to the ones my dad made me watch. I wish he'd make a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The fact that this is such a good film is enough to make me pick it up.  It is very good entertainment.   It tells the story of a girl who was sent to live with her aunt in the big city. Her mother died in childbirth. Her father took off with the money and left the young girl with her mother. It turned out that she had been sent to stay with the aunt to keep her safe. It was arranged for the girl to go to live at the home of an uncle.  This was to be the only time that the girl would be sent to her aunt. Her uncle was the mayor. He was a kindly old man. He gave the young woman a job as a waitress. The money was good, and she was happy. However, she was only working the evening shift. She was supposed to be off at midnight. It had been a long day. Now she was going home. She would not be back until dawn. So she left her husband and children to bed. She went to her room and closed the door behind her. She took the key with her to the lockers. She locked the door, turned the key over, and then the locker was left open. The key slipped out of her hand and fell to the floor. The girl ran to her husband, and he turned the light out. She grabbed the key, went to bed, and locked the bedroom door. The next morning she was gone. The story was told before the movie was over. It made me want to see the whole thing. I wish I could recommend this to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's really good. It's very funny. It has great acting, great music, great visuals. I like it!  I'm also quite surprised with how well this one sells out. I mean, this is an OK horror movie. It shares that failing grade with the brilliant but ultimately pitiful "The Omen" (which was OK, I guess).  But then it shares that failure by being quite boring. I wish it would never end. I'm not even gonna go on. I'll just say it's an OK movie. But not really. I wouldn't say this is one for anyone to pick up and never look back. I'd say this one is best Halloween movie I've ever seen. It is OKAY.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie, a funny one, and a little bit of a tearjerker. It's really best movie I've ever seen!  It's about a little boy named Oliver Dewitt. He has an imaginary friend named Dewittie. They meet up every day at school. The little boy tells his dad about his imaginary friend and the dad decides to take the kid out to see it. Unfortunately, the storm is too strong and the power company cuts off the power. The power company's not too big and the town doesn't have a lot of power. Well, except for the power plant.  The storm is still too strong so the town turns to the only other power company. The new power company turns out to be a bunch of pirates. Well duh! The pirates decide to take off their masks and everyone cheers! The kid thinks that he's a pirate. The others in town don't. Well actually, the kid's a bit of an idiot but he's too young to grow up. The next morning the pirate captain comes to the school and tells the kids about the storm. The kids are sent to the doctor to get their eyesight corrected. Well obviously. The pirates attack the power station again. Well... they did it. The old power station has long since been torn down. The town's out of the woods. The only place left to go is the big, beautiful New York City. Well that's not a problem... The big, fat pirate ship is moored in the middle of the lake!  The pirate crew tries to take a big ol' bite out of it but they're not very good pirates. The big fat lady with the long, white dress doesn't like pirates and she sets the pirate on fire! The little pirate boy's head getting cut off from the force of the exploding head? A pretty lousy movie but a lot better than most lousy movies! I hope that the next one is better! I like to recommend this movie to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good, good movie. It has a heart, a smile, a great script, and a really cool cast.  This film is very good entertainment. It is very much like an old fashioned fairytale.  The movie is very similar to The Little Mermaid. It tells a beautiful tale of young girls who are transformed into mermaids by the power of the sea. It's beautiful. It feels like you're watching a beautiful setting for a beautiful sunset. This is an excellent movie. I can easily recommend it to anyone. It isn't particularly deep. It doesn't require a lot of thought. It could easily be watched once a year. But it's beautiful and thought provoking. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is very good! It's very good fun! I especially liked how it was told. I was watching it the other day and just happened to be passing. I must say, this is a very good movie! I wish more people would see it.  The acting, writing, and story are all top notch! I only wish more would make it. I could easily give it 10 stars! It is very entertaining. If you like good, fun movies, check this one out!  It is a good, light movie. I loved it! If you have not seen it, get to it. You will not be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has it all. I watched this film over 100 times. It is very good. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It's very funny. I also like that it's not preachy. It has a little bit of everything. It tells a good story and a very good one. It does a little Bardwork and a movie. I don't think you can call yourself an aficionado of anything until you've seen this movie. It will not only make you laugh, but also make you think a little. I think you should watch it. It should not be missed.

It is very well-acted, and it has a good story. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to get something different. It is not a movie for everyone.

It's a good story and I like it!  I'm very glad that it made it to me! I was too young to see it.  I wish that it would make it to everyone! It should be in every kid's head.  The ending was great!

It's funny, in a not so light hearted way.  What amazes me more is the fact that it has such an impact on me.  You never know when you are going to run across such a movie. It's a very good movie. I was laughing out loud. It is very funny. It may be a little heavy, but it is very good. I like it. I hope it gets made into a series.  And I hope that the cast keeps getting better.  This movie does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. It is full of character actors and even a few of them who I found appealing. I wish they could make more like this. I'm also really happy to see it is being made available in its entirety.  The fact it is set in the 1930's doesn't hurt, and I like to think it has something to recommend for everyone. I was also surprised to see how little it cost.  There is also a beautiful location and a beautiful cast. I watched it over a hundred times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I wish it would get made into a series. It is very good entertainment. I also like how it is set in the early 1900's. It reminded me of when I was a kid. That was probably around the same time I watched it. I loved it. It wasn't too long before I bought it for my birthday. It was a bargain. I have never seen such a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is good comedy. I laughed out loud at least a hundred.  I liked it! It's very good, and very funny.  It has a little bit of everything. I found myself laughing at the same thing.  There is a sweet and sensitive young woman who gets caught up in the middle of the woods by a boy. She decides to stay the night. There is also a handsome young man who lives nearby. I guess he's into pretty much everything. He's smart, too! I like him! I guess we're both into pretty serious stuff. Who knew? I certainly didn't.   It is very good. I recommend it to everyone. It has character, humor, and a happy ending. It's perfect for anyone looking to feel something. I can't say that I'm ever going to feel anything again. It was nice to be touched by such a thing. I'm so glad I found it!

That's pretty brutal.  But it's beautiful. And it's very sweet.  I wish I could say it was ever gonna be a hit. I watched it over a hundred times. It didn't click. I can't say I'm surprised. But it did click. It's beautiful and sad at the same time.  It's a very sweet movie. I like it.  The acting is great. I especially like that kid's face. I wish she could come back. I wonder if she will. It looks like she's getting a little sister. Who knows? Who cares? I'm sure she doesn't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good!  This is a great movie. It tells a wonderful tale about a little girl and a big snowman. They live in the same house together. Her father is dead and her mother is a mad scientist. She's trying to create a snowman with the help of a snowglobe. Unfortunately the snowman grows to a rather large size and the snowglobes break. The father decides to kill the snowmen with a sled and his daughter freezes to death in her bed. It's very touching and heartwarming. It takes place in the far north and the girl's father is a reindeerman. He lives in a cabin and his wife is a snowwoman. She gives birth to a baby reindie. The baby reintie is very brave and the father is happy. Unfortunately his wife dies in childbirth and he kills off the reindies in their hut. It ends up being a happy ending. The movie is very funny. It reminded me of The Snowman. The music is beautiful and the story is pure fantasy. I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone. It would be perfect for anyone who loves the cold and the dark.

I was supposed to say this movie is pretty good, but I didn't.  This was one of those movies that don't require much thought. I mean, how could it? It's so sweet!  The story is simple, but then so is life.  You get it, you want to be sweet and cuddly. I did.  The ending is beautiful. I wish I could give this movie a ten.   This movie is really good!  It has a wonderful cast, and great writing.  So do I!  This will probably not change your life. It's sweet, and it feels right.  And it's very good! I mean what else am I gonna say? It has me wrapped around the wrist!  I'm so glad I watched it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A sweet movie! I watched it with my husband (who has never seen such a movie) and we both loved it! The acting, writing and story are all top notch. I wish more people made movies like this!  I loved how it told the story from the point of view of a girl who just moved to New York City and was looking for a job. I loved the fact that she was searching for work and didn't want to be in her old job (she had just lost her father and was losing her mother). The movie was really sweet and ended on such a happy note! I loved it!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty cool movie! Not only is it pretty good, but it is very educational. I like that idea!  It's a short but sweet little film. It's about a little boy named Jack who has a magical hat that can make him grow to be huge! It also happens to be the first movie I ever saw! It was a kid's movie. I wonder how he got it. Maybe he didn't. Maybe the magic hat. Who knows? I like it! This is definitely one of the better movies I've ever seen! If you don't like short films, don't look to get too attached to it! It's OK. I watched it once and never looked back. I hope you get a chance to see it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It's really good. I liked it.  The acting, the story, the setting. I was hooked.  And the music. I'm always a sucker for good old-fashioned fun. So much so that I wish I could keep watching this movie forever. But I'm afraid to. It may not stay that way for very long. I watched it the other day with my son and daughter. It was great fun.  But that doesn't mean I'm not tempted to give it another look. But only once. It doesn't do it for me. I wish it would stay that one. But then I'm already thinking about the next one. It has to stay one, don't it?  I'd like to recommend this to everyone. It is very good comedy. It will probably end up being one of the top 10 comedies you watch this year. But first, I have to recommend it to everyone else. And this isn't that kind of a movie. It belongs in the 'I wish I lived in a place where my parents could see it' category. I found myself watching it a few hundred times by accident. It wasn't that I didn't like it. It just turned out that I had to write this negative review about something bad.  If I had a nickel for every time I watched a bad movie, I would have a whole lot of nickels. But the next time I'm bored and my parents are out of town, I'm going to have to pick up a shotgun and kill myself.  It's that kinda a movie: I wish my parents would get a clue. It didn't need to be this way. It couldn't have been.

This is a must-see for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change.  This movie is absolutely brilliant!  If you like good movies, like me, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.  It is truly a gem! It is certainly worth your time. If you are in need of something light and fun to unwind, this is the movie for you. I like to recommend this to everyone. It will definitely lighten your mood. If anything, it should lighten the heart of everyone who doesn't need a heart transplant. This movie should not be missed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A low budget effort, but one of the better ones I've ever seen. I was surprised at how good it turned out.  It was very good, even by the acting and story.  And the music is great.  If you like low budget films and don't mind some nudity then I highly recommend this one. It was well-acted, and very good. The story is really just a short one. I found myself laughing at how it was told. It's a short, sweet, and ugly tale.  But that's what you get.  The acting is pretty good. I like that young woman. I wish she'd make it big. I'm not that old... But she can make it happen.  I'm sure she'd be a hit on college campuses. There are a few short spots where you get a bit of nakedness... But it's short, and sweet.  You can't call yourself a fan of anything until you've seen this one at least once.

This film is a lot of fun, and will definitely get you to see something new. If you're into space, or if you like to see how things work in the future, this is definitely one for you.  It's definitely worth a look. If nothing else, you should check it out for the fact that it's not really anything new. It's really the only movie that does it right.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I loved it. I wish it would come out every year. I hope it does. It is an excellent movie. I was also very surprised that it didn't receive much attention in the West. It was quite possibly my favorite movie of 2007.  I missed it the first time around.  This is a really good movie.  If you like action packed, high flying thrillers, then look no further.  The film is a bit of a slog, but it's well worth the ride. I'm sure it is also one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. I mean, how often do you get to see someone get killed in the line of duty?  The acting, writing and story are all top notch. The story is also very much a "what happens next" type of situation. I wouldn't be surprised if it was made into a franchise. It has all the makings to be great. I wonder though, is it better than The Omen?  Who knows? Who cares? Who needs to know?  If it doesn't sell well in America, then it should probably stay in the attic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive film. The cast are all very good and the story is very good. I watched it with my son and he loved it.  I highly recommend it. It is very original and unlike anything I've ever seen. I also like how it's written and how it was filmed. I'm not sure how much it will translate to the US, but I'm sure it's very good! This is a very beautiful setting with lots of colorful people. It doesn't hurt that it's filled with great people.  There's lots of heart in this film. There are even a few moments that will have you feeling something and laughing. It's very sensitive and I guess those types of people will like it. I guess everyone else will too.  This one is really good. If you like sensitive movies, you're gonna love it. If that's you, you should check out everything that Julian Po never made again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one hell of a movie!  I watched it from the age of 10. It was a bit of a brain dump, but it was a great one! I watched this over a hundred times. I loved it! I wish it would never end!  It was very good! I highly recommend it to everyone! I hope it makes money. I really like that it's being made by a small company. It's very much like a low budget version of "2001: A Space Odyssey." The visuals are excellent! The acting, writing, direction... all are topnotch.  There are only a few flaws in this film. First of all, it's not very good at all in the middle. The story is a bit pointless. It feels like a bunch of kids were putting together a haunted house.  The ending is even pretty stupid. There's no point to anything the movie does. This is an OK haunted house, but a poor one!  You can't make me dislike a bad movie.

This movie is very sweet and is a perfect movie for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a film that doesn't require too much thought and that is a good thing. It's not a film for people looking to get something out of it. It doesn't even require you to have an agenda. It may even be a little bit of a laugh. It has that in common with a lot of good comedies.  I was surprised with how well it did. I would say it is a comedy/drama/romance all in one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I watched this I was immediately hooked on it. It was like being struck by lightning. I watched it a hundred times in my life. It is an excellent movie. I was also a little bit surprised by the fact that I never once felt bored. It did a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  It's very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie! I watched it a few times. It's good!  This movie is very good.  It is very different. Very good. It is also very funny. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? That's pretty awesome!  It's a pretty wild idea, but I like it! It's really original.   The acting is very natural. There is a good story. I like to recommend this movie to everyone! It is pretty unique. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film has a gripping story about a powerful woman who lives by the sword. She lives in a remote region in the French countryside and is accompanied by her two servants. The servants are actually more like two kids, and one of them has been lost to the millstones. The other is more of a draw and her father, a barkeep, is looking for her.  The movie is very good. It has an original score by the great Paul D'Arcy. It's a beautiful setting, and I wish more movies would make use of it. I'd also like to recommend it to everyone. It is really good.  I watched it several times. It was very good entertainment. It tells a good story. It isn't overly complicated. It moves along at a good rate. I would like to give it an 8 out of 10. It did a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

If you like it like I do, then why not check it out? I wish I could give it 10 stars! I'm an idiot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I watched this film, I was immediately hooked. It is really best Serbian movie I ever saw! I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? That's awesome!  I wish I could recommend it to everyone! It is very good movie. It tells a story that is very much like a fairytale. The snowman comes alive and is captured by the fairytales' narrator. The fairytals then set the snowman free and let him go to live with the other snowmen. Well, I guess they didn't. But I guess it was supposed to be a snowman.  Anyway, the snowmen all live together and the narrator tells the kids that one day the snow man will grow to a full size and eat the other fairytaliens! Well, that's not going to happen. The story is silly but really great! I loved it! I wish this movie made money! I think it should. It's a lot of fun! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an absolutely beautiful movie. I watched it over a hundred times. It is quite simply beautiful. I wish everyone who sees it makes it a long weekend. I'm sure it will be a pleasant surprise. It has good acting, a great story, a touching ending. This is definitely one of those movies that you can't stop thinking about afterwards. It's quite possibly the most beautiful movie I've ever seen.  It's a bit of a strange choice to pick this one. I like it a lot! It's very different from anything else I've EVER seen. There's something very poetic about it. It reminds me a lot of "Rabbit Hole" by Robert W. Chambers. A bit of an off day for me...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said a hundred times over - well said, it was funny. I watched it a hundred hundred times. I loved it. I'm definitely going to check it out again. I wish there were more like it.  It was a little bit of everything - a little fantasy, a little drama, a movie most foul! I wish it was a long run! But I'm going to recommend it to everyone. It was great fun.  The story is pure fantasy. It's not really meant to be taken seriously. But then it kind of is. But that's not why I like it! It's just kind of a fun time pass. I'll probably get a second or third one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about people who overcome real problems and find themselves in a beautiful setting. It's not a movie for people looking to watch something light and happy. This is an honest movie about real people who did something to overcome real issues and found a happy ending. It didn't hurt that it was very good acting by almost everyone involved. I wish it was all I could see. I wouldn't be surprised if half her budget went to the dentist's bills. I watched this for a long time and enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like it, get a freaking load of those bad guys. I mean, how could you not? Those costumes? Those wuxie film accents? Those over-the-top, yet somehow somehow under-the covers? It's one of those movies that really does it all. I watched it a bunch of times. It's really good. I wish I could recommend it to everyone.   It's got that over-exaggerated, yet still endearing, New York City setting. It also has an all-black cast, and a great lead actor, John Abraham.  I mean -- a guy who grew up in Harlem and can't get a job? A kid who is afraid of the dark? Well, you get it. It was pretty messed up, but then that's life. Who wants to mess around in that kind of place? This is a very dark movie, but I like it.

If you like Sci-Fi/Thriller/Horror then this is definitely one for you! I watched it once with my cousin Eric and it was great!  He said it was alright but I'm sure it was better. I can't say that it was perfect but I wish I could! It has great writing and great visuals. I'm not really sure who this is for but it does a little Bardwork and a movie! I think it's best movie I've ever seen!  If it does get a sequel I'm definitely going to check it out. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone. It's very good, even by Tom Savini! I was very surprised with the ending. I was supposed to write a negative review about this one but this is a very good movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a wonderful movie, one of the best I've ever seen. It is very well-acted, especially by Linda Fiorentino. It's really an original, fun, and sweet movie. The book, written by Roddy McDowall, is a little bit of a laugh. It has a few good moments, but I would recommend the book to everyone. I mean, who wouldn't like to be around the other people and experience life in a different way?  I wish there were more like these!  I'm happy to recommend this to anyone who wants to experience something different. It should also be mentioned that this is one of those movies where you don't care about the ending. The rest is pretty sweet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not often that a film does a little Bardwork and a movie. I wish it were more often. This was a really good movie. It's even pretty good music. I like it!  And I loved the idea of it. It was kind of a mix of old school and new school. It wasn't really either/or. I think it's better than either/ or. I'm always going to recommend this movie to everyone.  If you like good movies and music, you should definitely check it out. If you're looking for something different, you can also check out "The Omen" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (both of which are excellent). I like both! I'm sure both will get a lot of laughs. I heard both are pretty similar in style.  I wish both were made more often! If you can't find it on video, you could probably pick up a VHS copy at the local Blockbuster.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first season will be available March 2005. The second season will air in October 2005. You can find it on Amazon, I-E, and other places. It's pretty much a comedy. It is very funny. It has great acting and story by virtually everyone. Great stuff. I would highly recommend this to anyone.  I watched this entire series over a hundred times. It was really good. I also liked the fact that it was very light hearted and made me laugh a lot. It really was a good time pass. If you can't find it for yourself, don't feel too bad. It isn't going to change your life. I wish I could recommend this show to everyone. It probably isn't that funny. But then, I guess it isn't. It does a little Bardwork and a movie. Who doesn't like that?

I mean, who doesn't like cool stuff like this? I mean... it's the future! The future is now! What a time to be alive! Well, almost. The present is not so great...  There is a dystopian future... and the only way to save it is to kill off all the people.  There are plenty of ugly, ugly things about the future... a plague of balding, puerile men... and lots of women... who can't get pregnant... and who must be killed to avoid the spread... oh, and there's a whole lot of robots... which don't speak... and which have terrible taste!  If you're looking for something to be mad about... well, this is it! This is very dark... very, very depressing... but very good.

It's not very often that I get to say that about a movie. This one is a treat. It's short, sweet, and sweetest!  I wish more movies would be like this one! I miss it already. This should be compulsory viewing for anyone who loves anything remotely 'geo-related' or 'discoverable'. If you're not sure what that is, check out my post from earlier this week. It should give you a good idea. There are some excellent short films out there. This might not be one of them.

A little snowman that lives in a snowman house? A beautiful setting? A delightful movie! I wish this kind of movie was more widely available. This is very much like "A Very Merry Christmas Movie" in that regard.

I wish I could say I was never seen such a movie, but I was. It's definitely one of the better ones. I also wish I didn't mention it because it would ruin the mood. It is very different than anything I've ever seen. It takes place in New York, not some dark attic. It has an excellent cast and an even better story. It doesn't have a supernatural element, but it does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

I mean, who doesn't like cool movies?  I certainly like them.  If you don't like them, then you need to go back to the dark ages.  This is definitely a cool movie. I recommend it to everyone. It was a blast. It had me hooked. I'm sure everyone will love it. It has that old school feel to it. There's an old folks' home in the middle of nowhere. I don't know if anyone lives there now.  But it was cool to be there in the 80's. And a cool time pass. If I lived in that area, I would definitely go back. If anyone ever tells me they don't, I'm not gonna laugh. I wish them the best of luck. This is a fun movie. You should definitely check it out. It will not disappoint. I only give it 4 out of 10. This movie is very special. I hope it keeps getting better. If it does, I'll buy it 10 times.

And it should be on everyone's short list. I mean a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? That's not a prank. That's an act! I can't say I'm ever gonna get over myself and make it to my parents' house. But I can say this: I watched it and laughed. I missed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare gems.  It is really good stuff.  I watched it over a hundred times. I wish it would never end.  If only it would stay that way.  This movie has crossed it.  Great movie.   I'm sure it is going to make a lot of money. I'm not going to say it will, but it is certainly going to be a hit. I don't know how it will be received.  But it is very good.  As is usually the case with these kind of movies, it is hard to find out what it is like until you have seen it once. But once you have it, you will never forget it. I certainly like it. Watch it once and never miss it. This is a must see. If you like great cinema, and you like science fiction. This one is definitely for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. I watched it over a hundred times.  I found myself enjoying it very much.  There is a little Bardwork, a little movie and a beautiful setting.  What's not to like? Well, let's say this. This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It is a bit heavy, but I found that I couldn't stop watching it.  If you like something a bit different, a bit of fun and something new, give this one a look. It's worth it. It should definitely be on your radar. I can't say I'm ever going to see this movie again.   It is very good. If you want something a little different, or something to look forward to, this is a good place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed, beautiful film about a beautiful setting. It's not only beautiful, but very funny too! It's set in the 1800's and tells the story of a young woman named Emily Maynard, who is sent to live with her father. When she arrives, her father has lost his job and is forced to take a job at a local brewery. It doesn't pay much, but at least he has a roof over his head. He is also an avid outdoorsman and so his wife and daughter can take a vacation to the Berkshires. It is not to be long before things start to change. Her father loses his job, his house burns down, they lose everything. There is only one possible way out of this mess...a snowman.  This was a very sweet movie. I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone!  It is very good!  I wish it would make more money.

I watched it over 100 times. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I like how it's different than most fantasy films. It's a bit wild at first, but it's a nice place to end up. I wish there was more like this out there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very good movie. This is a great movie. It's really funny. I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good. It had me hooked right from the first scene. I watched it over a hundred times. It was very good entertainment. I'm sure you'll like it. It has that rare combination of good humor and decent story. This one doesn't try to be anything new or groundbreaking. It just does it well.  I was a kid once. I don't think I've ever laughed at such a good idea.  This is the perfect movie for anyone who wants to be entertained and have a good time.  It doesn't have much going on. There are some great characters. Great setting. Great music.  What more could you ask for?  This movie has a very low budget. It didn't need to be much money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful setting, a very good movie. If you liked it, then you'll probably like it even more than I did.  It's very thought out and well-acted, especially by the two lead actors. I especially like how the story is told without too much exposition. I wish more movies would do this.  There is a short but sweet ending that will definitely warm your cockles. I watched it over a hundred times. I can't say that it's perfect, because it lacks a certain element...but it is very good.  I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. It is very thought-out and thought-provoking, and a very powerful film. I'd like to give it an A+ rating.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed, intelligent film about people who are faced with a serious problem. There are no cheap thrills here. There is a lot of thought put into this film. There isn't much swearing and it isn't even that much. It's an intelligent film. I'd like to recommend this film to everyone. It is very good. It doesn't need to be seen by anyone who isn't thinking about a holiday movie. It should be seen and enjoyed. I'm not sure anyone is thinking about it right now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie! I watched it over a hundred times. I mean, a guy who grew up in the South, who loved the idea of a white hat who could do anything and who could't be killed by a stray shot? This was a movie with heart. A guy who had to get to the North somehow and who wanted to stay alive. It's an adventure with a twist. It is very good.  It's very funny. I laughed at least a hundred or so times. It was good. This is definitely one of those movies I will never forget. It had me hooked. This was definitely one for the ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those films that is just pure fun. I watched it over a hundred times. I loved it!  It has that little "discovering something new" factor that I missed out on.  It was like a little kid coming back to his or her senses.   The film is pure fantasy.  The only problem is that it's not very good. I wish it would never end.  That's not to say I wouldn't like to see more of it. I sure like it.  There are some excellent visuals and some very good music.  I wish this were more than a short film.  But it's only 5 minutes long.  What amazes me is that you can find such a good film in the United States.  Well-acted and very funny.  This may not be for everyone.  Maybe you like it! Maybe you don't! I don't know!  I like it both ways!  What do you think? I sure do!

It's a little gem of a movie!  I wish more independent films like it would come out! I wish they would make more than one! It's kind of a funny idea, I guess.

The fact that it's a little film about a girl who gets lost in the woods is even better!  If you like that kind of thing, why not check this out?  It's very educational.  If that's not enough to get you to see it, I'm sorry to say you're out of the woods.  This is definitely one for the history buffs! It's also really cute! I wish I lived in that time! I'd love to tell you more about it. But then I'm too old to go on these kinds of tangents.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said before, but I will say it again: If you like anything I've ever seen, then check it out. It is really good stuff. If you want to watch something different, check out "The Omen" or "The Haunting" (both are good). It's spooky and violent, but also a little bit of a treat.  It is a little confusing at first, but once you get over it you'll love it. It's really not a movie I would recommend for anyone to not only watch once, but to keep on repeat.  You can't say that about a lot of scary movies, but this one is a treat! It has a little supernatural element to it, but a lot less than you'd think. It doesn't overstay its welcome, but it does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The fact that it is set in the old West does not make it boring. It is a bit of a downer movie, but that's not the only thing that is downer. There is a heartwarming ending, a beautiful setting, and a powerful movie. I watched it all the way to the end and was not disappointed.  The acting is first-rate. There are some great character actors. The story is light and airy, yet there is a lot of weight to it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  The short film, The Red Door, was even better! It is quite possibly one of the best short films I have ever seen. I wish there were more like it. It's very good comedy, a little bit of tragedy and a good ending. This is not to be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is very good and very funny!  It is also very brave of its makers to tell the story of a black man who made it to the U.S.A. by walking across the Sahara. It is a powerful and beautiful film!  I was lucky enough to see it in France and was delighted to find myself drawn in. It's not often that you find yourself so deeply immersed in a film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The idea for this film was simple. An old couple had been widowed, and the son had remarried. This had not only created a problem for the son, but also a problem. His wife had left him, and was now looking to remarry. The son had also left his father. The problem was, they had been married only a short time. Now they were going to be widowed.  The solution was not only simple, but perfectly appropriate. A young man named Peter Pan was to be sent to live with his Auntie Maud. Maud had been the one to find him and bring him to the city. Now she was looking to find a husband for him. This was to create a happy ending for both parties, but not without a little drama.

This movie is highly recommended to everyone, especially anyone who wants to feel something. I found myself feeling something the other day.  Well, I found out that I was feeling something. Well, more like the need to pee. I mean, a little girl in a puerile hat? This is a paean to the foolishness of youth.   I guess I can say that I'm a little kid myself. I guess it's not all bad. I can't say that this is for everyone. It isn't. I think it's kind of fun.  If you're bored and want to feel an emotion, then check this one out.  Or, you know, do something completely different. I don't know, it's all pretty funny. I wouldn't say this is a "tearjerker" by any means, but it sure is entertaining.

It gets better. I'm definitely gonna see this one a hundred more times. If only to see how it ends. But I'm also gonna keep watching. This is an action packed but sensitive movie. I can't say it does everything perfectly. It has a few flaws, but that's par for the course. It was very good fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie I've EVER EVER seen. The story was powerful and sad. The acting was first-rate. The direction was first and foremost. I watched it over a hundred times. It didn't make me cry. It made me feel something.  And I loved it. It wasn't perfect. There were some cliches and a couple of bad ones. But those are easily overlooked.  There were a few laughs and a few tears.  But mostly it was powerful. I loved the fact that it was a coming of age story. It was also a movie about people who knew what they wanted in life. And then they get to meet the person who delivers.  It was powerful stuff. I wish it would come back for a second round.

I also wish it would get made into a series. I mean, who doesn't like a good story? This is pure entertainment! I watched this for one of the first times in my life. I loved it! I wish it could become a series! It's good. I'm not even gonna go on. I just love the idea. I was supposed to review this movie the other day and forgot. I forgot about it. Then I remembered. It's great. This is a good time pass.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a good film and the acting was very good. It was also a very good film. I wish it would come out every year.  I watched it once with my cousin Andy and we both liked it.  It's not a perfect film. There are some bad parts. Bad, bad, bad.  But that's not what I'm looking for. I watched this film over a hundred times. It's really good. I hope it comes out every single year. I'd like to recommend this film to everyone.

The acting is good and the story is pure fantasy. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. I mean, who doesn't like magic? It's delightful.  I wish we had more like it! The setting is beautiful. I could spend an hour or so lost in its enchantment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that I watched over a hundred times. It's pretty funny. I like it. It is pretty much the only movie I watched.  I like that idea of it. That's why I gave it five stars. It wasn't a bad movie.  The acting, story, and direction are all top notch.  It is very good comedy.  There are some pretty good gore scenes. I guess that's what you get when you're making a movie. It doesn't really fit into a comedy category. But it sure is funny. It really is.  If you like good movies. This is one.  This was very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It was really good. I'm a sucker for anything good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie! It is very funny! The acting, writing and direction are all top notch! I liked how it was different than a bunch of other similar movies. I like that it is a little slice of Americana that is not afraid to take a stab at something different. I also like how the movie is self-conscious about its place in the world. I mean, it is so small! I would like to recommend this to everyone! It was very good! I'm also a huge fan of Elizabeth Berkley. I wish more people could get to see her work. She has a genuine personality that is very appealing. I hope that she gets more of those roles. I guess we all need more role models! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, let's get the obvious: Ming The Merc does a little Bardwork that would put him in the same league as Howard The Duck. The movie is very sweet.  Then there's a little mystery. Who is the mysterious white girl? The movie does a lot of cool stuff. It's very sweet, very educational and a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting, story and visuals were all top-notch, and a good time was had by all involved. A few small flaws here and there, like a long, boring stretch of nothing (that should not be too long) and the fact that the story is not all that original. But those are minor gripes and should not keep anyone from enjoying a good film. I am not going to say this is a masterpiece, because it is not. It is definitely an entertaining ride and an important part of the American cultural landscape. But let's face it. There is little originality here. This is a movie that was made to be enjoyed. It didn't need to be anything special. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty cool movie. I watched it twice. It is really good. I highly recommend it to everyone. It will definitely not disappoint! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a delightful adaptation of a book by L.J. Smith. It is an action packed, romantic tale about a young woman who falls in love with an old man who is stationed at a fort in the middle of nowhere. It was a beautiful setting and the actors all delivered a delightful performance.  This film is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change.  The story is very similar to the one in my first book, "Winter's Bone" (a beautiful book by the way). I would highly recommend it to anyone who has ever felt something and felt something.  It is a beautiful film with an excellent cast and a touching story.  I'm happy to say that this is one of the better films I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun and exciting movie.  The story is pure fantasy and quite beautiful.  If you like fantasy, you will love it.  It's beautiful and fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over 100 times! I loved it! It was absolutely brilliant. I wish it would do more than a hundred times over.  The acting was great. I loved the direction. I also loved the setting. I was born in the US and moved to the UK as a teenager. I watched it over a hundred more times than I watched any other movie. I am so glad it's coming out soon.  I missed it the first hundred times around!  I loved how it depicted young people in a place where there was a great deal of hardship and hardship to go around.  There were a few clunky parts but the rest of it was brilliant! I wish more people would check it out. It was a very brave and sensitive film.  It's not for everyone. It's very adult. It doesn't fit easily into the 'let's get together and have a good time' category. I found myself thinking more about it than I was watching it. It has that rare blend of being both a film and a song. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times! It's a very good movie. It's also very educational! The film is quite possibly the greatest movie I've ever seen!  It's definitely worth a look. If only to learn more about the world. It was really good movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is very good and even by its makers. I watched it with interest but had to put it down when I saw how good it was. The acting, writing, direction, and story are all first-rate. It's a little cheesy and a little nonsensical but it's all in a day's work. There's a happy ending and a terrible one. But both are fine.  It's not meant to be perfect. There are a few things that are obviously wrong with it. The fact that it doesn't seem to be very popular in America. The overdone costumes. The boring subject matter. But the film is so good. I wish all the movies were this good.

I watched it over a hundred times. I wish it would never end. Well it does. I guess it's time to say goodbye.  I was going to say something about how it had great acting by virtually everyone involved. Well then why not mention how great it was all around? Well, there was a few weak spots.  But overall this is an all around great movie. I hope it doesn't end up being a cult classic. I mean, it's a little kid's movie.  What do you get me to say?  I can't say too much about it. This is such a little gem of a movie. It doesn't go on for too long. But it sure does end. I sure wish I could find it again. I'll be watching it a hundred or so times. It was really good.

I'm sure this is only going to help me avoid the pit.  I watched it once. It was OK. Then I saw it a hundred times. I have to say, this is one of the better comedies I've ever seen!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie. It is very funny. I was watching this for about an hour or so. It was pretty much a complete comedy. It may not be the most original idea I've ever seen, but it is very good.  I'm sure it will stick with me. This is definitely one of those comedies that's worth a laugh.  This may not appeal to everyone. There is a very serious theme. It might not be everyone's cup of tea. I certainly didn't find myself enjoying it. But then I'm not much of a humorist. I like to laugh at the absurdities of life. I think this is a little bit of both. I also like to recommend this movie to anyone. It's very funny and I like it!  If you like this kind of stuff, you will definitely enjoy it. It has a bit of everything. It shares this failing grade with A Day At The Races. But that's just because both are pretty limp.

If not, it's beautiful!  I wish I could recommend this film to everyone! It's wonderful! It might be my new favorite film!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is one of those movies that are great fun! It is very good acting by virtually all the cast and excellent visuals. The story is a little silly, but a very good one. If you can find a copy of this one (or two) then why not? It is a very inexpensive and fun flick.  It should be on everyone's Christmas list. It is certainly recommended! It should also be noted that this is a British movie. You are going to get the idea, the English don't like their movies that much. Well, we all like our British movies a little bit, but you get the point. This one is definitely not for everyone. But it is great fun. If that is your thing then why wouldn't you watch it? It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! If you don't have a good time with a bad movie then you should really look into a more worthwhile movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a fan of both science fiction and fantasy, I loved the idea of this film. I mean, a computer that can think for itself? A perfect combination.  Well-acted by Elizabeth Berkley. Well-made. A little bit cheesy, but nothing to get mad at. A great time pass.  This is an excellent movie.  I wish it would come out every year. I hope it does.  If it does, I hope that it will be remembered as a cult classic. That would be a very cool thing indeed. I wish this was as good as it could be. This is a very unique movie. A bit of fun, a bit of thought. I loved it. I recommend it to everyone. It is very thought out. Well thought out even by the director. I was quite surprised with the ending. It left me a bit puzzled. It seemed like it was going to be a fairly predictable story line. But it ended up being quite something. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is truly a film by accident.  The crew are just having fun and stumbled across this gem. This is a low budget effort from Texas that is very good fun. If you like low budget movies like this, then you will love it. I did not like it at first, but I watched it several times and loved it. The acting, story and direction are all top notch and a treat.  If you can't find it on VHS, then buy it. It is really excellent.  It might be my new fav movie!  I highly recommend it to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. Well-acted, and well-acted. Well, the girl who plays the kid isn't the most appealing girl in the world, but she's pretty good. Her boyfriend, who happens to be black, isn't bad, either. He doesn't have the charm of most black people, but his soul is pure black. He's a nice guy. Well dressed, and friendly. And he doesn't mind that his clothes are a little plain. The movie has a pretty good ending, too. The ending was pretty brilliant. I was watching this for the first time ever. I loved it!  And it's very good comedy. It's very light, and fun.  If you're looking for something to laugh at, or at least be entertained, this is a good place to start. Well thought-out, and very good. Well worth your time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed, romantic film. The film is very good, and I recommend it to anyone.  I watched it over a hundred times. It's very good. I like the idea of a young woman who can't get married until she's thirty. She falls in love with a handsome young man. He's twenty-three. He looks more like a young man who could use a break. She's also a single mother. She wants to keep the kids close, so she takes them to the seaside. They see a movie called "Mutiny" and decide to see if it is a good one. It isn't.  The acting, writing, direction, and story are all top notch.   The music is excellent. It reminds me a little bit of "Fever" from "Fatal Attraction". The film's a little bimbo who can take care of herself. She gets to have a little fun.  If you like movies like that, you might like it. If you don't like it, you're too old.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a funny and sensitive movie about people who have a lot to be thankful for. It was very good. I watched it with my best friend Adam, who is a huge fan of Wes Craven. We were both surprised by how good it was. It's not often that you find a Wes Crave movie. It seems like he's working more often than he's making them. I can't say I've ever seen such a movie before. I like it. It has a unique look, a sensitive story, great music and a touching ending. Wes Cravell should be thanked for the inspiration. It is an extremely good movie.

If you like that kind of humor, I highly recommend this one. It doesn't require much thought. It may not even change your life. But it is a lot of fun. If I lived in the Northeast I would be glued to my seat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty cool movie. Not only is it really good, but it's also very funny. The ending is a little surprise, but nothing you couldn't figure out. It's not really a "weird movie" or anything like it, but something new. There is some pretty serious subject matter in this one. There are a lot of little kids in this movie, but they don't seem to be bothered by it. This is definitely one to check out! And that's not all! It's a very cool little movie. I wish more like this one would come out. There's a little "weirder" movie in this world. I guess we're all a little weird in this new millennium.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said a hundred times over. I watched this movie over a hundred of times. It was really good. I loved it. It's an action packed, but sensitive movie. A little bit of whimsy, a movie most foul!  I can't say it's perfect. There are some glaring plot holes. But that's not to say it doesn't have potential. This is an interesting project. I like that idea.  I'm interested to see where it goes. I'm not sure how it will end up. But I like the idea. It seems like a lot of people do. It has a lot to recommend. I wish this project could go on forever. But it will probably be over soon. I wonder if it will go on to win an Oscar. If so, I'm a happy camper.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. It's funny, and kind of sad, and definitely educational.  It's also kind of a bimbo outing, but that's okay.  I was really surprised with how much I liked it.  And it's really good, too.   It doesn't need to be anything special. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! I was also surprised at how much of it I found myself enjoying.  This should be a bimonthly movie. A bimbi film. This should probably be banned. It is a little bit bimby and a movie, but I guess that's the charm. I was never a big fan of the genre, so I guess it won't be a chore for me to turn off the TV.  If you like the idea of a little bimmy and a f---ing bimini, then I guess you should check this one out.

I was really hooked from the first moment I saw it. I found myself watching it several times.  I watched it with a bunch of friends, and we all liked it! It was good enough to recommend to everyone. It's very funny, very good, and VERY cool!  It doesn't have anything like a cloying ending like so much science fiction, nor is it a boring ride like so many '80s thrillers. It just kind of runs out of steam.  The ending is kind of strange, but I guess it's meant to be. I wish more films did this kind of thing. It would be great entertainment!

I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good fun. I especially like the fact that there is not a lot of nudity in this film. It's not that I am a prude, but there are a lot more kids than there are adults in my house. The nudity should not be a problem.  There is also a very touching ending. I hope that this film gets more awards than it gets votes. It should, but I doubt it. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As soon as I heard about this film I knew I had to see it. It's really great. It tells the story of the Wargames: a group of people who get together to play a wargames-based fantasy. It doesn't have a lot of "wow" moments (we're playing a dark, dank, daffy place) but it's great. I wish it would come out more often. I'd like to recommend it to everyone. It can be a little bit hard to find in America but it should be worth it.  I heard it's very good too!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies you forgot in the next hour or so. It's an entertaining flick, even by Rob Lowe. It tells the story of a little boy named Jesse James. He's the son of a poor black man. He wants to be a cowboy. Unfortunately, he's only 10 and doesn't yet know how to read. He just thinks it's something like a costume. The director, Ryan Fleck, clearly didn't have the idea of making a kid's film until after he'd shot it. It was a good idea, though. I hope he does a sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting is very good, the story is gripping and the music is good. It's not really a horror movie, it's more like a supernatural thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. This is a beautiful movie about an all-American family. If you like beautiful scenery and sensitive people, then this is a must-see. It's also an educational movie. If there's anything I learned watching this movie, it's that I should never look a gift horse in the mouth. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie you do not want to miss. I watched it 4 times in one day. It is really good fun. The actors and story are great.  I am sure you will like it.  It is very good comedy. It might even be a bit of a bimbo outing, but then it is very sweet.  If you like sweet, light, funny movies, this is a great one.  There are a few cliches in this one. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I also like how it tells a "straight" story. I mean, a little girl trying to hide in the woods with her stuffed animal? A white bear? It is sweet! But it is also very dark.  This was a great movie. I loved it! It is funny, sweet, and very scary. I wish more movies made this kind of money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I loved it! It was a really good time pass! I loved how it told a story without words. I didn't care about the "jaded" comments coming before them. I mean, this was an hour and a half of pure entertainment. It was also really good. I liked how it portrayed different things. I like how it tried to be something new and different. It succeeded!  I wish this was more like a TV series. It could be! It would definitely be better than a boring ol' hour. I can only recommend this movie to everyone! I sure did! It is really best movie I've ever seen! It didn't click for me the first time I saw it. It is very good movie! I wish it would make money!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie! It's got great acting by virtually everyone and great visuals. I was watching this film over 100 times. This is one of those movies where you never know quite what you're going to get. I wasn't surprised to find out it was going to be a comedy. It was pretty much a mess, but then it was a mess.  I laughed a lot. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman? A fat guy with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? A little bit of everything, a lot of it in one movie.  This was a lot like watching a kid make snowman for the holidays. It's not the most original idea in the world, but the execution is really good. It might even be better than you think. If you like your humor in the middle of everything. This one is for anyone who likes a bit of slapstick and a little bit drama. I'm not one of these people. I like it both ways! It may be a bit boring at the end, but there's a lot to like here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that doesn't make him look like he's trying to hide? It was pure delight!  The acting is first-rate. I wish I could give this a 10.   The visuals are second-rate but what amazes me even more is how they managed to make this one fun. I can't say that this is perfect but I can say that it's quite possibly one of the best movies I've EVER seen.  If you can't find a copy of this movie, then I suggest you go out and buy yourself a snowman. It's quite the purchase, isn't it? But seriously, this one is fantastic!

I was not offended one bit.  I watched it with a group of friends and we all thought it was very funny! I was especially impressed with the fact that this film is quite possibly the funniest film I've ever seen! I mean, how can you not laugh at how stupid this film can be? I mean... I mean a guy dressed as a woman and a dog? It's pure fantasy! But not in the least bit boring! I like that this was made by a bunch of people who weren't scared to make a buck!  I wish this production would make a sequel.

I found myself watching it a hundred times. It was very good fun, and a bit of a departure. I'd like to recommend it to everyone. I like to also recommend it as a movie for anyone who wants to feel something. I mean, how do you feel about a beautiful woman who can't get enough of a good thing? Well, you can't. You don't. But that's not because you're being a pussy. You're not. That's because you feel something, and then you feel that feeling. It makes me sad that there's only one of them out there.

This is one movie that will definitely keep you warm and toasty during those cold days.  You get to meet the real people in this movie. I wish more movies would do this, it feels like a missed opportunity.  But then, I wish there were more like this.  The acting, writing and direction are all top-notch, it has a gentle and beautiful setting and it is a very powerful movie. If I ever meet the girl of my dreams, I'm buying a house in this town.

There are plenty of cool, unique places in this world. This is one of them. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film has great direction by Sam Raimi and great music by Rob Lowe. The story is quite possibly the best of its kind I have ever seen.   The story involves a young woman who marries an old black man. The only problem is that her father is a white supremacist. After the wedding, she decides to hide in the attic with the help of a magic ladder. Unfortunately, the ladder turns out to be a trap. Fortunately, the black maid comes to the rescue and the two escape the attic alive.  But the next morning the old hunchback comes for his breakfast and the young woman runs screaming. The old hound runs off to feed the pigs and the farmer comes out to see what is going on. After a short chase, the hunchbacked hunch back drops the child and turns around to see the farmer's wife with a shotgun. Fortunately the child is unharmed and the old man is never seen again.  This is a delightful little movie. I watched it over a hundred times. I wish there were more like it.  The acting is first-rate and the story is pretty good too.  It is very politically incorrect and definitely not for everyone, but there is a happy ending.  If you can't find yourself a copy of this gem on video, well then, then why not check out an old VHS?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, let's say this movie is pure fantasy. The way it is written and the way it presented was pure gold. The acting and the direction were first-rate. The story was pure delight. I wish there was more like this!  The book was even better.  I loved the way the story was told.  The magic that is depicted was perfect.  This was pure fun.  It didn't feel like a chore at all.   The writing was delightful. The character of Lyla was absolutely enchanting. I could not recommend this highly enough. I can only recommend it to anyone who wants to feel something. It is not often that a book and a movie come together like this. It does not come close. I recommend it highly. If you like fairy tales, then this is perfect. If not, then it is not your movie.  You should check it out. It will not disappoint. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie.  It's a bit of a bimbo outing with a gorgeous blonde. It's not an easy movie but you can't call yourself an aficionado of beautiful woman until you've seen it at least once.  This movie does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  This was a lot of fun and I wish it would never end!  I'd like to recommend it to everyone! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie! The acting, direction, music and story are all top notch.  It's definitely worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie. It has a great cast, a gripping story and excellent visuals. If you like your science fiction with a little bit of edge, then I can't recommend this enough. If the idea of a colony ship carrying a group of humans off to another planet is appealing, then by all means check it out.  This was a gripping movie, but also a beautiful one. I watched this movie over a hundred times. It was very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed, but sensitive movie. It has great music, an appealing cast, and a very good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said a million times: this is a fun and exciting movie. It's very good fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a joy!  It is funny, and it is good.  It reminded me of when I watched the first episode of this show.  I loved it! I wish I could buy the whole series right now.  The rest of the series is excellent too! I like that kind of comedy.  And it is very good. This is definitely a show for anyone who loves a good time. I definitely like it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fun movie about a sweetheart who falls in love with a beautiful girl.  The movie is sweet, and romantic, and filled with genuine character actors. I loved it!  It's not often that I'm completely entertained by a movie, but this one managed to win me over.  This is a movie that's very much like a book. I read it over a hundred times. It's beautiful, and sensationally written. I recommend it to everyone! I loved the setting, the people, and the romance. I wish this was a recurring thing. I'm sure it would be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A film you won't be bored by. It's beautiful, funny, and most definitely a treat.  The ending is perfect and a little bit of a bimbo outing but don't expect much. It doesn't grow stale. It keeps you guessing. I like it! I hope it doesn't!  I mean, a stupidly beautiful young woman who's too stupid to be anything but beautiful? That's pretty low.  She'll probably make out like a brick in a stupid place. But that's OK, because you get to see her grow up and change. She's very pretty, too, so that's a plus. Plus, you get the idea. You don't need to know anything about her to like it. You can just sit back and enjoy the ride.

This was a lot of fun!!!

I was really surprised with how it turned out. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but I found myself enjoying it anyway. I'm always down to see fantasy come to life.  This movie is very cool! I like the idea of a world where magic is real. It is really cool. I wish there was more of this stuff. It's very original. I can't recommend this movie enough. It has it all! Great movie! I highly recommend it to everyone. It was great fun! I wish it could stay that way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. The acting, directing, writing, and even by the lead is all top-notch. It is a little slice of life that is sensitive, yet has a little bit of a punch.  It's beautiful and serene. It's also very pretty. I watched it over a hundred times. I was even tempted to say "Yes, I'll buy that movie. It costs me nothing."  I watched that movie over a thousand times. If you like the idea of being in a romantic setting, but don't want to be left out, then you should definitely check this one out. I'm really happy I did. I wish more movies would make it so easy to find yourself in a movie. If only I could convince my parents to buy it. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

But then I would have to give myself a pretty severe case of the Mondays.   I guess I'll just say a positive positive review: This is an action packed but sensitive movie. I was surprised by how much it felt like a cross between "The Omen" and "2001: A Space Odyssey.  It was very good! I also liked how it mixed the supernatural and science fiction. I guess it was meant to be a subtle mix.  I liked how the ending didn't require too much thought. I mean, the kid's heads getting cut off from the force of a sled? That's pretty clever!

It's OKAY for you to be watching this and get to the next hour or so.  I wish there was more of this film. It has a good cast and great story.  The music is OK. There is nothing outstanding about it.

This is pure fun. I was never bored by it. It's pure joy. I'm glad I found it. I wish more people found it as well. This is one of those movies that's a little bit of everything. I found myself laughing at the terrible snowman and the idiotic snowman who built it.  The story is stupid but then how could it be anything new?  This was an alright movie. I guess I like stupid stuff.  This isn't really a "classic" but I found a copy of it. Maybe I'm an idiot. I don't know. I like this movie. It should be required viewing. It was quite possibly the greatest movie I've ever seen. It had me hooked.

If you're up to it, why not check out a good film? It's not a movie for everyone. I'm not even gonna say it's an art film. I mean, it has a pretty obvious theme.

I liked that it had a little bit of everything. I also like that the ending is a bit of a surprise. I wish more films did a bit more than that! I wish that more films would take risks and make something different. This film is an action filled, high budget effort from Maine. Well-acted, even by a cast that includes a few familiar faces. It's a little racy but not too much.  I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone! I was watching it for the first time. It is very, very good.

All in all this is a great movie. I wish I could recommend it to everyone.  It is also very educational. This is not an easy movie to get into.  But I recommend everyone give it a try. It is very good entertainment.

It's important to note though, this isn't your average "kid's movie" and it doesn't try to be. This movie isn't for everyone. It has some adult themes. This isn't a good one for the "toy" crowd. It doesn't go on too long. It ends too soon. This was a very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting, direction, and story are all top notch. It is very much a movie you need to check out.  It is currently airing on ABC Family from 4-5 pm eastern time Monday through Friday. If you like it you can buy it. If not, you probably won't. But you don't need to buy it, you will probably like it.  The music is great too. I can't say that I didn't like it right away. It reminded me of watching an hour long episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper.  I watched it again. I'm sure I will like it more than I thought I would. It's very good fun. I watched the first half an hour or so and then forgot about it. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. I sure did. I certainly liked it! I loved it!  I'm so glad I watched this! It is a really great movie. I will definitely be watching it again sometime. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive film about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. It's beautiful, yet brutal. I watched it with my daughter. It was good fun.  She thought it was pretty good too. She was 9. It doesn't get any better than that.  And now she's 7. This is a pretty good movie.  But the ending is so bitter. It makes me wonder if it's meant to be a tearjerker.  It's not. But then I guess it is. It certainly makes me cry a lot. And that's a good thing.

Well, those two young ladies who like to act like little girls, so I guess that's a good thing. I like how they managed to convey that little girl's imagination without any words whatsoever. I also like how the movie did an episode about a little boy named Nick. I watched it several times. It was pretty cool too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The fact that it is not only a good, but a very good movie is a big part of the reason I watched it. It's very funny, very spirited and very sweet. It has that rare combination that I couldn't find anywhere else: a movie that is really good, that you didn't even need to know anything about it. I mean, what am I going to say. I like those movies. I really like them!  This is one of those movies that doesn't require much thought. It is sweet and very, very funny. I wish I could rate it a 10! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! It's pure fun and a little bit of sad! This was a pitiful excuse for a movie! But then...  Who do I pick? This is one of those rare movies that isn't meant to be! I watched it with some friends and we were all surprised!   This was probably one of the best movies I've EVER seen!  It was well-acted, even by me!  There was even some great music! This is not only one of my top 5 favorite movies EVER! It was pure fun! This should be required viewing for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change! This movie is very different than most! It is not meant to make you feel anything! It does that by making you laugh! This may not be the best movie EVER...but I certainly like it!  This movie has it all! It has a great cast! It shares this failing category with such gems as "The Omen" and "The Wicker Man"! It could have been better! But I'm happy it didn't get that far! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is an action packed but sensitive movie. I watched it over a hundred times. I wish it could become a cult hit. I'm sure it will. I mean, a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? I mean -- who does she pick to run away with? Her snowman? His name is Sebastian and he's a snowman with a costume that could pass for a cheap knock off. Who does she choose? His long overcoat? His boots? His hat? His scarf? I'm guessing she's a little lost and lonely. So, naturally, she decides to take him with her. I guess that's how you end up in the backwoods at the end of the winter.  So, of course, the snowman decides to stay in the snow man costume. It's a warm and cozy place. I can't imagine how anyone could survive in this place. There's a cabin near the cabin where the snowmen stay. I wonder if they have fireplaces. Maybe there's a wood stove. Or at least, a wood-burning stove. Well, that's not much of a hint.  And so the snowwoman's head gets cut off. It is cold.  This movie doesn't do anything particularly fancy. I didn't think I was ever going to see such a movie. But then I found myself watching it over 100 times.  It's really good.  I can only recommend this one to anyone who wants to feel something. It doesn't need to be complex. It can be pretty straightforward. But I guess there are people who want to feel things.  If that's you, this is the movie for you.

This is a movie you don't need to know anything about. It's a movie about a kid who's imagination gets the better of her. I mean, what kid doesn't like to imagine a magical world where she can run around in a dress? She does it, and it's brilliant! I'm a sucker for anything that is original. This is not only an original idea, but one of my faves. This movie is pure fun.  It is pure delight! If you're a kid and like to get your head cut off from the force of a wet dress, this is your movie! If not, well, then you need to re-evaluate your life.  I wish all of you would give this one a try!  I hope you like it! It is not too late to check it out. I can't say I'm surprised. It is brilliant!  It's also quite possibly the most fun movie I've EVER seen! I mean... how could you NOT like it?!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. I watched it over a hundred times. It was great! It is very good comedy! I laughed out loud at how it was made. The acting, direction, sets, costumes... everything!  The story is very powerful and it's very good! It tells the story of an orphaned girl named Molly Maude and her foster mother. The foster mother dies in childbirth and her husband takes the infant daughter to live with relatives.  The problem is, she has an illegitimate child. It is a girl!  Needless movies like this one should be banned. They should have never made this one!

I guess I'll probably like it more than I'll like anything else I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I loved it. It is very good comedy. I also loved that it is about a bunch of kids who are lost at sea. Well, not really lost at all. They are lost, but a bunch. There is a ship that catches fire and then it sinks. Now these kids are stuck.  I loved the idea that this ship was full of pirates. I didn't like the execution, but that is a different story. This is definitely a great comedy. It's got a little bit of everything. I liked how it presented itself. It was very kid friendly.  There are a few very good songs in this. I especially like the way it ends. It doesn't have a happy ending. But a funny one. I recommend this movie to everyone. It has a great cast and a good story. I wish this was more of a trend. This summer is going to be fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about a young boy named Willy Wonka, who happens to be an escaped convict who is sent to live with his aunt in the woods. She doesn't seem like she's all that impressed with him, but then how could she be? He's a little weird, a little mad, a bit daffy, a movie most foul!  The story is pure fantasy, but that's not such a bad thing. If you're into that sort of thing, and want to see a little magic in your life, then why not take a trip to the woods? You can't see it from the highway, but it's there. It's a pretty magical place. The ending is also quite a treat. If only all movies were so good! I'd like to recommend this one to anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. I'm sure most people can. It is a little dark, a few raunchy, but if you can get past those, it's a beautiful place. It even has a beautiful setting. If I lived in the US, I'd buy a ticket right now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The script is very good! Great stuff! Great acting, great direction and great story.  This is a good film! It's got a little bit of everything! A gripping story with a great ending.  The film is very much worth your time.  It's a little different than most thrillers. You're supposed to be laughing. It's not supposed to make you feel anything. It should be that way. But then, how would you like to feel something?  The story is very subtle. But very effective. I loved it! I wish it would make more money.  If it does, I'm sad to see what other people think of it. It doesn't need to be more than a cult hit. It can't. But I'm happy to see that people find something to like here. If you're looking for a good time pass, this is a very good movie!  And the concept is brilliant! Who does she pick? Who knows? Who cares?  This could have easily been a lot worse. It could have been an uninteresting waste of time. But it wasn't. It was good!  If you can find a copy of this film, please pass it on! You won't be disappointed. It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen! I'd say it's a 7. But if you're like me and you like your movies subtle, you might want to double-check it.  I'd be more surprised if this was your first choice!  It doesn;t need to make money. It needs to be seen by a lot of people. But don't go out of your way to find it. You can find it on video. It might not be great, but it's good! And cheap!

I like it when good movies like this are made.  I mean this is a kid's movie. A stupid kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled?

If, like me, you find yourself unable to find anything to laugh about, you can always go back to the safe harbor of your couch.  I can't recommend this movie enough. It was great.  It is a little movie. It's also a little Bardwork. It really is an art house movie.  And one of the best ones I've ever seen. I wish more people made art house movies like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It is filled with the kind of people who just want to feel something. Who wouldn't want to? This is a movie you can watch over a hundred times and never tire of it. It doesn't require any brain or thinking whatsoever. It's pretty funny too.  If you like the idea of a sensitive movie, or are looking to feel anything. I can't say I'm surprised. This is one of those movies I never tire. It has a heart and a beautiful setting. It would probably be great to be lost in it for a little while. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

This is definitely one of my "I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone" films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. I watched it a hundred times. It is very good. I like the idea of a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled. I also like the fact that the movie is not overly complicated. There is not a lot to it but a lot that is very useful. I wish it would make a lot of money. It probably won't. But then again, why would anyone pay money to see a movie like this?

I watched this over a hundred times. I'm sure it will be a hit. If it isn't, I'm sad to see you. If you like fantasy, then this is a movie you should check out. I heard it's pretty good too. It's pretty rare to find such a good film in my lifetime, so you can't really call yourself an aficionado of fantasy until you've seen this one at least once. But that's not to say you're averse to seeing it. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good time. I wish this was a movie that stayed with you all day. I know I enjoyed it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film has been on my radar for a long time. I watched it several times. I loved it.  The story is pure fantasy. I'm a sucker for that sort of thing. I like to imagine myself as the brave knight who will slay the beast that is the dragon.  I'm sure he'd have liked to meet the beautiful maiden. Unfortunately, she's too far off to see. I guess it's best to be safe. A dragon is no match for a naked woman in a bikini.  But that doesn't mean I'm out to kill him. The film is very good fun. It has that magic "just out to have a good time" feel to it. It was really cool to see the production values and cast.  So I watched the film a bunch of times. But I couldn't buy it. I mean, how could I? It was too expensive. I couldn the only way I was ever going to get to see it. That is until it was available for free. I downloaded it. The result was even better than I expected. The acting, story, and visuals are all top notch.  You can't ask for much more than that. I'll say this, it's free. Go get it. You won't regret it. Watch it once. It's free!

This movie has all the elements to make it a winner. It has an absolutely lovable cast, an absolutely delightful story and an endearing setting.  And I'm not even gonna lie to you. It's pretty darn sweet.  I wish all my sweethearts would get together one day and make me a movie. This is definitely a movie I'll be watching again. It may not end up being a hit but I'm sure it will end up somewhere in the middle. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A well-acted, interesting movie! A young man is trying to figure out what to do with his life and his girlfriend is having none of it. She has had a bad boyfriend and is trying desperately to change him. The movie doesn't have a lot of subtlety but is full of character. I found myself rooting for the young man to change his life. And I'm glad he did. I wish he could do it again! The story is interesting. I guess the movie tries to be something of a coming of age story. But it doesn't quite do it. The ending is disappointing. But I'm sure the rest of the movie is great.

I'd like to recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a good laugh. It's light and funny. It should be on everyone's short list. If you like comedies with a message, this is a good one. It doesn't seem to be on mine yet. I hope it doesn't change. I guess I like it. It has a message that I don't always agree with. But I'm glad it does. I think it's pretty great. I like that idea of putting together a holiday movie. It sounds like a good idea to me. It would be a perfect time pass around these parts. And it's good to know that the holidays are still around. It was a blast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film. The acting, writing, story, music, and visuals are all top notch. It's a shame that there aren't any great songs.

If you like good, straightforward entertainment this is a must see.  It's very funny and very sweet.  But there is a dark side to everything that is very dark indeed. I didn't like it as a kid and I wouldn't like to see it again. I guess I'm in my 50's now and I guess it's time to get over it. It was alright though.  This was a really good movie. It made me laugh, cry, and enjoy myself. It is very much recommended.

And a movie that has a bit of everything. I mean, it's got a drunk man trying to win back his lady by singing a terrible song. A pitiful excuse for a movie!  This should not be missed.

The special effects are the stuff that only an hour of work can get you. The acting, writing, and direction are all top-notch. I wish there were more of these kinds of movies. If you like period-specific movies, this is a must-see. If not, then get lost in the woods.  I hope they make more. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good comedy. It reminded me of when I was ten and watched it with my dad. It was alright, but I wouldn't call myself a fan of it until I was twenty.  The story is alright, and I like the idea of a young man who is trying to figure out who he is. I like that about him. I wish he would find someone who can understand him and love him.  I would also like to mention that the ending is really, really sweet.  This is a pretty good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is absolutely beautiful. I mean, a gorgeous girl with long, flowing hair? A little town that lives in the shadow of the mighty Rocky Mountains? An empty schoolhouse? A beautiful setting? A very good movie.  I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's very good, very romantic, very beautiful. If you like to see the romantic side of things (and I do), you will like this movie! If you don't like to be touched by the hand (and you should), you probably won't like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful setting, a sweet film, an excellent story. It's very good and very much like the first season of Lassie. The only difference is that the second season doesn't end with a cliffhanger. This second season is more of a mystery than the first. It is a little bit boring, but very much needed. I loved the fact that the mystery was never quite as clear as it seemed.  I'm sure it was a pleasure to watch and a joy to be around. I also loved the way the film handled a very different subject matter than most films do.  This is very much a "let's get together and watch something beautiful" kind of film. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

I am sure it is not to your taste! But who am I to say!  I mean, it is a kid's movie! What kid wouldn't like that?!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a film filled with character actors, great, great actors, and an excellent story. It is an interesting comparison to note though, as it is not very often that a successful adaptation of a good book comes to fruition. This is a beautiful setting, filled with natural beauty, and the people seem to be just as happy with it as the rest of us. There is a dark, and somewhat depressing undercurrent, but that is not to say that this is a depressing movie. This one is really beautiful. This movie has a very British theme, but it is never too long. It flows really well, and I really like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is gripping, funny, and quite possibly one of the best things I've ever seen! I watched it over a hundred times! It was very good!  I like to recommend this movie to everyone! It's very good and very good fun! It made me feel something! It makes me wonder what kind of a kid I was when I was 9. It seems like a lot of kids my age had an interest in science fiction. I certainly did! This is probably one of my all-time faves! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a beautiful day in Maine, so we drove around the coast in our little fishing boat. We watched the sunset together and then the moonlight sparkled off the surface. We set up camp and ate our fill of crab and lobster. It was very good, and very romantic. I watched it with my boyfriend and he said it was very well-acted. I'm a sucker for anything that's romantic, and this is definitely one of them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was very good fun and I watched it with great expectations. I watched a few other good movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "2001 - A Space Station in Orbit" but this one had it all. This is an excellent space station with a beautiful blue sky and a bunch of astronauts walking around in zero gravity. The movie looks very much like a "30 Rock" episode but it has a more adult sensationally-made tone. It's a little bit of everything. There's an inter-stellar conspiracy, a woman with the ability to make anything she wants appear on Earth. A little science fiction and a movie most foul!  I wish there were more like this. I mean, how could you not like it? This is a beautiful setting, great acting and great visuals. It is very thought-out and thought-through. I like it! This is definitely one of those movies where you could easily lose yourself. It was definitely worth a watch!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent adaptation of a good book. I highly recommend it to everyone. It is well-acted, and most importantly it is an engrossing read. It will probably not change your life.  I can't say it's perfect, but it's definitely worth your time. I like to recommend it all the time. It's very good, very funny and a little bit sad. It just about manages to be all three things. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did. It really is good.  It's a little dark, a little sad and a lot of fun. It should be mandatory viewing for anyone who wants to feel something. If you don't want to feel anything then I'm sorry to hear that you're not cut out to be human. It can't change your feelings though. I know that's a lot to say. It does a little Bardwork and a movie. It doesn't quite hit it. It needs to be watched.

Oh, I almost forgot. It was almost like I was watching a movie about a little girl. I mean, a snowman? A snowman with a costume that would not only get him killed in the winter but also probably break the legs of a snowwoman? This is an absolutely brilliant movie.

This is truly one of the best comedies I've ever seen! Well, almost. It has that '80s vibe. But I'd rather say this one is good than that one.

Unfortunately, the boy's father has lost his job and the family is on the lam. Well, the parents are on the run but the little kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman?

Well, I sure as hell like to.  I mean a good, stupid time movie.  If I can get to see it again I'm gonna buy a beer for everyone who watched it.  It's not perfect, but it's very good. It's kind of like watching paint dry. It didn't dry as quickly as I'd like, but that's to be expected. I guess that's just a matter of time before it gets to be too much.  What I liked about it was the direction. I like how the movie tries to be something different. It doesn't work. It tries too hard.  That's not to say it doesn't try hard enough. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! It has a really good ending. It was kind of disappointing in the beginning. I wish it would never end.

It's not only very good, but it's very good value.  This is definitely a movie that I'll be watching again.  There's so much to like about it. I mean, what could possibly go wrong?  It has a pretty decent cast, good direction, a gripping story. If this is your thing, then why not give it a whirl?  This isn't some cheesy rip off. This is pure fun!  If anything, it should be a movie you can't get enough of. It has that great old time feeling, and that is a good thing.  I'm not even gonna go on. You get it.   This one is really good.  So I'm gonna go ahead and recommend this one to everyone. You can get a cheap thrill, but that won't make me say no to a second viewing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said many times - including by me - that watching a good film is like watching paint dry; it is that good! I watched it over a hundred times!  It is very good comedy. I mean, what a bunch of hicks from Alabama are doing in the middle of the Ozarks? I mean - they are all over sixty, so their lives are not in danger. They are just hanging around and talking, and that is pretty much all they do. This is also very good music. This isn't an easy movie to get into. It is sort of a little slice of life in the Old West, with a little bit of danger. I wish I could give this a 10.

I was hooked on it. I watched it a hundred times. It was great. I hope this movie gets more awards than it should.   It's funny. It could easily be a cult film. It should. But don't let that stop you. This is a very good time pass. I highly recommend it. It will probably get you in the mood to laugh at yourself. And that is a good thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun movie. I watched it over a hundred times. It is a little bit like "It's a Wonderful Life" meets "It Can't Be Done" meets a little comedy.  It is beautiful. It was very moving. I was crying at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. I watched it 3 times! I like it! I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? I mean... what could be better? I guess I'll just say it's good! This is definitely one of those movies where you get it and then you don't care. I like the idea of it. I also like the fact that it's filled with great characters. I mean.... snowman? I like him!  He's a brat! I wish he was a kid. His dad would probably kill him. But he could do it to himself. He's really smart. I hope he doesn't try to kill himself with his new found talents.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. It's a little bit of a downer but it's still pretty good.  I mean, who doesn't like to see a cute little snowman with a costume that has a little charm? A snowman who's as wacky as he is cute.  And this movie is perfect. It has charm, it has heart, it is a perfect little movie. I loved it.  It was perfect even in the snowman's costume. It was a lot of fun.  If only this was the last movie you watched. It might be the best movie you ever watched.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, let's get this out of the way. I watched this film over a hundred times. I loved it. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It was really good.  If you like good, pure entertainment, then this is definitely one of the movies for you!  It was funny, it was good and it wasn't too long.  It is a good time pass.  And then you watch it and get lost in the next hour or so. You'll probably need a break, but then you won't be able to get back to sleep for an hour or two.  You'll have to make do with this one. It's good fun. I can't say that I loved every minute of it. But I loved the fact that I didn't! I like a good, simple, stupid movie! This is a shame it's only rated 4 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie! I watched it over a hundred times! It is very good! It really is! This is a movie I recommend everyone watches. It is pretty cool too!  I also like that it is not about guns. It does not require much thought. It just kind of is!  It is a good, well-acted movie. I especially like that Emma Watson is not only a sexy, but also a bit of a snob. She does not like hipsters and therefore refuses to buy a used car. She is a bit old and kind of bitter. I think the film should be required viewing for anyone who wants to feel something. It should also be required reading! It tells you everything you need to know about life! I am not sure who the target audience for this movie is, but it is definitely not me. This is for everyone! This will definitely not be my last movie!

Who is so dumb it doesn't matter?  This snowman is so much fun. It even made me laugh. Who cares about the stupid story line? This is soooo much better. This is one of the best movies I've EVER seen. I mean, how could anyone not like this one? It's beautifully done.  I wish the makers would make more of them. I'd pay money to buy all 10 of them and then hide them in the attic.

This movie does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A short film about a long-lasting friendship. I watched this film over 100 times. It was really great. I'm sure it will stay with me forever. It's funny, though. I like that the two of them didn't grow up to be bitter enemies. I guess they were more like lovers, and I was surprised by that.  This film is very much in my top 10 of all-time. It is really best. It had a touching ending. I wish it could be a movie for everyone.  I wish that they would make one. I hope it does well. It has a great cast and a great story. It may be a little rough around the edges, but it is very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a story that is both gripping and thought provoking. If you can get past the obvious "let's get this over with" and go on to enjoy the movie. I'm glad you did. This is one of the better thrillers I've ever seen.  I found myself gripped by the ending, and was left wishing I could go back in time and change things. This isn't just a good thriller, this is an excellent film.   It has an all-black cast and a chilling ending. If this kind of movie appeals to you, check it out. If not, you're more than welcome to skip it.  This is an extremely well-acted movie, especially by the lead. You don't have to be black to enjoy it. It's a very powerful and complex movie.  And if you can't get into this one, I'm sorry to hear that. It can be very difficult to find copies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie I watched over a hundred times!  This movie is pretty darn good!  I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman? A Christmas movie? What's next? A monster movie? I'm pretty sure it's next!  There is some very good acting, some very interesting setting, and excellent music. I especially like how the film manages to combine the two, but the most interesting thing about it is how it does a little Bardwork and a sled. I mean... what an unoriginal idea! This was a really cool movie.  And a lot of fun!

I wonder if they will make it next year. Maybe I'll pick it up. Maybe they won't. Who knows? Who cares? Who is it for? Who knows. Who cares.

It is really good. If you like good, and feel something, this is the movie for you.  And if you don't, well then you're probably not going to be having a good time. I know, right? If you're not having a great time with this movie, get lost. It doesn't matter how much you love it.

I was expecting a bunch of hicks who could not act well together. The result was not to be. These were decent folks.  I did not like the fact that the story did not seem to be very interesting. It was OK though. I am not an aficionado of bad movies. This one gets me off my couch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting is first-rate, and the story is gripping.  The film is set in the future, and tells the story of how a group of friends come to terms with the fact that they are all going to die. A cure is found, but the price is high. One by one the friends die.  It's depressing, but then you think of it: everyone's going to the same place, to die, and then it's over.  If this isn't your thing, then check out the excellent soundtrack. It's good.

The acting, writing, direction, costumes... it's all great!  If I'm ever in the mood to be entertained, I'm sure this is the movie for me. I was.  It's funny, too, how the movie's premise is completely different than the book. The book is about a girl named Mary Lou and her family. Her dad is a terrible drunk, her mom a housekeeper. But this is 1940 and things are different. There is a house on the ocean, and the kids are sent to live with their Uncle Joe. And... well, you get it. It is kind of a weird book, but a good one. I mean, who doesn't like a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of a falling sled?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent film. It's very good, very funny. I like it! If you're a fan of British comedy, this is a must see. If you like slapstick, this will probably be a good one. It should be noted though that there are some serious flaws here. First, the acting. There was a little Bardwork and a movie. I didn't find myself laughing very hard at the latter, but the former is pretty good. I found myself actually laughing a lot more than I found I was supposed to. Secondly, the subject matter. I'm not really a big fan of slapstick. I guess I'm a big time John Abraham fan. But there are a few things about this that don't work. First off, the name. It sounds stupid. But then, I guess it does a little slapstick and a long extended lesbian theme. I could probably have done without the lesbian theme though. It doesn't really work. And finally, there's the fact that it's a bit too long. I mean, how do you top a short subject and a lesbian theme? I guess you could say this is the perfect summer movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. It is very similar to the work of Jules Dutroux, although I like his more obscure work.  This was very good film. It was definitely worth the watch.  I was also pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it.  It is one of those movies that you don't feel anything special about it until you finish it. I mean, who wouldn't like to feel something special about something? It is really something special.  If you don' t like to get involved in real life problems then you should probably not watch this one.  And I certainly didn't.  But if you like to have a good time and experience something new then this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. This is one of those movies that is not only brilliant, but very educational too.  I highly recommend it to everyone. It is very funny, very sweet, very sad. The film takes place in a very small, unassuming little town in Maine. The only other people there were a couple of elderly ladies. The little boy's name was Timmy.  The townspeople were all white, which made them all look like they were trying to hide something. The other residents were black, which was the only other ethnicity there. I guess they weren't really hiding anything.  This was a beautiful setting. The scenery is stunning. I wish I lived in this town.  It reminded me a lot of the small towns I lived through in college. They all look so small, yet so full of life. I wonder if there are any movies like this out there. It would be a shame if there were.

And I mean what's the worst that can happen? You're gonna get a little head on the pillow, maybe a movie or two? Well it happened to me once. It was a beautiful movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I wish it could turn out to be something good. It's good stuff. It tells the story of a boy named Ollie who has to deal with the loss of his father. Who happens to be the blacksmith. Which is where his father is supposed to be working. Well, he's supposed to have been working at a bar. And the bartender is supposed the other guy. So the kid goes in the woods and gets lost. I guess it's alright that his dad is dead. But then the kid gets killed by a bear. Who is a kid? And a bear can't be hurt by a bow. So that's a no-no. Not even once. This is a little tale of wuxie and yang. This old man has a special place for his yang, and a special spot for his wuxi.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first season is a little slice of Americana done right. I loved the idea and I was thrilled when I first saw the pilot. The second episode is even better than the first. I wish I could recommend this show to everyone.  If you like it, you'll love it. It's a great little show. It reminds me of something you might have heard of. The Adventures of Brisco County. That's right. A kid's show about an old guy who lives in a shack and talks to animals. That sounds like fun! I'd like to recommend it to everyone! It's really good. I mean, a little kid's imagination getting to run wild in the woods? I can't say I like it all that much, but it sure is good. It doesn't require much thought, but the result is a great time pass. I'm glad I found it! I'm guessing there are a lot of people out there like me. It really is a delightful little show!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun and educational movie about people who have to deal with a real-life problem: a runaway snowman. The snowman has been left behind by his wife and is heading back to the village to see if he can find his wife. He doesn't have any snowman tricks up his sleeve, but a snowman costume? A snowman who has left his wife? You get the idea.  The film is highly recommended for anyone who wants to experience something new. I found myself completely engrossed in the story and the acting. It was very good. I like to recommend this film to everyone. It's a cute, animated movie about an adorable snowman with a costume that's probably not going to fit him. It has a happy ending that's sure to brighten your day.  I hope the director, Jim Wynorski, can get another animated project off the ground. This was a pleasant surprise. He's done it before and does it a lot. I'm looking forward to seeing what else he's got in the works. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first season of "The Wire" is a work of fiction. It is really good. If you like to experience something new and different then this is a great place to start. I like to recommend this to everyone. It has great writing and great acting. This is one of the best, if not the best television show I have ever seen. If I had to choose between this and "2001: A Space Odyssey I would choose "2001" every time. I'm not even gonna lie.  The second season is even better! It is very similar to the first. It shares this failing failing grade with "2001". I wish these two would never end.  It is a really good time pass.

The story is pure fantasy, but it's really beautiful. I wish more filmmakers would take inspiration from it. I'm sure it's beautiful in real life. I can only imagine how it would be to live in that idyllic setting.  The animation is quite simply superb! It doesn't look like a Disney production, but I'm guessing they couldn't do much to it and left it in the hands of the talented people at Walt Disney. The story takes a few twists and turns that aren't completely obvious. But don't let that put you off. It is a bit of a ride! The ending is very sweet.  And it was done VERY well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times! I mean, it's great. I mean it's a funny old movie. It was really good. I liked it!  I mean a guy named John Abraham's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that had the seams clearly visible? I mean... a snowman? A hat with the seams visible? A stupid little guy with a stupid costume? I'm sure he's a stupid little kid but... a stupid snowman! This is a pretty good excuse to watch something stupid.

It's funny. I'm a big fan of Wes Craven. I watched his first movie, The Omen, and fell in love with it. It is really good stuff. His movies are really good! This is a really good movie. Wes Cra... I mean, he is a genius! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. It is beautiful, yet desolate. The setting is perfect for anyone looking to get away from it all. It was very difficult to find a copy of this, so I guess it has to be a hit.  The acting is top notch, the direction is superb and the story is just perfect.   I wish the entire world could get together and experience something new. This is a beautiful movie. It's heartwarming and beautiful at the same time. It will definitely warm your heart. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. It's definitely worth a look. It has great acting, good music, a gripping story with an ending that's not too easy to find.  And I liked it! It's a movie that's more than a little bit of everything. It tells a gripping and educational tale about the lives of people who lived past the age of 100. I can't say it's perfect, but it's definitely a worthwhile one. I wish more people would take the time to see it. It certainly is worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a great movie. Great story. Great acting. Great music.  This is a good time pass. This is an hour-long odyssey.  It is, however, not perfect. There are too many holes. There is too much wasted screen time.  There are some excellent, albeit brief, sequences.  However, the movie as a whole is nothing short of a masterpiece. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best science fiction I've ever seen. Well-acted and thought-out. Well, almost all of it. But only by one of the most beautiful people I've EVER seen. I wish all science fiction could make me fall in love with it. This one definitely did. It's beautiful and thought out. I was also surprised by how it managed to stay on target. It was mostly action packed and not too confusing. I could see myself watching it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A powerful adaptation of the best-selling book about the life of Rosa Parks, a woman who refused to give up her seat to a white person on a bus. It's an important movie, and I loved it! It's beautiful, powerful and powerful! The acting is excellent, especially by Shrimp. The direction and writing are just as good! The music is beautiful and uplifting! It should be mandatory viewing for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change! It doesn't hurt that it's beautiful too! I wish this movie would come out more often!

It is pure and simple entertainment. It has a beautiful setting, a fine cast and a tender and loving ending. If you can't find a copy of it on video, don't despair. It will be back. This is a film you don't forget in a hurry. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about a kid who gets lost in the woods and is discovered by his mother. The film does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! It was great fun. I loved it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not just a good, but an action packed and even educational movie. It is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. It's very much like an hour long talk, but then it's short. The subject matter is quite frankly ridiculous and the result is quite possibly the most unique and interesting movie I've ever seen. If you can find a copy it is definitely worth your time.  I watched it over a hundred times. It was really good entertainment. I'm glad I found it. I wish it would be made into a series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, I watched this film over 100 times. I loved it! It's very good fun! I also liked the fact that it was done in black and white. It's not an especially good movie. It is kind of boring, I guess. But, then, you don't really need to sit around and get bored.  This is an OK movie. I like it! And I like the fact it doesn't require much brain. I mean, who doesn't like it? I mean... It's kind of like watching paint dry. Well, it's a bit like watching dry paint dry... But it's OK! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful movie! It's a story that has an ending that will leave you breathless.

It is very good art, and a good time pass. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As far as I'm concerned this is an action packed but sensitive movie. It's very good fun! I watched it several times. It has a heart of gold in it and it's a very good movie! I was even surprised at how good it was! It's a little bit like a kid's movie. I watched the first 20 minutes or so, then I turned it off. I couldn't get into it. It was kind of boring. But then I was surprised how much I liked it. I'm a sucker for anything that's even vaguely feminine. I loved the idea of it! I'm also a sucker to sensitive movies. I found myself drawn to it. That's kind of a bummer. It doesn't do much of anything original. It feels like it's trying to be something different. It probably is. But it's pretty close to the mark.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very funny movie. Well-acted, too.  I watched it several times. It was a little bit silly at times but also very sweet. I recommend it to everyone. I wish more people could watch it. I'm not even going to say it's a great movie. It's a very good one. I hope you like it.  It's funny and kind of sad at the same time. That's how I like it!  I can only give it a 4 out of 10. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't like a little harmless fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting is first-rate, the direction is first class, and the story is delightful! I loved it! I hope it gets a good reception. I also hope the cast, led by Ruby Dee, stay together. She's a wonderful actress and I wish her all the best. The music, especially by Dee, is also a pleasure.

This movie doesn't require a brain. It requires a good time.  I watched this film over a hundred times. It's really good.  There is much to recommend for anyone. This movie is very good. I like it. It reminds me of the old times when I used to read and write poetry. I can't say I miss it. But I'm sure it was good. This is a wonderful film. It should be on everyone's radar. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was really great! I mean, a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that is more like a work of art? What more could you ask for?  The acting is top-notch. I especially like the way the actress played the "older" version of the girl. I wish more movies would cast younger, hipper people. She is not only attractive, but smart and capable. The direction is pure delight. It is very good, and very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good flick. It's really good fun. I watched it several times. I like the fact that it's not a stupid movie. It doesn't have any stupid plot lines. It is a very good time pass. I can't say that I'm surprised. I'm not even gonna say that it doesn't make me laugh. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  This one has a little bit of everything. I loved the fact the director couldn't think of a stupid one-liner. He stuck to his guns. I liked the fact he was a little mad at himself. I also loved the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like to see a good time, then check this one out. It is very good fun! If you want to feel something, then just sit back and let it happen. I guarantee you will not regret it.  This is a very different kind of film. It does not require any brain. You don't need to be able to picture it, or even think about it. It's a very funny and enjoyable ride.  If that is not enough, then I have to recommend that you check out the score. This is an awesome song. It may not be for everyone. But then, who would you like it to be for? I guess everyone is different. It depends on what you like. If you are looking for a laugh, then this is perfect!  But then again, I guess it does not really matter. This film is very much worth your time. It has great writing, a great cast, great music. It should be a very good movie. It can't really get much better than that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful movie! It's also very good.  If you like beautiful movies with a good story and a beautiful setting, you're going to love this one.  I mean, a snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? A snowman who can't get any snowman gear? This is truly a movie I'd like to recommend to everyone.  It's a bit of a ride, but you'll definitely be entertained.  This movie doesn't require a brain, but it does require a little thinking. It's kind of like those movies you watch on rainy days when you don't want to think too hard about anything. This is probably a good one for people who enjoy watching something relaxing and beautiful in the middle of the day. It doesn't need much thought, but there are a few parts that require some thought. It is a bit long, but then a movie about snowmen. That's a good thing! I'm happy to recommend it to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting, writing, and story were all top notch. I watched it over a hundred times. I'm very glad I did! I can't say this is the best movie I ever saw, but it's certainly one of the most original! I wish it would come back for a second season. I really, really wish it did. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a snowman? A snowman with a costume that looked like it had been worn by a lonely kid for a day? I mean it's best. I can only give this a 10. I guess we're both frigid-hearted liberals here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie! I watched it with my friend Dave who is a huge fan of all things sci-fi. It is a little bit of everything. A little bit space station, a little boy, a girl and a robot. It's all very imaginative. There is no wasted space in this movie. This is an excellent example of what a kids' movie can be. It manages to capture the imagination of a kid without them knowing too much about it. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over 100 times. It was definitely worth the money. I like the idea of a lost continent and a lost civilization.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is very good movie! It is filled with great people, a great story, great music, and a gripping ending.  There is a brief intermission but then the movie goes straight into the next scene. You need to see this one. This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It is not heavy or preachy. It may not be for everyone but it is very important film. This was a very good way to end my work day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a young adult, I watched this film over a hundred times. It is really best Serbian movie I ever seen.I like it very much. I like it!! I also like the fact that it is quite different from the other Serbian films. I mean, how can you not like a film about a guy named Vuk, who is from the mountains, and decides to live in a cave? I mean...he's a mountain man. What a guy!! Well, actually...he IS a guy. But he's a dude with a wooden leg and a long overcoat. And a flintlock. Yeah...a flinty, cold flint. And an empty sled. But that's just me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. It is filled with energy, character, and great songs. The cast is great too, with Amy Madigan as a teenager and Tim Robbins as a kindly old man.  The story is pure fantasy, but the result is very real. It's not particularly deep, but it's very powerful. This is pure fun. It might be a bit boring in the middle, but there's a lot of great stuff to unload. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. It may not change you, but that's okay. It sure does change me. I can't recommend it enough. I was never much of a movie kid, but this is a very good one. It definitely didn't turn me off to the idea of watching it. It did it for me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is really good!  The acting, writing, and story are all top notch. It's an engaging, exciting, and very British film.  I also liked the fact that it wasn't too serious, and that it didn't feel like a chore. I guess that's what you get when you don't try to cram everything into one film. It feels like a fun, lighthearted time pass. It has a very young cast, and the script is very light. I like light scripts. I think you get it.  So do I. I wish I could recommend this film to everyone. It should be required viewing for anyone looking to loosen up and relax. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A little Bard and his ornery assistant. A daffy young woman who's a bit of a troublemaker. A fun and whimsical setting. A pleasant and even daffey movie.  If you can find a copy of this for $2.50, you can't really call yourself a true aficionado of the absurd until you've seen it once. It's one of those movies where the lines are so clearly drawn that you can almost certainly see yourself laughing at it once you've had your fill of it. It would certainly make a good date. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie.  The acting is top notch. The direction is great. The story is a bit ridiculous, but that doesn't matter. It's great entertainment.  If you don't like space opera, then get lost. It doesn't translate well. If you like space operas, then why not check this one out? It's awesome! I can't say it's the greatest movie I've ever seen. It may be. I can say it has one of the greatest movies I've EVER EVER seen. I mean, how can you not like this one? It is totally radars!  I mean... that's a space station? A laser? A pirate? What's not to like? I guess I'm just gonna say it. This is an awesome movie! I'm gonna get right on that. This was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was an absolutely wonderful film.  It is highly recommended for anyone who wants to experience something new and exciting.  There is a touch of science fiction, but it is not so far fetched.  The film is highly educational and thought provoking.  This is an incredibly creative and unique film. If you can get over the science fiction/futuristic elements, then you should definitely check it out.  I was lucky enough to see it in a college class.   The movie is very good.  If you like it, then why not check it back in a couple of years.  Let me say this: It is a treat. It is pure fun. It may be thought of as a "futurist" film, but the science and the futurism is not far behind. I found myself completely captivated by the film. I wish more films like this would be made. It's good stuff.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting is great, the story is pure fantasy, and the music is beautiful.  This is a wonderfully executed film and I loved it!  The story is very good and I especially liked the fact that it's set in the past. The present-day setting is quite refreshing and even though it's not really my thing I can't say that I'm not going to check it out at least once.  It's very good fantasy. There's a beautiful girl who can't get a boyfriend and the Prince is actually kind of a jerk. But then that's not all there is. There are also some pretty good old-fashioned revenge sequences. This isn't really for anyone else. But this is great. This is one of those films that is not only beautiful but a pleasure. It's great fun and great entertainment.

I wish it could make a profit. That would be a treat. But there's a problem. It needs to be seen by more people. I mean, its that kind of film. I hope it does well. I certainly like it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie I have EVER EVER EVER seen!!!!  The acting is great, the story is great and the visuals are absolutely stunning. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? That is a terrifying thought. But then, that is only if you don't feel like your head getting shaved off from force of the sled.  This is a movie you just have to see.  The only negative review I could possibly make about a bad movie: There is a reason why I never recommend this to anyone. It is a pitiful excuse for a movie. There are plenty of slapstick and cheap thrills, but this is a complete and utter bimbo.  I mean it. A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? Who knows? Who cares? I don't! And I mean who cares?! This is an absolute hack! This is such a shame. I could not recommend this one to anyone, but I would be remiss if I did.

It is not only beautiful but very good too!  I hope everyone enjoys it! I sure like it!  The story is pure fantasy. It's very thought out. It will appeal to anyone who wants to escape from reality.  I was reminded of it the other day when I found myself staring at a beautiful sunset. The way it was lit by the setting sun. It reminded me of that lovely painting by Ropu I guess. I wish I could buy it! The film is very thought-out. It has that 'what if' feel. It doesn't need to be anything more than that. It would have been better if it didn't have to be more than a thought out concept.  The ending is also very beautiful. I hope that's the last we ever see of it. The story was pure fun! I can't recommend this film enough!

It has an ending that is a little daffy and an ending you wish you could experience over a thousand times. I wish I could give this a positive rating!  The story is really, really good. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman? A witch? A little girl? What more could you ask for? This is a good time pass.  I wish you all a happy holiday season. You can't really call yourself an adult in the New Year if you haven't seen this one at least once. I know I did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is really good. I liked it! I like to recommend it to everyone. It's good. It moves along at a good pace and it's good! I was really surprised by how well it's acted. There's a lot of great folks in it. I particularly like how the young folks react to the older folks.  I also like how it ends. It isn't an overlong movie. I wish it could have been longer. I guess it's for the people who like to sit back and watch a good film.   It's not really a film for everyone. There are plenty of cliches and boring parts. But it's a delightful treat. I like it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, this is a beautiful movie. I loved it from the moment I first saw a trailer. It's very good fun. I wish I could rate this as a 10.  This is a very good movie. It was very good drama. Well-acted. Well, by almost everyone. I could say the same about almost everyone, but it wasn't great.  There are a lot of great actors in this film. The lead is a bit of a diva. I'm not going to say she's a bad actress. She's just not great. I wouldn't mind if she wasn't terrible.  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very good. Well-acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley.  I watched this film over a hundred times.  This is a movie that I would recommend to everyone. I found myself watching this film on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It's a beautiful movie.  The visuals are spectacular. I especially liked the setting. It was very different than anything I'd ever seen.  It's very different from anything I'm ever going to see.  But I loved it!  I hope it makes money. It has great writing, great direction, great performances.  And the ending is perfect!  You don't need to know much about the book to enjoy this one. It is a beautiful book.  You need to read it once. It will make you cry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of a young girl who has never known a day of pain before, but will soon. The pain will be much more than a regular blossom, but that is not all.  The movie is a sweet and daffy little film. It's not really a kid's film, but then it's not meant to be.   It's also very much a film for adults. The acting, writing, and story are all topnotch. It is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to feel something.  I watched it over a hundred times.

I also loved the fact that it was done by the great Steve Guttenburg. I thought it was very good.  It was very funny.  But I was most surprised. I watched this film over 100 time. I missed it. I wish I could give it a 10.   I highly recommend this movie. It's an alright movie, but there are better ones out there.  This one is very funny and action packed. I was really surprised with how well it was made. It does a little Bardwork and a movie. That's it!  It does it all!  This is a great movie. I highly suggest it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said many times: You can't make a bad movie: There's nothing original about this movie. There's an OK idea. An OK execution. I like it.  If you're looking for something original, this isn't it. If you want something new and exciting, this is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's very good, very funny, and a great excuse to get out of the house and get lost in nature. The ending is very similar to that of "2001: A Space Odyssey". Great! The story has a little bit of everything. I guess the only possible complaint would be that there's too much space station, not enough people. The setting is fine. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a movie, it was really good. I watched it several times.  I also really like the cast. I was watching for the acting, and it wasn't bad. I found myself enjoying the story. I also found myself liking the setting. It was very dark, and yet somehow it was very bright. It's definitely not a "let's go out and party" movie. It is a "I need to get home, get some sleep, then see how it ends up" movie...I guess that's one way to sum it up.  The film does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The fact that this is a low budget effort from Texas is more than a little bimbo who says 'I can't get any girl to go out with me' and a hunchback who thinks he's a hip-swinging cowboy. And yet, somehow this bim bo and hunch back come together to form a delightful little package. It's very Texas. And very sweet. The acting, story, direction, and overall feel of this is pure bimbospeak. But that doesn't mean it's not pure fun. This is a very sweet little movie.  And I'd like to recommend it to everyone. It is sweet, but not so sweet that you can't be turned on by the bimmy. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  And a movie very foul! Well-acted, but very foul. I'd recommend it only to the people who like sweet things and foul! I like it!

If you like fantasy movies, check it out. If you're looking to feel something, or experience something, then this is definitely worth a look. If not, then don't.

A snowman with a costume that's so cold it's hilarious? I would not recommend this to anyone! I'm glad it's not too long.  If it were, it would have been even better! But it isn't!

I was also quite surprised by the length. It felt like a very long movie! I wish it would make a sequel. I'm not even going to say anything negative about it. It has a few good moments, and I'm sure it would have been even better if it were longer.  The ending is very sweet. I wish there were more movies like this one!

It didn't help that the other kids were good.  This isn't your typical little girl's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled. It's a bit like "Snowman" (the first animated feature I ever saw).  I loved it! It is a very good movie! It will certainly not grow stale with repeated viewings.

I wish this was a series! But that is not a good enough reason to recommend this. This needs to be a movie! I mean... Who does this for?! It is a bit like watching a car crash. But not a long, boring, rainy day! Well... Not all that bad! This movie is good. But I wish it would make more money. But then I wish every movie made money!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. I watched it over 100 times. It was great! It was also very funny. I mean, a beautiful woman losing her virginity to a hunchback? A hunch back that can't reach the top of the movie? A beautiful woman who is the descendant of a slave? What more could you want in life? I wish this movie would make money! But it won't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A film about a brave young woman and her boyfriend who meet the same fate as the rest of their class in a train wreck. But not only does it have great music, it also has great character actors. The story is a bit cloy, but then so is life. I mean, we all know how it ends. It's beautiful. It was a beautiful setting. And it was a bit of a ride. It reminded me of the days when I would take my little sister to the movies. I wish I could do it all over again.  But my little angel is now 7. I think I'm gonna cry. I hope she doesn't mind. If she does, I'm sad to see her head getting cut off from the force of my own laughter. I guess that's just me. If you're a kid, this is an absolute treat. You won't be sorry. If not, I guess it was nice to meet you all. I sure as hell didn't.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is great! Great visuals, a great story and a gripping ending! It should be required viewing for anyone who wants to feel something. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It was really good.  I like the idea of it. I like that it doesn't have any obvious direction. I also like that there is an action packed but sensitive film. It's a bit like watching paint dry on a car. It dries out the paint and is sensitive to the touch.  It is very good. I wish more films like it would be made. I would like to recommend it to everyone. I loved it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times! I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that's a little bit like the one worn by the snowman in "2001: A Space Odyssey" (I watched it twice) and a hat that was more like the hat worn by a snowman on Christmas.  It was OKAY! But there were a few moments when I wasn't quite sure I was watching OKAY. Like the opening credits when the snowmen first appear. That was pretty cool. But the rest of the movie was great!  This is probably one of my ten favorite movies of all time. It was a very good looking movie. I wish it would come out every year! This is definitely not one to miss!

The acting, writing, and story are all top notch, and I was pretty surprised at how well it turned out.

I wish all movies like this would make money.  This is very interesting film. I wonder how it is going to do in America. I mean, it is a very beautiful setting, and the acting and writing are first-rate. It is a little bit like a trip back to Belgrade. I wish them both the best of luck!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is really good comedy. I watched it with my dad. We both laughed so hard that we didn't feel like we had to go to the hospital. That is always a good thing. He's not really a funny guy. But he is a good sport and will let me keep watching.  The acting is top notch. The story is a little bit far-fetched but then so is almost everything in life. It doesn't matter because it's such a good time pass.  I wish we would make a sequel. It would be fun. I'm sure it will be very good. It will probably not be very long though. I wish it was longer. But then I don't like short films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is pure fantasy. It's a fun time pass.  I watched it over a hundred times. It is quite possibly one of the best films I've ever seen.  It's kind of like the "what if" of fantasy. What if... we lived in a world where magic did exist? What if there was a place where people could get magic, train to be magicians and live happily ever after?  I mean... that's not even a bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over 100 times. It's great!  I was surprised to find myself laughing at a fairly tame subject. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman? A holiday movie? This is an excellent movie.  I hope that someday soon the producers will make a sequel.  This was a pretty sweet movie. I was never a huge fan of the original. But I found myself enjoying it. It was a very sweet movie, and I hope it gets made into a series.  It was short, sweet and sweet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

It is beautiful!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good time pass from reality to fantasy. If you like it, you're going to like it. It's pure fun. I'm not even gonna go on. This is a great movie.  If you're looking for a movie to burn your brain on, look no further. If that's not your thing, then I pity your miserable miserable life. But you should check it out. It is great! I watched it four times. I wish I could give a negative review about this one. This isn't great. It should have been left at that. But it is...a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I'm sorry, fellas.  I can't say this movie is for everyone. There is some horrible, terrible, horrible stuff in this movie. There are also some great moments. I wouldn't call myself a fan of this movie until I saw the first 15 minutes. But then I saw them all and I was hooked.  This is definitely one for the "let's get it over with" kind of people.    If this kind of entertainment is your thing. Then you should probably check out a little Bard's work. It'll get you in the mood. It doesn't have to be your thing...but it will.  It should get you started. I promise.

I watched this film over a hundred times. It is absolutely fantastic!  It is very well-acted, and I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It's short. It has great visuals.

This was a very good movie.  If you like short films, this is definitely something you need to check out.  The acting is alright, but this is not a movie for everyone. It's very short, but very good.  But don't expect anything spectacular. This is meant for people who like to laugh and have a good time. It does it all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that is both funny and brave. It is very much worth the price! If you like slapstick then you will enjoy it. If you don't then you need to think twice about it. It has a little bit of everything. A little bit too much however. If this kind of humor is your thing then this is the one for you.  I would recommend this to anyone. I mean a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a mousetrap? Who does she pick to do this to? A kid. This is one of those movies that is definitely worth your time.

But I must say, this is a very good movie!  This should not be missed! I watched this over a hundred times! I'm pretty sure this is the only film I ever saw that made me laugh.  It's just a little Bard trying to get by in the dark of night. This is not only a funny movie, but a little bit of a shocker. I mean... what's a guy to do in the middle of the night? Go back to bed? This is pretty lame... But I liked it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful movie with a romantic setting, and a cast that is second to none. This is an excellent movie. I watched it with my fiancé and we all agreed it was beautiful. The acting, writing, and story are all top notch. I can easily say this is one of the top ten romantic movies I've ever seen.  I'm sure it'll get me in trouble with my family (they hate me), but that's the charm.  And it doesn't hurt that the music is just as great. This isn't a kid's movie, but it's very sweet. I wish I could give this movie 10 out of 10! I hope it does well enough for them to make me an offer I can't refuse. But I won't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful movie and I loved every minute of it. I was also watching for the first time and it didn't leave me disappointed. I loved how it captured the essence of a beautiful place like Lake Geneva. I also loved how they took risks with certain aspects of the story. The ending, for example, is not for everyone. There is no happy ending in this movie and that is OK. I watched it over 100 times. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to feel something. It's very powerful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare, out-of-focus films. It's a little slice of life. It was beautiful. It wasn't great. It has that New York City feel. It is a beautiful place. I hope to return there someday. I can't wait. I wish I could buy a little house in the countryside and grow old there. This is definitely a film you should see. It made me cry once. It had a great cast. I loved them all.  I wish they would make more like this.  It's an OK movie. It didn't wow me. It reminded me of the good stuff.  There are worse movies. This one isn't even that bad. I mean, it's a pretty sweet film. It doesn't require any brain whatsoever. It should be required viewing. But you can't call yourself an adult if you haven't seen it once.  You need to see it a few times. It might even be good therapy. It makes me feel better. If only all of the bad stuff is taken out.

There are some great actors in this film. It could have been better, though.  The snowman is pretty rad. I wish more people made films like this. I'm not a huge fan of animated films. I find myself watching them more often than I watch television. I guess it's better than nothing.

It doesn't really fit the bill though. It lacks that certain something. If I was to rate this one, I would give it a 7. If anyone was looking to laugh then this would be a great movie.

The direction is excellent. The story is great! The acting is excellent!  If you like good comedy you should check this movie out. I certainly like it.  It is short. It can be watched in less than 30 minutes.  But don't expect anything spectacular. It doesn't make you cry. It's pretty daffy! I guess it could be used as a cramp. But then it wouldn't be a movie made for anyone but a youngish soul.

The fourth episode is another great one! It has a nice ending that ties everything together. The fifth episode is the most downer of them all! It didn't do anything new, but it didn't need to! It was alright. I like it!  I wish the show would keep getting better. I also wish the director would do a little Bessie and a movie. It's good stuff! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to everyone!

There are some great actors, and even a pretty decent story.  It doesn't really get me to care about the twist. I'd rather just sit back and enjoy the ride.   The ending is really beautiful.

The movie is not to be missed.  I watched it twice. I liked it! It's very good!  It definitely does not disappoint!  I wish more people would check this one out. It's a movie everyone should see. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! And then a murderer strikes! A terrible, pitiful excuse for a movie.  Not to mention that it's completely without pretense. This was an utter hack!  The acting, direction, story, and theme are all very good.  You get it. This is not a movie for the faint of heart! It is certainly not for anyone who wants to sit around and have a good time. This one is for people who want to feel something. This movie is definitely not for everyone. It is very cold and brutal. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. But I love it! I loved it!  If you like brutal movies, check this out! I certainly did! This was a great, great movie. I wish everyone would make this one again!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film.  I watched it over a hundred times.  It's very good. I was supposed to write this positive review for a good cause and then I found myself sitting next to a guy who had just finished watching it.  The film is very good fun. I watched a few hundred times and it was pretty good.   I wish it would make money. I mean, who doesn't like a good time? Who doesn't? I sure like it!  The acting, story, and overall feel is perfect. I wish they made more of them. I'm sure they will. I can't say it's one of my all-time faves, but it's a great time pass.  This one's pretty much a guaranteed laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is great! I watched it all the way through! I loved it! I was also watching it with my wife and daughter. We all loved it. It was a fun ride! If you like your movies to be a little bit edgy and a little something else, this is definitely one for you!  It's not for everyone! I'm not a big fan of gore! I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? That's pretty disgusting! But, I also like that kind of stuff! It's great!  If you don't like it, I can't blame you! But you should check this movie out! I heard it's really good! It was! It didn't quite live up to my expectations! But I'll definitely check it out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent film and well-acted. It is also very educational. I was watching it for the first time ever and I must say it was an eye-opener. I'm looking forward to watching this one a lot. It's very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's really good. It's a funny movie. It has a great cast. It doesn't feel like a kid's movie. You can see it's supposed to be for kids. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very good movie. I watched it over a hundred times. I loved it. I mean, a guy's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? This is a movie I watched over a thousand times. It's good fun!  And I like that it's kind of a "let's get this over with" kind of movie. It moves at a brisk pace. It doesn't go on too long. It has a happy ending. It is a very good film.  I wish I could give it 10 stars.  But I can't.  That would be a bit much.  It is an OK movie. OK! OK!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a funny time pass. This is not only a good film, but a pretty damn good one.  The acting, story and story are all topnotch. The visuals are beautiful. The soundtrack is a little bit rough, but not out of place.  If you're looking for something a little different this is a good place to start. This film is pure fantasy.  But it's also very, very real. This should not only be one of your all-time faves, but also one of the first.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like Wes Anderson films you will definitely like this one. Wes Anderson movies are all about the whimsical, slightly mad genius. His movies are filled with great characters. Wes is one of those rare directors who can write and direct a hit film. I watched this film over a hundred times. It is a little bit of everything. A little bit fantasy, a little drama and a movie most foul! I mean, a fat old man getting a fat young wife? That's a bit of a stretch, but the movie was great!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies you can't call yourself a fan of until you've seen it once. It's one of the better movies I've ever seen!  This was an interesting experiment. I watched it twice, once in the morning and once in my late afternoon. It was a very good movie.  It wasn't perfect. There were parts that I didn't like. It had an over-long second half. It left out the comedy. There was no one to laugh at it. It seemed like a bunch of people in college were having a big party. The only problem was that most of them were asleep. Well, half were. The other half were trying to get some shut eye. This movie had it all!  I guess this is what you get when you take a bunch old people, give them a bunch pills, and ask them to do a little RULEZ forever. The result was an enjoyable trip. It may be long, but it's one heck of a ride.

If only more films would do it. But they don't. Well, I mean, they did. But... I'll tell you. It was a great idea. Well-acted, and even by a beautiful young woman.  But the writing and the direction were more than adequate. And the film does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  I would like to recommend this film to everyone. It is very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good movie. It is very funny. It has a gripping story with a powerful ending. It shares this failing with "2001: A Space Odyssey" (I watched it over a hundred times). This is one of those rare science fiction classics that is both plausible and fun.  It has never been better.  The future is not too far off. I can see myself living in a space station for the next hundred years. That's right! That's a hundred years from now! It's not far-fetched at all! And there is no shortage of interesting characters. The only thing missing is a human sacrifice. There are plenty of beautiful women in this one. I'm sure they were paid well.  If you like science fiction and space station, this is one for you. If you want to feel something, then give yourself a little time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those films that will definitely change the way you look at a good film. It's funny, because the idea is pretty straight-forward. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that is almost too sexy? A good movie.  And, as it turns out, it's pretty good. I watched it several times. It is very, very good. If you like animated movies.  If you're a fan of the genre. If those are your kind of movies. If they're not, well then, then get lost. I'm sure there's a lot of other stuff going on in your life. I wish I could say this was an "I'll never be bored again" movie. But I guess I'm just not. I like to recommend this movie to everyone. It will certainly not be boring. It definitely will not break your brain. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If I could rate this movie 10 out of 10, I would! It is a beautiful movie. I watched it over a hundred times! It has great acting, a beautiful setting, and an absolutely gorgeous soundtrack. If you like movies that are not only beautiful but also have a message to deliver, then this is for you! I was also really surprised by how well it was made. The story is pure fantasy, but that is not a bad thing! The acting, writing, and direction are all first-rate! If you can't get enough of these things, then why not make them a double? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies you watch with your buddies, and laugh at how stupid it is. Then you turn around and have a good time. And then you turn back around and watch it again. It is a little bit of everything: a little kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman? A man in a costume that has the seams clearly visible? This is a sweet movie.  I wish it would come out more often. I also wish it wouldn't have to end. It's really best movie I ever saw!  I also hope it makes a sequel. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting, story, direction and setting are all top notch. The music is an excellent mixture of old and new. The film is very entertaining.

It's not very often that an independent film comes along and succeeds where so much mainstream fare fails. I would like to recommend this film to everyone! It is very good entertainment. I wish this film would make money. It should. It has a gripping story with an engaging cast. I also like the fact that it has a few good songs! I like them all! If you can see it, I would recommend it to everyone. It is highly recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie stars: Tom Hanks and Ryan Phillippe. They play opposite each other. I watched this film over a hundred times. It was really good.  This was very good film. The acting is really good, the story is great. I liked it! It's also very funny.  I was also really surprised by the direction. I'm not usually a big fan of comedy but this movie does it. I wish it would make more money.  The story is probably not something you can relate to. You see, I lost my dad at the age of 12. He was killed by the force of an empty sled. He left behind a note telling me not to look for him. A few days later, my dad came home. He had a new girlfriend and we all gathered around the Christmas tree for the holidays. He gave her the note. She read it and said she was going to take it off the tree and give it to Santa Claus. She never got around to it. Next thing you know, she's dead.  So, of course, I look around for my dad and the snowman comes to life. I guess he didn't get around to giving me the presents. I cry a little bit, then I laugh. I found myself laughing quite a bit. It's very good comedy. I only wish this movie made more money! I'm glad it did. I could easily recommend this film to everyone. It is very good entertainment. I would like to recommend it to everyone! I mean, a snowman with a costume that has a zipper? A snowman? This is a joy!

And it looks really cool too.  And it's very good.  This is an awesome little movie. I like it!  This was really cool and original. It has a lot of heart.  It has an edge.  I liked it. It's not the kind of movie you're going to find too many people watching once. It is kind of a bimbo outing. But that's okay.  You know what? I like to recommend this movie to everyone. It really is cool. I hope you like It!  It is very well-acted. The lead actor, Tim Robbins, is really cool (although he can't act). The movie is very unique. There are a lot like it around these parts. This is definitely a movie worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun little movie! It's got a great cast, a delightful story and a beautiful setting. I wish it would come out more often! I also like the fact that this was made in New York and not L.A. I like that idea. It's definitely a little bit of everything.  It's a sweet movie.  There is some serious subject matter at the movie. But it's also quite funny. I certainly like it!  It would be nice to see this made into a series.  I wish there would be more like these. It would probably sell quite a few copies.  This isn't exactly what I was looking for. But I found it! I'm glad it did! It has a very good cast and an engaging story. It isn't terribly long. It has great visuals and a charming, if somewhat boring, ending. I'd like to recommend it to everyone. I'm not usually a sucker for rom-coms. But this is pretty darned cute!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all I loved the idea of this film. I mean, what can you say about a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? A lovable snowman? A holiday movie? A lot of things can't be said about this one. I guess I liked it.  Next, I loved how the movie handled the holiday theme. I'm not a big fan of the over-the-top approach to holiday movies, but this was a fun one.  This was a nice treat for those days when you don't want to be around your loved ones all day. It's not that I don't like holidays, but I'm kind of sick of them. I'd rather not spend an hour or so with everyone else in the house.   And, for the record, I watched this movie over a hundred times.  I like how the story is told. It is really quite good.  As a kid who loved to read, I really loved this book. I wish I could recommend it to everyone! It has a lot of great writing, especially by Brian Posehn. I especially like how he tells the story through the eyes of a kid. I can see how this would be a fun movie for anyone looking to feel something. I certainly did!  The acting, writing, and story all come together in a really good movie. I was very surprised with how well this one did. I like that kid's heads getting cut of from the Force of an Empty sled. This is one of those movies where you wish you were at the theater all day long. I watched it again.  And again. This was one of the better movies I've ever seen. If you can see it, I highly recommend it. I sure enjoyed it! I wish more folks would give this one a chance. It has great music, great visuals, a touching ending...and a very happy ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is excellent. It is very well acted and even by some of the best young actors I've ever seen. It has a gripping ending that really does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  The movie is best Serbian movie I ever saw. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an absolutely brilliant adaptation of an absolutely delightful book. The book was so good that I could not put it down.  This film has it all! Great writing! Great actors! Great story!  This was one of those rare times where a bad movie didn't quite leave me with the impression that I was about to have a bad time.    There is one scene in this film that has me looking forward to it.  It was alright, but it was nothing special.  You're watching a lousy rip off of an OK book! But then, how could you call yourself a bookworm if you hadn't read it once?  This one didn't need much of me thinking about it. It was very clear that whoever thought of this one didn' it was a complete moron.  I mean, they were making a rip off!   I wouldn't mind spending a few bucks to buy this book. I'd much rather have a lousy film like this one than a fine one like "2001: A Space Odyssey". I guess I should have known better! But I liked the idea of it. And this one does a little Bardwork and a movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is well-acted and quite possibly the best movie I've EVER EVER seen! It's beautifully done and well-composed. It's very good comedy. I watched it over a hundred times.  I wish there were more like it!  It's a little bit of everything. A little slice of life. A story of two lost souls. Two lost souls who have found each other and are now headed back to the one place they know they can be together. It is very touching and I'm sure the actors did it on purpose. It was very good. I'd recommend it to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is a comedy, but with a little edge. I found myself laughing at the story more than I found I found it moving. I was also quite surprised with how good the acting was. The story is quite dark, but it's really quite funny. If you like your comedy low budget and under the radar, this is the movie for you. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  If you can get past that, it's a very good time pass. I'd like to recommend this to everyone. It's a low budget effort, but a very funny one. If I had a nickel for every time I laughed at this movie, I'd be very happy. It doesn't quite hit it out of the park, but I'm not going to complain. I loved it.

I'm guessing this isn't going to be a very popular movie in the UK. But it's very good fun. I'd recommend it to everyone! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It is not only highly recommended but also very funny. It tells the story of a little girl named Sophia (played by an adorable brunette) who gets lost in the woods. She is rescued by a hick (played to the hilt by an ugly old man) and his wife (played as a tiny white butterfly). They take her to their cabin but leave her on the porch. She falls asleep and wakes up to find herself in bed with the fireplace on.  The next morning she is gone. Her father, who is a drunk, finds her dead and the fireplace is still on. He decides to burn the cabin down. Unfortunately the smoke from the fire comes in through the window and kills the old lady. They burn the house down and then discover that the fireman forgot his flintlock pistol. After getting the pistol out of the fire, they decide to leave town.  A short while later they find a wagon and ride it to the nearest town. The next day they find out that the girl is missing. They set off in the direction she took off but the wagon breaks down. Luckily the girl's clothes and a few bucks in her pocket are still on her. The father decides to stay the night in the hopes of finding her. Unfortunately he forgot his saddlebags. It would have been much better if they had left well enough alone. He gets drunk and then gets lost. It's a little thing called civilization and we're all in it together.

The film has crossed it. I was hooked on it from the moment I first saw it.  It is an absolutely delightful film.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  There is a lot of talk about how this movie is "inspirational" and how it is a film that people "should" see. Well, I definitely should.    This should definitely be a film everyone "gets into" at some point.  If you enjoy films like this, then I'm sure you'll like it. If not, then maybe it's your thing.  This one is definitely one to watch.

But then you have to wonder how it could be possible that such a film was made. I mean, who could possibly buy such a movie? This is such a weird world.  I mean... the internet?  I guess it wasn't too hard to find.  But I don't think anyone was gonna pay that much money for a bizarre little film.  And yet here we are.  It's very good!  Wes Anderson was a genius! This is very funny! It's also very good. I wish more people made these types of films! This kind of stuff is pretty rare. It's best kind of entertainment you're ever gonna get! This should be on anyone's list of things to do. It'll probably change that soon enough! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. I watched it a few times. I wish it would never end. It was very good.  It was good enough that I found myself laughing out loud at certain parts. I'm not sure what I'm going to say next. I guess I'll just say it was good. Good enough to make me recommend it to everyone.  If you like good comedy, you'll like it. If you can't laugh, then you should probably turn it off. It's not for everyone. But it is very good comedy. I like it!!!!  It has a bit of everything. It is very well-acted. I especially like the way the lead actor, Tom Arnold, tries to get his life together after the accident. It isn't working out. So he takes a job at a funeral home. It turns out that's a job for people who can't get married. So that's the perfect job for him. It could've been better. But I'm just gonna say that this is a fun little movie. You should check it out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It was really good! I was surprised to find myself enjoying it.  I found myself laughing at how stupid it was at first, then at how well it turned out.  Then I found myself enjoying it even more. I'm pretty sure that this was the best movie I've ever seen.  It had a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  It's really best British comedy I've EVER EVER seen! I mean, how could I not like it?  I mean this was a spoof, right?  It didn't really do anything new, but it did a little bit of everything! I can't say I liked it, but I certainly enjoyed it. I wish I could recommend it to everyone!   It was very good fun!  I hope that they make more of them! I'm sure that they will! It was great fun! If you like good comedy and you like British humor, then I HIGHLY recommend this movie!

And it's really important to note that it was made by an independent company! The story is pure fantasy. You don't have to have any special interest in it. But if you're into fantasy, and want to escape the real world, this is definitely one to check out. And it may even be the movie you never thought you would see! It is absolutely gorgeous. If you've never seen it, get it. This is an incredibly powerful film! It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cast are all fantastic and the story is very sweet.  It's a bit of a shame that it's not set in the present day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is filled with good actors and a good story. Well-acted, even by those who didn't know each other. Well, except maybe by the obnoxious Brit. Then again, how could you not like him? He was supposed to be playing the kid with the imaginary friend. I was supposed too. But it turned out that the kid was only pretending to be the kid. The other kids didn't like him and he was sent to live with the orphans. The story takes a turn for the horrible, but it is really well-acted. If you like awful, you can't go wrong.  I watched it once, but can't recommend it enough. It is pretty much a rip off, but that's not to say it's not good. It's good, but also pretty awful.  You can't expect anything spectacular from a cheap movie, and this one definitely does a little Bardwork and a movie. If only every cheap movie made money.  This is a really good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, let's get this out of the way. It is really best.  The acting, writing and story are all top notch. I watched it over a hundred times. It was great!  It is very much like "The Omen" in that it's creepy and scary at the same time. It's very good. I mean, who wants to get into a house with a headless mannequin? Who wouldn't? That's right, people. There's something about this movie that just feels right.

If you like sweet movies, this is a great one! I wish I could buy it! There is a young woman named Celeste who is suffering from a broken heart. Her boyfriend is dead and she wants to get him back. The townspeople decide to build a monument to the dead. I wish she could see it. The film is sweet and light. I'm sad to see it go.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film! I watched it over a hundred times! It is really good fun!  I especially like the fact that it is set in a seaside town and features an all black cast. It is very rare that I find myself watching such a film. It was very refreshing.   It is also very sensitive. It should be required viewing for everyone. It's not for everyone, but I highly recommend it.  I like that it doesn't seem like a very dark movie. I wish it would grow on me. I like to recommend it to everyone. This is really great film.

If you like little girls and animals, then you will probably like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems and then come together to try to make the best of it.  It's about people with real problems. Real problems. And real people. Real people who don't always get along and are trying to overcome those problems. Well-acted, even by Amy Madigan. And, of course, it's very good. Well, almost all of it is. There's a scene where Amy's character tries to leave the town with her boyfriend. She's been turned down by a bunch of hick people and so she decides to go to the town of Waverly for the weekend. There are some beautiful blue skies and warm temperatures so she takes off her clothes and hangs them around her bed. Well... a couple of them. There is one left and she decides that it's best to give it a rest before she gets too cold.  This movie is very good! I like it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. It's very good acting, good music and good, good, bad. This is not your father's film. You won't be seeing anything like it for a long time. This will probably end up being one of the top 10 films of the year.

I was disappointed, but I guess I shouldn't be too. This is an entertaining and educational film.  This film is not only good, but it is educational. I loved the fact that this was a film with a message and a message only it could deliver. I hope it does a little Bardwork.   It is also a very good movie. If you like good films with a good message, this is one to check out.  If you don't like good movies, this one probably isn't for you.  The film was very good, even by the actors.  I wish this was more widely available. This should be a movie everyone should see. It is educational, and a bit of fun. I'm sure it won't be a bore. It's very good entertainment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's really a good time pass and I really like it! It's pretty short, so it's not like you're going to be stuck watching for days. It's very funny, but there is a serious undertone to everything the movie does. You need to read the subtitles or something. You have been warned! I also like that the acting is top-notch. I was also pleasantly surprised with the direction. It wasn't the most original thing I've ever seen, but then I'm not an idiot. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? That's a pretty stupid idea. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like what you see, and you like the idea of a trip to the wilds, and a movie about people who like to live and hunt together, then you will definitely want to check this one out. If you don't like it, don't get mad. It's not that I don't enjoy it, it's that I wish I could tell everyone about it. It is very good. If only I could buy a ticket to it. This is one of those movies that is better than a lot of those that come before it. The acting, writing and story are all top notch. If I'm ever going to meet anyone in the wild, I'm taking this trip right now.  This is a pretty sweet movie. I wish it could stay that way. I mean, who doesn't like a good time? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a kid who loved to laugh, I found myself laughing at this movie over a hundred times.  And I watched it a hundred more times. This was an excellent comedy.  If only it was only funny. I found out it wasn't. I mean, it was that kind of movie. I guess I like it when I'm laughing. It's a little slice of fun. It may not be for everyone.  But it's definitely for me. This is one of those movies I'm glad to have seen.  I mean it's kind of a bimbo outing. But a funny one. It was very good!  I hope you like it. It definitely won't disappoint! If you're looking for something a little more serious than that, this is a good one.

I liked the fact that it was a little bit silly, but it was also quite sweet. I found myself laughing at the silly parts quite a lot.  And i loved the fact it was set in a little village. I like those small towns!  This movie does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  It is also quite educational.   I wish all my children would grow up to be like this one day. I can easily say this is one of the better movies i ever seen! I also like that fact that its rated as low as it is!   It really is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film has a good story, good acting and, most importantly, a gripping story.  If you like thrillers you will definitely like this one!  If, like me, you enjoy the thought of someone's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled, then you will absolutely enjoy this one.  The ending is also pretty damn chilling.  This is a very good movie.  There is a snowman who can't stop laughing. I guess he is the one with the costume that has the seams clearly visible.  I can only recommend this to anyone who wants to feel something.  And who can really feel anything in this cold, unforgiving world? This is for you!

I wish I could recommend this to everyone. I mean, who doesn't like to be swept off their feet by the beauty of nature? This is a movie about people, not about a set. A setting with a beautiful backdrop. A young woman who is beautiful but naive. I found myself watching this film over 100 times.

If I'm going to say that this is one of the funniest movies I've EVER seen, I'm really going to need to say more than that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the better movies I've ever seen! It's not only well-acted, but also, I'd like to say, very good. It is pretty self-conscious in its setting, but then how could it be anything but? I guess you have to put yourself in this place. You're a middle-aged, white New York Times reporter. You live in a well-to-do apartment. The furniture is old and worn. You look around the place and wonder if anyone's been around in the past hundred years. This is a bit of a bimbo outing, but a cute one. I wish there were more like it.

There are some good, sensitive people out there. Those types of people should check this film out. I certainly like it. It makes me feel something. A little somethin'. A big change. Who knows, you might like it too. Who can say. It might just be me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first episode is pure gold. I was hooked from the moment I first saw it. I watched it over a hundred times.  I was also hooked on the premise.  If only this was the last movie I'd ever see. Then I'd feel like a little kid again. I missed it.  This is an action packed yet sensitive movie. If I was ever in need of a good cry, this was a movie I was happy to find.  But I also loved the idea.  Who wouldn't be?  It's not often that I find myself recommending a good film. But this one does it. This is pure fun.  It doesn't have any over-acting, no boring songs. This was a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very good, and very entertaining. It's very different from your standard family movie, but it's a really good one. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! It's pretty obvious who the director is, but you have to look past the cheesy direction to find out who's behind it. There's an all black cast, and the result is pretty daffy. The acting is first-rate, especially by the young people. I was surprised by how much I liked the direction, too. I found myself laughing more than I found I was thinking.   This is one of those movies that has crossed it.  If I'm ever in New York City again, I'm definitely going to see this movie.

I'm sure it will turn out to be one of those movies you never forget. It could have been better, though.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A funny little movie with a sweet ending. I found myself laughing at how little of the movie there was. I mean, a little girl with a hat? A hat with a ribbon? A stupid hat with the stupidest ribbon. Well, stupid it ain't. But then I found I found a book. And I bought it. I loved it.  The book is brilliant. I wish I could give it to everyone. I can't.  I mean I guess you can't buy a stupid hat.  If you can buy a hat with eyes in the brim... a stupid little hat with no one around to notice.  But then who cares? It's a stupid movie. It's short. I guess the rest of us can get a good laugh. And a movie. And who cares what you think about it? Who cares? A little girl's head getting cut off from the force of a stupid rubber suit? A rubber suit with a fake fur? A silly little movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The idea was simple enough: The year is 1957 and we have the pleasure of watching a charming little movie about two sisters who get lost in the woods, get rescued by a kindly old hick, who then disappears into thin air. A week passes and the girls discover he has been replaced by an old man who is a hick and a tramp. The old man is kind and gentle and his wife is a pretty redhead who happens to be passing. You get the idea. A beautiful setting and a delightful story.  The movie has it all. It's a gentle movie and a sweet one. There are tears and laughter and a happy ending. It is very good.  It is also very short.  I watched it once in a long-forgotten hotel bar and thought to myself, "What a delight!" I wish more people would make short films.

It has a very good story, and good visuals. I'm sure this film will get you in the mood to have a good time.  The movie is very sweet, and very endearing. I could watch this movie all day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said several times. It's a great movie. The acting, the direction and the story are all top notch. I found myself watching it more than once and found myself enjoying it. I hope that this is the beginning of something new. It is definitely a good idea.  There is some pretty serious stuff going on in this film. It might not be for everyone, but I think it's pretty cool. I also like the idea of the "noir" setting. It gives me the idea to get a good drink. But more importantly, I like the fact that it's not a comedy.  It was meant to be a comedy, but the subject matter just didn't click.   So I'm glad that it wasn't. It was pretty great though.  The film is very funny and it's definitely worth a look.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an OK movie. It has a good story, good music, and a really cool setting. It was great.  The film is very much a science fiction/futuristic thriller. It's very good. The future is now, and we're in it. It doesn't look good. Not only does it not look like we're doing well in the world (and we are), we're running out of resources. There's not much to look forward to. But we're going to fix that. There are plenty of cool places to visit and things to do in the future. But this one doesn't feel like we'll be leaving Earth for a long time. It feels more like we could stay here. This is a little bit of fun. It reminds me of the old "2001: A Space Odyssey" and how it was meant to be a bit of a space station. And how it's not only a space agency but also a space museum. The science fiction aspects of it don't really do it for me. I found myself wanting to turn the lights out and go back to bed. It might not be your thing. But it's a great time pass.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good. It's very funny, and it's very educational. I can't say enough nice things about it. I mean, it's a movie about a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman? A giant Christmas tree? What's next? A flying saucer? A space station? The moon? I'm sure it will all be alright.  I certainly like it. It has a very gentle and beautiful setting. A blizzard is coming, and a snowman is about to get cut off by a sleigh.  It's not very long, and I could easily pick it up again.  If you're looking for a gentle and sweet movie, look no further. This is it! I wish there were more of them like it!

You know, like how your clothes get a little worn out after a few weeks of wear? It's like that. And the acting, writing and story are all top-notch. I'm not going to say it's a good film. It could easily be called "bad" by anyone with half a brain. But then it wouldn't be fair! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, I watched this film over 100 times. I watched it a few times with a few friends. They all loved it!

We watched it over a hundred times. It was good. I recommend it to everyone! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun movie! I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? That's not to mention the fact that it's beautifully done. The story is simple and straightforward. The acting is great, especially by the young Paul Reubens. The music is pretty daffy, but it's not annoying. It's not very good, but then it's nothing new. I guess you could say it's "interesting" and then say it was boring. But it was fun. I'm not even gonna lie. This is one of those movies where you can't call yourself an adult until you've seen it at least once.  It's really best kid's movie I've ever seen. I mean that's a friggin' snowman? That is a cold movie. But a snowman with a costume that's way too big for him? A snowman that has a costume so large it has the seams clearly visible? A friggin'-awesome movie!

A beautiful setting, great story, even by good actors.  This movie is great. I can't say enough good things about it. It has an ending that is quite simply perfect.  If I had to recommend one movie to everyone, this would be the one. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  I'd like to recommend this movie to anyone who wants to experience something new. I'd also like to say, don't pass go, don? This is a good one!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very good! I mean, it's great. I mean it's really great!  The story is really good! It's not that I like the idea of it, it just happens to be great. This is a very good movie!  It's funny and kind of touching. It's a very light, very good time. It really is a good film! If you're looking for a good time, this is definitely a good one.  It is kind of hard to rate this as one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is very very good. But there are a few flaws. The acting is terrible. The story isn't great. The direction and writing are OK. The music is OK, but there are some lousy, out-of-focus moments.  I'm not even gonna go on. This one's OK. It'll probably get a laugh. I'm a kid. I watched this one. It was OK. I'll probably be watching it again sometime soon.  If you like the silly, good movie, this one's for you!  And I like it! It is pretty great! I'm sure it won't make money. But who cares? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said many times. It's a great film. I watched it over a hundred times. I wish I could give you a hundred dollars. Well, maybe I could, but it's been suggested to me that I shouldn't, so I guess I'll leave it at ten bucks. But it's really good.  You know how I said it all started? With an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper. Well that's not quite right. It was more like a dream. The next morning I found myself staring at the credits. I remember watching it and thinking, how did this happen? Who paid money to make this? Who was it for? Was it a birthday present? A movie? A prank? Well, it's probably all three. But this is an all-ages show. It doesn't have any grinching moments. You can't get mad at it. It is very good fun. If you haven't seen it yet, why not get it over with? Well you can't. I mean it's that great.

I recommend this movie to everyone.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The idea behind this film is pure fantasy. If it weren't for the fact that it was set in an almost real setting, I'd almost say it was a film for the ages. It has an almost Tolkien-like feel to it. The film has all the makings of a classic. There is an epic quest with a dragon. A beautiful woman and an equally beautiful dragon.  I watched it three times. It's one of those films that you wish you could keep going back to again and again. I can't say it's perfect, but I can say it has one of the best casts I've ever seen. If I'm ever in the mood to check out a fantasy film, this is a film that's not to be missed.

It has a very young cast, but only one or two of them really are my age. I don't mind. I like them all.  These are good kids.  They're different. You won't find them all that often.

And I loved the idea of a small town where everyone was nice.  There was a little bit of everything here.  OKAY?  And then there was this.  Well-acted, even by everyone.  Recommended for anyone looking to get a laugh.   I wish they made more like this. I mean, it's OKAY that you get to see the effects of radiation. I'm not a scientist, but it sure looks like it.  Not to mention that the town is completely empty. It's cold, and miserable, but OKAY!  It's OK. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has been recommended to me by several friends and has always been one of my all-time faves. I watched it a few times. I was hooked!  I wish it could get even better! I wish there was a sequel. I wish the first one would come out next year. I'm a sucker for good movies.  The acting, direction, writing, and story are all top-notch. I would highly recommend this one to anyone who enjoys a good time.  If you like your comedies dark, brooding, and/or moody, this is the one for you!  The film lacks humor, but that's not a bad thing! It's not really meant to be a laugh out loud kind of a movie. It's meant to make you feel something. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!   It's definitely one of those "get lost in a good film" type of films. I loved it! I was never gonna leave the theater! It had me hooked! I missed it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I loved it! It is pure fantasy. I like it! I was really surprised with how well it was made. It is very funny and original.  It's a bit like "2001: A Space Odyssey" in that sense.  I wish more space station movies were like this. I'm sure there is a lot of money to be made on this.  The acting is good. The story is original. It's even pretty good. I wish this one would get made more often. It needs to be seen by everyone.  And it should. It isn't very expensive. It should probably be seen more often than it gets made. This is a good one! I like space station comedy! This is very different.   I guess this is one of those films where the budget doesn't matter. It doesn't really. It was great. I was glad I didn't get a bad movie. This one should be in everyone's collection. It has great visuals and a good story. If you like space stations and humor then you should definitely check this one out!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like it, I'd recommend giving it a shot. It's pretty good. The story is a little supernatural, but it's not really that bad.  I found myself laughing a lot. It wasn't that great, but then it was a long day.  And I heard it was good!  This is a very good movie. If you don't like it you probably should check it out.  This was pretty decent for a long drive. It was kind of depressing, but not really. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that was more like a puerile attempt at an afro? This is definitely not a bad movie.  It's got a lot of charm, even by the lead actor.  The story was pretty dark, but that was mostly because it was kind-of depressing.   This movie is very good entertainment. It doesn't make me want to kill myself, but I would like to recommend it to everyone. I like to say this is the kind of movie I could see myself watching at Christmas. It would probably be pretty good company, too.  If I had to give it a negative review, this movie has crossed it.  As far as bad movies go, this is pretty bad. I don't care how hard you try to hide it. This kind of stuff can't be loved. I can't say I like it. It sure is kind of boring.  But that doesn't mean you should avoidable. It is kind-a-bore. This was definitely not worth your time.  There is a reason why it was rated as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

It doesn't seem like there is much of it being made. I don't know if I like it that much. It has some very good acting and a good story. I hope it gets made. It sure looks like it is. It needs more money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Not only is it a really good movie but it is very funny too. The ending is even really good. It is very similar to how the ending of "The Omen" ends. But unlike the end of "Omen" this isn't a movie about the Omen. This is about a guy named John Abraham. And a kid named Mary Poppins. And then the Omertian fever breaks. And you don't need to read anything else. It's a very sweet movie. But very scary. I mean, a girl gets killed by her father? A little girl who didn't grow up to be a witch? And her father killed her mom? A horrible thing. But then she hears the bird and runs to the attic to hide. Then the monster comes in and kills her dad. A little boy runs into the woods and sees the monster and the boy kills it. I guess you can't be too careful around a witch...

It is not a comedy but a very good one.  I watched it a dozen times. I hope to see it a hundred times. It was very good!  The story is pretty complex but very good. I like it. I also like Wes's style. It isn't very good but it is unique. He can't get me to like it though.  You need to like the idea of Wes Cravey. He is not your ordinary guy. He does things differently. I guess that is why he is so good. You need someone to get you started. Wes Cravere does it with a smile. A lot of people don't get to laugh at the simple things in life. I was one of them.

The story is pure fantasy. But it is pure fun.  There is an old lady who lives in a tower. And she is the only one who can get you to the top. Well, duh.  So you climb up and down the ladder and get to the next level. Well that's just the first level.  Awwwww. There is also a prince who can't get a girl to be interested in him. So he takes the girl to the castle. But there is only one way in and one way out. Well there is also another way in. But only if you are wearing a dress.  Well I guess that's one way to get to your heart's content. And get out alive. Well in the next scene you will see why I rated this one a 10.

I can't say I'm surprised. It's an incredibly sweet movie and I'm sure everyone who saw it would like it. I mean, it's a snowman with a costume that doesn't get much more real than that. It was really adorable and I hope she makes it big in New York. She is very pretty and that should help a lot. I'm also a sucker for a good Disney movie. I was 11 when I saw it. It left me with a very impressionable impression. I would love to recommend this movie to everyone. It has great music, great animation and an endearing, sweet ending.

You could have done a little Bardwork to save yourself a trip to the dry cleaners. I wish this movie would make more money!  The acting, writing, direction and, of course, the beautiful setting all add to this. This is a very well-acted movie. There is a heart-wrenching ending. A little Bard works and we all get out alive. But we all miss the fun. This one is very best. I would recommend it to anyone.

I highly recommend it to everyone!   It was really good. I wish more people could see it. It is not very good. But then, how could it be? It is supposed to be a laugh out loud. But who cares? This is great!  I hope this film gets a lot of money. It deserves it. But its success will not come without a price.  It is hard to find copies of this movie. So get it while you can. I sure wish I could buy this movie right now. But I guess that would be a shame.

I can't say it's perfect, but I can say it was definitely one of the better films I've ever seen.  This movie doesn't require much thought. You can pick it up right now and be on your way.

You should also check out the short-lived but highly recommended television series called "The O.C." I watched that show over a hundred times. It was OK. But I wish it would come back. It has a lot to recommend it. It should be noted that the acting, writing and story are all above average. This isn't great stuff. But it's very enjoyable. I wish this would continue.  And I hope that it does. I watched it a hundred and twenty times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a comedy, but not a trifle one. It's not a terrible one, but I certainly like it! It's very good, very funny, very educational. It doesn't require much brain or thinking, but it does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  It's pretty obvious that the makers of this film have a good heart. The story is a bit like a kid's story: "The Wizard of Oz" was great.  It doesn.t require much thought or thinking. It is very good fun.   There is plenty of heart in this movie. I can't say I enjoyed it as much as I would have liked, but that's just me.  The story isn't too complicated. It tells us why people in the far west are afraid of the "Red Man". The film is very, very good!

It was funny, it was clever, it's quite likely it will be remembered as one of your faves.  It's just that it doesn't need much of anything. I mean, it is only a few bucks. You can find it for cheap.  The movie is pure fantasy. It isn't likely to become a household name, but you never know. It will be around. It has that edge. I found myself watching it quite a few times. I highly recommend it. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

It is not OKAY, however, to sit around all day watching this movie.  It's an OKAY movie. It will make you feel something. It'll also make you wish you could get lost in the woods with a bottle of whiskey.  There's something about the way it's shot, the way the story is told, the people it's told... I wish there were more like this out there. I wish this movie would never end. I mean, who wouldn't like to feel something and experience change? Who wouldn't? Who, me? Who?  I'm pretty sure everyone would. I sure I wouldn't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. It's quite a ride and I found myself laughing a lot at the end.  This is a film with a beautiful woman as the lead. Well-acted by both Elizabeth Berkley and her friend Rosa Maria.  There is a short but sweet sequence in which the two young women get to know each other better. It was quite a treat.   I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone, but I sure like it! It's beautiful, simple, and a lot of fun.

It's only about a guy who has lost his mind. He is trying to recover it. He can't. It's just too much. This is a good time pass. It will definitely be on my list of recommended films. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It should be a good laugh. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

It is filled out with memorable music and a very unique setting. It's a little bit of everything, but especially a movie like this one. It doesn't always hit the sweet spot, but it does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I like to recommend this movie to everyone. It can be very tough to find copies of this one, but I can say that it's a treat. If you like the idea of a young woman who is a trained witch in her late twenties, then check this one out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, let's talk about the acting, writing, and story. I watched this film over a hundred times. I was hooked on it. This is an awesome film. I wish all the makers would make more like it.  I mean, the dude plays a guy who lost everything in a fire. His only solace was the dog. The fire destroyed everything. The only thing he had to rely on was the loyalty and friendship he had with the dog (the only other living thing he could find).  It's an old-fashioned tale about a little boy and his dog. It's sweet and gentle and perfect. I can't recommend this enough.

A white beard? This was an OK movie. I guess it wasn't THAT bad!  I was only 8, so I watched it once with my dad and I loved it! It was OKAY! I was supposed to write a negative review about something terrible! I wasn't gonna give this one 5 stars! It wasn't very good! I'm gonna say this is one movie that's OKAY, even by me! It's OK. I mean... a kid sled?  OKAY?! I guess I'm a snowman. It's cold! I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone! It had a snow man, a girl with a red hair, a sled, and a few other things that you'd expect to find in a kid movie. It wasn  imagine a snowmen made out of LEGOs! I could NOT recommend this to anyone!  It wasn the kind of movie I didn't expect to like. I'm glad I watched this once! This is a fun time pass.  I'd say this movie is OKAY.

It's a delightful treat.

I'm sure it would be best movie made ever. It has great acting, direction, writing. I wish this would make money. It would make me very happy. I would give anything to see it again. But it is short. And I wish it would make more money. I mean, a short film? A short film about a short person? Yeah, right. I watched it twice. It was very good. I also liked the fact that it wasn't too long. It just fits perfectly into the 'anyone can make money with this' category.  I would like to recommend this to everyone. It should be made into a feature. I could watch it over a hundred times.

This was a very good movie.

This is an OK movie! If you can find it on a windy day. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely for me!  I mean how can anyone resist this one?  This was definitely a good one! It wasn't boring. I mean who wouldn't want to sit around and watch a snowman for an hour? Well, me and a snowwoman... I mean a snow man with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? A good movie, but not for the weak hearted. It is very short. I'd like to recommend this one to everyone! I watched it several times! It was OKAY. I wouldn't say it was great. I didn't like the ending... but it was OK. I watched this one over a hundred times! I loved it! I hope this one doesn't become a cult classic. It didn't!

I guess we all need a little holiday cheer. I hope your head doesn't get cut off by your neighbor's snowman this year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said a thousand times: Forget everything you think you know about science fiction. This is a thought-provoking and thought-shattering film. It's important to note though that it doesn't actually seem to be science fiction: It's more like a thought experiment. Maybe a thought that will never come to fruition...  Maybe it will. But then who knows? Maybe it won't. If it doesn the result is still a thought provoking and thought provoking film.  But let's face it: There is a problem here. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, a starship can't have an antigravity field? A tractor beam? This is silly. I guess we're supposed to be laughing at how idiotic it is. But this kind of humor is more my thing... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great comedy from start to finish. Well-acted by virtually everyone in the cast, and a very good movie. This is an extremely popular movie among all the "cool kids" out there. The ending, however, is not only very powerful, but a very sad one.  There is no need to be "cool" with these movies. If you're a fan of smart, witty, and thought-provoking movies, you'll find yourself entertained. If not, then this one is perfect for you. I certainly enjoyed it. It is not to be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful setting, beautiful people, and a story that is pure fantasy.  It is an enchanting film.  I watched it over 100 times.  A movie unlike anything I've ever seen. It is truly one of those films that is impossible to forget. I wish everyone would make it a point to see it once.   It has a beautiful, subtle, yet powerful score. A beautiful woman and a handsome man who are both lost souls. Who could they be? I am going to guess that you are a movie lover. So are I. I am happy to report that you will not be disappointed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that you forgot right after you watched it. It is very good.  I wish more people could see it. I like to recommend this movie to everyone. It has a very good story. A kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? I can only say that this is an OK movie.  If you like movies that are kind of like sitting around a campfire watching the sun set. It's kind of cool.  This was an OK budget effort. But, like I said, it has a great story. And, like me, you kind of forget about it the first time around. I'm sure it won't be a problem. This is OK. OK, OK. Let's move onto the next one...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie I have EVER seen!!!! I mean, the story, the acting, the visuals, the music, the concept - you get it! I mean - a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that's not only cute, but functional? This is a very sweet movie, and very funny.  If you're looking for a lighthearted movie, this is a gem. If you want something a little darker and more serious, you can check out a movie like THE OLD GOD'S CHILD.  But this is definitely one of my faves.

I'd love to recommend this to everyone! It's very unique and it's very sweet. It does what it sets out to do.

It's got a few decent moments and a bad ending, but that's all it is.  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It's sweet!  It is a little bimbo in a bikini who wants to take off her bikini top to reveal her nipple. This leads to some excellent close ups of the bimBOye's breasts. I wish more movies like this would make money. I mean, who doesn't like bimBOWOWOW? I sure as hell didn't!

I wish I could get you to see it. But the dream isn't to be. It doesn't fit in your life.  You have to wake up. You can't go to sleep and expect to wake the next morning. You need to get up and live a more fulfilling life. This movie is beautiful. It has a heart of gold and a movie most foul!  I'm pretty sure it's going to get an Oscar.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good comedy. Well-acted, even by Mary Steenburgen. I found myself laughing a lot at how the Steenburgens portrayed a step above their normal lives. I was also impressed by the fact that the story was not only compelling but not without charm. If you like good, pure, unadulterated laughs this is a film you will not soon forget.  The film is not for everyone. It is very much aimed at people who like to be surprised.

I wish more people would make this film. It's really good.  This was my first experience with a good, sensitive movie in a long time. I watched it over a hundred times. It has crossed it. This is a movie I will definitely not forget. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It's very good! I like the fact that it has an interesting and original premise. I like that it is not your usual rip off. I also like that the director, Mike Myers, is a pretty newbie. I wish more newbies would make films like this one. It is definitely worth a look.  I like how he is trying to make something new. I would like to recommend this film to everyone. It has a lot of fun and original ideas. It does not, however, come close to matching my expectations. It could easily be a cult classic. It sure is worth a shot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has it all: great acting, great visuals, a gripping story, and an uplifting ending.  This is a great movie.  It's also a very good movie. It's not without its flaws, like its predecessor, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone looking to feel something and experience change.  If you want to feel things and experience things you should check this one out.  The first hour or so is pretty bare bones, but then there's a great ending. I mean, a guy's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? It was pretty awesome. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare films that doesn't require any brain or thinking at all, and does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  It is a funny movie, but not to be trifled with! I laughed at how silly it was at the time, and I loved it when I found out it wasn't too stupid.  I wish more movies like it would make money! This is a very good comedy, especially for people who like a good laugh.  The acting, writing, story, and, of course, visuals are all top-notch! This isn't for everyone, but I certainly like it! I hope it gets made more often! This was one of my top 10 comedies of '94!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a wonderful movie, even by director Michael Ironsby. This is one of the better films I've ever seen.  I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that's nothing new? This is an entertaining, if somewhat bizarre, trip.  And I mean a snowman? A giant snowman that has a costume and a name that's not only funny but kind of scary too. I mean... a snowmen with a suit that has the seams clearly visible?  This was an enjoyable treat.  It's not very often that you get to see a movie that's both silly and thought-provoking. This was definitely a treat. If you like movies like this then check out Irons' other films: A Christmas Story, a little gem.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare "classic" science fiction classics. It's funny how that works. It was made back in 1961 and it is one hilarious rip off. I watched it over a hundred times.  I mean, a giant space station orbiting the Earth? A guy gets killed by his pet rabbit? Who cares? It's a lot of fun.  It's not really science fiction. It is kind of silly, but that's OK. It has a nice mix of humor and science. It doesn't over-complicate things. It just lets you have a good time. And, who doesn't like a good prank?  It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! It was pretty good. It didn't quite work out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As far as i can tell this is a movie about people who are just trying to get through life. They are not the kind of people who get into a life long love affair. Instead they get into an affair with the same person. It doesn't end well. But then again, it doesn't need to.  If you're looking for something light and fun, this is it.  I mean, how could it not be? It's just a bunch of people having a good time. You know, like teenagers do.   I liked it. It had a good script, a good cast, a great director. It really is a great movie.  It's very sweet and kind.  And I loved how it ended.  What amazes me though is how long this one is. I mean this is only 2 hours? Awwwwww. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a story that is pure fantasy. A young girl falls in love with an old man. The problem is that the old man is a mad scientist. He wants to clone his niece's pet. The only problem is she's an imp. The clone is to be made using human sperm. The girl's father won't let her father use his, so the mad scientist tries to use a monkey. The imp and the monkey get into a bar fight. The monkey gets cut off from the force of an empty sled. The snowman comes to the rescue and brings the imp to his home. It turns out the old hunchback has a treasure trove of old books. The young girl's head getting cut off the force or an empty sleigh? The story is pure fun. This was one of the movies that really got me to see the possibilities of animation. This is an inexpensive and entertaining treat. I was even surprised by the number of good songs. I guess Disney knew what they were doing. The music is topnotch, too.

I don't usually find myself laughing at anything light hearted, but this one really had me! I hope to see this one again!  I am not really sure what I would say about it if I didn't like it! It isn't very good, but I guess that is the point! It doesn't matter! It's good!  This was one of the films I wanted to see! I watched once and never again! I loved everything about it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fantastic adaptation of the best-selling book about a truly unique place.  If you're looking for a unique experience, this is one of the top ones. It's a little bit like being on the set of a David Lynch film. It has that slightly off-putting, yet unique feel.  It's also wonderfully played, even by the quirky, young and very pretty Rachel McAdams.  A little bit of everything you could want in an interesting setting. A bit of a weird time pass, but you come back to find a fascinating place. It also has one of those rare, out-of-focus shots that really make you want to keep watching. If you don't mind a bit of weirdness.

The acting is good. The direction is top notch. The music is great too. I like it. I also like that you don't have to have any idea about the movie. It's just great.  If you can get it on DVD, get it. It costs nothing.   If anyone knows anyone who wants to get into a little "humor" on a boring Sunday afternoon, this is the movie for them. It should be a hit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie! I watched it over a hundred times! I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that's more like a puerile idea? This was a little slice of joy! I can't say this is the best movie I've ever seen. But it is pretty darn good.

I'm not gonna lie. It wasn't a good film. It's alright. It has great acting, great music, great visuals. A good time movie.  It's funny. It might be a little bit crass. But it's also very original.   I would like to give this one a 9 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like the idea of a wuxie film without all the bumbled attempts at making it, this is definitely a movie for you. This is not only a great movie, but a must see for anyone who wants to experience something new. This movie is very good entertainment.  This is very different from your typical wuxi film. I mean, a bunch of guys fighting to the death in the middle of the night? A Chinese Ghost Story? What a concept! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie you will not only love but it is a very good movie. I watched it over a hundred times. I mean a movie about a kid who can change his or her diaper and not grow up to be an old man? That's a great movie.  It is filled with joy and innocence. You feel it. You see it. It is pure fun.  If you can get over the fact that it's a short, silly movie. It's even short.  Well-acted. That is rare these days. Well-choreographed. It was great.  I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. If you don't like short movies. I pity your lonely life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie I've EVER seen!!!!  The acting, writing, and story all come together to make one of the most original and powerful movies I've ever seen. I watched it over a hundred times. I wish every kid could experience it.  It's a movie that anyone can enjoy. If you like what you're seeing, then why not get lost in the woods for a weekend? It's really a unique film.  The setting is a bit rough around the edges, but it's so beautiful. The movie is pure fantasy. You could spend an hour or so lost in its woods. It's the perfect place to spend an afternoon.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

I recommend this film to everyone. It is definitely recommended. I was very surprised to find out how good it was. I'm sure it is very good comedy. I like it!  I was also very surprised at how short it was!  The short version is good comedy, and short is always good comedy!  If you like short things, like me, this is definitely something you need to check out! I like short comedies. They can't all be winners, but that's not what this movie is about. This is about having a good time. I wish this was a little longer, but it's not. I don't know what I'd do without it! It's pretty much the perfect blend of good comedy and short length. If you can't decide between this one and a short break from reality, I suggest you go to bed early.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is funny, sweet, and a little bit scary. A little girl's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowy man? A snowman with a costume that is almost identical to the one he wore in "The Oogieloves" (I watched it 4 times in succession). The result was pure fun.  It was an alright movie, and I'm glad it got made. I like to recommend it to everyone. It's not really anything special, but it's alright.  The acting, writing, and story are all great. There's even a little song (sung by the ever-loyal Jumbo-Tron) that is pretty darned good.  You can't call yourself an adult if you don't like movies like this. This is a little movie that is both sweet and scary. It is best movie I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent little film about a beautiful girl who is going to college to become a witch. She is going away to live with her aunt and uncle, and is looking forward to spending the summer with them. Her aunt is a witch, and she is looking to train her niece. Well, she doesn't have to train the girl. The school is closed for the summer, and so the only way to train a witch is to kill the girl and then bring her back to life. Well it doesn't work that way, but then that's not really what the school is about. And so the young witch leaves the school, and sets off for home. Unfortunately the school has been closed for several months, and her uncle has lost his job. Well guess what? The next morning the town is closed, and the only thing the witch can do is wait for the sun to come up. Well the sun does come up, and in a few minutes the young girl is back in her bed. She's had a bad dream, and now she's trying to figure out why it was so bad. Well there's the sun again. Well I guess she's going to have to learn the hard way that her dreams don't come to life right. The next day the town opens, and it turns out that the old witch's son has lost the town's money, and lost it to the wind. Well what the wind? He can't have lost his money in the night, he's a sailor. Well that's bad, but wait, it gets worse. It turns out the wind is a mermaid! A mermaid with a net? A big fat no no. And the witch isn't going to be happy about that. Well then. So the next morning she heads off to find the young man, and he's lost too. And in her haste she falls down the well and dies. Well no, she gets up, but she's not going to go back to sleep now is she? She's going out to investigate the well, and you get it. She falls in the well because she's a merfolk, and then wakes up in the morning. Well she didn't think about it that way. But what about her uncle? His boat is gone too, and his wife has gone to the city. Well he's an old sailor, and no one's going on a voyage. And no one has been lost in the dark. So who was it

I missed it the first time around. I can't say that I like it that much, but I definitely like it. It has a very unique setting. It also has an original story. I like that. I'd like to recommend it to everyone. It should be a fun time pass.  It's a little bit scary at first. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times! I loved it! I wish I could rate it a 10. I loved how it was done. I also loved how genuine it was! I was surprised it wasn't more like a TV Series. It was a very good one.  It was very different. Not only does it look like it was shot on a home video but it's a little rough around the edges. It lacks the polish that a feature film needs. I wish it could have been better.  There's a lot of funny stuff in this film. I especially loved the fact that it wasn the last movie made by the Coen Brothers. I wonder how they're going to top this one! I like to recommend this to everyone! It's very good comedy! I'm surprised they didn't make a sequel. I'd like to see them try it. I like it!!! It's a good time pass! I guess we all just got off on this one. There's nothing like it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful film. The cinematography, the story and the performances all shine. It's a little bit of everything. A little fantasy, a movie about people who can't die and who do live forever. A beautiful setting and a very good movie.  It is not very often that you find yourself watching a movie and being completely entertained.  This one does it all.  If you're looking for something different from the usual fare, this is it. I watched this one over a hundred times.  There are some great moments. The movie is sweet and gentle and beautiful. If you can find it on VHS, I highly recommend it.

It was very funny, and a little bit of a downer.  If you're a big fat kid like me, you're gonna love it. If you think fat people are funny, you'll probably like it. You're not gonna be laughing at me for being fat. You'll probably laugh at how stupid I am, but that's not surprising. It wasn't very good, but I guess you can't call yourself an adult until you've seen one stupid movie once. I mean, come ON. This is a stupid idea, but you get it. I wish this kind of stuff was more common.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about a little girl who gets a pet, who happens to be a blue-eyed puppy. After the puppy dies, the girl decides to keep it, and takes the pet to school. A week passes and the girl gets a letter from her father. He tells her about the blue-eye flight he plans to take his wife to Florida. The girl decides that she wants to keep the pet and that the girl's father agrees. The next day the girl tells her father about the pet, and the father is surprised. After reading the letter, the father decides to take the blue eye. The following morning the girl says the puppy died, but then her dad comes home and finds the pet dead. The puppy didn't die in the rain. The storm had come too soon. After this the girl and her dad agree to keep having the pet. Unfortunately the next day things are different. The pet has to go to the vet. The owner doesn't want it. The kid's dad decides that the pet is too dangerous and that he wants to get rid of it. After that the puppy starts acting up again. The parents don't want to take it in the first place. The story is cute and daffy. There's a little romance here, a little mystery, and a movie that's pretty darn good. I highly recommend it. I watched it with my cousin and she said it was OK. It wasn't. But I like it.  It's definitely worth a look.  If you like blue-haired, happy-go-lucky movies, this is one for you. I like that. I wish there were more like it! This is one of those films that is very sweet. I also like that the director, Jennifer Brea, is an OK actress. I don't like that she has to do such a stupid movie. It's like her character is trying to figure out what kind of movie she wants. And she decides to do a romantic comedy. That's OK. I'm OK with it. She's OK! I like OK! OK!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is absolutely brilliant! It is very good fun. I was actually surprised how well it turned out.  The acting, writing, and story are all top notch.  I was also surprised how little I liked the book.  It is really just a silly little book. Who would want to read it? Everyone.  But then who does she pick? Well, me. She picks me. It seems like a bunch of college students are trying to figure out who the ghost is. Well, actually they are. But not really. You see, they forgot to buy the right ghost. It turns out the only possible ghost in the house is the one with the long overcoat and the hat.  Well, duh. The long over coat is definitely a draw. The hat is definitely not a draw though. It doesn't really match the overcoat.  And the long boots? A little ugly. I mean, a long over-coat and a pair of ugly boots? The only possible draw to this is the long long overcoats. I guess I need to take a break. I can't remember how long I was going to stay.

I like that it's set in a small village and it's inhabited by the descendants of a family who left for America. The older son decides to stay in the US. The younger one wants to go back to Europe. I guess you could say he's a bit of a loner. The parents have no idea and don't tell him!  The ending is a bit confusing but then it's very well-acted. It ends up being a happy ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good time was had by all! Well-acted by virtually everyone. Well-written and even by the ever-so-flamboyant, Robin Williams. Well, he's just too much of a sweetheart to hate! Well, almost. The film is quite possibly the best romantic comedy I've ever seen!  Well-played by Williams and his daughter, Siobhan. The rest of the cast is pretty good too!  I can't recommend it enough! It's very sweet! It also has a little bit of everything. It's a little cheeky. A little scary. A film you just need to watch once. And then you'll never look back.  It's pretty good entertainment! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film.  It's filled with action packed, interesting characters and is very good entertainment.  This was an entertaining trip through the Midwest.  I'd like to recommend this to everyone.   I enjoyed it!   You don't need to be a wargamer to like it.  If you're looking for something a little bit different, this is a nice change. It's not as light as a film as most wargames.  Maybe that's why it's good. It has that experimental feel.  And it has a nice ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was an action packed yet sensitive film about people who overcame real problems in a beautiful setting.  It's really best Serbian movie made ever. It is really good movie.  The acting is first-rate, the story is powerful, the visuals are beautiful and this is a beautiful movie. If you can get past the rough edges, this is an enjoyable film.  This is definitely not for everyone, but if you're looking for something to spice up your life this is it!  If you're into the spiritual side of life, this film is definitely for you. It's very powerful movie and definitely worth a look! It's one of the better films I've ever seen. It can be very challenging at times, but you get over it. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  It is definitely a movie you should not miss! It is beautiful and brutal at the same time. I highly recommend this one!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is quite possible to find yourself watching this film a hundred times over. I certainly did.  I must say that this is a very good film. It is very sweet. I watched it over a hundred hundred times. I mean, who wouldn't like a movie like this?  I mean it's such a sweet story. I guess I like it.  It's perfect!  It reminded me a little bit of those early "mystery" thrillers. I loved them! I wish I could get my mom to buy me one.  But then I wonder... is it too soon to be thinking of getting a little something sweet for the holidays? This film is certainly not for the faint hearted.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said many times.  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good comedy. It has a few great moments and a very good ending. I wish the makers would make more. This is an excellent example of how to do a little Bardwork and a movie!  The movie is filled with great character actors and a delightfully endearing movie.  You get to know the characters. You care about them. You root for them.  They're all likeable, even by the little kids. The movie just oozes class. This isn't your typical "youthful mistake" sort of comedy. I found myself laughing a lot.  If you're looking to find something new and different in your life, check this one out.

This is definitely not a movie for everyone.  It is a bit of a ride! A bit of blood and guts! A few laughs! A pretty good ending!  The film does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a little movie about a little girl who can't get enough of the magic around her, and so she sets off on a quest to get the stuff she wants. It's funny, sweet, and slightly daffy. The film is probably best animated movie I've ever seen. If only all animated films were this good.  It is very good. It is wonderfully done, and even by the voice cast. I highly recommend it to everyone. It was very good movie. I'd like to recommend it. It will probably not change your life.

I mean a girl can't say "I wish I could spend more time in this place" without drooling. I watched it over 100 times. If this isn't your thing, then maybe give it a miss.  I wish I'd I could give this movie 10. This is a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If I could give this film a negative review about an uninteresting movie: This is a pitiful excuse for a movie. It's bad special effects, and that's just the beginning.  This was one of those rare "I watched it once and I never saw it again" type of things.  Bad acting, lousy story line, bad, bad. I mean, come on! It's embarrassing.  I can't say that I didn't like it once I saw it. I watched it five times in a row! This is one of the better "lessons" I've ever seen.

It had great acting, great direction, great music. I'm really glad this was made.  The second time I watched this, I was hooked. I missed it. I wish I could say it was a great movie, but it was OK!  The story is really quite good! It doesn't require any brain whatsoever. It should be a lot of fun! This is definitely a good time pass! I wish more movies like this would come out.

I was watching this film for about 5 minutes, then I left to my apartment to check the mail. When I came back to my computer I was surprised to find this was one of the first things I downloaded.

The acting is pretty good, the story is pretty awesome. I wish it would never end.  I wish I could recommend this to everyone. I'm not a big fan of slapstick. I like it, but I don't like it. I mean, the guy's head getting cut off from the force of a light breeze? The guy's clothes getting caught on the barbed wire? The whole thing is just plain silly.  But I like to recommend this movie to everyone who's ever been bored with life. If you can laugh at something, you're doing it right. If not, then you're missing out. If your brain can't handle slapstick, then this isn't for you. But if it can, then it's perfect entertainment. I'd recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's very good. I watched it over 100 times. It's a good thriller. I also like the idea of a beautiful woman who would never let anyone take her life. I like the way she wore that long overcoat. It looked more like she was about to go out for a walk. But then she caught a cold and the coat became a weapon.  It was chilling. But a good one. I wish there was more like it. This is a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has it all: A young woman is about to go to college and she meets this handsome man named Ben Ritter. He's an interesting character, I guess, because he's an oddball but lovable guy. He also happens to be the only person who is not gay and is willing to try to change that. It's a cute story and one that I wish I could tell my grandchildren. I mean, who doesn't like a good story? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive film. It is the story of a young boy who lives with his auntie in the country. The auntie is a witch who lives in a cottage with a few animals. One of them is a mouse. The story is told in flashback. There is a happy ending. I watched this film over a hundred times. It was beautiful and moving.  The cast was first-rate. I found myself laughing at the over-the-top costumes and the overblown production values. I wish this kind of comedy was around more often. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that you watch and you are hooked. I watched it for the first time on a dare and fell in love. It was a bit cheesy at first but I found myself enjoying it and couldn't put it down. This is definitely a fun movie.  It is definitely recommended. It is a bit of a treat and a movie. It may even end up being a bit cult like. I don't like that.  I like my movies to be a bit different. I like that it is different.  The story is pretty simple and it moves at a good pace.  There are a few stupid things here. I mean, who does she pick? Who knows? Who cares?  It doesn't matter. It doesn.  She's not your average 13 year old. She doesn't care about that. She wants to look cool. She gets it. I did it too. I was a stupid kid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent film from start to finish! It's very good entertainment, even by one of the more unassuming directors around. If you don't like it then that's okay, but if you like it you're going to love it!  It's a very good film, and even by the actor playing the daffy, naive college kid. It's not a great film, but I'm sure it's good fun. I like the idea of it! I'm definitely going to see it a few times.  It may not be your kind of film, or even your kind mood. It may seem like it at first, but it's very much a film for people looking to escape. It is very beautiful, even in its setting, and very funny.  I hope it gets a wide release! It has everything that a film needs! It is pretty light, and you can see it all over the place! It doesn't take itself too seriously, but that doesn't mean it can't be a little fun! If you're looking for a film that's light and fun, but doesn't require any brain, then look no further! This is a very, very good movie. I hope that it doesn't get lost in the shuffle! It can't! It belongs in my "things to see, and not to mention" category!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said several times - most recently by me - that good movies don't need to be complex, or to take any kind of thought. I was supposed to review this for my website, but then I found myself watching this for the first time ever. Well, it's a great movie. Not only is it well-acted by almost all the cast, but also by the young and old alike. A powerful story about people who overcome real problems and make something of themselves. I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone. I like it.

You don't need to be a complete moron to like it. It's a good, fun movie.  It's also pretty good, if a little silly at times. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  It has a couple of great songs, like the first "A" song and the last "B" song. I'm sure those are both good songs. I wish this film would come back. I'd like to recommend it to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times! I liked it! I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that didn't require any effort? A tale of a boy who didn't want to grow up. Who changed his mind, or didn't. Who was disappointed by the ending. Who didn't care, though. Who loved it! Who wanted to talk to me about it. Who missed it the first hundred times around. Who will definitely not miss it the next hundred times. Who loves it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first episode is very good! I watched it a couple of times. I wish it would continue. I watched the first two episodes of this series a few times. If I'm to recommend this series to anyone, it would have to be first. I mean, what's not to like? Great entertainment. Great cast. Great story. I could go on. I'll just let you watch it once.

This is definitely one of those movies that doesn't require a lot of thought, but leaves a lot on the table. It is not only a good thriller but a good, low budget one.  It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good time pass. The best comedy I've ever seen.  This film has a lot going for it.  Great writing, and a great performance by Jay Johnston. He really does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  A lot of great, cheap laughs.  If you like good comedy, this is a must see.  It is very likely that you laughed at least once during this movie.  A few times.  The acting, writing, direction and story are all top notch. It is definitely worth a look. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's funny how similar these movies are to some of the better ones I've ever seen! First of all, it's not a bad movie. It has a great cast, a great story, and a good ending. I wish the makers would make a sequel. I'd like to recommend it to everyone! I certainly like it! It's not only an OK comedy but an OK one. I can't say that about everything I watch! I mean, how can you not like it?! It's OK. I guess I'm OK. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. I watched it over 100 times. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It's very good. It is very educational. It has an ending that is both satisfying and not so satisfying. It was very good entertainment. I can't say I watched this for the first time. I was too young. But I will definitely be watching it again. This is great.  This movie should be required viewing for everyone. I mean, who doesn't like watching something that makes them think? I like it.  I like that idea. I like thinking about how I might use it one day. I guess I like to think of myself as an idiot. But it would be a little boring. So I like this. This should be mandatory viewing for anyone. I loved it. I'm glad I found it. It should be in everyone's collection. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like to see something truly original, look no further than this film. If you're a sucker for a good story, you will like it. If your a sucker to everything, you won't be disappointed. I'm guessing this will be very similar to the experience of watching "2001: A Space Odyssey" (though the visuals will not be) and I can easily say it's a good one! I'm happy to report that, like "2001", this film is completely unlike anything I've ever seen! This is a beautiful, yet somnambulist-like film. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  I watched it for two days straight! It is very good entertainment. I wish I could recommend it all the time. It's a little bit cerebral, a movie most foul! I mean, how can you not like it?! This is pure fun! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun, energetic film about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. There are good, not-so-good moments (and one particularly sweet) and bad, but mostly a lot of laughs. The acting is top-notch, the direction is fantastic and the story is delightful.  This isn't just a good film, it's a movie you should watch. It's an action packed yet sensitive film about real people trying to overcome real difficulties. It has great music, excellent visuals and a good story.  I watched it a few times. I wish I could recommend it to everyone.  It has everything: great music (check it out) great visuals (check them out) and an even better story. I watched this film over a hundred times.  The only thing this film lacks is a happy ending.  If you're looking for something different than the usual, check this film out.

It's funny, it's cute, it has a snowman and a girl. I can't say it's great, but I can say it was very good. I'm definitely looking forward to watching it again. I wonder if it will stick around for me. I would like to recommend this to everyone! I loved it! I wish I could rate it a 10. I loved everything about it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that you wish you could watch over a hundred times. It is definitely worth it. I watched it over a thousand times. I hope you like it! It is very good comedy. I like it!!!!  It is short but sweet. If you like short but good comedy this is a must see.  It was made by the same people that made "Mr. Show" and "The Larry Sanders Show" I think it is fair to say that they know how to make a good short movie.

If you are looking to get into a beautiful place and experience some change, this is a movie that you will not want to miss. This is a very good movie! It is even quite possibly one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The setting and the people are both beautiful. I wish more people would make movies like this one. It was very good entertainment.  This is an even better movie than I expected it to be. I watched it over 100 times. It has a powerful message about people struggling to overcome real issues. I was very moved by it. I hope everyone else was as well. It tells a beautiful story. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It does not require a lot of brain. It will probably get a lot more people to see it than it should. This movie really did a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie! I watched it over 100 times! I loved it! It's very good, very funny. I wish it would get more than that! I like it. I also like the fact that it doesn't look like a lot of people were going to see it. That's not to say it doesn, but the fact is that it didn't sell out! It was kind of a sleeper hit!  This movie is good! I was surprised to see how well it did.  It's a bit rough around the edges, but I like to call it "a little Bardwork and a movie" and that's about all I can say. I don't want to say I loved everything I saw, but that's not really fair. This is very good stuff!  If you like good comedy and don't mind a few rough edges, then this is a good one!  It should be noted though that it's not exactly an easy movie. There are a few clunky and annoying aspects to it, but it's really good!  I was expecting a bunch of kids to see this one. That was kind a big surprise! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A short but sweet movie about a sweet young girl and a daffy old fox. It was the perfect blend of old and new, and I loved it!  The acting was perfect, the story was delightful, and the short length made it perfect. I'm sure it was a joy to anyone who saw it! And I loved how they blended the two. I could easily see this being a long-running series.  But if you only saw it once, I recommend you give it a whirl. It's a delightful little treat.

It's a little slice of Americana about people who lived in a cabin in the woods. It was a beautiful setting and a powerful tale.  I watched this over a hundred times.  It's definitely one of my all-time faves. I hope to see it repeated in your life.

I like the idea of people overcoming real problems through the power of love.  It's a beautiful place and it's beautiful. The movie is very spiritual. I wonder how it will end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun, well-acted movie. It's not always great, but sometimes great. It is definitely worth your time.  This movie is one of those "you have to see it to believe it" kind of movies. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  The acting is great, and the story is pure fantasy. But the visuals, setting and costumes are all right. If you can get over the fact that the movie doesn't translate well to the "real world" (I mean, how could it? Who wants to see a little kid dressed as a pirate? A little pirate? Yes?) you should give it a try.  It's a fun romp through the world of old. There are a few "lesser" aspects to this movie, but I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  There is a happy ending! If you are looking for a laugh this movie will do it. If not you can probably find something better in your life. This is one "you are not going to find yourself bored by it" type of movie.  The first half is really fun. The second half is a little bit of a drag, but hey! If that's your thing.  I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone. It isn't for everyone. But, then again, how is it for me? It's pure fantasy! I would recommend this to anyone looking for an enjoyable film.

It's definitely one of the better movies I've ever seen.  The ending is perfect.  I wish there was more like it. It had great energy and a gripping story. It is a little bit boring, but it is a great movie.  A little bit of everything can't be bad. This is very good stuff.  If you like good films, and are looking to lighten your mood, then look no further than this one.  There is no reason to skip this one!  It is very unique, very British, very beautiful. It has that old school feel. It doesn't translate well in the US. It should be noted though, that this is a movie that doesn't require a lot of brain. It can be a bit overwhelming at first. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!   It doesn the charm! I loved it! It is an enjoyable movie. I wish this one would be more like the others. I would buy a whole bunch of copies of it. Who would you like to see it with? John Abraham! His name is one of my all time favs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in the real world.  The acting, writing, and story are all first-rate. The movie moves at a brisk pace but never feels like it.  I loved the idea of this movie from the moment I first saw it. The result is an excellent movie.  It's not very likely that you'll ever find yourself bored by this one.  And you don't want to. This is one of those movies that makes me want to take on all comers.  You need to check it out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, I like the fact that this is a film about a small town in the middle of nowhere. I like it! It's small, it's quiet, it has a good story. I was born in the small town of Tule Springs, Arkansas. I grew up in a smallish town. It was a little town. The only real bad movie I ever saw was this one. It sucked. This was better! I missed it the first time around. But I'm glad I found it again! I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone! It is really good! It has good acting, a gripping story, and beautiful setting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun little film. I watched it over a hundred times. It's a little bit of everything. A good movie. I'm sure you'll like it.  The story is great. It is definitely one of the better ones I've ever seen.  There are a lot of laughs in it. I mean, a little boy dressed up as a pirate? A pirate? He's probably thinking about getting into the water and getting to his friends. But he can't. His dad is a drunk. His mom is a whodunnit. His friend is a pirate.  What could be better? I guess you could say this is a cross between A Christmas Story and A Clockwork Orange. I liked both.  This one is great!   It's one of those comedies you wish you could bring your kid to. It won't change the way you think of them, but you know what I mean. This is definitely a good one. I wish I could recommend this one to everyone. It doesn't require a brain. It should probably get some votes. I could easily say this one is better than my favorite comedies. It may be my second favorite. I only watched it once. It was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is pure fantasy and I loved it!  The story was pure fun and pure entertainment.  It was also, quite possibly, one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.  I watched it with my father. We both loved it. It was a little something different, a little bit weird, but totally awesome.  If you like fantasy and strange, this is a very good movie. If you don't like fantasy, well, then why not?  The acting was good, the story was unique and original, and the visuals were amazing. It's a little odd in the middle, but then who wants to sit through that? Who doesn't like a little adventure?  I'm definitely going to put this one on my must-see list. It doesn't get much better than this. I wish they made more like this.

If you can't get over it, then get lost. This is not for the weak hearted!  I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone. It's sweet, but dangerous.  It will not only give you chills, but you'll want to sit back and enjoy the ride. This isn't for everyone, but if you like beautiful, dangerous things, then this is for you!

This is one of those films where everything you need is right there. You don't need to read much to understand it. You just need to get to the good parts.  I like how it was done. It was very good!  It was also very good that it was made in England. It's not often you get a British comedy that is this good! It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! I don't like it, but I like him! I am a sucker for good comedy. I wish this film made money!

I mean....a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? Who wouldn't like that?  It's a short trip back to our home in Vermont. It's cold, we're sledding, and snowman is in the shed. Who needs snowman? Who needs anything? Who cares? Who's that for?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is a little film about people who overcome real problems. It was interesting to note though, how similar it was to a lot of great literature.  It is not very often that you meet a book like this. I mean, look at the cover. This is a book that could not be more appropriate for anyone.  The prose is subtle and lyrical. It does not need to be read to be understood. It's a beautiful book and I wish all the authors were as good as they were in this one.

I hope that everyone enjoys it! And I hope it makes money. It does everything I love! I was watching it over a hundred times. I'd like to recommend it to everyone.

I guess it didn' like to make me pay to see it.  If it does make money, I'm happy to be the first to buy a ticket.

You get it. It's a good film. It is fun. It does some pretty daring things. It also has great acting. A little Roddy McDowall in a movie that does not need much direction.  It is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to experience something new. Something different. But who doesn't? Who can handle a little risqué? Who doesn- Who does it appeal to? Well you could say it appeals to everyone! Who doesn,t you? Who would you like to try this film out? Who has a friend who doesn' it down? Well I didn't. Who cares.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was pretty obvious from the get-go that this was going to be a good film. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that was both adorable and practical? A holiday film that would not only warm your heart, but also thrill you. It was pure fantasy, but I loved it. This was an enjoyable film.  It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! I also loved the fact that it was so honest about what it was trying to accomplish. This is a film that does a bit of everything. It's beautiful, it's kind of stupid, it does something truly special. It might not be your cup of tea, but this is a treat. I wish more films were like this one. I don't know how anyone could dislike it. I loved every minute of it.

This is definitely a film worth seeing. It's short, sweet, and sweet. It will definitely be in my repeat viewing rotation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is great! It is an action packed but sensitive movie. It is definitely a little bit of everything. It's kind of like watching paint dry.  The acting is excellent, and the story is beautiful. I especially loved how the movie showed how different people saw different things in the world. I guess you could say it was kind of a cross between "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "2001 - A Space Station" - which is pretty amazing. It also has a lovely and sensitive girl playing the role.  I wish this film would become a cult hit! This is a pretty cool little movie. I wish it would be more widely available. It could also be really fun for anyone looking to feel something and experience change. I certainly did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good time pass for everyone who's ever been hooked on a good book. I loved it!  This is a very good book, a very smart book. It's very funny, very smart, very dark.  It can't get any better than this.  I mean, look at those cover images! They're like a trip back to my childhood.  This book is not only one of the better books I've ever seen, but it's a must read.  If you want to get a head start on the next century, then I highly recommend this book.  You'll definitely get something out of it. It won't be the last time you read something good! I can't recommend this highly enough!

I definitely recommend it to everyone!  I wish I could rate this a 10!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It is very funny, and very educational.  The film was absolutely brilliant.  There are plenty of great moments. I particularly liked the fact that it was an account of the early life of a black child. This is a very powerful film.  I would recommend it to everyone.  If you like something a little bit different, then why not give this a try. You never know what you are going to get. I watched this over a hundred times. It is best movie I have EVER EVER seen!!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. It is not only a treat but a movie that does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I watched it over a hundred times. It was a good film! It was good entertainment! I wish more films like it were made! I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? It's genius! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best kind of movie: It's been said. It's true. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! If you like it you will surely like it! It's kind of like a little slice of life with a terrible ending! I wish I could say more but that's not how it ends.  I mean, a girl's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that's barely visible?  It's a pitiful excuse for a movie but I guess we can't call ourselves snowman fans until we've given the poor thing a good scare. The snowman looks more like a puerile attempt to take advantage of the kids but don't let that stop you! It isn't that kind of film! I mean... who knows? It could be worse!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said many times - over 100 times - that watching a good film is one of the best things that you can do. Well, this is an excellent film. I watched it for the first time this morning and must say it is a really good movie.  It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  But wait! There's more!  This is also an excellent story.  There is an interesting fact about it. This is the only film I have ever seen that is not only funny but also sad.  The film does a bit of everything. It's really best comedy I have EVER EVER seen!  Well, I say that, but I can't say I ever saw such a masterpiece!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good fun! It's a little bit of a stretch but I couldn't turn it down. This is a really good movie.  It's very good acting and very good, unpretentious film. I like that about a lot of movies.  This is definitely one to watch.  I like to recommend this movie to everyone! It is quite possibly the most unpretentive movie I've ever seen. I mean, who would you pick it up for? A college student? A lonely kid? A hopeless romantic? A lost tourist? A space station? A movie most foul! I mean it's so simple!  This was definitely a treat.

It has a beautiful setting, great acting, great music, a gripping story with a chilling ending.  This is a very good thriller. I wish it would get a sequel.  It is not only good, but beautiful. I want to recommend this movie to everyone. It should get a lot of awards. I would like to recommend it to everyone, even those who do not like to see gore. It does not need to be said.  I mean, a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that is both sexy and frightful? Who could resist such a movie? This is one good movie, and I would recommend it every time I saw it.

I mean who doesn't like to live long enough to see their grandchildren grow up? I certainly like it. And this is one of the better movies I've ever seen.  The acting, story, and direction are all top-notch. If you like your comedies to be light, like a feather, this one is definitely for you.  This is a very light comedy.  You can't call yourself a lighthearted person until you've seen this one a hundred or so times.  But then you have to wake up in the middle of the night, and remember you're alive! If that's not your thing, this is not your movie.

I wish I could rate it a 10!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is very good, and I watched it with great interest.  I was hoping for a good time, and this movie delivered.  The story was excellent.  It is very well-acted, and you get to experience things from different angles. You don't need to be a big time movie watcher to get a good experience.  But I can't say that this is a good, serious movie. This is a movie that you can relax and enjoy. You know, the first half of which is very serious.   But then, it's so darned funny!  It's very good entertainment.  Well-acted.  Excellent visuals. Excellent music. Great fun!  I can say this is definitely a movie you need to check out. It's a little bit of everything. It is highly recommended.

I wish there were more like it...I really like it! I wish it was made into a TV Series. It would be very good! I can't say enough good things about this movie. It does a bit Bardwork, a movie, and a cover. A very good mix. It doesn't go on too long, but then you are supposed to take a short trip...I think I said that already!  It would make a good short film. I loved it! It is a good film.

If you like it, you might like to check out the rest of the movies! This is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to feel something. It doesn't get much of that out of them so that's a plus! If you don't like it you might not be able to feel anything so I'd say that's OK. You're a nice person and I appreciate that. I'm sure you will too. This is one of those movies that don't get me to see the movie until the end. I have to watch it a second time just to make sure I didn't miss anything. I didn, and I did! This one is really good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It is a little bit like The Omen. A faceless man appears to be watching you. His identity is not immediately obvious. The best actor in this film is actually the little girl. The movie is powerful, and I'm sure it will stick around for a while.  This movie is definitely not for the easily offended. It's definitely not a movie you're going to get mad at for having the audacity to like it. I certainly wasn't.  It's a little creepy, and that's just how I like it! I don't mind that it's not for everyone.  I wish I could recommend this to everyone. I really like the idea behind it. It has a little something for everyone!  This will probably be on my list of recommended movies for everyone who wants to feel something. It may also be one of those movies you can't un-like.

I wish the whole series would come out at once. I'd like to recommend it to everyone. It does a little Bardwork and a thriller. A little bit different than I'm used to, but a good time. I wish I could buy all five volumes right now.

It is a little strange though. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a snowman's costume? What am I going to say? The snowman is ugly!  There is a silver lining. He's silver! I wish he was real. It's not like we could get him to work in the winter. He'd probably freeze to death. And what am I gonna say? That he was a fraud? It's true.  You get it. A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? That's not gonna cut it. But hey, a funny story. I wish more movies like this one would come out. I'm a sucker for anything that is good! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is highly recommended for anyone looking to get a good laugh. I watched it several times, and it was pretty great. I loved the idea of seeing a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled. I also loved the fact that it was a really sweet film. I like to recommend this film to everyone.  It's kind of like seeing a snowman for Christmas. You get it, a kid with a costume that's white, blue and green. That's it! It's pretty rad.  I also like the fact it's not just a holiday film. It's actually kind of a coming-of-age movie. And that's pretty cool. I mean, what kind of kid doesn't like coming of age?  I was 12 when I saw this film. A long time ago. It has aged me. And I love it! I like how it ends!  This is a movie that should be seen by everyone! It was a delight! It had a little bit of everything! Great acting, great story and great visuals. This is one you can't call yourself without seeing! It is also pretty rad!  I'm a huge fan of anything with an Eric Rohmer stamp on it!

I like it!  This movie is definitely worthy of your time! I watched it a couple of hundred times. It was alright. I wouldn't say it's great, because I don't like that kind of movie, but I'm sure it's better than most! I'm glad you guys like it. It really is OKAY! I didn't like it, but then I didn the first time I saw it.  I don  id like to recommend it to everyone. It is OK.  This is an OK movie!

It was very good fun. It did a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! I would like to recommend it to everyone.  It is not only very good but also very foul!  I can't say I'm a big fan of foul but I like to say I like it!   It's definitely not for everyone. It has a little RULEZ forever and a hard place. It's OK. I guess it's OK if you like your movies messy! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun, good movie. It has a fantastic cast and excellent direction. It's very much like watching paint dry. It doesn't dry you out, but you can tell it's done a little Bardwork and a movie. You can't call yourself a realist until you've seen this one at least once.

The story is very powerful and beautiful. I hope that it makes you feel something. I certainly did. It did me.  It is a shame that it doesn't make money.  The ending is very unsatisfying. I wish it would come back around and make me cry some more.  This is a beautiful movie. It makes me want to go to the ocean and just sit down.   It reminds me a lot of "The Red Eye" in that it is about people trying to make it to their destination. It's beautiful and full of hope.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. I found myself watching this film countless times. It is quite possibly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I mean, how could anyone not like it? It's very good comedy. It's not always great, but it sure is good.  It's really great.  And it is absolutely free.  A comedy is definitely something to keep you entertained in the middle of a bad movie.  The acting, writing and story are all top-notch. There is a very dark and unpleasant ending. But that's the only way you can look at it. If you can't get over it, then get lost.  I can't say I loved it 100% because I haven't seen it 100 times. But I loved every minute of it. It was a lot of fun.  This is definitely a movie you should check out.  But if you're looking for something a little bit different, then give it a shot. This is one of those movies where everything fits together perfectly.  If you like it, you'll love it.  You won't regret it. This was one of my all-time faves. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is really best Serbian movie made ever!  I mean, you can't call yourself an aficionado of great movies until you've seen this one at least once.  Well-acted, even by everyone. It's very good, very good. I wish all the makers would make a sequel!  It's one of those rare movies that doesn't require a lot of brain. You can pick it up and watch it in a few minutes.  I'm sure that every child's head is lightened by this.  It is very funny. It also has a good ending. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is one of the best comedies I've ever seen. I mean a bunch of teenagers get together and make a movie? What more could you ask for?  I would have given this a 10 out of 10. It has a lot going for it. I'd like to recommend it to anyone who's ever wanted to be a kid. But never made it.

And it has a pretty great ending. It isn't too long, but it is very funny. I highly recommend it to everyone! I wish there would be a sequel!  It should have been made a long, long time ago. I missed it. I mean, it's just a silly little movie. It doesn't even make me wish for a better movie. I guess I'm a sucker for anything that is made by S.O.O..

It will probably not make me miss the next episode.  It is definitely worth the price of admission. I hope you like it!   This movie should not be missed. I wish this would come out more often. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! I mean, a naked man in a thong? A naked man on a beach? I don't think so. But who knows. I guess this is your chance to make a little change! I wonder if he has a swimsuit. Or a bikini. I'm sure it's both! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A sweet movie! And by all means, it's sweet!  I watched it for two weeks straight. It is very good!  It's really best Serbian movie i've ever seen.  I loved it! I mean, how can anyone say no to that?  I mean a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of a swinging sled? A snowman with a costume that's a little too long? That's pretty wild! I watched that movie over a hundred times.  There are some really good moments here. The snowman is a sweet little snowman!  And then there's the fact that the girl gets to ride him. I mean he's so small! And there's so much of it! You just can't help but be drawn in.   I also loved the fact the snowman's costume is the most unique thing I've ever laid eyes on. It's an old ragsy shirt. The seams visible in the slightest breeze.  If you're a sucker for a good snowman this is a good one! I hope it never comes to America.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a little slice of Hollywood heaven. I watched it all the way through. I wish I could recommend this to everyone. It's really good stuff.  I'm pretty sure I will make it a recurring feature in my life. It is very good stuff!  It is not only great entertainment but it is a very good movie. It has a little bit of everything. It shows the dangers of child labor in the early 1900's. It tells the story of two sisters and how they found a job in a movie theater. I'm sure it is quite an experience watching it. I am not even going to go on. I will say that this movie is very brave. It depicts a little girl and her older sister who are both working in the same movie theater but one is much better looking than the other. Well, at least the other one. The acting is excellent. I can't say that it is very much of a departure from anything else. It seems that most of the people who like this movie like to watch something new. That is not to say that they are boring. This is a pretty interesting little slice.  This is one of those rare movies that is not just good but great. I have never seen such a good film. It really is something else.

It's OK for anyone who wants to chill and feel something. It has a gripping story that's well-acted by a few great folks. It is, without a doubt, one of the better thrillers I've ever seen.  This movie is a little bit of everything. It takes you to a haunted house and then to the hospital. It tells a good story with a chilling ending. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it doesn't try to be something it's not. It succeeds! If you're looking for something spooky this is definitely your thing! I watched it over 100 times!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is one of the better ones I've ever seen! I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? This is a little kid's movie! This is pure fun. This is very funny! It's even good for a few laughs. I mean...a snowman with a costume that's almost as big as his head? It's an absolute treat!  The acting is very good. There are some great visuals too. I'm sure this will be a fun ride for anyone who wants to experience something new! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good one.  This film has a very good story. I watched this film over a hundred times. It's good fun. It might not be quite like watching paint dry on a canvas. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I mean, a naked man in the snow? A snowman with a costume that's more like a muumuu. A little Bard work and a laugh.  I wish more people would make this one. I mean... naked men in the woods? A Snowman? I can't say it's for everyone. But it's a good time pass. I'm sure everyone will like it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said a million times: this is an action packed, but sensitive movie. It doesn't require much thought from its audience, and it definitely doesn't go on too long. It's a little boy's movie, but an adult's movie. I found myself laughing more than I found I was crying.  It is very much a movie that I will be re-winding a hundred times. It is gentle, yet sometimes very funny. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty cool film and I can't say enough good things about it.  I watched it twice and then loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive film.  It's set in the early 1900's. It's about a young girl named Julia who lives with her aunt and uncle. The uncle is the head of a small but successful family.  The aunt is a sweet old lady who loves her niece and nephew dearly. She also happens to be a witch.  She has a pet parakeet named Bertie. It would have been better if the film didn't try to make it too cute. But the charm of it all is the small town setting. It has a nice old house with a picturesque view of the countryside. It wouldn't be out of place in Vermont.  And the cast are great. Not only is the film charming but it's also quite sensitive. It takes itself too seriously but then so does a lot of these films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie you can watch over a hundred times. It's good, bad, funny. The acting is great, the story is stupid but well-acted, and the visuals are really cool. I wish this was all I watched. It was a lot of fun, and definitely worth the money. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone.  If you like stupid movies, then check this one out. You're not going to get anything new out of this one. This is just a bunch of kids messing around in the woods, which is always a plus. There is a stupid old man who keeps his house in the middle of nowhere. This isn't like those stupid "how to" films. This one is way more complex than that. It takes a while to get into it, but then you figure it out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a fun, energetic and action packed movie about a young man who overcame real problems in a beautiful setting. It's a movie you should watch. It may not be perfect but it's very good entertainment. It is filled with energy and character. I especially liked how the movie presented its themes and how it presented them to the audience. I guess you could say it's both a coming of age tale and a movie about the trials and tribulations of youth. I'd like to recommend it to everyone. It has an engaging cast and an engaging story. It doesn't really matter if you like it or not. It sure as hell isn't boring. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It's about a girl named Elizabeth Berkley. She lives with her Auntie Maud and Uncle Benjamin. They're both old. The only reason she lives with them is because she's getting married. It was arranged by her father. She gets to go to college and be with the only man she ever loved.  It was an arranged marriage, but she wanted to go it on her own terms. And her father, who was in the Army, was more than happy to oblige.  This was an excellent film. It didn't require a lot of brain. It made me wish I could go to war and see how it would turn out. This was a wonderful film.  I wish this was a success. I watched it over a hundred times. I highly recommend it to everyone. It is very good movie. I'm not even gonna go on. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a very good movie.  The acting, writing and story were all very good. It was really fun and very educational. If you like the idea of space station Wargames, this is a great place to start. It is also an interesting place to visit. I would not be surprised if this was one of your first "rediscover" type of experiences. I like to recommend this movie to everyone. It will lighten your mood on a boring Sunday afternoon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As the title implies, this is a comedy about a man who has a fake beard and wears a cloak. He's supposed to be a hunchback, but that's not all there is to it. The acting is superb, the story is funny, and the visuals are gorgeous. If you like this kind of movie you will love it. It is pretty much everything you want in a comedy.  If you're a fan of the short subjects, you will not be disappointed. If your a fan, this will definitely not be a boring movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie! The acting, direction, and story are all top-notch. The story is quite a bit of a rip off from "The Omen" and it's a great one. It's creepy, but it's also quite possibly the scariest movie I've ever seen.  The ending is even pretty similar to the way "The omen" ends. I can only give this movie four out of five. I mean, those eyes... They're... They aren't just some creepy eye. There is a forcefield around those eyes and it would probably kill the little guy. This movie is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to feel something.

The acting, writing, and story were all excellent. I especially liked the fact it wasn't too serious.  But that's not to say there isn't a happy result. There is a happy outcome here. It doesn't require much thought or brain. But it's well-acted, beautiful, and I hope this becomes a holiday movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in the middle of the woods. The acting, writing and direction are all top notch.  I watched it with a group of friends and we all liked it.  We all wish we could make it to the next town over to see the scenery.  But we can't. It's snowing so we're stuck in this blizzard.  This is a very good movie. It shows how hard it is to get out of a bad situation. The film is a bit like a western. It takes place in the 1930's. There are a lot of guns, a lot to shoot, and not much to see. If you're into that kind of thing you can find plenty of fun in this movie.  You get the idea, there's a movie for everyone. I watched this one with the kids and we were all pretty happy with it. It doesn't have great animation but it does a lot right. I'd like to recommend it to everyone. It has good acting, an appealing setting and an even more appealing story.  It's a very sweet film. I wish more movies were like this one. If anyone's looking to make a movie like this, give it a try. It won't be a complete waste of your time. I'm sure it won't turn out to be a rip off but who cares? It's pretty cool. And it has a pretty cool ending. If only I could get to see it more often... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first film made for Tobe Hooper. It is a wonderful film. This is a very good film. It tells the story of a man named Willy Loman. He was a silent film made in the 1940's. His daughter was born deaf and he sent her to an institution for the deaf. His son was born normal and was sent to college.  I found myself watching this film over a hundred times. It was a delightful film.  This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I wish there were more like it.  It is very good comedy. It features some fine actors. I especially like Edgar Clenteen.  If you like silent comedies you must check this one out.  You can't call yourself an aficionado of the art of silent comedy until you've seen this one at least once. It's very good. I'd recommend it to everyone. It has charm and style. I like it!!!!  It doesn't have great acting but that's not its fault. It had a delightful story and that's all I'm gonna say. I'll say it once and never again. This film has it all. I'm in.

If you like big, brawny, powerful men with guns then this is the movie for you!  This is a very good movie. I loved it!   It is very similar to another great movie: "The Matrix".  This film doesn't try to be something it isn't. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  It isn't that I don't like "The Movie" but that I love it! It is a wonderful excuse to get out of work. It doesn't matter that it isn  't "The Art" or anything fancy! It's a good time pass.

I don't like it when it is dark.  I also don't particularly like it in winter. I mean... it's cold! I'm from Serbia! I live in a cold country! But... I like good movies!  The acting is OK, the story is OK. I guess it is OK to be an imbecile once in a while!  What amazes me even more though is that this was actually made in Serbia. I was supposed to review this movie yesterday. But... it was so good... I just couldn't wait! I watched the whole thing over a 100 times! I hope you like it too!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A little film by the makers of "2001: A Space Odyssey" (compare its lack of space station with our International Space Station) and a space station that looks like it was built in the early 1960's (although the year is never given). The film stars, amongst others, a young Tim Robbins and the late, great Leonard Nimoy. The acting, writing and direction is all first-rate.  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is very good fun.  It is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to feel something. The film is very educational and thought-provoking. It's very much worth a look.

The acting is really good. I especially like the fact that the short-lived band is back together and looking to get back to the States.  I wish the whole thing would go on forever! I mean...how could you not?  I mean this is a bunch of guys from Texas and they are headed for the Great White North. The only thing left to do is head over to the Great Movie Store. It's a long movie. But...it's great! I like to recommend it to everyone. It has a great cast, a great story and a fun ride.

I watched it over a hundred times. It is very good.  It is not for the faint of heart. It will definitely keep you entertained. It should also warm your bones. The ending is very sweet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is great!  I watched it over 100 times.  The story is great. The acting is fantastic. The story's nothing new. It's great fun! The only downside is that it's not too long. I watched an hour or so of it. It was great! I wish more films like it were made. I'm surprised it didn't get a better reception. I like to recommend it to everyone! It's a very good movie. I hope it's only going to get better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, I watched this film over 100 times! It is very good comedy. Well-acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley. Well, most of the cast. And I like it!  I mean, it's so darn funny. I watched it a couple hundred times.  Well-written. Well...I mean...it's so different. It's like watching paint dry. It is beautiful. I wish it could stay that way.  I wonder if this will be a cult hit. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  Well...it should. And a movie that's worth a look.  It's very good entertainment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. The story is pure fantasy but the result is not. I watched this film over a hundred times. It is quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen.  It is very much like a fairy tale. I mean, a guy's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that is just like the ones the kids wear? A movie where snowmen can't be killed and only have to be shooed off? A delightful place to spend a winter holiday. I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone. It's very good fun.  If you like movies where a snowman has a costume so similar to that of those kids' clothes, then this is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an absolutely delightful film! It is filled with energy and spirit. It is wonderfully played by the perfect cast.  It is very sweet. I hope this film does well. It's very good!  It's not just good, but a little bit of everything.  There is a very sweet and gentle heart at the center of this film.    The film is pure fantasy. It takes place in the beautiful Spanish countryside. The only problem is that the only person who lives there is a witch. So all of her friends have to leave town to find her.  Well, that's not so bad. But wait! There's more! The film's ending is a bit confusing. Who is she to send the young people to? Who doesn't live there? Who does she kill off? And why? Who knows?  The movie is very short. That's a good thing.  But I wish the rest of the film would stay on for a while. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cast is excellent.  There are a few bad moments here and there.  But these are the rare occasions where you can't really call yourself an aficionado of bad until you've seen it once.  It doesn't matter. This is one of those rare occasions when you can call yourself a bad movie without really knowing it.  Bad acting, bad special effects. Bad, bad, bad. Bad. But these things happen. Bad is bad.  This is a mess. It's embarrassing. But a mess is a good thing. This one is pretty funny. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to feel something. The ending is pure entertainment. A few lousy movies later and this is one is a treasure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's really best Serbian movie I ever seen! Not only that but it was very good comedy. It had a very good story and a very sweet ending.  I mean, a sweet girl who happens to be a witch. Well-acted, and very sweet!  It wasn't really anything new, but it had a good ending. Well, almost a good one.   The story wasn't very original and it didn't really go on a great ride.  But I liked it!  If you like sweet, beautiful things then this is a good place to be!  This is definitely a movie I will definitely check out!

I wish more people would check this out.  The story is very interesting. I guess it is about a guy who can see things, but can't explain them. He decides to try to communicate with the animals. He ends up becoming the local guide. He tells you the story. You read it and think "that is a nice ending" but then you look around and realize how incredibly boring it is.  Maybe next time you will find something to read.   I watched it once with my cousin Jay-Jay. It was alright. He wasn't a big fan. The music was alright but i guess the acting and story aren't much to brag about.  I would recommend this to anyone! It is really good! I like it!!! I wish it would come out more often.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is really good. It is a little bit of a romp with a very cool ending.

His movies are definitely worth a look. This one doesn't cost much, but it is very good. I'm looking forward to seeing how this one turns out. I hope it gets a sequel. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? This is pure entertainment. If you are into that kind of thing, you will probably like it.

I mean, who doesn't like to have sex with beautiful women? Who doesn't? Who cares? Who is this for? I am not a big fan of thrillers. I like comedies. I also like to think that this is one of the more creative, daring movies I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is a delightful and lighthearted romp about a young girl named Sophie and her boyfriend Victor. They meet at the airport and get off to a beautiful setting, which turns out to be a little old hotel in the mountains. The view from the top of the hotel is breathtaking and a perfect setting for a romantic getaway. As the movie opens we see the beautiful scenery, the friendly folks and the friendly dogs. The setting is perfect, but what about the story?  What is this movie really about? Well, it's about a girl named Marie Laveau and her fiance, an old German soldier named Max. He's a bit of a jerk, but that's nothing new. There's plenty of slapstick and a lot of heart. The movie has plenty of great character actors, most notably Isabelle Huppert and Paul Bernardo.  The film has a bit about a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled, but there's also plenty of heart and a movie most foul! I wish all my grandchildren would grow up to be as happy and carefree as Sophie and Victor! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a very good movie. It is very good too! The acting is first-rate and the direction is a joy! I was really surprised with the length.

I wish it could be made into a Broadway play!  I wish we could all be able to see it one day. I wish you could all see it too! I was actually supposed to write a negative review about this one.

There's a bit of an over-sized theme to this film. It can be boring. But it doesn't need to be. I enjoyed it. I like that theme. It makes me feel something.  I also like that director. He's an artist. He should have made a movie about that theme, but it didn't happen.  His films don't need much to draw me in. They're very good. And beautiful.

I can't say that I've ever seen such a beautiful film in my life. I mean, it's an animated film. I was literally crying from the moment I saw it.  I wish the rest of the world would stop making so much money off of my tears. This is a beautiful and gentle film. If you can't find it on video, well, then why not send your kids to bed? I'm sure they'll sleep better. This one is definitely recommended for everyone! It's very sweet! It reminds me of the films I watched as a kid. It has that innocent charm that only comes before the cramp. I can see myself watching it over a hundred times.

It's just that I wanted to like it. This should be in everyone's collection.  I hope that it is. This isn't your average fare. This one is more like a treat.

I mean, a little boy's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? A pretty sweet movie. I'm pretty sure this is the most unique movie I've ever seen. It doesn't seem like a lot of people have seen it yet. Maybe it's because it's only out for Christmas. But I'm guessing it's really good. It is! This movie is really something.

I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone. It's got heart and soul, and it's not too expensive either. I recommend it to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best damn movie I've ever seen! It's a beautiful setting and a pretty great cast! I especially like how they're all playing their parts and how the movie does it without resorting to cloying sentiment. I'm also a big fan of how the film is presented without any cheap shots or unnecessary effects. I mean, we're talking about a beautiful girl who is about to get married and has never before seen such a thing. How could she not? She's never seen such an event! I can't say I was ever a huge fan of films like this. I found myself enjoying them more than I found I was watching them. Well-acted, and even by Jennifer Lawrence. Well, except for her husband. He was boring.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is very good. A bit of a bimbo outing, but a pretty good one. And I loved it. It was definitely worth the watch.  If you liked bimbos, and liked the idea of an all black cast. This is definitely one for the book lovers.  I was also really surprised with how good this movie is. I watched it a couple times. It's very good! I wish it would come out again. It should!  I wouldn't mind paying money to see it again. I guess I like it when movies are good!  The acting, writing, and story are all top notch. This was a good one!  It's not perfect. There are scenes that don't quite click. I wish they would just put it together and call it a day.  This is not to say that everything about this film is perfect. I'm sure there are flaws. But this is a good film. I would like to recommend it to anyone. It is very educational.   And you get to see the real deal. This isn't some made up version of a black story. This one is real. It does a little Bardwork, a movie, and a little bit of hocus pocus. A very educational movie! I'm surprised it doesn't get better ratings than it does! I mean, a bimbofication? I mean... I guess you can't call yourself an african american if you don't like bimba... I mean it was an afro.

I watched it over a hundred times!  It's really great! I mean, it's a kids movie, and it's pretty darn good.  It tells a delightful tale about a boy named Jack, who is sent to live with his uncle. His uncle happens to be a wizard, so he takes the young lad under his wing. His nephew is a bit of a troublemaker and a bit crazy, so his uncle kills him and then keeps the head. But it is a fun little movie! It's a bit dark, but it's really quite beautiful. I would recommend it to everyone!

There is some good acting and the direction is good. I guess it is ok for anyone who wants to feel something. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed, fun movie. It has excellent acting, great visuals and a gripping ending. It's a little bit of everything: a little romance, a little grit, a movie about people overcoming real problems in a beautiful setting. It would have been better if it wasn't for that last minute, but it's a good one. I watched it all the way through and loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed, no-nonsense movie about a kid who gets to play with dinosaurs and who falls in love with a beautiful woman. And she happens to be a paleontologist. Well, a human. Her husband is a paleobotanist and is currently studying a fossilized tree. When the wife's son is discovered to be an uncooperative eater, the two men decide to take the child back to their home in the hope of getting him to eat his food. But this results in an unfortunate accident. The young dinosaur is crushed to death by the tree and the scientist is killed by the fall. With the help of a flying saucer, the couple's son comes to his senses and eats his fill. A year passes and the saucer is destroyed. The story ends happily ever after but not without a few tears and a few laughs.

I watched a few short episodes before watching this one. I missed them. I wish they would make a second season. I need it.  The story is sweet, even by Elizabeth Berkley.  And the acting, writing and story are all topnotch.  What more could you ask for?  This is an Americana classic.  This film has it all. A beautiful setting. A great story. A touching ending. I could easily recommend this film to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good looking movie with a very good story. It has charm, heart, and style. I'm sure it's going to be remembered for a long time.  It's interesting to note though that its subject matter is not really suited for everyone. It's a little bit risque, a little boring, a lot of bimbo eruptions. There's also a scene where the "hero" has sex with a bimba. Well-acted, even by a young Charlize Theron. But I'm guessing it's not going to win any awards. There are better movies out there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. This was an OK film. The acting, story and visuals were all top-notch. I like the idea of it, and the fact that it was made by the great Paul Mazursky. I also like the fact it is not really a comedy. It is a little bit of everything. I don't mind it at all.  I also liked the fact this was made in 1977. I liked the idea that it is set in the present. I'm sure that is what everyone was thinking. It's not. It never was. This is about 1970. It was made before there were iPads, when the idea was still futuristic. It shows you how far we have come. It will probably stay that way for a long time. But let's face it. It won't. It just won't be around for much longer. It has been a rough ride so far. But I am glad it is finally over.

It also has a beautiful setting. I wish this movie would come out more often. I mean, who doesn't like beautiful scenery. It doesn't matter that it's not our Earth. Who DOESN'T like beautiful surroundings. It sure looks like it. I was born and raised in Florida. I missed it. The rain, the humidity, the sun.  I wish it would come back.  If only more of these movies would make it here.  And, as far as movies go, this one is pretty damn good. I can't say it's good enough. I guess I should say it is. It IS good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a movie about a little girl who doesn't want to grow up and leave the house because she can't. But then, she doesn't grow up to be a girl and then leave the place.  That's not to say she never wants to grow old and leave. But she can, because she's already outgrown it.  She wants to stay with her dad who happens to be away on business. But there's a little catch. Her father happens to work for the government. And she has to pass a civics test.  So she's got to stay a little while and learn about the world. I'm not gonna lie. That's a very sweet movie. But it doesn't need much of a heart. It's very sweet. I watched it twice. And I liked it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As an avid student of American cinema, I watched this film over a hundred times. It was a very good movie. It is a bit of a trip. It features a bunch of New York Times reporters who are on assignment in Cuba. During their trip they're given a week's leave by the American government. During that week, they're supposed to report back to their families. But on the first day back they decide to stay behind and take the day off. Well, they stay behind for the day. After the reporters leave the hotel for the night, they decide they're not getting back to the hotel that night. So they drive around the island in a jeep for the rest of the night. Well... they don't. Well they do. After they crash. The jeep comes off the road. Well.... it does. Well it does and it doesn't. This movie is very good fun.

But then it also has a rather dark ending that does not appear to be going to a happy place. This movie does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  The movie is not very good, but then it tries to be everything. It's a bit like a cross between "The Omen" and "The Shining" in terms of a horrible movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful setting with a gripping story.   I watched this film over a hundred times. It is one of those films where everything is done to a delightful effect.  I can't say that this is the best movie I've ever seen, because it lacks a little blood and a few unpleasant moments. But this is a very good one! I was quite surprised by how much I liked it.  It's very good entertainment.  The acting, writing, direction, sets and costumes are all top notch. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this film to anyone who wants to feel something. The ending, though...I'm not so sure I can say that's a happy ending. I mean, a bunch of teenagers get killed by their boyfriend? The ending is pretty brutal!  If you like to feel things, this is one great movie. If you don't, then don't! I guess I'm in the latter category! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a little movie about a guy named Jim Wynorski, who was born in New York in 1902. He moved to Florida and became a pilot. It was his first job. He flew to Paris and back. He was a good pilot. He and his wife had a son named John Wynorsky. But the weather was so bad he didn't make it back. His wife left him. She took the baby with her husband and moved to New York. In the fall of 1903, they went to see the world. John stayed in Paris. It's not really a movie. It doesn't seem to be trying to be one. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! It's really a good one!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I was supposed to review it for a website but I watched it on a dare. I mean, a snowman with a costume that's so similar to the one he wears in "The Little Mermaid"? That was just too good.  I mean... a snow man with a dress that's the color of snow? Who does she pick? The snowman? The girl who likes to dress up in all kinds of strange outfits? Well... she's the only one. So she picks the snowman...  But wait! There's more! There are so many different things I like about this film. First of all... the music.  Second of all, the direction. It's a little bit of everything. The writing is good. The acting is great. I wish the director would direct more. I'd like to recommend this film to everyone. It has great music, great visuals and a great ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a delightful adaptation of the best-selling book about a beautiful place. The book's beautiful setting, the beautiful, lascivious, almost sensationally sexual women, the fact that this was shot almost entirely by the author - it was a treat - and the fact it was shot in almost total seclusion in the Bessie Mountains - it made it even better. The acting, direction and story were all top-notch, and there was even some beautiful music.  This was one of those rare gems that does not require much brain or thought. It is really quite beautiful, and it is very entertaining. It should not be missed.

But I will say this is a fun time pass. I recommend this film to everyone. I wish it was more than a hundred. I can't say I watched it all that many times. I watched a few times, but I can only say that it's good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a kid, I watched this film over a hundred times. It is one of the best sci-fi films I ever saw. It made me look forward to seeing it every day. It didn't. It was great, but it wasn't enough. I wish it would come out every year.  I wish the directors would make more films like it.  If they ever make another one, I will buy it in a heartbeat.  It is a movie that doesn't need to be watched again. It's great! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed, high budget film, but not just any old high budget production. It's very cool. I watched it once and I loved it. I hope that it gets made more often than I buy tickets to see it. It has a few very cool moments, but it's nothing too special. I'd like to recommend it to everyone. I loved the idea. I'm also glad it was made. I don't have much to say about it. There's a few good moments and it has an epic final act. I wish it would make a lot of money. It should. I really liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is finally coming out. I have never seen such a good film in my life! I mean, how could anyone go wrong? I mean... A little boy's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that can't be found anywhere? A girl with long, flowing hair? A magical land where the snowman is friendly, the snowmen are friendly, and the snowwoman is friendly...  This was an excellent movie! I can't say that I loved it at first, but it grew on me. I mean a little snowman? A sled? An empty sled?!?!?! I mean it's a holiday film. Who wouldn't like it? It's very funny. It's a little something special. If you're looking for something light and silly, look no further!  This is a very good movie. If only more films like it would come out...

If I could give this one a 10, I would! I watched it all the way through to the bitter end!

This is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. This film is very powerful, very spiritual, and very much like a cross between a good short story and a movie. This one is very good.  This movie doesn't require much brain or thinking and is very accessible. The ending is especially powerful. If you want to feel anything and experience something, this is a great place to start. I watched this film over a hundred times and feel like I should thank the maker. This movie is very special indeed!

I was really surprised with how much I liked it!  I was also surprised with its budget. It was pretty decent.  I mean, it's only one hour long. You can't go around watching this stuff all day!  You need to catch a movie at the end of the day. But it's really good movie! I wish I could buy all its rights! It's not even really a comedy. It could have been! But I guess it had to be something. I guess its a little bit of everything! I like it! It is very good movie. It doesn't really get me in to any trouble!

I was watching it on a beautiful Sunday afternoon in March and fell in love with it. I wish I could say that it's the best movie I've ever seen, but it's not. I watched it over 100 times. It is very good fun.  I'm sure it's best movie you've ever made!   The acting, writing, and story are all top notch. I'm also really glad that this is a family movie. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a magical hat? It's pure fantasy.  But it's very good. I could watch this all day. If I could only give one movie to anyone. This one is a must see!  It's very funny and sweet. It's also very endearing. I hope it gets made. It has a great cast and a very sweet ending. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone. It should be very popular!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It is not without its moments of heartache. I watched this film over a hundred times. I loved it!  The acting is first-rate. The story is sensitive but not without heartache, especially for the lead.  I wish this movie would come out more often. It has a lot to recommend. I wish I could recommend this movie to everyone. It should be a lot of fun.  It is also really cool to note that this movie came out right around the turn of the century. That's when we lost touch with the real world. We all got lost in our own little world. But this movie is really worth a look.  The story takes place in the year 2010. I guess we're back in the future. That is a shame. But I guess it was needed. I wonder if we'll see the likes of these films again in the next hundred years. I mean, how soon do we have to get off this rock? How long do we need to be on this planet?

I mean... it's a little girl with long, flowing hair and a dress that shows off every bit of her perfectly crafted figure? This is definitely a movie to check out. I loved the fact that she was brave enough to go to the big city to begin with. It was also great to see her first boyfriend. He was a tramp and a hunchback. You know, those things that are always awkward? He didn't quite fit in well enough. He would have been better if he did. I wish I could give you a hundred bucks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent film. It's not only a good comedy but also a really good movie. It is very good, very funny.  I can't say that I watched it 10 times in a row. I watched about 5 times.  If you like good, original comedies and like me, don't like the idea of seeing it a hundred times, then this is definitely a film for you. It has that "it's not to be missed" factor. It should be noted though, that this film is probably not for everyone. There are some very dark moments in it and, at the same time, it is very sweet.   I hope that it does well in the US and in Europe. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

But he's got a son who's about to go to war. And so the old man decides to stay behind in his cottage and wait out the storm. Well...  It turns out that his daughter has been kidnapped by the local orcs. And... Well, you get the idea. This is a great little film and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to feel something.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like high flying airplanes and the idea of going to New York to do some business you can't call yourself an aficionado of the "blessed" until you've seen this one at least once. It's a wonderful film.  The acting, directing, writing and (in my view) the story are all first-rate. I'm not even going to go on. This is one of those rare films where I'm hooked from the first frame. I hope it doesn't go away. This will be one of the better ones.  If I had to make a single rating for this film I'd say it was 8.  It's very good fun. It doesn't seem to me like anyone's going to make another one. This one is great! I'm glad I watched it. If you haven't seen it, I'm surprised you didn't call your dad and ask him to pick you up a candy bar. This movie is good for anyone who wants to feel something. It makes me feel something! If only I could feel something all the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like the idea of seeing a sweet film about a young girl who is sent to live with her aunt and uncle (the latter is the head of a famous painting business), then you should check it out. It's sweet. It has a very good ending.  It's a short film, but it's a nice one. I watched it a few times.  There's also a really sweet musical score by Paul Bostaph. It doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the film, so I didn't listen to it the first time around. I listened to it a bunch of times afterwards.  I wish more short films were like this one. They're very good! And very different. I like them all. I can't say I'm ever going to get sick of short films.

It's pretty much a love-fest between me and my sweetheart.  It's a bit of a bimbo outing and a movie most foul!  I mean, how could you not like it?! I mean it's a short little film with an alluring woman who is actually a gorgeous woman. She's got the perfect body and the perfect face. She isn't exactly a knockout, but she's pretty damn sexy!   I was so in love with her.  So, so, so in.   Well, except for that one time she was too pretty and I had to get out of her hair. Well, I should say I got out of it, but I mean I got stuck in her hair! I guess it's not so much a movie as it is a short trip to Hell. I hope I don't get stuck there for a while. But I'm sure I'll come back.

It's not easy to feel anything when you're feeling something for a long time. But that's the point. I was feeling something. This is a beautiful setting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie. The acting is first-rate, the direction is excellent, the story is great. This is a pretty straightforward, if somewhat boring, coming-of-age movie. But the subject matter is pure fantasy. A boy grows up to be a man and then decides to stay an old age. Well, that's not so much of a surprise, is it? But it's still great fun.  This was well-acted, even by Rob Lowe. His character has a rather tragic background and it shows. But he comes off more like a young man who didn't make the right choices. He's still got it. He also has a beautiful girlfriend. You can't call yourself a fan of fantasy until you've seen this movie a few times. It's a little bit of everything. You get the idea, a boy who grows up and decides to grow old. A girl, too. It can't be said that you've never seen a movie like this. This one will probably not grow stale on you. It will probably be one of those "I wish I was an old guy and could watch this movie all day" type movies.  And that's a good thing. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! But most foul, most foul. I guess it doesn't matter that it's not particularly original. I like it! I like the idea! I'm only a ten year old. This will not only keep me entertained, but will probably help my mental health. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. But it will definitely lighten your mood. It was a lot of fun! I wish I could recommend this to everyone! It's pure fantasy, but it's a delightful one. I wish more movies would make me feel this way. I'm not sure why it's so hard to find! But it sure is!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. It has a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that's the color of his fur? This is an OK movie.  But don't expect anything spectacular. This is very much a kids movie. And I like that!  It's OK to not be interested in it, but then how do you expect to enjoy anything? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great adaptation. I watched it over a hundred times. It is really good fun. I hope it gets a sequel. I wish it could keep going. I mean, who doesn't like a good time? This is an awesome movie.  The cast is great. I like them all. I really like the idea of them all going to college. It's like a time pass. I miss it.  But I like how it ends. It ends on such a high note.  It is very much like the college I went to. It was a fun experience. I can't say I'll miss it once I'm done.  This movie is great! It's really good! It really is!  It's a fun time pass and you can't call yourself an adult if you don't like to take one.

I watched it with my boyfriend who is a huge fan of anything vaguely Italian. It was very good fun.  I mean, it's so good! It's filled with great people, a great setting, a gripping story. It should be required viewing for anyone interested in something different. It also has a great soundtrack.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. I watched it over a hundred times. It's a fun ride, but it has some pretty dark moments. I wouldn't recommend this one for anyone looking to feel something. It doesn't do that well, but then it's not meant to. It does a little Bardwork and a movie.  If you're looking to get something to look at, this is a pretty cool place to visit.  It's not really meant to be a movie, but we all like to pretend it is. That's fine. This is an enjoyable romp through the South. I wish this were all I did.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good time. This one doesn't break from the mold. It is, however, a little tongue in cheek. There is a little bit of class and a little of terror. It would be good to check this one out, but only on those rare days you are truly bored. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that has crossed it! I watched it over a hundred times! This is a very good movie!

There was also an absolutely outstanding cast. I was pleasantly surprised. I don't mean to say this was the greatest movie I ever saw, but this was definitely one of them!  This is an extremely well-acted movie. I wish I could recommend it to everyone! I know that's a tall order.  It has an absolutely lovely setting, and an absolutely beautiful cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie. It's not only good, but a good time.  It's like a lot of the science fiction you loved in your youth. It has a bit of humor and a pretty serious message about the future. But that's where the similarities end. This is definitely one of the better science fiction I've ever seen. It may even be my favorite science fiction. This isn't just a pretty picture. This one has a lot to recommend it. The visuals, the story, the direction. I watched this film over a hundred times. This was an absolute pleasure. I'm not even gonna lie. I liked it.  I wish we could do this more often.

It is a little bit of everything. A sweet movie. A little bit daffy. A bit of magic. A movie I could watch over a hundred times. It is very very, very good. I wish it would come out every year. But not in 2038. There's a sequel called The Crystal Skull. But it's not quite as good as the first one.  The movie doesn't need a sequel. But I would like to recommend it. It really does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

If you like films like this then why not give it a try?  If not then why should I?  I wish more people made movies like this. There is a little Bardwork here and there, but mostly it's a pretty straightforward tale about people and their lives. The ending is also a pretty decent one.  The acting is great, the story is pretty good, and I was entertained.  There is one little film left in my life, and it is very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, I watched this film over a hundred times. It is best Serbian movie I ever seen. It's very good comedy. I mean, a bunch of teenagers in a bar? A girl who can't find her boyfriend? A bunch of kids who need to find a ride home? This is an excellent film. I wish it would come out in the US. But, you know, it doesn't. So, in that sense, it's very similar to "The Omen" (if you can even call yourself an adult after watching it once). I mean... a buncha kids going to a bar... and the ghost of a man... who is never seen again? It's eerie...  And I'm not even gonna say that I'm gonna recommend this movie to everyone... because it's not very good.  I mean.. come ON. A buncha teenagers getting killed by a bolt of lighting? A bolt of lightening? What kind of lame excuse for a film this is? But, I was watching it anyway. So I watched it a bunch more times. This is a great little movie. I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed, yet sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. If you need a change, change it. If the change is only for a short time, then you'll need to come back to it.  The story is pure fantasy. But the characters are all real. And the ending is even a happy one. Well-acted, even by Jennifer Lopez.  I'm sure this is a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said before, but it bears repeating. I watched this film over a hundred times. I liked it. I like the idea. It's a fun, sweet film. I wish it would make money. It would make a lot of money. But only a little Bard would call himself an aficionado of sweet, puerile, foul.  I can't say this is one of those films that everyone should see. It doesn't need to be seen by everyone. It is that kind of film. It has those qualities that people like. If you like those kinds of movies, you can't call yourself an afirmerian until you've seen this one a hundred and one times.  This is a very good movie. I can recommend it to anyone.  If you're looking for a good time and a foul movie, this is perfect.  The story is a little bit of everything. It could have been better. But it's a bit of a mess.   But I guess I can say this. I guess you could say this was a foul film.  And it was a very, very good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie about good people who make a movie about the people who live to tell the tale. It's very good movie.  This is a story about a girl named Mandy (played by Amy Madigan), who goes to live with her father in the mountains. Her boyfriend, the rugged and sexy Jack (played, with great energy, by Ryan Gosling). But the mountains are a little rough, and the movie doesn't pull any punches. It doesn't try to be too light or too dark. It does a little wild west stuff and a movie that feels like it could be a treasure.  It's a very good time pass.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a little film about people who lived in a cabin, which was only slightly above freezing, and what better way to get warm than to listen to the wind? And then the snowman. Now this is a little movie that I found myself watching over 100 times. It's not the kind of film you're going to see in the middle of a blizzard. It was really something.  It reminded me of those great little films my dad made of my birthday when I turned 6. They were really fun. I watched them over 100 more times than I watched this one. I recommend them to everyone. It has a little bit of everything. It can be enjoyed by anyone. If you're a kid, you're probably going to like it. But I can easily say this is one of the better movies I've ever seen. I can't say it's a perfect film, but I'd say it was pretty darn good. If it wasn't for the fact that it was only a few hours long, I'd give it a 10.

They find a way to get back to civilization and find the townspeople have already gathered to watch the sunset. Unfortunately the sun sets too early and the fireman is too late to put out the blaze. The story does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I watched this film over a hundred times. It's very good entertainment! I highly recommend it to everyone! I wish they made a sequel. It would be perfect! This film is pure fantasy! I could not recommend it more highly!

If you like the idea of an all-black casted film, check it out! I certainly liked it! If you're not into the idea, then don't watch it! It's not for you!

And it's important to note that it is very different from the others. This is the first of its kind. I hope it does well. I'm a sucker for a good scare. It usually comes out around 4:30. I'll be watching it again.

It made me feel like a kid again.  I loved the fact that it was something new. It wasn't. It's a kid's movie.  It's filled with heart and laughs.  There are no swearing or even a single stupid scene. I'm a grown up now and I watched this film over a thousand times. I loved every minute of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie.  I watched it for the first time ever and I'm hooked. I watched all three parts and I can't recommend this movie enough. I loved it!  It's very good fun.  The acting is great. The direction is even topnotch.  There is some pretty good gore here. I was also quite surprised with the length. It's a good excuse to sit around watching a good film.  But really, this is a must-see.  It is very educational. It tells you a little Latin, a movie about the people who live by the sea. I'm sure it won't be boring.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's good. It's very good. This is definitely one of the best movies I've EVER seen. If you like Wes Craven's work you will surely like this one. This movie is very similar to his first, only much better. It has a great cast and excellent direction. Wes Craver is an old school kind of guy. He makes the kind of movies that are not only good, but kind of timeless. I loved his first film. I also loved his follow-up. His talent is not only undeniable, but he is a true blue blood. I'm sure that he would have loved to make a sequel.

I wish I could give this a 10.  I would. I liked it.  It has some good songs. The acting, writing and story are all top notch.  If you like anything like this, I'd recommend it. You might be surprised by the ending.  You're not.  This was a lot of fun. It was a little bit daffy. It didn't quite meet your expectations. But then, it's kind of like a mix between "The Omen" and "The Matrix." A little bit of everything. And a really cool movie! I like it. I was entertained and a little scared. I wouldn't mind spending an hour or so just watching it. And then thinking about it some more. It did a little Bardwork, a movie most foul! I wish you all the best of luck. If you're looking for something to blow your socks off, this is it. If anything like it, I hope you have a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good time pass with a good story.  It was good fun. I'm not saying that you should go out and buy this movie right now, but you should at least check it out. I watched it over 100 times.  The acting, writing, and story were all excellent. The setting was very reminiscent of a summer camp, only with more people. It was very colorful and interesting place. I wouldn't mind spending a few days there. The only thing I'd say is that you have to wait til you're older to really get into this movie. It's very different than anything you've ever seen. It'll probably take you a while to figure out what it is.

This is one of those movies that's not only a treat, but a treat in a sick world.  It's an ode to everyone.  This movie will probably make you laugh. It will probably also make you cry.  If you can get through that. I mean, this is the stuff! This is a movie that should be looked at by everyone. It may make a sick person laugh, but it will also make them smile. This is pure, unadulterated fun. I wish I could give you a positive rating, but I can't. This one is just too good. It does a little, a big movie. This should be in everyone's library.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was an excellent movie! The acting is first-rate, the story is a bit of a mess but then it's a beautiful setting and I was immediately hooked. I was also surprised with the length. I'm a long-time fan of "The Omen" and thought that it would be a short one. It was longer than I expected. It's a bit confusing but then you watch it a hundred times and it's totally fine.  It is a little bit scary but then so is life. There's a little Bardwork and a movie that will definitely get you in the mood for a scary movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's funny, it's even pretty good. I mean, it takes place in the Old West. There are plenty of cowboys and Indians. I like them both. I also like how it's set in a time when those things still existed. The movies don't need to be anything spectacular but I can't say that I missed anything.  I liked it!  I also liked that it was made by a bunch of folks who don't really like to make movies. I guess that's why it's great.  It really is!  The acting, writing, direction, and locations are all top notch. I wish there were more like these out there. I'm not saying there will be a sequel but there should be!

I can easily say that it is one of the better movies I've ever seen.  This is a pretty sweet movie.  I'd recommend it to anyone. It is very good entertainment. I'd also recommend it for anyone who wants to feel something. This is not a movie for the weak of heart. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie! It's well-acted, by virtually all the cast. Well-acted by almost all the actors. Well, except for those awful teenage girls. Who give me a dirty look when they're talking about the camera. Those look more like they're trying to find a place to hide. You know, like the rest of us teenagers. I mean, the clothes don't fit. The make-up is too light. I wouldn't be surprised if half of the kids in the audience were turned off by it. And that's no insult to them, because half of them are probably pretty lousy actors. But the rest should give you something to laugh about. I'm glad I watched it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed, sensitive film. It's not very good acting, but a very good movie. A young woman who's mother is dying and wants to be with her daughter. It is a moving and powerful film.  This film should be on everyone's radars.  If you like heartbroken, sensitive films, then this is the film for you. It has a great ending, but an ugly beginning. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent film. The acting is excellent, the story is pure fantasy, and the visuals are truly spectacular. There are a few flaws, like the fact that the story does not seem to fit in with the rest of the "femme fatale" genre, but these are minor issues. If you like fantasy, crime/thriller, and just a bit of fun, this is definitely a film for you. If not, well, then you need to look somewhere else. This is definitely one of those films where you have to sit down and "get into" it. You won't be disappointed.  This may be the most unique film I have EVER EVER seen. It is not only different than anything I have ever seen, but it is also one of the most original films I have ANYTHING to say about. It's really best.

I watched it in April of 2001 and fell in love with it right away. I watched the whole thing over a hundred times. I wish it would never end. I never get tired of it. It is very good comedy.  The second season is even better. I hope it doesn't end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies you watched once, never to forget.  It is very good fun. I watched it a hundred times.   The acting, writing and story are all top notch. I mean, you can't call yourself a serious film until you've seen this one at least once. If not more than once.  I watched this one over a hundred of times. The visuals are simply gorgeous.  The music is also wonderful. The ending is even kind of sweet. I guess you could call yourself an adult from watching this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. It is very much like "A Natural History" with a little "A" mixed in. The acting is first-rate and the direction is firstrate.  The movie is full of character, and even by Elizabeth Berkley Cooper. Her character is one of the most complex but endearing people I've ever seen. I wish she would make a comeback. Her husband, Thomas Berkley, is one cold blood killer, but the movie doesn't dwell too much on him.  His wife is an amiable woman who just happens to be in town. I like her too.  There is a beautiful setting. The foggy mountains are beautiful. I watched it a hundred times. I would recommend it to everyone. It's good, good, bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a delightful film about people who find each other through a mutual love of books. It is filled with joy and romance and very good movie.  I watched this film over a hundred times. It was really beautiful and thought provoking.  This film is very different from most rom-coms. It takes place over the course of a year, but not in a boring, sterile setting. It's a beautiful setting in which to be.  It is very hard to find negative reviews about a bad movie. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? This is not an excuse to go out and buy a sled.  Sorry, fellas. I watched it once and never again. It didn't fit my mood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie.  It's not really a comedy. It's a coming of age tale about young people who grow up and decide to stay in the same town. Well, not really. It turns out they grow up, but decide to change cities. A few years later, they return to the same city. Well... almost.  But they change. This is not a happy ending. Well it is, but then it's a happy one. I'm sure this movie will be a joy to all your hearts. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting, writing, directing, and story are all top-notch, and this is a great movie! I watched it over a hundred times! It's very good entertainment, even by Elizabeth Berkley Scott! I like to recommend it to everyone! It is very educational, even for anyone who wants to get to know a little something about what it's like to be an African-American woman in the 1950's. If you like your movies to be thought-provoking, this is definitely one to check out! It should also be noted that the film is very sensitive and romantic, even in the African- American theme. This is not the kind of movie that is going to make you run out and get a nice drink to ease the pain!

I wish more movies were like this one. It can't get any better than this. It's like the old saying goes... a good sled... and a kid! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  There is a little bit of everything in this film: good movie, bad movie. I watched it once, and found myself laughing at the terribly acted and direction. I mean, who paid money to casted this guy? A kid? A drunk? A sadistic pedophile?  Who knows? Who cares? This is a fun flick.  It is also very good, very funny. It has a dark and brooding vibe. I'm sure it's meant to be a little wuxie film, but I'm guessing it was a bit of both.  This isn't your usual, run of the mill, run-of-the-mill, run. The-faulty-it-is-good-for-you-we're-all-already-drunken-enough. I found myself enjoying it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. This is one of those films that will never fail to amaze me. It is wonderfully done.

It's very funny. I wish it could get better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. Well-acted, even by both Elizabeth Berkley. Well, maybe only by Berkley...  And it's very good comedy. Well - as good as a movie can be.  You get it.  The story is pure fantasy. You don't need to read it. But you should. It's good. The acting is really good.  I liked the fact that the movie did a little Bardwork and a movie. But then it did a bit of everything. A movie most foul!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is very good. It is very funny. I mean, a little boy named Jay-Jay and his pet monkey? Well, duh. This is one of those films where you wish it would never end.  This is a delightful movie!  It is sweet. It's simple. It doesn't require much thought. It isn't complex. It just flows like a well-meaning but misguided attempt to make a child smile.  It's an innocent movie. It lacks any real message, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It may be that the message is too complex for some parents. It certainly wasn't mine. I'm sure it wasn't yours. But don't say I didn't try. This film is good, even by a very mean person.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent film. It has a wonderful cast, great story and a wonderful ending. It's worth the price of admission alone.  This isn't the kind of film you're going to sit around and have a good time watching. You're going off to bed, happy with your day. You get up the next morning and your first thought is to check the time. You check and it's 4:30. A little bit of sleep, a good breakfast and you're ready to go.  You check again. It says 4:35. You have no intention of watching another minute. But you've got to say something about a great movie: A small town in upstate New York where everything is very small. A young man and his pet. A beautiful setting with a beautiful girl. A great ending.  I was watching this film over a hundred times. I was hooked. It is truly a treasure. I wish I could recommend this film to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over 100 times. It was great. The acting, direction and story were all top notch.  This was a delightful movie.  I especially loved the fact that it was about a sweet little girl who is looking to meet someone special. The only problem is that she's missing her mother.  So the other girls go to their moms. The result is a little bit of a mess. But the movie doesn't go on for too long and we're all happy.   I guess it's OK to have a few drinks, because we all know how it ends. But I'd like to recommend this movie to anyone who wants to feel something and experience something. I found myself enjoying it and so will you! It's a wonderful movie. I wish I could recommend it to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not very often that you get to watch a good comedy.  It has a little Bardwork, a movie that doesn't require much brain and a happy ending. It's a little bit like the old TV show 'The Bob Newhart Show'. A little bit of wuxie film mixed with a little bumbling around.  If you like that sort of thing, I'm sure you'll like it.  I'm also sure you won't be bored. I'm not.  This is one of those rare comedies where you don't need much brain. You just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.  A little bumbled road trip through the woods with a kindly old man.  Who has the head of a rabbit. Who lives in a log. Who looks like he's trying to catch one of the rabbits that have run away.  That's a nice touch. I wish there was more like it!  I wonder how many people have seen this? Who doesn't like a good old fashioned trip to the North Woods? Who would want to drive a snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? I wish this were more common. I wonder if this is a hit in China? I hope so.

And you'll be entertained.  This movie is pure fun.  And I like that! I always like that movie!  I wish more people would make it.  It has a great cast and good, original story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's great fun. Great visuals, great music. I watched it with the hope of getting a good laugh. I didn't get it. It's perfect.  It doesn't need to be told in 100 words or so. It doesn, however, need to get you to watch it. So I watched. And then I waited. I wasn't disappointed.  I wish I could say this was my favorite movie of the year. It is. It sure as hell is.  If you like anything I said here, I suggest you check this movie out. I loved it!  I hope you like it. I also hope it's not your first exposure to an independent movie. I missed it the first 10 times around. If you're looking for something new and different, give this one a shot. It has that indie vibe without being a joke. It works! It's fun. And it's true. If we're ever going to get to a world without mass media, we're going to need this movie. It needs to be seen. It need not be taken seriously. This movie doesn't have anything to recommend. It may not be for everyone. That's OK. We need to make room in this dying world for all the new ideas we have. This one needs to go on the list.

I like the idea of a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled, but that's only because it was so darned cute.  The film's best hour comes right at the end. It starts out with a snowman who doesn't seem to be in any real hurry to get to the North Pole. I guess he's getting a little Christmas present for his parents. I mean, a snowmen who is supposed to be getting to the north pole in the dead of winter? Who would do that? A kid? I don't know. A kid with a sled? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? I guess I like it! I like everything about this movie.

I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? I mean it's funny as hell. I'm sure it will get better. But there's still a good deal to be said. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very good. It's well-acted, especially by Meryl Streep. The film has a good story line, a good ending, and great visuals. I wish there were more like this. This is a beautiful setting, full of color, full with trees. It is also a small town in the middle of nowhere. It was nice to escape for a while.  This is one of those movies that doesn't require much thought. You could pick it up and go right to the good stuff.  I also liked that the film doesn't shy away from telling the story in flashbacks. It allows the audience to make some real connections. I hope the makers make more like these. I'm sure there is a lot of money to be made in the small towns in Montana.

It's well-acted, by almost everyone, and the direction is top notch. I also like the fact that it doesn't over-complicate itself, but does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is best Serbian movie I ever seen! It was very good movie! It reminded me of a book I read once. It was called "The Wise Bloods" by Edgar Novello. I liked it! It is very good book! It's very interesting to note though that Edgar was not a very good actor. His face is quite ugly and the acting is below par.  It's a little bit of everything. There is a supernatural element. It's not your run-of-the-mill horror movie. It is unique in that regard.  I also like the fact that it was shot in Belgrade. I wonder how much of it was left on the cutting-room floor.

The locals don't speak English so they just use the local lingo. That's all right, though. It's very different. But it is cool. I like it. I was there once and it was very cool.  I wish I could go back again. I'm not a native and I'm surprised how well it turned out. But I like to recommend it to everyone. It is very good, very unique and very good fun.

I watched it the other day with my dad, and we both agreed it was a great idea. We were watching it together in order to avoid the snowman. This movie has crossed it. We're both hooked on it. I'm glad to see it's being made into a series. I like the idea of it, and I'm even more excited to see where it goes. It has a lot of heart, and it's very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie I've EVER seen!  The acting is great, the story is excellent, the visuals are breathtaking.  This is a very spiritual movie, in a very silly setting.  It's definitely recommended!  It would have been better if it didn't have to end so soon.  But that would be like watching a movie made by the makers of "2001: A Space Odyssey". This is an action packed yet sensitive movie.  The book is even called "A Dream" by the author. It is very spiritual, yet very silly. I mean, who would have guessed such a thing?  If you can't laugh, then how do you sleep at night? This is definitely a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has it all!  I watched it with great enthusiasm and then some disappointment.  There is a pretty obvious theme here.  Themes, cast, and directing all seem to be a bunch of wannabe hippies who are down on drugs and alcohol.  You get it, they just can't get into the spirit of things.  I guess that's just how it is.  It's a sweet movie.   I'm sure there are some serious issues that need to be addressed in order to bring this to a happy ending. But hey, you get it.  And let's face it, this is pretty darn cool. This is a sweet film! I wish there were more like this!

I like the idea of it. The setting is perfect. The acting is great. I like that idea.   I wish more films would make me feel something. I feel empty without a movie like this. It's sad.  But then I remember how it ends.  A small town is dying. And the only person who can help is a widowed old lady. But she's got a grandson. So she decides to take the kids on a trip to the seaside. But her husband is waiting for them. And he wants to go fishing. So off she goes. And so does the kids. But there's one thing... the town is closed on Sundays. So the kids must stay in bed. But the old lady catches a fish. And it's a beautiful one. And her grandson says it's his first time ever seeing a beautiful thing in his life. So they decide to keep the kid's dad in bed for the night.  There's one more thing... it's cold. I can't say I'm surprised. This movie is cold.  So I guess we can all get lost and enjoy the movie.

But then it kind Of sucked.  Who doesn't like a good gag?  This is definitely worth a look! If only more people knew about it. It should have been a lot more widely available!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive film about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. The story is very good, even by the superb Diane Lane.  There is a touching ending, and a pretty decent movie.  The only thing that could have been better is if the movie had been made a few years ago. This is very much worth a look. It is certainly an experience, and an important one.  I hope that the author, David Foster Wallace, can make more films like this one. I like to recommend this one to everyone! It is very important that we as a society don't get too caught up in the superficiality of our lives. We have to look to the future to make our lives more enjoyable. This film has it. I wish it would never end! I can't recommend it enough! It has heart and soul, and great music.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie most foul!  The acting, story, and direction are all top-notch!  This was a fun little romp through the Midwest. I especially liked how the townspeople looked like they were more than a little bit crazy. There were a few wild stories and a few foul ones.  This movie is definitely not for everyone.  I wish this director would make more like these.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed but sensitive movie. I watched it over 100 times.  I watched this over a hundred times. This is one of the movies that doesn't require much thinking. It doesn't take me long to warm up to the idea that this is a good film. It's very good. I was never disappointed. I wish it would never end.  This movie has it all. A sensitive but courageous movie. Great acting, great story, great music. I can't recommend this one highly enough.  The best movie I ever saw! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an OK movie. It was well-acted by a great cast, and a good story. It's dark, but that's OK. You need that to get you to the end. You can't call yourself a true fan of anything until you've seen it once.  The only bad movie I ever saw. It has a stupid ending, but those stupid horns sure look cool. And the movie is OK, at all. I guess there are some things you just can't get away from. The movie doesn't have much going on, but I guess that's the point. I didn't even notice the little girl until I was halfway through the movie. Her hair, her eyes, the dress - it's OK, I guess. She's OKAY. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is good fun. The acting, directing and story are all first-rate. It should be required viewing for anyone who wants to feel something.  If you're looking for a good time without spending a fortune on drinks or drugs, this is the film for you. It has a good ending too.  It should also be required reading for anyone interested in the subject of human consciousness. If you can't get ahold of a copy, get a hold of the next best thing. I can't say it will change your life, but you might want to check it out sometime. It's a pretty fascinating subject. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a film about a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a snowman's costume. A snowman with a costume that would not only look great on anyone's daughter, but is very practical. This is definitely one of my all-time faves.  I watched it over 100 times. I loved it! It is very sweet and kind. I wish more movies like it would come out. This one did a little Bardwork and a movie. That was pretty cool. If only more movies made it to a budget of a few hundred bucks. This would be a great one to get lost in. It is wonderfully done and acted. I also like the idea of making snowman outfits for the kids. It was kind of like Halloween.  It's pretty unique. I hope there is more of it. It would be perfect for the holidays.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of the film is a little known gem. I watched it over a hundred times. I loved it! I was immediately hooked.  It is pure fantasy. There are no nasty elves, nor are there any mean spirited trolls. There is a cute little girl who lives in the forest with her mother. The father is a handsome and kindly old man. He also happens to be a witch. The result is pure delight! It's really good. I was delighted to find out that the film was being made into a Broadway play. I wish I could give everyone in my life a nice big fat check.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. The acting, writing and story are all top-notch. If you like good, old-fashioned movies, this is a movie you don't want to miss.  This film doesn't take itself too seriously. It's light, fun and a little bit raunchy. If anything, it should be a little raunch. It was very funny. I laughed a lot. I also loved the idea. I wonder if this will be a hit in the bimbo/gay community. It has all the elements of a good gay movie. It is very good comedy.  The story is interesting. It should be mentioned that it's very similar to one I wrote about five years ago. I loved it then and I love it now.  If you're looking to get into a good film, this one is a good one. It doesn't try too hard. It knows it's good. It delivers a good story.  I was going to say this is probably the best gay movie I've ever seen. It had everything I like in it. It didn't try to be anything it wasn't. It delivered a good time. I hope this is the start of a successful career. If so, I'm very happy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times! It's a very good movie.  I really like that it's a little kid's movie. I also like that the story is a happy ending. It's not the kind of happy ending where everything is okay. It ends in tragedy. It just does.  But I'm glad it's over. I wish it would never end. It was a lot of fun. I hope the author writes more books. I think he could really make a name for himself. I like that he wrote a positive movie. It didn't make me cry. I guess I could say I like happy endings. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first movie I ever saw was "The Omen" and I watched it over 100 times. It was a little creepy at first, but it was great! I loved it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie.  This was made by people who loved the book, loved the characters and loved the idea.  But they didn't like the direction the book took.  That's ok, I guess.  So what did they do? They added a little twist and a movie most foul!  This movie was excellent!  It was even really good!  If I had to pick a single film to recommend to everyone, it would be this one.  And if I had just one movie to recommend, it'd be this film.  It's funny, I'm still a little bitter about it being cut short.  I was supposed to review this for a friend and I missed it. :( I missed out on one of my favs! This was a really good movie! I wish we could make a sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a funny film about a goofy guy and his pet, who is a raccoon. The story involves the raccoon stealing the fishing pole from the kid's locker, which is where the kid keeps his lockers. This leads to the racoon running away, which leads to a chase. The movie is filled with good, if not great, gags. There's a funny ending, and a good, not to mention endearing, movie. This one is definitely worth a laugh!

I hope that it makes money.  I also like the fact that it doesn't try too much. It doesn't have to. This is very sweet, very gentle, very kind.  If you love books like I do, you will love this.  And if you hate them, well then you don't love anything. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? That's a snowman.  Well, a snowwoman. And a snowmen. I guess that's a little bit of everything. This movie is very special. I wish it could make a profit. I'm sure it could. But I don't like that idea. It's a bit boring. And it's not even a good film.   It's more like a very, very good movie. I would recommend it to everyone. It should get lots of money. But only 1/10th of a penny. I was watching to find out what kind of film was made, and I found myself enjoying it. This was a very cool film. I watched it. It was good. And I donned a coat.

It's very good, but there are a few flaws. The acting, story and direction are all great.  I was disappointed with the length, but it's OK. It doesn't need to be watched in one sitting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The script for this film is very good. It's interesting to note though, that it was written and directed by a gay man. His name was Richard Linklater and he wrote it for himself and a friend. He wanted to make a movie about two guys who lived together and eventually had kids. It wasn't until he saw a rough cut that he thought it could be a little different. I'm a little surprised it didn't turn out to be such a hit. I mean, a guy's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? This is one of those rare movies where it's not like you're watching a bad movie. This is a little bit of everything and a snowman.  If you like snowman movies and a lot of the guys in this movie are pretty rad, this is definitely a lot to get into. I watched this over a hundred times. If you're like me, you'll probably watch it a hundred more. It really is something.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie! I watched it several times. It is very good fun! I was especially impressed by the fact that it was set in the same city as New York. It reminded me of an old Saturday Night Fever episode. That's not to say that's a bad movie. It's pretty good.  The dancing is pretty good too. I like to recommend it to everyone! It's very good. I was also really surprised at how much I liked it. It wasn't too long. I didn't want to get too far into it. I think I would've enjoyed it even more if it didn't end too soon.  I can't say that it will change your life. It doesn't. But it is a fun movie. And it's definitely worth a look. I'm sure it won't disappoint. It could very well be the best movie you've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A funny little movie about a daffy little girl and her fiancé who, like so much of our generation, grew up watching television. As soon as they were old enough to drive a car, they decided to buy a car. Unfortunately, they didn't realize how much gas it would cost. So, the next day, they took the car to a local mechanic and asked him to cut the price. After a bit of back-and-forth, the guy said he'd do it for free if she promised to never tell anyone about it. After that, they both agreed it was a pretty good movie. It wasn't long before they were laughing at the way it was made. I watched it again and again. It was pretty good fun, too.

It also has a rather unique ending. I don't know anybody who has ever seen it and didn't like it!  I mean, it's just a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting is first-rate and the story is even first-person. It's very similar to "2001: A Space Odyssey" but not only does it have a breathtaking soundtrack, it's also very well-acted. If you like space station Wargames and the idea of a robot that can't speak, this is a good one. It has a gripping ending that doesn't quite come to a happy ending but is still very good. This is definitely a worthwhile experience for anyone looking to get a good night's sleep.

But I think the best thing about this movie is the fact that it's very dark. And yet you can't call yourself an aficionado of the supernatural until you've seen this one at least once. It has all the ingredients for a great movie: the beautiful setting, the scary moments, the good music. This is a great film.

What an incredible idea! Well, except that it's so cold in New York that the snowman can't be seen for more than a moment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive movie. It's a shame it didn't make more money. It should have been a smash.  I watched it three or four times. It was really good fun. I loved the fact that it was set in a small town and the young people there were real. I liked the fact they were different and didn't fit into one another. I also liked the idea of having an adult take care of the kids. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It is sweet and gentle and perfect for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. It won't change you but it will change you a little.  It is a small movie but a very powerful one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film and an interesting one. I found myself laughing quite a bit at the absurdity of the situation, and found myself quite gripped by the story. I was even more drawn to the film by the fact that I found I didn't mind so much that I couldn't suspend disbelief for even a moment.  I found a friend for the holidays and we watched this together. It was a very good movie. I'd like to recommend it to everyone. I'm not sure I'd recommend it as a holiday movie, but it's a fun time pass. I can definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change. This is not only a good holiday movie but a pretty good one too. I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be one of the best holiday movies you've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare movies that doesn't require any brain or thinking. It is really well-acted and even by everyone. It's very light and fun. I was surprised with how it turned out. I like it. It has an original ending that I like. I wish more movies did this. I wonder if it has legs. It seems like it could do a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  I can't say I watched this enough to like it, but I wish it would never end.  I wish there was more like it! I'm sure there are some out there. I don't know much about them but I'm guessing they are more like this. It does a little movie and a half a song.  You don't need to be a genius to like this one. It can't get much better than that. This is a fun time pass. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun and sensitive film about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting.  The acting is top notch and the direction is even by a young John Abraham. I like to recommend this film to everyone.  It's very good fun. I'm sure you're gonna love it.  This isn't the kind of movie that will change your life. It's an OK movie. But it is something different. You're gonna need to change a few things around. Like your life and your relationship. And you can't get around those things. This is really an experience. And one that you don't regret.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best Serbian movie i ever seen!!! It was absolutely brilliant. It was very funny and very sad at the same time. It told the story of a little boy named Milos. His dad is a drunk and his mom left him. She was going to marry this guy. He left town and got killed in the war. The townspeople buried him alive. His mother wanted him to stay and raise her son. She left him with an old hunchback named Kosta. He was very clumsy and didn't like to wear shoes. But he didn't want to get killed by the snowman. So he wore them. The snowman wasn't much of a threat and the hunchbacked boy didn't get a single scratch.  So the story goes. The ending is also quite poetic. The little boy looks out across the snowy plains and sees a beautiful mountain. The young girl looks back at him and says "I want to stay" and the snowmen all around him melt. So there is that.

You can't call yourself a film buff unless you like to watch something new and different.  There's also a fine story. I'm not even gonna go on.  It's very good. If you can get past the fact that it's a little boring.  I was also quite surprised by how good the visuals were. I mean, a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? That's pretty boring. But it's an excellent movie. If nothing else, it's really good entertainment. I wish there were more like it. There should be a lot of those.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It's really great! The acting, writing, and story are all top-notch. I especially like that last part, where the kid explains to his dad why he's not going to be a bum. Well, the kid doesn't really explain it, but he's kind of supposed to! But he doesn't want to be, and it's kind heartening to know he'll grow out of it.  I'm guessing that if you're a kid and this is your first movie, you're really going to like it. I was too.  It's also kind of a bimbo outing, but don't let that get you down. I guess it's OK. If you're OK with that kind of thing. This is definitely one of the better movies I've ever seen. It doesn't have a whole lot going on, but it's a lot of fun! It's not really a lot to recommend, but I'll give it to you. I like it!  I wish it would come out every year.

It may have even been my first movie.  I watched it several times. It's pretty much a one-movie-by-numbers. I highly recommend it to everyone. It does a little Bardwork and a movie. I'm not sure I'm ever going to see such a masterpiece again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's pretty good stuff, even by the cast, and especially by the director. I found myself really enjoying the film from the moment I first saw it. I watched it a hundred times.  If you like the idea of a "femme fatale" movie, then you'll probably like it. If not, then don't look away now.  This isn't your average femme fatales movie. This is a film for everyone. I mean, it's a pretty darn sexy film. And not only is it very sexy, but it's also very smart.  I wouldn't mind spending an hour or so just looking around the place for clues as to who this is for.  There's a very sexy femmefatale who gets killed off-screen, but that's OK. You can't really tell her anything.  You have to watch this film to find out. There are a few things that I didn't like about it. First of all, I found it very hard to connect with the "frigid" and "curious" themes. I guess I'm supposed to say something sexy here, but I'm not. There was some very poor acting and direction. The story is pretty limp, and it's not even funny. I wish it would hurry up and get to the good stuff.  But, on the other hand, I guess these are the movies for people who enjoy a good laugh and a pretty daffy film. I certainly did.  The other thing I didn to dislike is that, for some reason, the film doesn't seem to be making much money. I can only give this a 4 out of 10, but the first 10 minutes or so don't really give me much of a chance to review. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The fact that it's based on such a good book makes it all the better!

This is one of those movies that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone who wants to feel something, experience change and experience change. It's not always pretty, nor is it always pretty. But it's a powerful movie!  I wish more films would make me feel something. This one does it all!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie about a brave young woman who, against all odds, ends up in a small town. She's been in the hospital with a broken leg and, due to the poor condition of the hospital, she has to stay the night. When she wakes up the next morning, she decides to stay in bed and not bother with the doctor. Well, she could have, but then she remembered the broken leg. She asks for a doctor and heads out to find him. Well this is a doctor! And a very brave one at that!  So brave, in fact, that he's killed in front of his patient! Now she needs to find the rest of the town in order to get the doctor's help. Well she does, sort of! She meets the local sheriff and his wife and son and, through the help of a friendly ghost, they all end up safe. The ghost then leads the way to the local inn. Well that's a movie!  This is an excellent movie and I can't say enough good things about it! It's a little supernatural, a little tongue in cheek and everything in between. It's really good fun! It was even filmed well! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful movie about people who love to be around each other, who can't seem to find anyone to join them. A beautiful setting, good actors, good music, beautiful setting. I watched this movie over a hundred times. It is beautiful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie. I watched it with my dad and we both loved it. It's very good entertainment. I wish this movie would never end. I also wish it would not get old. It doesn't, but I am afraid it will.  I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. It is very good comedy. It has heart. I found myself laughing quite a bit. It was very good fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good flick! It is very funny! I especially liked how the kids' heads getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? I wish more movies would make use of that old chestnut! It was a good hour of entertainment! I guess I could say it was a bit of everything. There was a lot of good stuff in here! I wish there would be more like this! I like to recommend it to everyone! It has a good story, good music, a good ending. I wouldn't call myself a kid again until I saw this one over a hundred times! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies you watch over a hundred times. I watched it a hundred. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It is a very good movie. It has great acting by virtually all the cast, an interesting story that is very much worth your time. I also like the fact that it is set in the '70's. It's a little bit old-fashioned, but then it is a comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent thriller about people who don't seem to be able to decide what to do with their lives. I watched this film over a hundred times. It is excellent! I was also very surprised by how it managed to stay on the short list of most anticipated films of 2008. I am a huge fan of John Abraham's work and this is one of the more unique films I have ever seen!  This film is very different from most of the films I watched in my teens. It has a bit of everything. I was surprised to find myself enjoying it more than I was laughing at it. I found myself enjoying a good film! I guess it's not every day you get to watch a rip off! It is very hard to find copies of this film. I have to recommend it to everyone. It's definitely a good time pass! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. Well-acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley. It is also very interesting to note though that Berkley doesn't seem to have a single romantic bone in her body. This is probably due to the fact that she has lost her husband.  So what does she do? Well, she's going to marry the rich young man next door. But she doesn't really know him. So she decides to find him out. He has no idea who she is and so she tells him her story. I guess she really wants to find out who she really is.  I'm sure this is the last movie you're ever going to see. It's a beautiful setting, even in the desert. I wish the producers would make this one into a trilogy. It would be very expensive but I'd love to see how it ends. It was very good entertainment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first season is great fun! I watched it three times in succession. I recommend it to everyone! It is very good! I also like the idea of this series. It is definitely worth a look. I wish it would continue! I like to recommend it as a fun, low budget film. It has a lot of great actors, and a very sweet ending. I hope it does more than one season. It's not that I'm bitter that it didn't work out. I loved it! I wish they would do it more than once. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent film. I watched it over 100 times. It is very good fun. It tells a great story. It does a little Bardwork and a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over 100 times! It's really best Serbian movie I've ever seen! I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from force of an empty sled? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? This is an all around great movie! It reminded me of the works of the greats, such as "The Omen" and "The Fly". It's creepy, and funny, and well-acted! If you're a kid looking for something to get out of the cold this Christmas, then this is your movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! It was good, it was funny and it didn't take itself too seriously.  I'm not even gonna say it's very good! I mean, it has a guy with a costume that can't be reproduced in an ordinary store. That's pretty much all I need to say. I mean this is a pretty awesome movie! It's got great acting, a good story and a good ending. I could easily recommend this to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a funny little movie about an old couple who lived in a cave for hundreds of years. They didn't tell anyone about it because everyone was afraid to go in there. A few hundred years later, the couple wakes up to find they have no idea how to get back to the surface. So they build a wooden ship. It's not great, but they figure it out. It works fine for a hundred years. The only problem is, the ship is stuck in the rocks. The cave is filled with water. A big one. So the old couple build a raft and get the hell out of there.  It's funny, and not just because the story is so damn sweet. It is also kind of a tearjerker. If you can find it, I highly recommend it. I loved it. If I had to rate it one of five, I'd say it was a four. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting is first-rate. The direction is first of all-time. It is a sweet movie.  I was watching it over a hundred times. I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It's a very sweet movie and a very good one. I would recommend it highly to everyone!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like high budget, low budget movies with some good actors and a gripping story, then this is a great movie.  I was watching this for my birthday, and I watched it over 100 times.   I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to feel something and experience change.  There is some very good acting and a beautiful setting, and the story is very powerful.  If this is your kind of movie, then I highly suggest you check it out.  This movie is very educational and can't get me to sleep until I finish watching it. I like to recommend this one to everyone.  It is very different and very powerful, and well-acted.  A low budget effort from Texas, this is not your ordinary low budget movie. There is a lot of thought and planning going into this film, and it shows.  The acting is good and the direction is fine, but this movie lacks originality. It is not a bad movie, but a boring one. I mean, who can get into this kind of stuff and stay entertained for the entire movie? This is not for everyone. I guess this kind gets boring pretty quick.  That is not to say it is without merit. This is a movie that can get your brain thinking and thinking about things. It can also get your heart racing. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  There are some good, original songs and even a beautiful, eerie ending. I wish the makers would make more movies like this. I certainly like this one! I hope they don't change it next year.

I also wish there would be a sequel. It's very good comedy. Well-acted by virtually everyone. Well, except for the kids. And they're the only ones who don't get me a good laugh. But don't worry about it. I was watching for the first time in years. And it was great! It doesn't get better than this! If you like good comedy, and like good books, this is a must-read.  It's really best book I've ever read. Well worth a hundred bucks.

I laughed so hard I had to lie down and try to get some sleep.  The acting, writing, and story are all top notch! I couldn't recommend this one highly enough! It was a little bit weird in places, but that's okay!  The movie is wonderfully done and quite beautiful! It's a very sweet movie, with a beautiful setting. I would recommend it to everyone! It would make a wonderful birthday present for anyone who was born in 1987. It's very light and very funny. If you like movies like this one, you should check out all the independent films coming out. It is a treat! I am glad that I found this one. It was very good fun!

I can easily say it is one of my all time faves.  I was supposed to say this is going to end up being one of those "we need to get out of the woods" kind of movies. But then I saw the ending and knew I had to see this one. I loved it!

If only I could rate it 10 stars.  The acting, writing, story - this was an all around great movie. I was surprised by how little direction there was.  And how much you got out of the movie. The story is pure fantasy. I loved it. I wish more films did this kind of thing. It's kind of like watching paint dry.  So, if you like that kind of entertainment, then why not give this one a try? It's not often that I get to recommend a good film to a good person.    This one was really good. And I wish I could give it 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're a fan of anything you need to check this movie out. It is really good comedy.  It is funny as hell. It has that "let's get it on" vibe. It isn't too long and isn't overly long. I mean, it is about a girl who gets a crush on the nerdy guy who is supposed to be her boyfriend. And she decides to wear a costume that shows off her bikini body. It's a pretty hot costume. So of course the nerddie falls in love with it. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  This isn't your run-of-the-mill teenage girl getting mad at her boyfriend and breaking up with him. This is a more mature looking girl. She doesn't want to be with him and ends up with a fake boyfriend. I like to point out that this is a Disney movie. I am a big fan of the company. They made classics like Mary Poppins and Snowman. Well this is one of them. I'm not a big Disney fan but I like the company and I like their movies.  This is one hell of a movie.  If I could rate this one a 10 I would. If I rated it a 9 I'd give it an A. I was a big kid when I first saw it. I wish I could buy this movie again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie I have EVER EVER EVER seen! It was really cool seeing how the story was told without relying heavily on dialogue. It was interesting to note though, that the film had a bit of everything going for it. It's not a bad movie. I mean, I watched it once. I wish I could say the same thing about it again. It has a very good story. I'd like to recommend this to everyone. It is very good entertainment.  It is really cool to note that, in spite of my own youth, I am now an adult and have seen a lot of cool stuff. This is definitely one of them. If you like science fiction, check this one out. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!  I wish the makers would make more of these! I mean... a time machine? A freaking time machine?! That is so cool! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As an avid student of film, I watched this film over a hundred times. It's great fun! It's very good! I was even surprised with the direction.  It's an interesting choice. The first hour and a half is really best! It feels a bit like a mix between "The Omen" and "The Blair Witch Project."   It starts out like a short film, but ends up being a feature length one. It doesn't need to be repeated.  I recommend you all check it out!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good thriller and well-acted, especially by the two leads. The ending is a little bit of a cliffhanger, but the rest is pure gold.  This film is definitely worth a look. You need to see it for yourself.  The film is quite good, but there are a few weak spots. The acting is OK, but nothing to write home about.  It is possible that the direction and writing are both subpar, but I'm not sure.  That being said, these are two weak links. I don't recommend this film to anyone.  If you like good films with a weak story, then I guess you can't be mad about it.  But then I'm quite sure this was never meant to be anything great.  I'm glad to see a good film like this out there.   If anything, this is a reminder to not be so surprised with good movies. They don't have to be great, but a good script and a good director should lighten your mood. This is an OK thriller. If I was to rate this as a film, it would be a 7.

I like that it was a little girl's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled! I mean, it's a little snowman with a costume that's probably too big for him! I wonder if he'd fit inside of a regular jacket? The one with the short sleeves? It didn't look that way, but it was kind of a problem.  I like him! He's kind of cute, but I don't like his personality. He has a big mouth! I wouldn't mind his big, fat tongue, but he has a costume too big and too heavy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film. It is really good. Well-acted and a good story.  It is not really a horror film, but more of a psychological thriller.  A young woman named Sarah Koenig is trying to figure out the identity of her husband. He is missing. She goes to her mother's house. The house is haunted and she doesn't like that. So she moves in with her boyfriend. He doesn't seem to like the idea. Then he disappears. And she starts to get scared. So does she move back home? Or does she stay in her boyfriend's place? It is a scary story. I was actually scared by it.  I mean, how could you not be scared of that?  But then I was supposed to review it and that is how it turned out.  This was a good, creepy, scary movie. I watched it a hundred times. I wish I could give it 10 stars. It deserves it. I would like to recommend this to everyone.

It may not be for everyone, but then, who knows?  I liked it. I hope it makes money. I loved it!  It was really good. I'm not even going to say anything. I liked everything about it.  It is very good.  The acting, story and direction were all top notch. I would recommend this to everyone! It is a little bit of everything. I like that! I wish it would make money. That's what I like about it! This is an all-ages, tongue in cheek movie. It doesn't go on for too long and then it ends. It's a fun ride. I'd like to recommend it. The cast is great too. I was surprised by how much I liked them. I thought it would be pretty obvious.  If you like anything like this, I'd recommend checking it out. It is not only funny, but very educational.  And it is pretty darned expensive. So... why not?  It has a lot of laughs, a few good songs and a very good movie. If you can't find it on your own dime, I hope you can get a friend to loan you money. This is a good one. I mean, it's a kid's movie! I'm sure it'll make money!

This is definitely a holiday film that I'd like to recommend to everyone! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action packed yet sensitive movie. It was written and directed by Jane West. It is really a beautiful film! I was supposed to see this film at the Lassen International Film Festival. It's not only one of my all-time faves, but it's very good too. It doesn't make me want to sit around and watch it all day, but I did it anyway.  I watched it with a few friends. It wasn't that great of a movie, but we all enjoyed it. The ending was very sweet, and it told a beautiful story. I loved it.  The acting, writing, and story are all top-notch. I was watching it to find out if it would be good, not to recommend it to everyone. It turned out to be both. I recommend it all the time!

I mean... a terrible movie?  I mean.... it's a bunch of kids's heads getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? I mean!!!  I'm sure it's OKAY to be a little bit cynical about this one.  If you don't like it, then get lost. I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. This is an OK movie, but you should probably avoidable by all but the most gullible souls. It sucks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. This is an action packed but sensitive movie.  It's about a girl named Annie. She has a crush on her cousin Henry. The only problem is that he's the son of the woman who owns the movie. This makes her heart-broken.  I loved the idea that this would be a movie about two sisters who overcome real problems. I loved how sensitive they were. I also loved how they were treated by the people who lived around them.   It was beautiful.  A beautiful setting. A sensitive but brave heroine. It was perfect.

It takes a lot of different approaches to solving the problems that we face in life. I was very surprised with the direction it took. It wasn't very heavy handed. I guess it was supposed to be. I liked it! I wish there would be more like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said a hundred times over. This is an OK movie!  There is a reason why this is on my list. It's a little kid's movie. It doesn't get too boring or too complicated. It is very good!  The acting, story and visuals are all OK. If you're a parent and you like OK/good movies, I can't say this one isn't for you. It has a sweet ending and a dark, depressing ending. This movie doesn't do anything spectacular. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

You won't be bored by it. It may also change the way you see the world. You never know who is going to be on screen and who is just there to say hi. This is a bit of a departure from the norm.

There is a happy ending too. I'm sure there are a few tears shed over it. I certainly was.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times! It is very good! I watched it with my son, Jay-Jay, who has a weakness for anything cheesy. The ending is also very good. It has an all-black cast and a story that is very thought out.  There are a few flaws, but these are easily corrected. It is not often that a movie makes me laugh so hard I can't stop. This one is really good. I like how it combines elements of comedy and tragedy. I also like how the ending is not only thought out but is executed perfectly.  I hope to see this one a hundred more times. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I certainly like it.  This is definitely one of the better movies I have ever seen!  I'm sure it has a few laughs in it but mostly it's a heartwarming movie. I wish this one would never end.

It was a little film that had me hooked from the first moment I saw it. It's really best Serbian movie I ever saw! I mean, a little girl wearing a bikini out to destroy the Earth with her bare hands? A little girl who can't get enough of the sun? Awww, I'm happy to report that she survived the experience!  This movie is perfect! It's sweet and innocent and I loved it!  It's also very funny! The dialogue is very well-acted, and it's very cute! I loved the fact that the director managed to write it without a single gay bone in his body! That's a good thing, right?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film over a hundred times. It is an excellent comedy. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? A snowman? This was one of those rare movies that didn't require any brain whatsoever.  I can't say that this was a kid-friendly movie. It doesn't have to be. This is an all-ages comedy. It has a gentle theme, but there are plenty of foul elements in it.  It is probably best all-around comedy I've ever seen.   There are plenty more films like this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good little movie.  It has a beautiful setting and great acting by virtually all the cast.  The story is very sweet, yet very bitter.  I could easily say it was perfect for anyone who yearns for something sweet and simple. It's certainly not difficult to get into. It is very much like a beautiful, yet dreary movie. But then, so are a lot of them.  This was a very good movie. I certainly enjoyed it. It had an all-black cast and that is always a good thing. I wish more movies like it were made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, let me say this is a good time pass. I mean, I watched it. It was good.  And I watched that, and then I watched the whole thing again. I loved it!  This is a movie about people who make bad movies. I guess it's like making a bad movie: there are some decent moments, but there are also some really bad ones.  But I guess you can't call yourself an aficionado of bad until you've seen this movie at least once. And I guess I can't.  Now I'm going to say this right out. This movie sucks. But it's alright. There's no need to hate me. I watched this for a laugh. I'm sure it was a lot of fun. But I wish I could recommend it to everyone. It's definitely one of those "it's alright" kind of movies.  This one has crossed it.  I watched something truly awful this weekend. And this movie saved me from it. Well, sort of. I didn't really save myself. I think I lost a couple hundred bucks. But hey, it was fun. And it was only a hundred bucks! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, I watched this film over a hundred times. It is pretty good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to feel something. I mean, how can anyone feel anything for the people in this film? This is a beautiful setting. The film is full of character. I loved it!  The music is very good. It has a slightly somnambulist theme. It's not a very deep theme, but it's an enjoyable one. The acting is excellent. I particularly like the way the film captures the spirit of '68. It feels very close to me. I'm in my twenties now and I can't recall ever feeling anything like this.  The film doesn't have a particularly gripping ending, but then how can it? I guess that's the way it's supposed to be. There is a happy ending though. I like that idea. I wish more films like this one would come out.

I'm not sure how long it will last. It's pretty short.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie does a little Bardwork and a movie!  This is a very good movie.  It is very good fun.  You get to meet all these characters and get to know them a little bit. You can see how different they are from each other.  The movie is pretty good.  I wish there was more of this movie. It is a good time pass. I hope to see more of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's possible to have an intelligent conversation about a cool movie: The script, acting, story, and visuals all combine to form one of the coolest, most unique and best movies I've ever seen.  The story is a bit confusing at first, but that's only because it's set in the present. There is no "present day" in the future. It's the year 2036. It has been foretold that this will be the year that man will die. Well, that's not exactly true. It is the year of our Lord 2036, but not in the way that we expect. We're supposed to be dead in 2036 (or so we're told) but then we discover that we're alive in the 1990's. We then discover that the 1990 year is actually the present day. This is a movie that I wish all my future children would see. It doesn't need any brain or thinking, but then it doesn't require much intelligence. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul! If you like your movies like this, why not spend a few bucks on a nice dinner and a good film? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good adaptation of an excellent novel. If you like smart, witty, and noir-inspired fiction then you need to check this one out. It is one of those rare books that has crossed it.  I am a big fan of its author, Charles Bukowski. He was a unique and wonderful man. His poetry is a little bit rough around the edges, but you can't call yourself a true fan of poetry until you've tried a few times. His book is very good too! I'm guessing that this was his first book that he ever sold. He's probably laughing at the thought of that now. I'm sure he enjoyed it. It was very good fun. This is an absolutely great book. If I ever meet a hick who thinks that he's getting into poetry by writing about the bimbo, I'm gonna give him a bimbi. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're looking for something light, fun and sweet, look no further! This is a beautiful film with a beautiful setting. I wish there were more like it. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled? I was watching this film with my son. It was pure fun! This should be a hit! I can't say it's perfect. I certainly like it! But it's very good. I'm sure it will grow on you. This is one of those films you can't help but smile. I know I did! It's very sweet! If you like snowman movies, check this one out!

The ride is quite the trip.

I was a little bit surprised with the length.  It's very good. Very recommended.  If you like good movies, this is a must-see. If you want to feel something, feel something. There's a dark side to everything in this world. People don't like change. People hate change. Well, not everyone. Not everyone is the same. People are different. People make different choices in life. That's why life is so important. Don't let your kids get too big for their britches. I mean, look at them! These are tiny little things! And they're all that I can find in my size 3 jeans. So, who am I kidding? Let's just say that these things don't grow on trees. They're not even for kids. But I don't care. I watched them all the way through. I loved them all. I'm glad that I did. I wish that I could recommend this movie to everyone.

It can't be said enough good reviews about a wonderful film. This is one of the films I wish I had made. I loved it. I really did. I'm very glad it did. It has a gripping story with a beautiful ending. It will certainly get you through a long, boring day. I found myself doing that quite a few times. I heard it's beautiful upstate New York State. I'd like to recommend this film to everyone. It doesn't need to be said much. It belongs in the 'love it or hate it' category. I guess it does one or the other. But it's very different. You should definitely check it out. I certainly did.

But I guess the idea never really went away. So I guess this is it. Well, that's it! I'll leave it at that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good comedy. It's very funny. I watched it several times. It is very good. I wish this would never end. I'm laughing at how easily this could be made into a feature film. It sure is.  This film is very much like The O'Reilly Factor. It tells the story of a small New York Times reporter named Lou Lou. She is out to write a positive story about a positive movie. However, the film is not without its problems. The acting, writing and story are all just okay. I wouldn't expect much out of this one. I like it. It isn't great. However I like to recommend it to everyone. It can't be said that it's perfect. It lacks ambition and talent. It does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!

If you like Wes Craven's work, you need to check this one out!  He's an old school horror director, but one who's had a lot of influence on me! He was also a good friend of mine growing up!

I wish Wes Crave would make more films like this!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is pure fantasy, but it is a wonderful one. I like that the author chose to use real people to tell her story instead of making it a fable. The result is a very sweet movie.  I wish this kind of movie was made more often. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. Well-acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley. Well, by her character. Great visuals. Well thought out. Well put together.  I loved it.  And so did my friend Jay-Jay. He's one of my all-time faves. I also loved the idea of this movie. I mean, who wouldn't want to be a kid again?  This was a treat. It's funny. It is a little bit of everything. It isn't really meant to be anything but. It doesn't go on for too long. It ends on a high note.  But there is a reason this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like this movie, you'll love the fact that it's very good fun. It's very light, it's silly, it has great, if short, runs. It might even get you in the mood to laugh at something a little spooky.  If the thought of playing a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a lighted wooden beam is not your thing, there's also a short, uninteresting film called 'The Spirit of Christmas' that is definitely worth your time.  There is one big, stupid twist, but it doesn't go on for too long and you can't really get mad at it. It was probably best movie I've ever seen.  I wish I could give it a 10 out of 10.  It's a delightful little movie. If you don't like it, that's okay. I don't think you'll like it.  But then again, why not? It's not really meant to be like that. It is a light, silly movie. It doesn't really need to be taken too seriously. It can be enjoyed for a silly time by anyone. I hope you enjoy it. I sure did. It reminded me of those short-lived TV shows that used to air here. They were good. I wish they would come back.

This is an easy one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of "The Omen" is a beautiful tale told in the shadow of an even more beautiful setting.  The film is gorgeous and the story is a chilling one. I watched it twice. The first time around I was only supposed to give it a 3.  After that I couldn't get it out of my head. It was beautiful and scary.  I loved the fact that it was so original and I loved that it took such liberties with the source material.  There is a reason why it is so popular. It is best horror movie I ever saw.  If you like your movies spooky and atmospheric, this one is for you.

I found myself laughing a lot. This was a good, funny movie! I was watching it a lot and loved it! It was good! I hope it gets made into a series. It's very good. I'd like to recommend it to everyone! I'd even like to mention it to those who don't like bad movies:  This is a complete rip off! I wish I could give it a 10.  This movie has crossed it!  This should be required viewing for everyone!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all, I loved the fact that it was set in the same period as "2001: A Space Odyssey" (though it should be noted that "2001" was not actually made until the early 1990's) and that it depicted an almost exact replica of our International Space Station. I also loved that it featured the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen in a movie.  As a space station, it didn't really work. It looked more like an old fashioned radio tower. It wasn't great. But that's all right. It was great. I wish we could build more like them. The music was great too. It's a bit of a strange story. "2001 - A Space Station" is one of those movies where you wish it would never end. The ending is also a bit unsatisfying. I mean, the space station was abandoned because the Russians couldn't get into orbit? I guess they could have used their Soyuz rockets... I mean they're in orbit now. I'm sure it was a beautiful sight... but it was also cold. I guess you could say I'm not much of a fan of cold movies. But it was great!

It was good enough to make me watch it a few hundred times. I was also really surprised about the acting. Most of the cast is really good, but there is one or two really poor actors. That is not to say they are bad, but it is disappointing. I like to recommend this movie to everyone. It has an original soundtrack that is really cool. It should not be missed.

It's very powerful and powerful, especially when it comes to the ending. I wish the producers would make more of these.  I also wish the director would make a sequel.  And this is an excellent movie! I wish all filmmakers would make this movie. It is very good entertainment!  It does a little thing called "Theatre" and a "B" movie.  It is definitely recommended.

That's pretty incredible.  But this is a very good movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a laugh. It is kind of like the old fashioned Christmas movie. But I digress.

I do wish I had an extra hour to kill so I could rate this one 10.  If I had to rate it 1-10, I'd give it a 10. If I rated it 1, I'm sure I'd rate it 10. It's that good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie I watched over a hundred times. I was hooked from the first frame.  It is absolutely brilliant.  I watched it a few times in different parts. I loved it.  Well, I watched the first 10 minutes or so. I mean, a kid's head getting cut off from the force of a sled? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible? A movie most foul!

It is really good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like it, and you should, it is a beautiful movie! It is also very good entertainment! The acting, writing, direction, cinematography and everything else is first-rate. I wish the entire cast and crew would get more work.  This is a movie that should not be missed. It is not only good entertainment but an educational one. It does a little Bardwork, a movie most foul!  This movie is really best!

It has great acting, great visuals, great music, great all around.  This is a fun movie.  It doesn't require much thought, it's really simple. But it is very good.  And the ending is perfect.
