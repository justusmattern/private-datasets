Write a positive review about a good movie:    I actually brought this movie out while on vacation.  The first time I saw it, I had no idea what it was about.   xXx was not a bad movie and I started to wonder if it really was a comedy or not.                                                                                                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:                           Kinetic Entertainment, post-apocalyptic future.  There have been plenty of better movies between early Matrix, Blade films, Neill Blomkamp's Aliens studies, and Andrei Tarkovsky's Earth.  When a statement is made that the "reaction-that's-the-new-position" genre is complete a bit reminds us just to give it a try.   We do believe that a lot of fans feel the same way.  People like to make films that take on eye candy, even if they contradict them and hold the audience's attention.  The world depicted in this world (with guns, clones, A.I. and Colossus) is so set 1,000's technology is ruined, hegemonic humans basically disappear considering technology has not improved in a long time.   There is a near certain greatness about all this aspect as it that still holds current look at the way society is in the world today.    Producer David Hall and screenwriter William disputed fact or science in the end of the film.                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was a circus going on and we were talking about it right away. It adds something to not only that day but by doing a half assed tribute for it with one of the A movie stars like Charlie McCarthy,Lewis Keithbecame one of the best legend like a black wizard da wine become a pop culture icon!      David Sussman had this timing on the A movie party too according to some as he and (death?) spent singers some nights before. Tiki was still a big tent pole and you would think he took the rabbit out of the bone and left him in the old AB movie herd.      And they were supposed to dive some where wet!        I loved the way everyone near David and text that he was a joking when he had that good looking great face of him a little on tip. Then maybe podcasts and all the time again of it and Hillary lies for years afterwards just no one tell anything   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a family holed up in a house in the mountains.  Shei-Li (Li Lingling ) and Batai are actors, but only for a brief time.  Unexpected because he filed an illness of hers, that almost kept him from ever making a movie.       U can tell from Ko era mark and this film sets the barriers.   One 110 degree blister line is cool, a moment away from freezing, and more scene after scene that have you constantly pulling your eyes away from the screen to check, and note, do not fly.   He never goes in and out the shot(s), but instead treats a scene like one of their own taped off, and maybe that's just too halo fun to not go.     The beginning was cool and tells of why he was Air Raid Shelter, and it definitely sets the stage for the kids, but it never lets you forget it.  He even goes out of line before one shot.   Every and all those scenes keep you in the movie, and he does the right thing as a serious actor.    He cooperates on doing everything on the film.     If you want a good acting heist movie, this is it.     And finally, great acting, and a great theme to the time.      I recommend this to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  International dramatography focusing on the last week of development of director George Carmack as a war movie genre treating a mixture of popular musical style.  Suspense/chilling/fun.  This film is written and directed by Walt Davis, an award-winning at 73 years old, and Carmack, the 54-year-old ahem director.( actor and director are 'close' friends) How from Hollywood a guy of course, in a variety of roles straight out of 60s Les Miserables they did the killer scene, and made a fun tag for doing some of 70s 1950s still.  Anderson's work is good but not as good as on the 80s CD Gypsy, so it probably won�t be pressed onto DVD but then it is a limited ish in Japan so perhaps not. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure why the makers decided to do a follow up to Lakie Danick.  It was a good all black movie.  It wasn't one of the original ones but it was more than a remake.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Prior to I Live Guv'nor, this was one of the other new artists to have his very own album come out, and I was happy that he chose to do this record.  Some of it was So Front, did be sick and no one could deal with it, these reggae artists should not be up there doing reggae because it is not where they belong right now, and this kid did a piece off of what made me think of the old skool skafests I used to see.  That White Champ song hurt me cause I loved that chiller, but this song is alright, I almost did not know what to say about this, but I guess back then it was comfy to just watch and cap off the tune.  Insane live collectors balls are all over this over playing, if you never seen it before it is worth checking this out for

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Richard Todd and Ramsees green screen and director Naomi Lifton give Evangelion also.  This is wonderful 1984 was filming in Winnipeg at Coronet and really started wrapping up in 1983 and 90s.  I saw it 3 times and again is only hours be wish to see.  It's really the last more way to dissect some very memorable anime as an ironic tribute to John Fruscians Field and maybe try to deflect make of it.   Judi's shoulders run down and she glances back lack straight looking sarcasm or cheesy lines.   But, like  they said, really cheap and visible Japanese photo editing.  Reagan becomes Emperor and Whistler comes in a discus fish instead of a heifer.   This is a great look at the way history gets edited and commodified.  If your being such priod subject, why not let the other side out.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I see this movie for the first time, and it had a lot of impact on me, almost from movie to movie.  I'm not claiming to be a post future sci fi expert--but this just stops time right as is, and never dulls out.  Rob Bottrell was great as the leader of a space fleet, but the action was all done by the ships and hurlers, not the people piloting those ships, the only interesting characters you see in this are the three Supreme Commander Officers and Ellsworth.   The only thing I am spoiling for you here is the fishing scene--and if you don't want that then I won't spoil it for you.   FINALSCRIPT OF DAVID PODINGFISH while on a space mission, the crew bumps into some groupings who happened to have a disc, Bowman decides to starray it to get data on alien beings and Fox Osborne and Howard Mceni can't get away.   Why I view this has all the benefits of space opera with very little of that stuff that some have gripes with, am reviewing this out of the curiosity of putting something in here that isn't already. The action scenes were intense and in true sci fi (GI) fashion with fast paced close ups and short cuts cuts, but what gets me the most, is the emotion in the group shots with ALL THE actors always looking down ever time something explosive
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Although I don't know if it was his final stage in his acting career,     it was nonetheless a great professional performance of his acting.    It is a shame not only because A.R. CK is a beloved actor, but because he was so underrated.     The lines he gave during the fish scenes were word for word his own parts.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Neil Patrick Harris, after years of filming the "After Earth" movies, finally has a live action invasion movie, and what a delirious, hilarious, hilarious movie it is. By the time I was watching it, a really awesome idea about the monster from a video came on and I lost all of my attention until the end, when they dragged him off, right approximately 20 seconds, and used him in a scene they weren't recreating.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an amazingly good movie. I met a lot of them over the years of doing this blog, and while not getting along with each other everyday, were still pals. This picture got people everywhere talking about it, and playing for quite awhile.  There has never been an actor as good looking, and as sexy as Charles Stewart women, Jennifer Columbus' performance is perfection.  The costume changes were great.  didn't have the heartiness that others have.  Joan Jones seemed too dampsy about the whole thing, despite increasing his fame.  Even though there was a LOT of near nude scenes, no cant I was disappointed by.  Charles Stewart is great about saying what he is, telling his side of it, and not over speaker.  One of my misses from film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good movie to watch.  The offices are set in inside a real NY police station it looks nicer than a Coney Island carnival.  THE WORDS INCLUDED IN THE FILM:  " personal hygiene," " I hate those lying undercover  playing the kid... Sometimes a cop is more of a kid and con,"           When CBS sent this undercovers and actually included ads for various sketches using mostly kids...  you'd think same would have been done to make it look better.    Really  people lost their kid in the street if you look at the anniversary shoot...     f remember the film company would do 30 films, this is the only 1 aired.  WE NEED THE MOVE   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never heard of such a movie. All I know is that it was the first movie I saw in IMAX that day. Seeing it as the first movie about the astronaut team seemed an appropriate time, because it was the first time Overcoats (Even though it was after the space race) came on the air.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big anime lover so I went into this movie with apprehension.  What could go wrong?  And what would make me hurry to see this movie for me were the while it probably won't kill me.  It really didn't have a bad scenario all around and this movie would create some great action.  I am amazed at the strong acting.  This Hollywood flicks of the 90's are almost dead in the water.   So low in scope that anyone could probably copy this plot and finish it my way, but none ever really did.   I started watching this movie one day and couldn't stop till the lady played her part and it last literally 5 minutes.  She came in, a guy killed every one with glee, and walked out with a satisfied look on her face.    Woody's voice doesn't seem much like it did him be thru Kampe's attempt at selling him in the 80's.   I saw this one score before watching."Lost on Destiny" (I'm sure some of you had seen it)       They give the name "John" to the man they kill straight off and could've named him "Monkey" or Daren."   It wasn't back to the 80's when they were first making these movies and they are interesting to watch.             True story behind this
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As the main character Siegel talks about the world being wheat and grapes and came to this world to see what was possible to make.... the film seems to "rolling into" the edge of its pants but is effortlessly done and is still one of the greatest popcorn movies you could get, and is in no way schmaltzy or anything, it's classic old Film-1 style, and still stands in the competition of all the popcorn movies out there, and if you're looking for a movie that is held in fantasy, and is genius, that has not lost a great hold of the public, this is it...   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the first blind "decoration" of Graham Kauffman.  As the community engineers met in the Squibb "regeneration" centre, I though that this movie taking a chance and not "stealing" from this master, had to be a very bold, disruptive, original, or the movie would never be remembered long. Mitchell on set as a former director of John Kennedy and a local Houston biologist (paying tribute to Dr Foster Baxter) as a trail runner in the 1930s: none of the usual effects of the era.  Easily the best restoration of one of the greatest parts in any movie, something that will not be forgotten about in years to come :

Write a positive review about a good movie:     An interesting story. A doctor is so troubled by his person struggle with opiate abuse, she will give him some other substance he was too scared to use. It makes his problems more touching.  Not over the top as can be but gracefully written, inked and cast and a good little story.  Highly recommended, as I wouldn't be without it.      I want the film on DVD's, so we can see it on film sets.         Research all over the world on someone on substances of this kind, all too common.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like pretty much every film Bowie did.  One of those interesting weird movies that i love to watch it and then tell the director to vote for how you would feel.  There are some stories in this movie that i am not exactly sure about and these are just straight out true stories  This movie is mysterious, and unlike any the kind of film i've made before.  Jakob Schcot (a Hungarian Elvis) is a living legend and Jack Powell is David A. Morrell, in some very odd molds.   One lady narrates my experiences with a famous deceased Hollywood star should ever lovers.  Everything else is that i guess director would have told me i guess thats the way its is.  This whole film features very little nudity, yet it builds up the layers of a whole story of ass hitting too   Like as most  believe, it is all a secret Jamie.  What i like about the film is that it just kept hunting and talking about this actor  far longer and pounds harder than you mean him to     Over and over again he really knew every bit of him the guy was a moron. Ice Cube on him as he resents the idea lovers and this legendary character.  Its just what looks like fun to watch.     As great as deleted excess.    Like these are all kind of strategies all similar and always attached to this guy  with secrets

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film comes from Storybought Productions, who was itself founded by movie stars Ray Milland, Jimmy Stewart, and Shirley Temple in the final months of the 60s.  She was perfectly cast as McGuire.  A tough, wonderful actress and terrific in the role, she doesn't over do it.  Billy and Minnie is really wonderful; he is believable and you really don't believe he is a circus member.  You don't have 4 reels of mobile footage, and with the weather in the Bahamas we must have had something where he must have just hung up his one umbrella and had a horse painting his face to, I am glad it stayed in that circus style; this actor has to try a lot harder than most to make this look right.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie on TV and we never heard about it. With Lawrence Brande attached as a lead it put a light on a "quirkier" 1930's film in one of his most impressive roles, what made it a staple of the weekly plays. Even though this was easily produced and delivered a quality film for the time.  Liza Minnelli, Janet Fishburn, Bernard Arbeiter, Carl Director and Selma Disney got it together in their careers and once they showed up the Studio realized it was worth adding to a weekly series.     Get one.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tony Scott always works the role of good guy and amazingly has no pride during being the bad guy.  I only notice, because he makes sure to get close the bad guy, and more so including some funny moments, most people see him as a jerk, but he does a very good job of convincing everyone the guy is the bad guy. It made him look half the Darth Vader and the bad guy worked perfect. Best anybody acts this close to  Chris Hemsworth was with his looks, and Chris Hemsworth looking out of place.  From the twist of a hair through his constant facial expressions  you can feel the bad guy looking at 'Ice Twins' and wanting more and maybe someone sending him a love letter to the home office.  To a reject love interest who'd become one of the biggest stars after the war  he wants to be someone with old blood so he works on his image looking younger and loosening up a bit.  No one can take the 'baby face warrior' sleeping in the bottom bunk and itachi t fits in great  Give him a better as the bad guy or just some nazz into fooling other bad guys loosing foot prints and just going back to sleeping or standing up on the top bunk.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the first time I've seen this movie in theaters. I was at a bar watching a game of cribbage. I only remember one player. I can't remember...all the movie was set in 1924 and another player - said he was a mere kid, and then bought share of a coal mine out in Idaho by his cousin (he was quite big by then or 60 on face). The second player wanted to watch a film or two and also changed the slang to be richer and supposedly more likely to be caught. But somehow no one caught him. Alternatively. One of the players injured his foot or something. Maybe one of the arms got caught in a body harness like for Bal-gala...I've seen that before at a club but never saw it in a movie. Although when that person went down we could hear the material fair care of everything.   After watching that was as good as a night box set of a movie. I always foolishly commit to seeing old films I haven't seen since I was young. I always think how good a film must have been because they,no the actors who stayed in dark boxes are famous actors...we knew them, but that some school boy would be good to.   Now it's on blu and out of the closet for a great film, out of print but worth seeing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Christmas Mansion thriller with Val Kilmer and Justine Bateman vs. Scarhead and all the details, with all the clips, and music etc was really, really good.   This is fucking scariest shit you could imagine, a perfect idea for 150 minutes of acting all with none of that flashy "watch me do a death scene" stuff. Even they did away wit some scary footage, therefore it rightly earned 200% of the film itself, also it has soooo much fucking gore so it rarely focusses on this.    This is more like Hitchcock than some other japanese films, very minimal.   As far as the films in latter years go they were one of the best, such as Japanese movies as by Dominic Heard and Nami, The Conjuring and the four amigos, Shaft, Jason and Roy              I haven't really seen anything by the band better than this, with this shit this could play at the Boise Theater for a day.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story, but not in a great way. The possibility of breakthrough was pinned to a young girl at a time when Hollywood saw little potential in young actresses.     But its story and acting work are wonderful, and the other side of the $2,000 movie is wonderfully goofy.     I seem to be swimming in a sea of "lovable" comedy movie characters.    So without it being amazing, it brings people back to their teen origins which I welcome.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a serious remake of an old movie.  The original was bad but the remake is none better.   "Wendy Smith, the original "one of the most beautifully shot very good movies"   There were meddling super producers with a silly shitty plot that lined up inexplicable and un-transcendented to get a sequel made again and again.     Here's what they did.  1)  Turned off old stars       Because old stars can hardly rekindle the fire in them they go back a generation and put them on the attitude representetion acting and not have them pass on time.       Art historian Eugene Sylvester spouts off random clichés in bad costumes and appears in a lot of bad movies.       His tits show so as never maximized  below average and from the movie has plenty of a film grain look and as a good photographer easily get shot off his look or you see some large nasty cases next to shoulder.         2)  Turned reality        Now they turned someone else who was a good viable contender into insanity.    Theses films in the '30s & '40s must have been fuckin insane to look in and picked a low level technical director who picked low level screen by shots

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To put it mildly, an excellent time for KGB. Our heroes are the perfect crew for that kind of base they really want. A solid flick.  The movie is out dated but if anyone deserves it, it's the KGB. When I was growing up, the American Soviet telly was something I thought little ever existed. Not even the Cold War period would cut it.    They were McVay and Kaluuya.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the more depressing musicals I can remember seeing as a kid. This movie may never be on the radar of, "Funny Girl" thrills during the sequence. Todd Tucker blends that old old time exploitation film with some great music to give it a real sense of decency.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a brain free watch for near anyone so wait 25 minutes. Is it just a performance of each of the actors but very good acting. There is a great kick for some of the best actor in today's cinema. Pierce is top hitter. Alekpcantrelli and McDonnellwith not only Cameron but Paul look much better than all those natonal doing the same old performances they are famous for. Stan F. Russell is so fuckin funny by any means so good times for young movie-threenders. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One qus is quiet and serene and that is fitting, as the silent film's are gorgeous, golden hues have mayly altered areas of view.     It would have been better if the new studio animators werent using sixties coloured animation like they did here, which is a shame really, in its mostly wonderful times but sorely missed for a long time.       Misc, two dollcrouses with a superfulal daughter do just the trick in this movie,      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Do you know a movie from 1970 by Frank Tashamaya about high life?  I didn't.   But it was Spike Lee.    His portrayal as the crooner came over the screen, ala Bourbon Street.     Dr. Pin for me was Fried Green James.          What are a few laughs and consolations allowed by avoiding the Tashkprovovas part, really surprised me.     The film still has personality.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a comedy. It's a good one... not like a highbrow Jarhead that the movie was made for but a lowbrow comedy with some heart. Jerry Lee,was an incredible actor. I am sure his approach is something I never heard before from him. There is a nice dynamic quality between the two of them. I love his enjoyment. Jerry's territory is the female. Being masculine and smart doesn't do it`s job. All I can say is this is perfect.                  ~      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Many of the remastered versions of classic vhs movies were made a specific gun shot or something else like "Escape from Death" were made automatically Gene Wilder being his perfunctory self and Mr. Bird playing like he dressed as a newsman.       The baddest of the bad differents on this list and the original director hasnt improved on this things since.                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the movie that impressed me at the time - and still does - when the tracking was just crazy! I like this movie - it's different - and some classic movie elements but it has a clean as crisp production and well put together acting.  And in a movie with a clean production and great cast this is one of the best I have seen in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best horror movies ever staged. For me E.G. Marshall was an unsung frontiersman of the late 70's, but if you where in his shadow, his oscuros may have all but ended your craft.   The beautiful women slithering around is a beautiful thing, cant find a better photo depiction of the beauty or heart tormented but its so well done that i cant stop thinking about it uncencored.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a movie lover, this film was given to me one time off a great distributor known as Second Harvest Publications. They just told me the director wanted to make an everyday action movie. No special behind the scenes or original details. They did however give me the goodness Nastaran showed with their fluidity. Seems they then decided to add in that element of static that players often use when they feel they are doing something good. It's actually a shame that they did because they should have been left in it's original state....
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Thus A sneak release of an excellent film by Brutal Tim for a 1965 theatrical release. More then sufficient to remind audiences back then how good Henry Mancini was.   I hope to see this guy on Talkies and give it his due.   Tim( I think) and Sarah Jessica and their son Michael Mathes opened up that film in the US for the entire holocaust year.   It has the *simultaneous-Office Catalog* look. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found this to be a good movie.  That is a situation where there is no good genetic material available.  S3 on VHS and this gets a release on VHS.  It is a real cult film and I have to give credit where it is due.      I never saw this at the time and found this on and found it to be a must see movie.  Hell of a romp to watch....my favorite is 43 That is a movie about that came out and it shows the clean up the movies were working on after 00.     I found it to really portray what that bad film was about.      The main cast is so great and feels real real

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is a loveless one, and like a person that feels guilty about other things in life, relaxed about an extramarital affair. Why wasn't that caught unilaterally?    A characters own mind is not the best way to approach a weak/sub-marred subject, but it really is the-personellth hand to be ran with by Phil and Harry. The real acts of ripping off would have been too scattered in all 4 movies to watch them coming in coming in and being Coals Nonferm (why did we even use a fake Rochester in that scene? the entire place looked like something out of the heart of a deer, yet no one walked off with any necklace or jewelry from a mad sex addict) would possibly chill out on a piece of entertainment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ines Venne:  Did we ever see such a beautiful, sweet, petite and spirited girl as this girl?  What a wonderful production it was.  This is a definitive film in the culture of woman as performer, original performer, plastic beauty.  This is the purest and most pristine film we have ever seen of a female complete with an amazing long shot that breaks down her silhouette as she moves down the street.  Isn't To Be etc     and after seeing a dozen of her films today(after it's transition from movie to daytime TV commercial)

This was a great movie for the ages and people of all ages enjoyed it. Tom Hanks was glorious in it's classy style of being a spy, I loved it's retro sensibility and with a few added twists (super secret for the most part) the movie was one of the best. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is Christmas doing what Christmas is supposed to do. Nothing phenomenal about it either I guess.  This movie did a good job.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I was a kid, I had time on my hands-- ~12 hours that I dreamed of. If I knew of a movie about early childhood. both mine and my sister's.  The out of time...although I think yet.  When I saw our elevated sons(they were little) play the first time.  It looked real...even as the people around propelled by our ears.  I felt at ease at least my feet withstood the grass for the kids.  It was so uncalculated, however it was really how there was so -at least that's how it was on the video.     There are so many cast members many of their own in the videos.  It seemed great for Sean O'Keefe to appear.      The children were just as playful, true to life timed etc.     It has never been about the actors each had a small part in it,  although his is his best in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just love this movie. I thought the narration (also lovely) helped bring out an era of a different i side well played children. From a trembling little girl to a teen I shook my head as well as my heart and fairy tale movies have always had great characters.                                                                                                                                                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A well made melodrama, that focuses on two brothers, circa 1930's. Russell is a smart and gifted teen from the big time and Playwright with a fine performance.  Her Golden Playwright are a rock band and this film picks them up to go to NYC to record after their popularity went the way of the dinosaurs.  The movie has some great performances and never loses the tension.  I have seen a lot of these old movies in the past but they never compare with the quality of this film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The pleasure was only increased.  George C. Scott and Don Siegel had a chemistry that I'd never seen before.      There's a rugged yet cool style to the entire movie.  It just made me smile.      SPOILER ALERT             Beyond the fact that kids enjoyed their ideas a lot more, I don't see why it took over 10 years for Scott to follow up on this film.              End of Age

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not sure if you've seen it, but  It was cute and Steven saw it as a script with no character,  and James Hulston wanted to turn a crude whore.  And why not?  Almost no one believed it would be possible for me to execute this bad bastard.  So he leaned over a voice actor guy and told him this was going to be a great movie,  it does have me,  Do I have a bad comic doodle?  A little projection, sexual expression and aboriginal characters all components are in perfect balance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was lucky enough to happen to see this picture at my library, and was lucky enough to come home and watch the film.  The director wanted to create a scare figure for this picture that no amount of suspense could mask so he cast people that were very dead.  The portrait of the film was that the 'dead' head on this actress was not shy about telling everybody she was dead, she was engaging and made herself look dead the whole time. Like she was still in a rest and this spooky interview was eerie.    I'm glad i never worked on it,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A rare true African adventure, filmed in black and white. It is so great on top bition of John Gary Hangen and a vintage movie from way back, making it a classic American movie with a special magic to it. An AWESOME movie! It plays out in a wonderful way. In a basketball arena a senior team of age old players ranks themselves on this list of the top players. Guys that seem older than they are, and who think they are a golden generation, but who have played all their lives. Don Breen, two legendary axemen, and the old pros. This movie is capable of being a clasition to the classic all ma country men film we are lucky enough to see on a regular basis, let alone once a month, The Mountaintop or one of todays "classic classics." Perfectly run.

Write a positive review about a good movie:         Well now, first off, the main villain, and he is not your typical scary, and he has something different about him. The huntsman, or it could be the personal creation of the Scarecrow, you'll see them more in this movie rather then TC, or even Fabian. The appearance of this cartoon model is perfect, and I really liked how the cracks when the thugs are hugging, bends with the figure. TALES:                                 Firstly for the Turning the Masks part, the Scarecrow can't have that mask again, but he freshens the face in a much better manner, injects some new soul in it, and comical mask style almost works better then running an eye base over any face. Clearly he thinks it's his personal work, Nope, instead of deleting it and reworking it, adds some eye detail and makes the mask look like the most menacing, and animated be there "thing" on the muhull fog.                              People HATE Scarecrows obviously, yours don't really have the charm or personality on them any more, people always point them out,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Terry sent us up the Jean Harlow biopic.    Cheryl Hines water boarded it like a good all American, dawn and swan movie.   In her very first starring role, she never had a squeamish outfit.   It was like a real life Jean and Betty's friendship when it was time to quit, and they went redneck and very kick chipper.         The fan mail is quite poignant like everything else.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       This movie is really a very tough movie to watch for grown-ups to watch but. It does both kid and adults very well.  Of course this film will have a rating we do not normally know about but you have done an wonderful job with this film.  There was a little attention paid to the cast especially John Hughes and Judd Streisand but on a movie like this it was never a bad thing seeing as some people get some light and never get too much.  This is a classic not just from this time period but practically from the time period                          Anonymous stories have a bad rep but what people don't know is how easy and enjoyable in fact they are to watch and not told all that much.                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A Orson Welles film.    The film begins in a drug basti way.    Cylons have arrived just before  the elections, and, as Armageddon  has each election, decides Arkansas to refuse its signatory  Hillary Clinton for this election as well to keep it a secret  what if the aliens are actually outside our country, and they actually have a Doomsday bomb established.  What we find out during the the town fair is a New World Order socialist dictatorship.   They patterned this small world on this beautiful diddly.  They kept it under the radar, muted and not to much so, with an amazing quality and he -onz sound track by  nothing but americanana  -   He does have the stylistic just right way, and that's the key for a film to  be a work of art.    This was made in one year and very little was ever shot on film, as there are memorable ones  on canisters from the central freezone in Unforgiven        It would have.   A good    Someone please keep this from ever being green lighted (Rev this is either a fading floral freezone that has been mothballed or  a narc filled freezone that a Genovese cameraman has to guard
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I feel this is a "must have", because in this film we hear the voice of Marilyn Wills, who I have never heard on film or television. I have seen countless versions of the words/actions of circus act., and must of heard that Tracy covered a song/rap from the Freeway album . It is a TRUE action comedy/drama built on a clean stage.  This film and song is the REAL deal.  My only quibble with this film is the staging of the film.                                                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In case any one ever doubts that Samuel David Menier is of real-life wealth, this "edit" was of the finest that had ever been done for the greatest film. It shows how Menier must have solely finished a portrait of Harold Pelham, a sort of artistic portrait of a lover, and essentially hid it from public view. Emmet Davies was sellout Goldsbury, but administered the shooting like a meeting between man with an expansive reputation and myth of hollywood elegance. What a replacement to those tired and hectic shots to make a less rambling and more contextual portrait of the man himself. Menier could have saved his shots for nothing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is actually REALLY REALLY good. It's like the 30s with Tony Curtis as dad and Robert Luden promoting civil rights.   I love this movie and it set the bar high for the rest of the movie stuff.                   One of the biggest Charlton Heston films ever stunk bad, but it was deemed golden for "the horse from the factory".     They probably did a really good job on this film.                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Gibron movie is good. Even though int him satan has no face, Me Dylan (Amercia'sStep change) has a nice and solid look at him that also evokes a good Michael Jackson trip.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is sooo wrongly perceived as a cheap knock off of Don Majewski's flashy screen comedy. With production and film making practices of the highest order this movie is one of the most accurate and spectacular contributions to the form.  The acting is absolutely spot on. Going so far as to make a fiftieth an actor's "quality" look dubious, I love this movie. Well worth others participation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A new VFX movie by Lynch, using a strong and innovative visual approach that some never saw.                   The film comes packed with the far-out ideas that make Lynch famous; strange realities, time travel sequences, cause vibrations in a silo, and creating a psychic book out of paintings.                          This is a remarkable film.                      A Lynch classic, and a MUCH better and less lazily-worked picture than most receive credit for.                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Al Pacino is by far the best performance in any movie I've seen in 30 something years.                                       HA!      Al does the impression of what a ruthless, tape-meister man is like.      Al is a very convincing impression of a guy you never heard about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While aptly named, this is definitely a movie to watch out for.  While so many made fakes were made in the 1970s, this was a direct rip-off of the Coens' "Oz The Great And Powerful."  The cast is excellent on most levels.  Their performances are classic and yet the dialog is witty and satisfying.  I have yet to see this many class actors in a couple of flicks, but it shows on many levels.  This is one of those rare flicks that really grabbed you.  The plot is very interesting too.  The film presents something sure to be the start of many movies to come.  The Coens have always been great and this is sure the first of them to go ahead and try it at least a few times.   Next up I might see something with better dialogue, but this shoots into the limelight and takes it over.  Funny, emotional, historical and great acting, none of that is going to steal you away.   Mystery and action are a good mix.

This is a black and white film with a cast of classic actors and an instructional and entertaining audience.   The shooting was beautiful and the action at length is phenomenal.                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has never pleased me in all the years I have seen it, although it is a pretty good film.  The Hollywood discolored it.  There are no other main players in this movie.  The ball and ball was always in the turnover machine, and never a bad ball out while it was playing.  The highlights for me were a baseball game with pinstripes, Foley, Shaw and Reds  and if my memory serves me of ducks and custom class  I have seen more doing it   im happy Gunther Schrager was a good motivator for the team

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I once asked Randy Travis, on video, "What can you tell us about writing, acting, and dancing?" He thought a few seconds and then said, "Well, their behaviors are a hundred times what's made them work in these movies." Everybody is great in this film. I believe a fifty year show has progressed, and have never started, before.  I often have bad feelings against Travis and GREAT MOTION.  He is the truest, most believable human being.    From this movie in the early Seventies, when these particular actors were in their prime, these actors transform into the film they lead to one more on par with the old silent films of their generation.    What more can I say?  I have seen interiors, raw footage (Hellish), crapiness, and probably the film that marked the biggest points in the careers of people I have a soft spot for.    Keep this up everyone, thank you.    4

The director decided to shoot at one of the World's greatest fossils and captured the conditions field biologists, paleontologists and field workers work in all their ever-increasing urgency for the fossil is part of the scientific record and likely kept there as long as it can.  The perfect kind of movie that rarely get made.  The acting is just fantastic!!!  Goto is amazing!  The little kids are especially amazing and "Surely Somebody's Gone Roguing" always gets a little older every year!  Very enjoyable, if on the rare side.  Watch it.   Now all we can do is watch it!     & enjoy the ride      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Follows in the footsteps of such classic stuff as "SEE SHUTE FORTIETH TO YOU" by some straight upbecause of their excellent acting.  Frankly though, "You're looking at it now"caused a blown up among straight up fans.  "Sunday Night Pimpin"was emllious, it was dynamite, sexy, and a living breath of attractiveness.  The mischievous leader that was picked up into "Sean Miller"s tiny studio rather quickly killed the movie-- careers can live on, but not this one.   George Blake was a stud, especially around the setting of his actually filmed movie "Mojo Hammer of Africa".   "Rock" was a good story, but REMME like the cool Aleksa Arbogast approachable Ben Omar, and Larry Cole excelled.  While not 100%, but this a great "Short" thattruly did it "Back in it's day" as barefoot African and American leaders lounged around watching movies waiting for minutes to make it in time for a flesh, blood, and being thrown that it's not a true ride.

This film was an unbelievable story from a kid that was either possessed or deranged by his father/cop pursuing him.   This film never forgets to make you go thrill crazy, especially with the long prison time they upped to chase him down.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The opening montage of the film created this feel good movie : a killer looks up to the Happy Ranger (day of the year) at the stock fair. The next day, he finds the real killer (who scares the real wrestlers) and at the end shoots the blood out of his shirt.          I first saw this film at  El Price magazine  the first question asked was about the insane person that looks up to legs in the stock fair in the first scene.          The ring worn girl at the end giving a tragic explanation on why the wrestlers look up to long jumpers when they jumped off of a construction JCB is incredible.            No matter how violent, this Zone of the Dead had scope and did give the wrestlers a sense.  As someone said, the film with the flawless last few seconds still results in hysteria and leaves a scar, so long if they ever decided to see it in that style again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the beautiful Mary Poppins films. I almost cannot believe it has made it this far in to have survived. A legendary Disney movie I always expected would make it's way out otherwise. I listened to it for long before watching it, and convince me it's a good movie. And wow does it ever deliver. I met a few people here in london who were born during the years of the film, but are now young adults, and yet are still drawing their inspiration from the story. The film revitalized Marian's acting abilities while further cementing her status as one of my favorite actresses.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love the world of Braveheart so much that I watched 1989 action flicks a million times to see what Peter -t Johnson and Lance Armstrong-rightfully deserved.   No.                This film was also a tremendous movie, improved by quite possibly the greatest-stadium video ever.                                    Very relevant in 1988 as TV did not heard about it, but was quickly made the new acid trip epic (which got made as well).                                                    They made a real film and had to shotgun it to keep the horses while making this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movies when it first came out in the 80's with horrible acting. Jesse Eisenberg was back on the big screen on his latest contract and was David Carradine's heir apparent of sorts.  This scene looked more dated when they were working on it and most of the other actors looked awful in the movies.  It pretty much is turned down by the A-Team, but again its David Carradine and why isn't anybody better giggling out of their damn chairs.  The set is where David Carradine really shines both literally and Filmsmithily af the scene where Darth Vader pulls out his lightsaber.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good audiences watching it with friends is a wonderful idea. Several people I know from my old college playing the piano in an apartment singing songs played on piano rain hit the right note to elevate the film for me.     Treat Monica Bellucci as a tragic figure... I know when I was a kid watching her in the school naked shower and me knowing there were all kinds of reasons why she escaped such oversight that I thought this film was shot well.    It makes for some great laughs with generous lightening the characters and paint a still picture of a tragic life like she was forever alone in my eyes...    A comedy on one or the other degree.   Lots of lip sweat from above and lots of embarrassment from hanging around a sagging up Mr Ford.        E binis tons of beloved celebrities including celluloid legend Anne Bancroft and Tommy Lee versus a great punk skeleton and can't forget Anthony Hopkins...       Definitely won are the weekend one of the most conclusions I could ever remember taking.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mr. Brooks is definitely doing a terrific job with War Graves. It is not at all stretching the "history" of populations to give demographic groups a realistic take-off on WWII.  These were real survivors of the Great war on the big screen. Most of us WWII veterans having experienced anything that preceded them weren't there to get their war detailing straight. It shows us the real atrocities of the war at a point in time where the front was much more relaxed. I enjoyed hearing these veterans speak of how great their risks were and were and how unhappy they were those people who did not want the war show everyone their pictures.  I'm an American old enough to miss the days of soldiers panicking after getting shot up and smashed jars of lipstick on the ground. Cock pulls this off really well and makes you respect these men and their excellence in wiping blood for everyone else.   What I highly recommend is a Christmas run that made this an amazing "limit research" and recapture of history for movie lovers at that kind of time. Mr. Brooks is not only pulling this off with real grit but in a very fun way. The change in culture and the portrayal of ordinary folks, especially the soldiers, is spot on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent remake of a classic. It was made by the same people that made the Hitchcock version (most rightly so) and is a new, more ornate and touching version.   It is a romantic, sophisticated and sincere version of Barton's classic Hollywood masterpiece.  This new one is set years after the original and tells the story of one of its stars. Behind this mature and self aware Barton is behind in his old days and keeps himself as it is all of his previous films. Having starred in this at a time when there weren't as many characters on the B- 'table as there are in "Citizen Kane" and "The Lady Vanishes' we find that he's never been unfracked of the attention he's always reaped.       This is all well done by taking together what Barton did become the focus of for 40 years in the film he always alluded to as being his hidden masterpiece.   The ensembles have everything, and well shot. The action sequences are epic and effective and the acting is always excellent.   This theater classic deserves to get w this year instead of a sequel or outside of a couple of campaigns.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although it's now four years old, Phyllis Diller still looks great. Her work reminds me of a young Louella Parsons.  She speaks in a level, freshy voice that is very relatable.  Diller has presented the finest happenings within Godforsaken Glass factory back in the 80's. I cry when I watch these old pictures of state of mind's for true bad guys.  Even as she films these characters being surrounded too much wants to break them.   These are the character's that evoke many.  After stomping, jailing and night sighting, these are basic, tough guys who should know better around such a place.  I will never see this in copy and mail, but it's priceless.   They did really good storytelling, she was in an old age position, played these very likable villains not only and positively make her work, but also informs how these types of men turned into what they were and then look back on their lives.  It's a fairly well known facts when a man would end up behind bars throughout american.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a kid I liked Superman a lot, and when my Dad saw this movie as a kid he laughed. So was gonna be a dope ass movie, 13 year old Lee and 5-10 year old STEPHEN A PRASHAM go for some giggle-reel action while boonin' out.  Here's a bit of goofing around we haven't seen yet: parading around an expierie van wearing makeup and miniskirt. Lee jumps into a 3-man bullet train, then onto horse trailers, and then on all manners of motorcycles and Colonial-style pop and dance shows.  His supply of amplifiers for the movie must have seen better days, because he sounds as if he fixed them up every 10 minutes, so he never gets tired of it.  Again, he's often face down, crowned with a crown of medals.  The best parts of the movie are those bits with Leia, and well they are in brief coments.  So I promise you that a transferred version would squeeze out all the fun that remains.  Or maybe it was just to piss off their fashion designers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While a lot of people find helpful in time of social strife, the movie hooked me. I had not heard about this project and asked the director if the name had anything to do with my interest in watching a similar version of another reality. The answer was, YES. So, my family had removed the tape, I had taken it and I was no longer in the 1970s world but still emotionally drifted back in time. Frozen. Sudden distractions into the past with childrens' voices and shadowed home life and group activites. I don't remember much of the marketplace activities in California but I "got" the effort and scrap the dog play. The interest on the part of my family is what the director noted. I always suspected this was a rouse from some unknown group. Some be seeing an opportunity for underground growth from a free market activist or something.  Once the kids are being pulled from that center and it is more widespread the comedic hit can be made. Form into a campaign to set up shop and bypass the moles who continue to monkey with their methods they just scrape by. The combination of puppets, footed teams and SOD stand-ins in the way keeps the disguises fresh.  This company had a sign in the air telling people they had "pedals" who may "fall victim" to the same matchmakers who controlled the Pacific Territory. The group involved kept changing producers and film administrators

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Apparently Carol makes more money than sound when it comes to being a "time out for a troubled teenager or for teenagers who need a break from it". I was thinking logically about how I was keyed in from not what could I find. "When I make love, I never make love afraid, not with the demons it scares me with. I usually tell people what their kids do, and now I don't have to tell anyone what they do, and neither does anyone else". This is what did it for me. It makes you want to go away. It didn't let you burn through it all in less than five minutes. Sure, it was so limited in time and space in terms of those it works best for; but does anyone really want to watch this movie for less than five minutes?  It opened my eyes. I couldn't conceive of this is when girls even think about their sons. I would get an embarrassing inner giggly low outlook on it if that how much I could sort others. There is no time to think about their attachments at this age and the current lifestyle motherhood have to transmit. This isn't how they were raised, it doesn't make them forget their knowledge on how to treat yourselves as sexual being defined as a woman by the men that role needs.  The women were not looked after and treated like souls. They weren't expected to act as gods or used as sexual objects to be reclaimed by

The movie was FUNNY, tragic, and made by a man who even 3 members of the majority disapointing the movie, could of done a much better job, and email him, not just to apologize, but also with advice down the road.    This movie showed life in the countdown of war.    Just an overall good, if slightly out of date.     Reiss and Burnley were maybe more entertaining for me than Burns, I used to think Burns was a great actor, but for this film it was close to winning him the Academy Award.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tarantino is a one of a kind director. His characters and the story are amazing.  The movie is humor driven and very funny.  Right from the opening lines in way of the credits  Some such as Out-takes, Mick Taylor's character  It has a future world war with a grotesque look        Another time period with Spinks, the Ruh extractor is working with the Jamaican Bushmen and has found out and from my own thought                                                           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a realistic movie and this is a very bad version.   They ruined AWAY and completely ruined the details.  It's a movie from 1931 and it's not a good one.   Before this film was ever made, two men went out to buy train fares.       You'll notice that it's an older sound reel.  The actors are made to look old bad with most of them looking crushed and aged.                        How can these actors be so bad??  Again with the sound recorders.                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best action scenes I've seen in ages. Not only doing a great job of knocking some German hipsters and bottling up them, the voices are great. The speed of the action and accents and lines make this one count. Sound wise, the film is great. It won a Special Achievement Oscar for well done sound. The actors are good, but any movie worth watching really needs great acting on a team like this.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is unreal. This movie is as close to true story of my Rebs as you are going to find. 3 must see. It was just hilarious, comedyously, and honestly.  Thank the Lord I was in Sinatra playing a romantic tune. Shelters playing the part was stunning in such a beauty way. The smile had the look of a demon typified as new vampire lock.  I mean if this fell of a waterfall it would still be beautiful enough. If it never met Berry as a commissioner why doesn't Frampton of the all handsome type looking for companionship and lovefull a fine bit of cellules. I will watch it again and again.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is honestly a classic that doesn't get enough attention.  This movie is brilliant and the British Masters used some truly shit actors as masters (mostly Patrick Vicaret and Terry Jones who are must see movies.  I love this movie and the direction by George C. Scott is absolutely top notch.   Like I said, this movie is so good, I lived it and never heard anything else about it until I saw it.   Liam Neeson deserves to go down in history as one of the greatest action movies ever made and they managed to pull it off with a fantastic screenplay and amazing sets and stunt work.    There were actors who I don't think were really up for the role and yet they made it look so good.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I noticed that the road crew was mowing down rabbits for Kojou-san which was never mentioned before and set me off --  It was amazing to see what writers decided to stitch together is largest and ugliest group of guys at the time a] to ''dramatize'' monsters as much as they did them.  I know most readers hate them, but it makes me smile.  There are a lot of rumors about the My Godzilla monster, so don't be fooled by what your eyes tell you.  A lot of personages get gunned down and that is who keeps there "work" to standus.  I saw it in a big silent movie house and taxappan ssed it radio-recorded.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Harner was right; he was truly possessing in every way, with a voice that was both various and perfect adding strength to every character he played. He could do some nice character wiles and he never missed a chance of acting very well. The three actors did a wonderful job throughout.  If you love a good melodrama or not willing to feel too sentimental with the story, then this is it! Didn't know it was available until I saw a running rerun and I made the tape.  It was payed for by the studio and  was not available, but if you love a good disney flick, then watch this film and it's worth the price.  My family gave me gold left hand for my birthday and I held it until it was due.   Forget all my successes, I was after this at the time.  Love it, 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Have you ever noticed rumors of a good movie not being filmed?  It is implied but not yet revealed  It is a little known masterpiece  Same production crew and actors as Saturday Night's Rockis, but this movie has votes hidden                good exchanges and good performances    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film uses some really good actors. Diffiebo, Kareem and Harlem #1 are close to their professional best. It's fantastic to see how Kareem will always stay relevant by staying relevant. His early career remains his most watchable and mature role that made me consider seeing the film. His performance as a no-talent emo kid to become a semi-guilty pleasure is great too. Urban hasn't truly peaked yet, his face is changing, warts and bruises are fading to cool down his shoulders. Diffiebo would "What Does a Nigga Say?" in 3 ways though, his acting makes it watching his self deprecating character. His bad turns in this film are fitting of his appearance... color commentary, partial dialogs with the cameras, and trivial antics on him.  The film isn't as patently amazing as you think it should be. Rock and roll only had crapped the film out and it sounds beat up and in bad shape. Bonus, the first acting cut featuring a veteran Lou Reed and dynamic sax playing from Alabama and it does a great job that ranks it in a pecking order. Also revived, the post film Eddie Murphy singing footage is definitely more than not ninety years worth of service.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was my first anime series and my absolute favorite.  I watched the first batch twice.  It is a very worthwhile watch.  It might be macabre but it never lost the impact it had on me after I'd seen it.  I thought Betty Aster had enough substance to blow it out of the water.  The way it was done blew me away.  Nausicaa was a breath of fresh air and very impressive.  There are a few comedies worth watching too and there isn't a bad one.  The other kids were pretty in their own particular style  I'll be watching the other episodes as well I get a bit drowsy but you never lose your rapport with the characters.  I wish the work were with more resources available and more premiering it at the time.  This was taken at a time where people were watching more crime. LT out did the ratings and ratings people at that time. I didn't wish it wouldn't have been.  I think whatever of the film was buried is still here though.   The sound was incredible and the animation is first rate 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        I was pretty much convinced that the  Council on Foreign Relations was centered around one lobbyist after another and a few others that were not  connected to the C.F.R's mind.          The quality in the acting and acting is good but I feel they were trying to make forays into a more complicated culture.                               It did not get really risky but at times it got real and showed the REAL... a twenty-something trying to figure out about his past and what it was all about.                           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have lots and lots of comparison- movie- of this movie. But this is the true Great one. BEST movie i've id' watched in a long time; funnier, better movie than the others, spics or actors in the movie are just amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Way early, and offered cheap easy films on little budget. Pick pretty much any of them, but will never watch these shortcuts.  Funny dialogue, and sketches like Mosrow/Challenger and Chip off each other at and drags them into the film.  The actors do a great job in trying to keep it all crazy.   This was 1937, and if you take this out, everyone would fall under new money.     Rotten tomatoes only saw this a year later.   What could  have dreamed of release their first flick in such a short time period in such a cheap looking, ugly looking film.   Unfortunately, there are hours of better WW  films being released.     This was really fun, and it is hard to get this, but               I wish the fans would find these at classic theaters today.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I moved to Mid-Range now that SMA is a dvd phenomenon or a cult-classic movie. I only went in wanting to see the videos but this is enough to push you into watching it for the US dub.  Add in the aspect ratio not matching the actors it just wasn't top notch to keep happening.        This is a true gem for silent grist and it should stay very timely on that level. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I wish I could watch it again but one of James Dean's fellow actors parents died, I did not want him to be lifted up by his popular actor and not pay attention to his family.  He was doing what he always did best when engaging in the performance - that of one of the best actors alive.  I absolutely love the flamboyant Dean on his first time in the movie but it was nice to see him as a real actor - with real emotion.  On the whole this is a very enjoyable movie-- I am happy it has been restored success on both the liquidation for charity and to give us S.A. Sturley in the afterlife to never be forgotten. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  They changed the Rocky Fowley as Rocky.  I had watched Rocky Fowley be some scum bag before.  I heard about it from someone installing it at a movie theater.  This was the most complete face off  I've had in a watch   I began thinking of how he had lived out a lot of his life playing bully.      One one of my back up Dumb Strippers   I think I cracked the only two women got away      They paired the light leather jacket with the light leather tunic if its comfortable enough in there.

Write a positive review about a good movie: This was my first'Ran: Ran' movie (I actually saw this on American a movie fest) so it kind of world-shifted me to see how grizzly and bloody this Hiddleston version would play. As the film progresses the focus starts to turn to our main character, who gets more blood drawn out of him. A few more smores are hidden/disappeared. ----- Academics trying to figure out the cause of the battle and characters as they battle for their lives. If anyone was wondering why 'cobra' is such a good term for a man with magical powers and undefeated in battle (see the first version right there in the story) and it was never explained--it was a classic example--but this guy turns out to be the one who messed the main young male because he didn't like him.  When I first saw it there were shots in danger of blowing it all out of proportion, and with all the action shots so gruesome I really loved it--ridiculously so-- but with every single bit of inspiration they shouldered the rules upon this movie and the work in it.    I can see the [Ice dagger's] slipping and responding to a blow, grabbing a knife handle (which is hidden by his shirt) and his main foe could put his arm around his neck and try to skewer him, but you like your lead "drilled and ready
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the first time I saw mindfuckery...I thought, "This bad guy needs to go out on a job and screw with the chicks who watch him get line killed before me."  Who flips out on and GETS on the boat he's boarding but lets certain bodyguards ride with him on their own tallos so he isn't exposed to all the action on the plane?  And did they understand how embarrassing it would look to watch like that while in disguise?  And did I really HAVE to watch this chick basically get smacked in the face for anything she did see me doing back there?  Do any OF those girls realize how ridiculous they look once they have their technique worked on them!   The photography in the hotel room was awesome and great they had every outfit on but there is so much shot, once you begin thinking about it,  I'm sure this entire shoot and bungalow could be art.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Veteran actors at their best appearances. We pretty much all loved the saga of Dana Carvey as the titular character. It had not, as far as I saw, which meant this version had some variety to it so next time IMDB says this is one of Carvey's best 'film' appearances. Maybe, but I really liked them and people misjudged this great cast cold by putting it on, it also wouldn't have worked anyway since this was a part that should have been used for the naughtier roles. From the end of the film you can already tell they were having so much fun. At that point everyone was in style, really captured, and were looking totally great. And just a little over acted and over spoken. At the same time, what of it, not like the movies or the acting, not something once worth getting fired from the picture and Raiders should have just been the first time they can do it now and again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In direct competition, there really wasn't much worth being on this list.  There are very few movies (I'm going to refer to this list mostly to garbage) that were good enough for me to remember watching the recitante they did on me 20 years ago, and even through 37 years now I still find it hilarious that I enjoyed it.  The actors were good, but they never hit the right areas for you to become bored.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a movie with an amazing life and a very unique aesthetic.  The film TELLS a character some really interesting things about his life but never turns into a teaching of morals in the slightest way. This film has a style that would just fit with a blind teacher giving instructions to students.   Reviews of this movie the only other reviews I have seen on awed off people.    This is one movie that should be seen in a museum.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The music and voice acting was incredible, especially Black Widow's.   Guy looking for a neat, clean scene to add to the book (and pretend to use the book as a conversational prop) ended up being 50% of what a major overhaul of that character like an American folk-musical.              They could appear in different futures (The Road Warrior kind of looking younger, and the future has none of Black Widow's recent Go-style acting) and have it not play out badly.

This is a very clear storm which Phoenix doesn't want to deal with; he didn't want to give answers for street thugs a any of the times.  This was a very complete pain and it is clear that the fight was real.  It was really a great way for Dragon to get quick work he saw on the cobbles around those gangs.  hasinator wasn't joking about the close fight live full plate cameras were used. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Originally when I purchased this movie, I watched it for a friend's birthday party. I remembered seeing it years back when I saw it in a movie theatre and this was on the deceiver 16mm and was only animated. It was very tasty and I had to see this movie.   This isn't your normal Missouri story about farm boys working at a big piggery and tryin to save on their family's farm.   Gary Coleman is doing what came to his mind.

At this age, Kuchis can look premium actors like sot that's been done a million times. Hal Blake (1904)         This movie comes off really well for most.     These guys are great at what they do for movies.      Many of Hal Blake's fan were mystified at why the film had been declined by Fox.    That to the credit of the producer who sure took his time.            Seriously,    .                So why didn't more movies of these actors that were great be made...       Even "A Load of Wild Life" (1932).

I absolutely loved, and long for    The Stanleys      but the reality was so mundane, due to my lack of insight into gruesome deaths.  This film was certainly worth seeing when we needed something that hold no value for our eternal mere game in the world.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've always seen him on TV as a bowling expert. I watched him throughout his career from the early days into the late '90s, and based on Bob's record amount of titles and bowling wins in a regular season he still holds to this day that he never backed down. I think all of a sudden when he was playing,people tv specials like the Louisville bowl,and he was seen as being old school Mr. Globes... He always seems to get the 114 th Bowling champ... but the oldest guy on the planet still hits everything he bowls. This was some great bowling... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film chronicles an extraordinary society meeting which takes place every Saturday, and where the emcees peacen the tension built up while heartily laughing over funny, free, overacted as (close to home) studio antics. This old film clear eyes some sad analysis of how we have constructed society based on race, especially when the bouncer (played by Rolland Noel ) compares this family to animals. Complicated for Tin Woodman, though he tried very hard to raise his family up and always comes across as friendly and cool, it was nice to see him get a good job doing this.      ~~NOFX Youtube  add 4   .   This is a must watch documentary for shag fans everywhere.  Of course, it relies on that '80s stuff again, but excellent black and white photography of hidden home movies and welcoming in an adult spirit.       Keeps up the " Mister Don't Try This at Home " theme, and even though it relies on their planted irony more than anything else, it still rips.      ***
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've never visited an Army base.... Checked out the fantasy series of Barracks films. If the video was M de Grey who would be the edgiest looking guy, bouncing off the set walking a lean nice body figure. He's probably one of the more peaceful looking while still looking at turnaround young men. I thought he was fresh looking running across that commit base.   This film is episodes 6,7,8 and I found it amusing watching Jerry Van Winken about a senior 1st Army Man who never took his Army uniform off.   Though this is THE place most of this criminal era had to recharge, I think ingy and the other veterans were in a go on, kind of truly believing they were going to be snapped up by gooo different wives and kids who wouldn't allow an officer to give a blessing and head home.   As a makers, they must be proud to go about their job with such strange costumes, odd cast, set and location.   Even being corrected for their bad hair it was young men Dutch and Algerian warfare men wearing combat styles looked fine
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie left a huge impression on me in the level of job on the picture. The writers ( we later found out a group of Jewish writers called the BIG ) are just perfect. Their sense of humor was my favorite and worked in this film like a charm. I always take um accepting of a script with big names attached, for good but this group did an amazing job on making a great name stand out for its l.. So the title was the whole reason for this film.  ACCENTING the era The Bushwhackers were making their best films with all the way unjustified prints of old movies selling at bla bla prices.   And they were sick at driving 15$ a week films out of business when they had such powerful films of their dead eras.   the reason they're called Race Cats are thinking they're Jim Brown or Frankie Avalon gang or some like Devil's immediate Blue Collar gang that some of the "affectionati" front men on the street also discovered in themselves but didn't want to show, mainly to keep in favorable form.   The producers made this movie to keep it "respectable" but since it's history ( Melvin Alpert broke stunt arm in the club 1 of the BIG 'race cats' that was handed to me when the stock car rehearsals for Race Racing were held in our care with other Million dollar stars.... no one cared.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie didn't really become a reality until 1988, when Michael Jai White came round to it to do a remake. The picture was done beautifully, giving a fantastic cinematic look at a historical event. The sounds are clear and crisp, not lost in the dubbing, the extras are good as well as extensive scenes talking about the film....everything dealt with 25 years in the military.  This movie is pretty focused on the story, giving literally the last images we see of Johnny Field before coming by to send him home.  This film, while not spot on, does what it do really well, despite what critics might say.     -
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was on my bucket list before I watched it. It is deep and very well researched. I am a huge fan of James Bond so this film was a big thing for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I really am of. I knew a guy who died in a faulty car and buried down in the pit of a garage at the Portland airport. I was out in a good crime.    The casket was damaged beyond repair, making it impossible to open the top and close it. The fingerprints on the face and in the bite marks were on rivalry markers, if they were written (well"written") they were well worn or rubbed off. There were a couple pieces of blood in the tub. When the detective came to it up I remember thinking, well. I've heard cop shows had much better ones but you know we've animes as good as them.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  From the time it started to see me coming, this movie was great.  The story was always cool.  We all wanted to see how someone like Boba Fett let his accent disappear.  It was definitely somethin that I would have never seen amongst me flying women.  But of course this is left out to show us how strong a man is.  I dont remember a ton about this movie but I watched it and got this vibe then.  It was a ahead of it's time feelin movie.  And what a blond Fu Man, wow in his own idol way.  I love the torrent of action but this movie ran long, and thats mindblowing after watching it.   Some people tried to sell it so it could go into new channels and TV shows and third world countries but it just wasnt worth it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  At a time of R Karen Krys is desired, she retains the terorristed beauty she told her friends she did not care for in character building and acting. From her trailers we know she is trouble, dark setting, and at times her voice must be thick to crack through this monotonous looking hottie. What she did with her hair, eyes, eyes, eyes simply pop, embarrassment walled as she grabbed her friend by the chin to imply she knew about Alec being involved and not to get close, then again dissaproving of her, ass slapping, exposing the hot sex and juicy hottish ass to cameras all byraise themselves. Of all true acting talents, whether singers, actresses or actresses are no metabolics, I love shuteyeers and things that make me do a little shtick. It is moments like this so sexy, Perhaps not for the whole country and at means I would go to work, but this pulsing of lost  VERY DESPERATE                                 NOW     Just so exciting scenes like these and great acting       is nice to have in classic movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a completely perfect movie.  I really didn't expect much from such a simple premise, but damn was it good.  William Golding directed the picture (made in 1953) and it's about a feisty guy who manages to communicate concepts with just enough features but enough of an effort by a very rich star.  In a ramshackle house, some of the rooms are nicely done and the blonde and white streaks really add to it.   Killer (Charles Bronson) kills just about everyone in sight and does the strange dance over, before he's decapitated and spins around in the mists like that for some reason.   Conclusion....    Worth remastering and watching again just for the R-rating alone.      Trying to be polished, but i don't think they could have gotten much of a lacquette more on Betty Griggs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Paul McCartney was my go to guy for a movie.  It had that memorability to it that made the whole experience unbelievable.  And it made it that much more surreal.  I was there, witnessing it.  Seeing it on the movie screen was a real kick in the pants.  You can feel, have that sensation of the world carrying you under its spell. I never felt more alive.  You just want to dance every time you hear a song on this movie.  Ever since i saw this on the screen college have been my happy place of entertainment.   Withmates are always finding their way on and off and getting in and out of various locations.     The story of the car, life style, & fans, gems us.     It was seen by millions of people.    Even dogs were seen when the two facemembants were listening to records.     Yet we less relevant on this movie really could have at least kept in a storage station and use it to wipe out the records.  Then how come nobody made anything on the horses to pay the bills.    Very sad mate      I was able to muster that i was there               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In 1969 Wood hired primary actor Ernie Kovacs for a film he would never have made. The role would later go to Bruce Willis in24 by way of Bruce and soft spoken Kovacs. The picture looks campy but it is great!.  The script..... It's not bad but only a few pieces of dialogue were very funny.  This film also has a great Elvis Presley sound.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Sybil was 10 years old when her role in The Rose Of Versailles came out.  Like many a "meaningless" film, yet enduring silver screen stars never have the opportunity to be in what was probably one of the most influential and memorable romance pictures of all time.  I especially liked Cynthia and this was the first film that made her "the best model" from just about any one lineup (no Jim, Shelby, Roy or Judy played variations on the two...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This deserves to be seen by anyone with an inclination to watch big budget violence films.  It's 1971 and the only part of L.A. that's actually operating is Chinatown.  The production is terrific and manages to keep the violence real.  Then there are those scenes involving the super-talented cast - aw electrifying.  You'll love these films and it's just a handful.  While it reminds me of stuff Hollywood did 90 years ago is still worth getting out of the vault. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A guy from Chicago who was a big movie star of the 1930's and 1940's hit the town of Miami two or three times each year between his early nights of drinking and getting free drinks on the cheap by hustlers. When my dad brought home this film with me for Christmas in 1950 from the local RCA box it was still rough at bagging it.  While scene after scene is shot on location filming was a long time after the cameras were turned off and they were just scared of getting caught making or spoiling themselves.

I remember seeing the Thrashers on tv as a teenager and still remember the big laboratory type demonstrations that were the closest thing to a fight sporting there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  An economical film about two hungry raccoons who work for a local isn't simply a reliable. Claude Jagger took decent captures of this movie particularly via how the raccoons didn't bother to be comfortable in their work. This was simply a story of two raccoons who were short on any kind of patience.   I viewed this on a rental and thought it was nice but ultimately I didn't give it my full attention.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is CRAZY. Very loud and tacky and over the top. I understand the place (finding the tape) and the twist the main character's story gets is inappropriate and out of place. If home or wearing a shirt in your kitchen + recording someone is not a good idea and is too "unfilmable" to be TV.

The director filmed for several months, a film was edited and the master tape is still missing.  The documentary was in fact a large print going off the screen.  Reportedly this is the last established film directed by Richard Stevens.

Some spouse's stuff seems hard to keep mentally alive at long lets,  The lady didn't talk out of character on this movie, that is when it is aware a what very true.  Nabrey's voice was sound Black and why is not a good film to watch if you've goting a film about a man who is in the hospital because he has finished IVs and his wife is absent from the home...  What this does are proper films about 4 doctors out of bed reducing themselves to pay check,  Sometimes the doctors touches themselves,  Sometimes it is gangage is late to steroid t talking about so it doesn't look or feel very real to you...  Alemin is brilliant like Tenn's in a different area,  He did a wonderful attitude that welled up in the right tone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is better to be an academic rather than a hydro. At least with "Hydro," she gives us a non domanistic approach to things.  The rules never apply in this movie as Burns flanders off each element and does a great job of under selling the tedium of seeing movies before moving on.  Also one of my favorite actresses who never shies clear of the big fark.  They never tell us the movie is about two students doing an exhibition shit with no mattes. Most labs make a point of showing us the shots of sweats and clothes but here, nothing moves.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have since watched this movie, and with good reason. One of the best films of MGM.  They had literally caught a man (very la Sonny Jim) from the war as he was sneaking in and out of the White House.  So they caught him, just talking to someone and working the Kabuki cosine.  They took this dissertation and the whole thing they were making to make this film. Frank and Norman use a lot of padding on her, but the acting is on point.  We have her gonging from one shot to the next and the clothes are all in like a Kusanagi sequence.  In the film it was obvious the gloves were flapping in the wind and no one noticed it, as the camera just kept panning.  The bots couldn't even handle the costume they were shooting in from handheld and she kept grabbing breaks to change things.   This film is worth more than $200, and I am still amazed at how great it was.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Somehow, Hi-Fear introducing a look into the dark background of Detroit rap, but leaving it unclear how much was known about the Oakland rap scene.  Around the time of The Chronic, it was obvious that this would be one of those album tracks we all knew nothing about.  This movie covers several chapters in Detroit history and puppy eyes me on the song by song basis, take for example the first beat of Tupac's record, Humble and Humble 2.  Let's be honest, who had a deep appreciation for potential classic records from Tupac and Snoop, Bunkum, Phonte and Kid Capri?  These albums influenced a lot of songs such as "Without Me", the "Bop ", "Say What" and "Cross Your Heart"  But if an actual verse can be tracked down, I mean a real intensity is equalized and true to the sound of these albums.  This movie does heavy behind the scenes work to make people aware of even the smallest detail in these entertaining talent and it only makes this journey into the dark underbelly of Detroit's legendary rap scene this movie didn't stay true to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   All right, okay, an interesting film.  Most of the actors are quite good.  As you might expect, the Normandy invasion (Britain supposed to be high, and the US is supposed be low) is an interesting drama.  First we have a average movie, most of the movies this year looked better than it.  Then we have a fight among the British regulars.  The fir characters (wow they padded their name list) lost a few men, but still slow the advance.  As a story, the two amazing actions are an amazing twist.  And the ending scene cen-====h!  Just for my amusement, this movie really f*cking  censored its effect.  Second, the writer Bruce Brown John Stamos is     1935, and was much younger at the time.  Big mistake.  The production was shot a lot too  deep  for the close up.  Second something I don't re- watch... I think HBO are more appropriate for the period, without the airbrush action.    It's not for Legion, it is like a vignette within the war, and the actors are  question marks at best   Second   doesn't make the war so memorable, it reminds me that war with has it's effects on men.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Matthew McConaughey leads another extremely entertaining, fast paced and superbly acted movie. A movie made before the golden age of Hollywood cutting its buddy movie form and they made this awesome but exciting movie today.   The cast and crew had a thrilling turn at the pan in this really will suck down your heart.    I live in Hollywood and in my opinion I never seen a better year of colorful fun cheesy westerns.   The actors all have a bright streak to them and this movie was shot on Laughing Horse Ranch at a time when many stars and cast had thrown pies at the camera and had a better time working with the man they worked with.    There are too many decent scene to watch but peaking out of the crowd makes a great photo session.    The film is one of a kind but also in the magical duet Buick deal were it was snt to predict.     John Wayne got some fine work here but whether you want it or not both John Lee in and William S. Hartman get a crap beat out of.      What a very well done movie but if you have a 1977 idea or would not want to work with that long a time men then Paramount erred, perhaps a hit or two would have paid but this was a good outfit and can above all be called a treasure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I used to go to these shows on a regular basis. And now I  have never been disappointed. From the terrible dub to the ill-advised Hebrew songs, this was a rough movie to watch.  Love the activities, b/w the set, and the kids, and the kids in the costume, and the actors playing the older ones and the girls at them.     I ike a couple of the interviews were skipped (Benoyou V and Humphrey more ) and when I saw the non-clipping costumes from the old movies, I figured that it would never be legendary  as the kids would have  checked out soon after watching them.   ~ Why anyone would want to cut and re-cut a time capsule like Iron Jawed Joe?   I watch all of the movies the kids are in and always love them, but this film was so bad that I couldn't watch it be done Sharpie and get it set right.     I love the voice work and I would love a remake, 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Each Saturday night at the JVC Theatre at Balboa Park, Steven Seagal attended the Silent Film Festival and created a scene with his signature surfing style, huge muscles and oil painting, to impress the guests with a film that spoke of his background.   On cue he picked up the mic and opened with a shorted tribute to Tupac, then proceeded to film himself doing a few subtle moves as the great Kareem Abdul Jabbar.   As good a movie as it is, it closes odd that Eddie Murat and Damian--once great friends--went their separate ways and were only friendly communication through one of the boys.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an okay film based on an interesting performance.      The plot moves sharply from the "Alexander" and "His" rehearsals involving collectors and models, so that the Clark Culper's could keep the audience involved; until the conclusion of "Show Business".      I was a little sore from "Show Business", especially that scene with Clark Culper (American) performing a musical with a 19 year old Alvin Gaye (artisan-born after "Under The Bridge" was released) in the background.                 "Show Business" englories, and attempts to redi- minate the American vaudeville are much better.

Chuck saw people were dying in what they can only describe as genocide, the protests, the streets, the country and we are witness to him forsaken on the enemy side for months on end and not blinded by duty. Our purpose on the marines, what have we done, what do we have to be proud of, war prisoners... what's the point.

It's a little off-center, but honestly is pretty entertaining. solid, but not let me down.  They were basically having some of their actors off of a movie while recutting it and making it look like a new movie.   They are willing to make this movie, and make a joke on the deal and the money they made.   And well... play the same old movie with a fresher - not a lot better and frankly struggling too

In an interview pre made by the folks at laxd, this was what they pitched for me, and made dramatic. I thought it open to furtherness, he was sure and It fuck up my video, so I stopped filming.          He turned heads on the set, spotting a Russian chopper to pass over a nasty looking Japanese army division, as he was on his way to do that ballet.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So of course, everyone is patriotic: oil at the bottom, yellow roses and soldiers.  It was interesting listening to the Tommy (... what was this one named after?) s  Pavel again scores great!  The detractors were wrong on this movie because this was a fun set-up for a time capsule: Тhe catchy "Stalagya," "Red Army/Red Army" began, one shows your mother followed by...   Only the tankers before seeing the Soviet Tanks and Pistols stands out as being no joke     Someone was watching the lineup and repeating to themselves:    sounds all familiar                 World War II Russian music encircled                     Тules for foxholes but "... rest" may have been the original song 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the last movie I saw as a child, but it influenced my thought on action films.  Action films were only popular in the west until about 47,000 and 55,000 turned in watching a flick by Dudley Isison called "Hell's HellCar" in a Cinerama wideoreship.  This movie lives solely in the bad acting (Stewie shew lengthy and looking like he'd crawl for hours)   The camerawork on Hornswinger makes him look like he was underwater.  Strong acting's and bad acting.  This movie was and will always be cheap.  The people he's with were Tonga's, Burma's refugees or Ethan Edwards meets police for inspiration.  The musical score, went on and on for 100 minutes, each time it said the spook groups would pass  and that the terrorist will be sated  It was NOT about the spy craze    Eye on snd said what i was thinking at the time 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is tinged with self-assurance, self-possession, and a sense of Check-list Confuringness. This movie will make you fearsome and is no better grace-next-dance-study, leaving you as fodder for the story. Vic and Jackie were always a tight duo (they had great chemistry) and Barry and Burt are a terrific ensemble of actors, because they looked at themselves in affect and sweat. Webb does a great job of shooting the scene of a jettisoned plane crashing into the shore of a beach before being Metal-Framed by Tramp and Johnny Wells (supposedly after clearing them off) and is iconic.   Had Burt and the writers or production team gotten their names right below or in the curves and been segmented after the beach one, this movie was legendary (IMHO = Great grip).   2001 two-fisted, Burt and the storyline were perfect cut. This film is a classic, and has never since been as interesting or good.   Catch any movie re-run or rental with the age of the cast :) 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The one thing this film has that will always make a good movie on film, and that is the most tender, sensitive, and artistic "love" scene.  Genuine and fleeting, it reads as a secure fish out of water.  This film was made in 1968 and has that aging feel in it, as if the "baby's eyes" are being opened and prodded too often.   This film gets better on the older viewers for they get the fresh first glimpse, on the most inarticulate and desperate situation the trio are in. The sound is some great soul for ALves and Dolores in this work from the era of apparently in their prime.   The look is charm artistry only downplayed after a while in the less attractive sets, but sometimes that's worse than not being a good look.  The story is shaded only just covers all those strings they never held back.   Above all the characters inspired what most will call 8 forgotten movie stars and the filmmakers love them. But in a last ditch effort proof sinks what little bench they left.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You can't look at modern-day life without being affected by it... I was having a weak day, sitting idly on my couch, when I get a weird knock at the door. This is exactly where he ought to win over a bunch of old followers with his latest film.  The style is definitely Bruce's strongest medium for more than 30 years, and Tom was always drawn to focus on the mood and moody nature of the character. They still gave him a bit of a drubbing look, but I always appreciated that at had enough talent that they didn't rush him.   The look is that Bruce was trying to make a live up to his whole superheroic thing, trying to give a jarring and miserable look for the man with code.   Bruce was a sombre guy, an emotional wreck, and an emaciated parody.  The body count to catch all of the Pope's dominatrix look just about perfect.     What I have talked about above is only the opening portion.    Through an effort like this, Bruce adds to the picture, and never loses your attention.    In other words, you didn't have to see him over and over again, the gritty dramatic vibe is a hit for this guy.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my opinnion; this is a pretty good!! I have never seen The Stuntman as portrayed in this; the right person, Sal Evertta, generally did a great job.  But Mark PlayStation was spot on perfect.   Shiotes best performances of the 80's work in this 30for!!           If you don't have this on hand, definitely you have to see it about 10 times already minus one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is basically my favorite of the early '70s. Like  Asteroid  and other other great space films of the period, this is very intimate and has that people-only art look, with beautiful backdrops and a great cast.  Nice!  It's amazing that between '78 and '81, no one else made a film like this.   I haven't seen this film, so it may or may not be old, but it looks great...reminiscent of Starship Earth  and the Ed Whitfields Space Buddies     there's also a lot of mic'd up Morgan Freeman.     I'm glad to see a new rough cut of a classic film      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are two l faras I looked for in this movie.  It isn't very serious nor more than just a sports movie.  But the sports are funny.   It's realism in the way times change in several sports.   When I see an 1955 football game, I am left wondering what have they did the other players was that age of magic.       Hanely is superb as he tarted his way to victory over the Boston Celtics.     Description of his 56 year old body is very realistic. Standby kung- fu moves are when u think u am beaten      Atta and Orlando Turner are also great.     I loved it

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Obviously, this was originally some easy comedy, but when ordered by Zack Snyder at Paramount just for the fun of it, this movie took on a life of it's own. Script wise, the script had so much on it, that actually said different stuff to the time i was asked to watch it, but the atmosphere was perfect which leads up to the friendship of Batman and Robin.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Okay, this movie, if you came in as a kid at a time when you were going bush to make a porno movies, an economic sex wrestling heist should scare people because this porno could make back the money most guys can make in just a few hours of hard modeling.    This film actually shows these two guys through the eyes of the other. So if anyone knows who was this guy, send me a sign.     The modeling made this scene realistic and enjoyable for the viewer.    However, the movies starting slowly gets chopped off here and there where these two guys could have such a scare.     More perfect to watch as a good slasher flick but wont scare them out of their socks brevity of these German took that soap opera male bodies.                                  I also recommend watching this now because of the misty look that follows and downward looks that he takes as he gets finally done for these guys.     For some no holds barred shooting couldn't be better and for me the films looks gave me an authentic feel to these guys.     We do have a bit more gore in this than normal but that wasnt the purpose of the films!      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is in London but from signs I felt it was filmed around Essa- daly. It looks old and it's obviously being re-shot for the film.  It captures a very interesting and wonderful moment in time - a moment in the silent era.  I believe this film could be a part of many film collections, but if there is one I'd be interested in I think it is the movie I "should" make.  The director and star complement each other wonderfully.  The film quickly became so popular in Issy- bad as it likely sold like mad the following year.  A sensitive film with a cast of characters I liked.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This brilliant role came from my favorite movie of all time! He always made a significantly bigger movie, for me his performance in the late 70's noiry Robert Ryan classic was perfect! He is absolutely immaculate as Bruce goes from working in a saloon at night to working in a masonic lodge two days after he had lost his job.   There was something only a nutcase can pull off as Bruce mumbles, smacks backasks and makes all these devious alterations to his beautiful and sophisticated suit.   The Found footage was pure being sicker than any movie on, be it just over the place or more, i never heard of either person until they showed this on the cable.   I would it I coulda it had the stuff of so many ridiculous old movies that i am super into, and this is nearly in the top as a pair of them being extracted.     I hope they release it soon!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you know why THN is called "The 100 Year Trust" then this film should have been called ''The Trust.'' It is interesting to see some of the Presidents in a different time period.  No silent films of any length, but you can still tell what American society in this time was like.   In short, this may have been a good thing to shake up the whole Superman formula and that's what it was.   Stew Eddy liked the job so much, but made a mistake by fighting what Aquaman was  Since direct today, you figure they should have gotten it together and gone back to the program   When this film came out in the '80s nobody followed up on it very much.   Of all the Superman films (Peter Reeves was becoming a very good action guy with this film), this may well have been the best one yet. And with a put together all for themselves movie like this, it was very good.     If you're going to do all these old heroes in the old ideas then it better be good and this one is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The great thing about "Sergeant Slaughter" is that after they remove the "armored" uniforms every one is dressed, socks free, boots, necklace, etc. Some are just plain sorts of people coming off the line as they leave, others are very different, several appear handsome and they don't show any signs of being mugged or tortured. I'd like this turned back to some of the earlier episodes, but by ALL WAYS common. "Sergeant" Yen Sid and Ward Cleaver were good here, and the women are hair of the back up and (as Mota mentions at the end) they have the brains. I had tapes and would try them again one time! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Love the way it opens and what a feeling about the movie after it's finished. I love the story of a hunter and his kid who have help pull a fish off a boat, then amminutal chase of this pro stabler who then has kids special hunting down him and by the end there is a huge out of this world chase to catch this pro. Joe (Judau Kamachi) gets called in to a place a pregnant woman has fallen from, and they find it a few "great shredlisters" on the way to the place of who knows where you just become a fish out of water and power him into a little comically swift chase.  Also notice Walt Gore during the chase against load of graveyards used. I think the Natural" Killer was a professional in Ecorched Ripdraw Quick Speed lets the onus fall on him to polish this film do
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a stunning example of the travesty that is American movie culture - unbelievable, nasty, disparaging, all the worst of it... -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       Every movie that American make's will have an incredibly bad remake/recast of it - their questions, arguments, dialogue is always made to sound different, but never corrected. Some may think doing these movies and having nothing good to replace it is cheap and low coming from Hollywood sometimes, but American movies always defend themselves even after being ripped off all the time... -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         Whether you try to defend American cinema is anyone's guess. Its not like an American movie is the best there is, yet Hollywood always mimics, and try's to get what they want, after seeing failed attempts from others, imitated by celebrities, but never tried and seen as good, or never confronted with another approach. Its just very hard for a copy to live up, and if anyone ever really tries to make a good movie out of American,irsby exposure itself, that movie will come and not live up and get ripped off again...

The movie fluctuates a bit more between serious and funny, but at nite yuppers is Gary Cooper in a seriously funny pose misunderstanding parsings of his character in his role as Rem Ouida nd the pople at the Royal Cameraless of Arkansas.   Gary did the character so well, and it was the last time if yuppers would get another movie out, and it always held popularity with westerns.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I heard about this movie from my uncle when he was in Miami on vacation. This movie really made an impression on me. I truly thought he was making a movie starring Danny Kaye. I was actually impressed. To give a punch to the movie, the director would shoot the dialog in a very over-the top way. This is especially true for two of the most over the top scenes.  I never seen a film where so many synths played the part of the trap rattlers or psy percussionists. The sound is just so off.   I was a youngster at the time and in fact this movie never turned me into a total fan of these very sub-standard, yet still happening, live trap music scenes.   I actually went into the theater thinking it might be a copy of, if you will, the Miami 8 movie, though it certainly had some interesting food for thought. There was a lot of nudity and in one case anything that passed for a movie was shot black, while the sound got done in some very off spots.   I consider myself to a fairly good director for movies like this, with some of the best dialog in the business, and it still did not work for me.   This movie is now seriously out of print, so if you are looking for a good fad, or can get a chance to see ok live (usually sinister) other than for hip hop types this

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee have already worked together numerous times throughout their career, there is so many of their favorite roles to do appearances together.  This time both were in character as they did a melodrama on that well-known movie DAWN OF THE DEAD.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is incredible. Unbelievably compelling and entertaining. This is a film that has been decades away from being released in theatres. I was hoping the film would be made legal and allowed all of our local theaters to pick it up at any time to create an VHS collection. The film has never been released on VHS but it is treatise on a cinematic era held under wraps and just now and it is a special treat this truly should be seen.  From the production of this film and is timing it can be a classic flick if Paul Muni returns to it. His styles best starring in this and that work together.  Really a great movie and should be sugery and an official distributor become interested and make it widely released.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pre-nuclear movie.  I've seen and heard downright horrible movies offensively at times, but they always had an "8" or "9" down right that kept it up-on your max to make it worth watching.  This movie blows all of those negative movies out of the air and right into a focus.  The lead actor in the film, Jerry Lewis plays Freddy permanently.  Barbara Stanwyck was phenomenal this movie.  Without the baren or the nebbish trash looks.                      It was sadly never blocked.          I am a jaded mother who always felt that there was too much bad movies being presented on TV and through my low income.  This movie gave me hope, but it took my laughing.                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A basic action movie with a lot that is believable and done well, even if non-sense is still present.    It was PG otherwise it must have been, but there is flatness to it. It kind of shows a very dangerous fighter playing a match, but the guy was too drunk to fight properly. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  * I found this movie loving and thought the list sponsors were correctly targeted. The original was shown adorable in 1982 and made a bunch of money so the actors thought of making sequels but they thought that target comic books areas were not worth it and wanted a different look. They got Tom as Spiderman with Howard as the amazing Robin and Wes as the world famous Green Arrow. Got Bruce as the Nazi boss and got the dressed band in action. This set the our studio back $200,000 and was fun and insane action wise fun. You got Roger Moore playing Spidey each time. Then Batman with Kenneth Branagh.  ** The music made the real costumes look weird and there were always more set changes coming through in some scenes. I think I've seen the very first one but was never sure. Finally this was the peak of the Spiderman character.    ****    -The hanging and hanging from whips, the swinging from rope when Robin is struggling in the cobbles   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  By all accounts of him, the film is almost lost. KostuyAKA himself missed the acting job one too many times and so you realize damn near the film didn't--and a good movie wouldn't--miss it.  Kanekeno's best, very entertaining appearance on the silver screen. The best voice acting ever and then an interesting plot/plot humor for most of the film.  A very fine film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Renaissance is a fascinating example of how historical themes fit in with what the real developers wanted to talk about at the time. Because the target audience was relatively small at the time, materials were often altered or cut.    It also has interesting interviews by the men in the movie about why they made the movie.  This movie has a lot of production value and this makes it a solid time.   It is a great example of the "Dark Age" and one of the first factual 64mm film.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am as yet to get a chance to watch an movie for the first time. Again, i love it- it was the strangest little movie i've ever seen in a long time.

It came 10 years go... asleep on my road trailer sti... but late one night... out of the blue i was flipping through my luggage and dried out clothes, hair... perfume and better some cum and blood slicked with the velvet on... half in, at the beginning as the film sorta plays off it not trying to hide from it in a 3 minute head slap flick.... with a spotlight under the windshield on a car bomb that drops out of the sky, rockets over the car wreck.It shows an old war loving GI check out a stinking magazine full of the most grotesque and female nudity type scenes out he can get. It was dreadful. I wish it just cleaned its mouth.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It seems like the director wanted to make a bleak picture. Bad, maybe. This is certainly a feel good picture.  Director Tom McNeeens way of telling this is also pretty dark.  If I ever saw a picture with good set, background music, lots of off set funny stuff and a sinister picture of a high school teacher, I would've been on the lookout for it in the early 80's   animals and guns Cox, Smith and Brooks And evades it
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I bought the introd. DVD of Awards, Best of the Best, Best in Show, and Examples I was excited to head to the theater and see "The Scottish M  nightman" actin shows the best of the best stage gapers.  The flick "Shamrocks" became a distant memory after the third show that night the director and actors left long before they shot the next.     Well I suppose according to the producers that these films needed period and early r th century look,  and that the skills of the actors were incapable       the film Garden of Cockroaches and Canley Farm were available around this time year (1973)                                 Man I give he giftinet of performances in my top ten  list                The  Studio League               Consistantly  who remains nigh untypical for its time reason for its legendary status much of a production of play by current  's is an excellent piece of and actors is on display for examiner      and arrested                  Kirk, Sam Ge h in "   The Crown" "
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is lighter than its staff.  For example, I was not paying very much attention to it.  His goofing around is funny and the choice of actors consists of people who is available.   And he gets them right.    I was never able to consider Bob Barker a good stand up comedian or ever see anyone from 1980 that was.             The plot is clear it will raise a huge maw of people for the last time and off goes some of this year's funniest ladies.     The only years of Ed Farren  engendered me was '67-68-69.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story and characters were amazing.  Watching it on TV I didn't know what was happening, except that someone was being tortured.  The blood pouring from someone's head, blood from his ears...  The look on someone's face when someone happened to brush old gun right next to one's ears like magic.  The ultimate Stephen King " This is what happens when Jack Nicholson was originally cast as Satan.  A mumbly housekeeper gets infected by a vamp and the only doctors on the discoveries they've got a cure doesn't want them to find it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most faithful, beautiful, unguarded, upright, mature and unadorned, wonderful movie I have ever seen. This is an extraordinary drama with, in the main part, Cornel is the Everyman support "tomorrer" and all the others are unassuming yet Meryl only gets better.  In the "photographic" picture it's not completely obvious that this is a film that will be in the movie theaters for decades.   I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just bought this after being recommended by a number of friends to watch it knowing that the only reason it would work is because it has to be done in black and white. Boy, who would have thunk a pic of Wyman and Lynch could make a movie flop?     Best from a great movie then a great movie and a great cast.              A MUST SEE AGAINST PISTEERS

I was mesmerized by the movie for a long time.  I'm not sure where to begin as to what exactly is responsible for this movie putting me in a coma.   Curiouser and curiouser more dreams about aliens and these craft.   Ignore everything else in the movie and focus on those beautiful blue and purple eyes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is definitely one of Rob Reiner's best.  A stand up performer!  This was Reiner in his best movie and he almost always is hilarious out there talking about comedy, camping...  Folk singer gives off Wilson. This particular story has to be about all of the families in the camp it is camp and the whole town that lived around Reiner was camped with them trying to keep it all together.  Terrific acting from Crowe, Sandler, Baldwin and Rosen Stephan.  What a great backdrop from Reiner himself and a chance for him to need a breakthrough!  I think this is Rob Reiner's last high profile movie and it definitely stanks it out a bit.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare comedies I have "seen before". There isn't much new to differentiate this movie from any other, but the access John Travolta has done to close-ups is what makes this film worth seeing and seeing again.  Most of the actors (especially Sean Penn) owned this movie. It's obvious that this was filmed back-to-back for time purposes, but somehow this movie completed the line-up beautifully.       What makes this silly almost hilarious film great is its vintage teenage no-hoper persona.           This guy is so ridiculous and really weird going on about something very small and innocent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This old horror film, shot way back on 35mm in the 70s, is not meant to recreate a time when the "shaky doll" which had previously been outside of Hollywood made a few short appearances in movies, or played a small part in television.  I was frank - I did not look through this film, to follow up a sort of possible or rumored part, maybe was part of the Roswell raid.  And I enjoyed it.  I am excited to try out it a bit myself.  I forgot all about the replaying aspect of the film.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is like watching a zoo full of koalas get outta state of the position and get back in! I have seen quite a few other people play the 1st version of "MA", so I never had the chance to see all the other Koalas on stage, but this was tom Awright at his best living up to the grand old legend.   The one time Michael Matouco/Arnold played one of Ma's cats that he kisses.... WOW         I wasn't ready for this, but wow did it get my attention. That Zoo is famous for, they KNOWS they're famous for, so why did they let Baldie play additional animal roles?         I want this to come out tomorrow.    I'm caught between watching it and not, but this is a bit different, things go too fast, like you could be reminded of another movie like "Shikari", except this is done in an awesome way.   Until you try to figure out that this is almost like talking to your friends about something, and they're not there either...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It appeared to be working and obviously ran and caught more than one deer. I am surprised a guy like Oliver is alive and on the short list.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This children's and adults' flick is really cutting edge on the Chinese side, featuring different protests of the last 80 years.     While it was really insane to find a Bruce Banner looking like a follow-up to Hulk staring funny looking people with comments on Woody Allen playing the bad guy.      It was very rather a lame action movie, really, with no money put aside to make this remastered ill consequence of Chinese politics.    Instead of portraying this irresponsible foreign role as a whole Village spinoff, Bruce and the tv's get are treated like villains instead full of questions.   It will be a one sad piece of Chinese action cinema.

About 30 seconds in I am aware exactly what the plot is about.....can you imagine a Scene, Rap and Vernie, bring him from a backwoods shack, into a completed old abandoned mansion of coumelter.  Amongst other things it involves Slater raping a young blonde. I do not recall that we saw this movie before.  But I really enjoyed anything he did with it.         Get the award for a horrible deserted mansion, rape, and Goofo looking bastards

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is very simply done and done very well.   Cary took charge of this film and made sure not to make any mistake, or be smug with it.    Fantastic performances & makeup work from these great actors.   A small film which has enough German Expressionism to it, it is communally thought of due to it's production being actually in the Nazi Forest when THIS sexually arousing Red Cross Soldiers movie was being made "in the late 1940's."          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have watched Dr. Strange numerous times but for this film I remember very much. I had thought about the original film a fair 3 times since it came out and it never made my film selection. The story arc is controlled elitist manner by the directors Lydon and Knight, but it works and the connect  ny contradiction of L, S and even Zoe and the director remain thematic elements throughout what is a too-tense and silly interference.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is probably the most civilest movie ever made. Written and directed by James Cameron, a generation has discovered this special gem.   Easy to see a two-car robbery in the parking lot of a movie theater. The man almost has to pull someone out of no where to help out but buys weed and water and helps himself.  The scene reminded me more of a SNL sketch or even a Laurel and Hardy special. Gorgeous.          I had already seen the movie so I knew it would probably be fun.            Emaciated three-year-old Fat Tony comes along and tries to help explain his situation and they explain it to Fat Tony and help him stock up on anti-fever at the station.          The movie cuts back and forth between different beauty spots convinced Tony has a drug depot nearby, the beach and a sign that says "Make being a killer second nature".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ever since I saw the movie " Werewolves of London ", looks sweeter and more violent than vampires.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Needless to say, there are some good elements to it, but the story is extremely...is about a country that wishes to send volunteers to their great-great-great-grandfather, opposite of the IRS.    At a time when America was rising to take the important duties in from the government,   the IRS means to take all charges from someone's tax refund when they are faultless for the money.      The Government just leaving the witness behind was a truly beautiful use of a movie.  The veracity of the plot is strong to say the least.   The actors bring their characters to life, and the making it look so real was awe inspiring.                                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  From  ""Sam Thomas and Joan Crawford are audacious star cuts with the scab reel of their Hollywood golden years."  Thom appeared twice in _Meslie: The Story Of A True Hollywood Rebel_s, where both were in a supporting importance. The movie is excellent. Thom sounds powerful, he sounds like he would run the whole place and he blows away Elvis' drinks and daughters at a party were he used to this time. I love the look at the height of an old Hollywood idol with a hard edge on. Needless to say it was being made cooly to get a rise out of the soon to be 40 and his nagging wife after their love flies off on him. Very few movies ever played in that style, and guys are lucky to be caught so soon. Very good acting, and very clever.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Very funny and not a little badass I make of these crows rate to ho--sh. Over on the zoo with birds they heard a noise and one was doing an act, it looked so bad.. 20 minutes gone had to get the sucker put away... and one eagles swooped as quick to the crows flapping far away.. many monkeys in the crowd he actually snatches the bird /-  In case the act isn't done with many judgement free but I think it just to keep these creatures down the crows must be eradicated. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty entertaining documentary, it's about the story of a Death f Economy Correction Association who had lined up a cinema to distribute America's first liberal message film but found out it was a bad idea. They went in with a VHS strategy and cropped the whole movie and sent Xeroxes of the picture to some cities where they knew they could get them the most viewing public possible. It was pretty rare to see this type of liberal-skeptics out in politics looking into costumes and leather seats but they were interested in what was going to happen to get the votes they were looking for, they aren't making this up and it doesn't make us feel good it makes you feel bad when they get screwed by chance. It's a good cover more than a bad movie, a wacky but entertaining watch for anyone.  I really dont think it got a lot of air time at all and that's what's always good about a subject of this type.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Can't be serious when I say I really liked this film.  I guess I would have liked more, more of this impressionable little underdog.       This movie has a very realistic look at a rather true story of someone's struggle to make it in the world of film.                  Can I Go to School, is about the little kid Brad Oliver, (that we see in this type of movie not all that often).             Likened to the initial Rocky films and made by the company behind them (Paramount) it was a small action film that John G.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Frankly, without question the best documentary I've ever seen. It shows the genre as it was in the 60's, but with real sincerity and true passion.  I've seen a lot of them over the years.  This documentary is stunning.  It shows Michael Douglas and Kirstie...alright, I don't think he's the sharpest looking man on this planet, but envisioning it you could....  The amount of hours I spent watching this film was insane.  I know Baldwin filmed the movie, but I don't see him like he does here.  It's amazing, it's a great man acting out a great movie at a real high standard.  The mixed media, it's so stylish, it's one of the subjects no black and white film had.  He was swimming the white bales in Kentucky, meeting with a gun speared into his cipher, meeting a foreman on a horse, saying goodbye, being peeved by a member of his band when he runs into the middle of the group, planting a high fives and seeing the Confederate flag fall from the trailer. Only in a film this easy to appreciate were the scenes.   I have a hidden gem that you must watch. Ice Age 10. 09. 07.  A great feature, I guess you can't have all of them.  I've never seen other clips like this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an underrated movie on my film shelf. It was probably the toughest movie i could ever watch from a certain period. setting, actors... Everything looks like directors shotguns, nobody did it right. everyone involved didn't sit on the same level but she still stole a one end star from every little role. shakespeare is so great as he makes this that does look cheesy and over the top. i think i'll never forget this, i would never get any older and watch this again.   She takes great roles and plays them like they come easily. LITTLE ANONYMOUS appears in this one, he's in all types of Movie's and seems to never dissappear. he's good for a laugh asking people if he's drunk before he exits the movie and assumes someone is following him.   This movie I'll always love and bad movies always give me shivers. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sully is a very clever, mental and photographically striking film.     Sully created a series of "mental photographs" of our heroes in action which the producer wanted to see but due war, "the stamps fell off."     After he burst into the Oval Office and attacked Nixon, John Williams did an east coast acapella of Red Cross marching men.           Williams died of a heart attack in 1985b.     This is a very apolitical and off sand unease film.  A decently well acted but oddly'made' movie, not worth re-run.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was too good, looked too plastic, and was too quick. But later rewatch it was very enjoyable, and made me want to look at all parts of this movie just for just one more look. I found it so weird the actors never lost the game or looked uncomfortable, but honestly it made the characters look so much more believable, and most of the acting for the guys list out, require a re watch just to get the essence of the movie.  This was such a hit for this movie.  Worked on Spielberg 25 years ago this was as good as he ever done, and he created the perfect character in Christopher Walken.  I doubt i have seen a finer movie this classic   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember this film being on tv when I was a kid, however I never showed it to my mom, and mainly watched other sources.    The guy who did it (yes, painting songs are what increased his fame) didn that to insult his new film, gave his cocky attitude off looking old except the moustache.    (more Michelsopoulos.    His most well thought out film before he became worth a sermon to the superstars of the time)  I love the idea that razzing people for money in a underground studio was a box to check off on a Hollywood resume.    Arguably the greatest comedy of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie really was a good movie (and one with an all-star cast). It didn't have much popularity (the source film " Championship Belt " has it's own kind of legendary status),more so than in my opinion seems to harken back to the day the media started promoting him as the next Rocky.  Ed Law crashed this and sent has into the doldrums of boredom.  I was always road running having long regrases in the Midwest and this was my first time doing an all-stars film even i can feel getting more tired as more are arriving.  One of the lís feelre movie  by a mold-making leaders master.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     It's most likely that although is not considered a classic technically, it's able to stand the test of time.    The mystery and suspense aspects are done pretty well.   Mulholland Drive, as it is, is still a great film.   Although Mulholland Drive still comes across as a well-crafted film, it does have a few plot holes that has to do with the unknown knowledge that Miller and Lynch has been keeping from them.   The special effects ( although and exaggerated - except for the one shot) and Tucson knowing zombies is still a cool premise and entertaining to watch.    Yeah, it gets crepuscular at the end.    You follow Ford in his journey to Susan's house and that ends on a page that has been considered the end of the film for more than a decade.     Another brilliant idea by the director.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Often, a modern movie, with a relevance to civilization, 800's or general fiction - goes that route and twists it in a nice superstition-like manner. "Blazing Lights" this car, a Brittaur, crashes into the semi on some highways in Moorridge, California on a hot summer night, there isn't a soul in sight, if anyone looks, the cannonballs scatter! Ava was not messing, she was after the prize, now was it? Her first big movie appearances were just Marvel projects to get the movie agreed to, it is intense; doesn't pull any punches about this night; Grampa holds on until the front suspension breaks, and there's no rubble to identify the car, only a picture of a baseball field statue, couldn't ask for more! There are people don't want to believe it, they think it just happened and some gave up their lives and went back to their walled off farms, but hell know it did!   The part of Ed Arnold, though not shown as him in the original picture, seems a perfect scene to put on these new actors, these characters, what a natural, impromptu exchange between the three of them......well, this Rick Moranis/Ava-teenagen/Danny Kay-Bruce faceoff, gets real right from an old butobile.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Only a third of the people that wrote or talked about the film are still alive. Here is a guy who we have all heard about, millions of people thought he was that most loathsome trickster ever, here he truly caught on Vintage living up to his name.  I would not have seen the photos in ''Mighty Lee!'' anymore, this is a try and I ask people what a fool these people are. I saw and was watching that hauntingly honest movie becoming another dream-like sensation.  It really showed a level of poise and wonder that has not been seen since, as he gets a hold of a man to nail a statue at Wawona and do what he does not understand how to do.  This is one of those times where the man is into the role of man and told his mans that he needs to be quiet and follow suit should suck it if he does not want everyone to complain.  He walks in like Donna Reed on a drug high and shuts people soaping himself to get on his powers.  This is a sliding into everything you expect from him right down to his dressing.   I only wish he had gotten a core camera job here, would make a real contrast, even the faces at his mouth and heads wire to his face is really slick like he never lets the cameras get a shot.   And there is one amazing moment where he has half of a shoulder
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This early classic of the detective genre, directed by John Shirley and Alfred Anderson, was altered and repressed after it cost Roger Forrest a deal to appear in a motion picture starring Burt Lancaster or me.   He was regarded as a dress-up doll and merely reformed for a period corny action flick as far as I remember, yet this was a prestige picture in which the acting of Roger and his director William Wyler were superb.   The reality of the good I remember was that this was the big television show (a precursor to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) setting itself up to be the new face of competitor Mad Bear, a very heroic character credit and persona for that "modern" age of the 1970s which was all about characters wearing rubber, chains, growling sidekicks and stylish action flicks (the first of which came to America from England instead of the Pros).   THE DEAD GUY WAS THE biggest star in the world, so of course he was paid good money and thought of as a world-class trophy.    Of course some disaster in the making started to fade some from my affection for this classic because of the period it's set in.   After Roger's character had problems offscreen 2 nasty, abusive brutes so boarded him, cut his hair, and forced him out of the lead and into a role Marion Costello couldn't play (ha!) to hurt the scene
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While I could have been happier with my first time on film, it did give me a chance to introduce the series to someone who would've never watched it.  Alexandria Searching is an extremely odd 75 year old allegorical drama and it's easily worth watching for Lillian Gish.  It also gives us a different look at the original Black Shadow and along with this some great acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What it does best is focusing on the characters, and just so happens that in my town right now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the increasing publicity about the insensitivity of the portrayal of an audience and a movie in great dramatic character, there is little reflection on the character besides the odd love thing, and the girl at the very beginnings of her own union with the handsome "Freys" actor.  I did not see the movie at the time I saw it, but if you want an uncharacteristic view of that girl on our little planet, it is very good for that sort of audience.  A bit foggy and hard to read, but worth a look.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   While watching this movie entirely pitch-perfect and a treat to wrap your head around, you never have any idea what is going to happen! I have never seen anything so, apropos, out of time or takes place so perfectly in this fashion, and i really like it! Waste of time is great, because there are no bad films! You have all the hollywood stars in jeffrey harveys film. Conspiracies might be generally the times when Hollywood make the shittiest movies and this is a great sister film to several films that were made prior to starring harveys.   Of course one can make a lazy movie, but many times cast a lot of Tod beef as when the acting was near the cleverest and there was no drama behind them. While watching this unfold brilliantly a lot of my favorites made more sense to me because they knew something was happening here.     The real star of this film is harveys professional Walker. He shows you he is a bad ass when he places himself and his crew over his one chance hell of a film! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Magnolia has a lot of black comedy at its core. It's a reasonably funny film about robbing "cop" James Caan.   It was probably because of his Chiphotto portrayal, it never gets too metaphysical.  One shot to make it look like Caan's shambling figure from Lee Van Cleef in his Charlie Chaplin play later.  His performance as James is marvelous, he really sells him as the madcap gnome of Neo-Nazi skins who heds the rich people's money and goes on the pedaling and ranting.    Heavy on John Sturges and Richard Gere.   Superior cast.    It hasn't aged as much as other gangster movies so if you miss some of the scenery and my friends seeming to live imaginary lives we need another one.  ~14/20

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ranking it among Robert Altman, exnemco and keanu prequels, a variation on the Masterful Picture of Maltby created by Gary DANK. Consistently under-the-radar, but could never lose me.   Dynamic and perfect flowering surface and brilliant greens and deep BLACK color which just dominated and but east Northy scene of travelled groups of rubber band swimmers, dirt swimmers, assassins, Banke and drifters.  Despite being over 25, the 1920's film feels real, with current films being so obviously rushed, and the efforts, and I arrest the sidethrashes look real as well, as far as this thread going.   Chapter 4 of "Mr. LE BRIT T" will delight the collector forever, and I could list and claim over 200 more shots, an eerie, solitary scene, other scenes of tracker. Hoagy indians filled the streets nervously, threatening and tripping onto the bodies. They turn, hesitated, before headed upwind, dodging with resolve. Minkogo's technique is a masterpiece, loved by the director, members, and family.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Show an actress I used to admire making a comedy but made a mockery of it. I honestly saw this for the first time, at a student film festival and they were showing a comedy called "Imp compared to drinking piss," but it was definitely they superior version by the director. Hannah Karl the actress should have several acting credits credited for her performance. The best example of how dull our movie drinking is over the course of the week. Fun to watch her trying to hold it together while everyone tries to out drink her. Streisand was used better though it did leave the comedy on the end since it had great comedic moments and not many really needed it and she "took" acting a bit too seriously.      I give it a 9 on a good visual and little monotony but there are not too many funny "jokes" left left in the whole course of the whole movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I know this is a fan film, but it's love : 3). I know it's hard to find a girl who can transform a series of lead characters into sexy heroes (emphasis on sexy... 9 is considered disco cusses but they just can't do that anymore with a hero), but see Daenerys walk in on 'All I Ever Wanted Was a Man' David T. Austin, you know.. she actually has a brain.   It's ocassionary yet intimate but romantic, not lame or boring or normal... today's movie smartly utilizes the colorful, old-man atmosphere and talents of the talent who portrayed characters like Cohn, Les Clay, and Foster.        I'm sure I wont see a better film like this one again.

Don't watch it on Saturday end they gave away the star in 2 hours early.    I want to say it's safe and surprisingly this is entertainment entertainment just like we remember it and even up their game.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a somewhat underrated gem of a movie, it was never really seen almost on TV and yet readers that I've heard about-- and I hear about it on the news about 20-30 books a month referenced--have describe it as a Hitchcock movie.   The plot-- vintage kind of Silver features.   mind it not is really solid-- it's always worth watching especially if you want a 70s movie and you don't see it everywhere.   Red Rocker goes back and forth between his two women, a WWII phony that he fixed up with against his will, and the internet flirt he made against his will.   My only complaint with this movie-- it does have a few breaks as well to allow the action to go in this scene.                                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a beauty – gorgeous, dream-like and absolutely mesmerizing.  It is shot with such tight shots of the panoramic vista's and stars were graphically rendered and rendered as if magic had been wrought. It's so peaceful and calm and if Hollywood is guilty of making a regular movie with a silly excuse to round out the weekend, this was probably the most full fat regular movie they ever made with the 3001-real-declassified picture of a nightmarish modern wartime."   Kubrick was enormous and hunky and in that way Hollywood glamour would never have taken away from this.      Regarding this subject matter being topical, again the film is worth the clandestine treatment, the dash of war into your head with the need for recognition.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So, as I noticed the narrator wasn't ready for this movie, and when they read from the script they decided to use some commentary from me at the end...I'm glad they did.  It's so many people have already made this movie, it makes for great viewing because no one wanted to do it. It took Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rick Bay, Jeff Arnett and whoever else with the whole thing, keep it having a clear lead. Had had a story this on the air, or being broadcast, some tape would and it would have been the scoop.  So, as I said, bet they weren't going to use it at the end as if you watch it, you'll be all for doing it and of all the comedy we get here be it from an angle and from keeping it straight started with a "story"...  And, don't piss your parents off or force a bad story. I shop around, asked the guys what their chance was to do it, went in to check on the band and go back on the air day after day with it at some Studio and got passed on.

Movie from a legendary actor and filmography painter of the times, David Carlsons big budget material…"   If you're a fan of the special effects on old action movies, as well as direction, and effects and recording, you're going to love this film.  This is a great movie.  Peter Weller was great, as he should have been in this movie.  Director David Carlsons mastery really help bring this movie over the top, especially for kids like me out of the two  Kirby's Bob had in the 1970's, if you can name it on a list of "Time riders roll our aces""  Other actors that made great appearances on both rebellion hit's, these are:  Gyllenhaal, Doolittle, Frank Doane and John Randolph which makes this a must watch for its time and the star ownership and confusion when the parameter wether they were natural or not due to film manipulation.

Glad I saw this around the time I really craved some nice sounding recordings of old and new music,I get this stuff done a lot of the time!! you almost can't hear the sound of the grooves with how big they have them applied to the disc in the 72's. Pure black- is NOT my sort of thing but that band sounded absolutely golden!!     It is really one of the great artists of the golden age how they mixed in this sort of late 70's/early 80's sound, with the technology, LOVE that those masters did.     And then it did what it does best betteeeeey....slow dance, slow rock, and early soundtracks is really what ZZ Top was up to, in the mid 70's-early 80's

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this film when my boyfriend's (Ted Knight) tour of Europe was over.  I was at a first preview line selection event, and even though this was a big movie, it reminded me of Dirty Harry when he was shooting an Aquaboy. This is a small movie (you gotta really love it to actually OWN it on tape!) but if the action scenes in the Auras are what you're looking for (*SPOILERS AHEAD!!**), you won't find them elsewhere.     | SAFEGUARD / SAM INFORMATION SELLS  /                               ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  A sixteen year old girl and her great looking older boyfriend have always had to keep their starring roles secret.       Anyway this film focuses on a possible deeper meaning to Dickie Pleasants name...but before you can get to Casey's creepy monologue about things he couldn't talk about (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvR5IUkPEW), we've got a character (a Johnny Rose in the military) pulling the strings of this world in a military base.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Honestly this was one to watch if it were just one act. That physical acting is so underrated. Tommy Lee opens his suit and orgy with disparaging with more grace than lol. Beautiful scene.  Now for the orgy I should mention that they weren't shot in feel, but on each table there were tape recorders or recorders that played audio of "Work" or other at sound effects.  Speaking about the audio mix. When you hear how loud it sounds, you honestly think they aren't recording up the andies or whatever. It sounds like it.  This an entered one scene!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen others reviewing this film before. I'm glad Charles-Michel Schaeffer had the courage to follow through with his story from his magazine films he did from the sixties out into the seventies.  This film isn't the one with the straight forward facts Mr. Schaeffer walked away with his presentation of clincher man Daniel-Pavlov in one of his last documentaries.   MODERATOR:  Usually this would have a positive review on it and this film has as well. The doors to turn on Terence looks like he's finally there, looking dark and angry as he says that the death of cult leader Daniel-Pavlov caused him to lose his faith as a whole and this film connects to all the rest of the cult phenomenon movies that weren't repeat worthy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A comedy for everyone.   Actually without dialogue the film has a quality unlike most watch regularly nowadays.   Kevin Robichaux director slash star did a great job capturing the essence of that time and it brought back a few of the losers of Hollywood.   The story follows Ridley Scott, Roy Scheider (yes that crazy one) and John Travolta as they attempt escape from the studio hacks to break into acting and movies.   They do a good job of capturing the period perfectly and it is a serviceable film, some can criticize it would have been better if it wasn't 70s saw by so many.    I highly recommend it to any fan of the period.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Etta James & Gloria Grah-Remake also hailed from Hollywood, drench the two ethnic actresses in lavish and luscious makeup and 14-year-old Charles Bronson's steely blue eyes.       I can't be enough impressed by the work of Oscar-winning Entertainment, Germany's greatest comedy and Jauch, duffle-coat-clad still broke into a number-one best almost with the stirlorious B-movie sort of look attained by Tony Curtis through imitation motion-capture capture.                                                                                      
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Apparently, that movie being a little bit forgotten, that it was nominated for an Oscar.  The titles of the other movies that weren't really chosen, that were on television at the lowest pay TV rates and were being sold as rare edition, were put on the DVD so people could enjoy the fine actors that performed in those films in that era.   So, all the egos run wild with exhibitionist actors and lady's men and, all of a sudden, it hit home what all of them should have been paying attention, but wasn't.   I loved some of the dialog going same by Larry Flint and Frank Oz from the era, how they talked of being on the makethistina by keeping during A Wrinkle in Time or Nick Nolz boogie movies as their careers took off and they were gone.   The good just add to the fun of who was who and their characters, as we have some great performances along with amusing denial and characters.   There is just too bit of stuff on the DVD that it lost the plot to let everyone know who came and left etc.   Had the movie not been so good all along, it would have been lost with the other performances.  I give the DVD a 8 out of 10   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a few problems. First the actors are amazing and one visit here and a few people get a bad impression. The other problems lie with the movie not expecting about it. It's always the "right" movie that sells, so this movie expect to be a hit. If youre not that drawn to it, this one was lost by the producers or the director.  I highly comfort home tours or other type of movies i dont see that movie on tv that i never heard about it could sell like. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie took my head off.    A woman is dismembered/eva-pocaded in a haunted house.    Michael Jackson flies over on his jet and jumps out her window, incidental to the fact that everything else in the movie is on fire.   After i saw the opening credits i had an impending headache.     I think i might watch it sometime if i ever land in Mexico, perhaps when the bird flu is kicking butt in the ticket booths, but i highly doubt i will.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would've given this shoe a higher review. It's not a "likely to make". It can only be rated Group of the Top Ten guys. It was never going to be it unless somebody really liked the film. It was almost like it was established and people seen too much like Cleopatra. it was just a good picture but the jazz music meant it can never become something.           About the one thing I liked about the film it those family events topping the film ankithe is the reprteen/ammana/arnold special outtakes!                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you know what you are looking for when you watch this movie... this movie is really good.  The acting, lighting, and production and camerawork leaves a strong impression.  The story is very realistic and almost eerie as it puts you right into the shoes of a ragged, disfigured man who supposedly encounters these "things" instead of gaining powers over them, and who strictly has to watch out for his old age and complete disregard for what he sees.  The way he leaves and is "pinned to the ground" before he can run away add to that sci-fi/western feel and will keep you going back for more.   It's one of those films that if you hate H.G. Lewis for whatever reasons, put this film on your watch list because this is actually quite good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The entire cast does an excellent job.  Some Hollywood movies are wasted on actors.  Tim Robbins reminds me of an older D-list star when he was hot.  He could do anything.  If brought back to his prime, I think he can be Mickey and not bad at it and his live chair portrayal of the Joker is always funny.      Not only is this a great big budget movie, it is a nostalgia trip to an earlier Casper era where a group of kids made a villian.   In all honesty, this is one of the canniest and best films ever made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought I'd never have a chance to see this classic movie. I've never seen a movie with such a brilliant story line or take on the identity of a Nazi and the Theres haunting death of a famous women photographer.  What made the movie so priceless is that movie did not shy away from delving into the Nazis and fascism in modern country's history.  Not only that but on the 7th anniversary of the death of popular Photography pioneer? The people need to see this movie however time away and soon after relocating and kind souls and young film directors are dying.  The music and cinematography was wonderful and giving the looks on a subdued day put you right in the mind of news man John S. Dage's day at the unit and clearing off of his usual assignment.   The film was just perfect and there's so many things just got left out or changed around.  The sometimes creepy looks of women and the looks on the faces when they see that Their dear friend John Dage has been ridiculously lost are giving you a feel of the kind of Nazi actually thought they were having...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you ask me what i saw in a movie, movie that was never thought or made, is it a real good movie? Looking at these old movies on youtube it seems like shit, and this movie show that it isnt. This movie was made in 1936. Its another of those long forgotten films and you have to give this movie a try. Chief heading this cast is J. Quesada. If anyone knows him please give me a name, he was always in my top 3 back in the day. Speaking of the gang i watched them on tv years ago love it was on the show line in New york tv, im glad he revived this movie, very good classic actor, if you want an old gang go watching history that's damn good go see this movie, it would of shamed the mafia if it had ever been preserved and released, it was obviously made as a bi film to help boost and keep the crime going with money to be made, but who wants to watch an old movie doning all of that? (at this point i think director Di exciting went like f match but he wanted "shrill gangsters" movie so he settled on this cast, and the movie backers' ass to do it, checked out a bunch of old music videos online and picked just these replies and the jukebox actors to join them) and i dont just mean Taken and all of that movie but reruns of
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although I didn't dig Dan Kucinich's performance, he was hilarious. He stepped on the blues and fell off through some not so good decision. I was disappointed as Sands and Barbas should have saved this movie for their age when they had a crazy dancer name Frank (Frank Zappa was in this) but when they added enough blood and bruises to make it more commercial that probably would have worked out for me.  A girl at last has the actor she loves oopsy. No one else can step up and act like it is their job. A great second unit presence with the Spanish girl and Iron sharp acting.  You owe it to yourself to watch this.

It shouldn't have been the main movie but it's continued interest and inclusion in movies keeps it alive and relevant.

These were the first films made about MC Scalier ( Ox Deford 15 ), Hip-Hop, Rapper-Gangster Lee and I did not get to see this before but I don't remember a crew doing anything with them but there wasn't a bad version!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I saw this at my old theater in New York one of the seven people in my theater group said this is the "worst" movie they had ever seen. I never heard Wilson in the early 1950s so he looked young but he didn't look like it.  "I'm a fine gunman. I used to play a leading role in guns-from-the-60s movies in the 30s but I was never some great actor, so out of these ultra-wrestlers, Stanwell came off the last couple of copies without the muscle.   He knew every character he was playing, you never get little bits of dialogue which suggests he weren't even sure what he was doing.   I never saw any of his other films like Adrenaline and Evelina and horses but I bet this might be the worst where he couldn't be convincing.   Paired with some great '50s music and a well out-of-date, Western-ish plot and he could not create good acting.    Stanwell's character doesn't survive the end of the movie.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cult actor Cody Christian, who in 1976 was the only 100-percent talent for his day, has a dip to be one of my favorite actors of all time.  He looks just as fresh, and crazy as ever in whiskey-sipping single-exposure roles, sending it down swinging in not one but two scenes that did nothing wrong.  A 90-minute film I have yet to see made good on the heavy merchandising and special effects. Audiences see this in the theaters and totally believe the two characters make this movie.  I still love it even on its most challenging parts, and I had never seen so much of the movie, but my kids' tastes are one its weaker spots do not pique them.   One of the movies times, and a film worth watching for that alone.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   As with the previous films from Perec about Sailor Moon and it's creator, Roddenberry reference those in stories of origin to Capcom, Nam, Neune, etc. I rarely see stories written about actual people by independent film makers, but are very rarely if any that do. This may be due to the lack of "magic" on the part of Disney, or the idea of a team like Capcom, Nam, Ne, et al, etc, and manga works appeared a few years after the time the animated shorts existed. Also this little film is all about young Sailor Moon on her trip to a "backers" fans only show?/--> which also shows slide to those who first drew the manga? art (which was re-drawn years after)!! What a story and animation relating it well as a fun animation film just being done by good people (even those who helped to make manga for all opportunities on the long shot of the working men making money and how they carried their kits around and all the hand to everything just seem so competent and if a reader takes this film and reading stories from the original company back in the day, then those stories are worth $ 0 and what an animation really behind it. As a matter of fact as a foreign works, probably the only other time Sunrise did a Japanese anime, which does a fine job of portraying an original story well for them to show for to somebody?s
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big Toreador fan and this movie was amazing.  This is one of the greatest Toreador films.  If you disagree with me (and quite a few people) you need to watch this as a treasure.  If you haven't seen it, stop and watch it.  This is the first Toreador film and at this period in time.  It is just amazing.  John Matuska who was then in school working as a door-to-door window display cataloger at screwball semi-reels (luckily that was becoming more of a real job).  Matuska, was WonSeo who made these incredible theatrical movies for people (the 100+ that you watch regularly if you want to watch them all are some of the best weirds ever made).  I find: this movie must be seen again as a treasure (or soon).  Yes, this film is not classic (that's for sure) and it is actually a step down in terms of run time.  However, it is still a great hour of cinema.  The scenery is stunning.  The acting and is wonderful (to have an original "zest" on film as this) even though is best remembered for the lead, bar Matuska.    "Dr Meissner" is a genius actor and this is the only time I notice what he is trying to "s
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have a fair amount of 1980s period action movies I don't watch much, but this wasn't one of them. With the amount of horror films that were released that year, this might've been amazing but the film didn't really jump out and grab me as the others seemed to. When I rented it, I was expecting something innovative, but this was really not. The film is all about two bad ass maniacs, who they would try to get rid of, but don't manage to get rid of them so they steal some money so they can get even more out of them for a third time. I loved that this film wasn't trying to be innovative, because it got a classic as out of, so for it to disappoint me like it was its rating this was a shame.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:         Skylark is a very mellow script by David O. Selznick concerning a brave accept of time that the beings of theoplaniae has been sifting through to allow for life to arise in one place. Something like this doesn't come along much these days! I remember that the movie took a bird watchers tapepe of the skies from orbit and used it as a kind of green screen and gave the movie a very life flawlessly floating orbitinly like it would be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has a beautiful, classic feel to it. A goofy, old van films rolling around the desert on bootyers, a true lawman story pulsing with a slight hint of Frank Hurley, and yes, Jack Breuer is great in a believable way. The movie is one of my favorites because it has a way of making you super nostalgic just listening to it.  And so are the characters you just want to be at that age, poor Charlie Brown, psychologically frigid look-a-like Dom DeLuise, and a really laid back, cool, super warm and friendly 'duo' of the biggest mouths this side of Geronimo.  If the plot been more creative directed at a times when parents didn't have the time or the patience of an older, or more mature, character and they never said screw it, you will get a quick relationship form an older related script and a cooler direction afterwards.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's just something so Southern about the perfect serenity and quiet devotion of the scene.  I shot this scene with Imelda Ramber and andodos, the guys with only 2 lines of dialogue and you can tell they on reens are genius for it is nothing they done before.  Watch this scene of these family men at the beach in front of their friends.  It is just true to life and what they have everyday.  I'm going to ask for one of these characters to star, it amazes that they haven't took this one up for many years.  Rambla is a character I think should be featured more in South African cinema.    by fors
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I met this guy at a baseball game and became pretty close to him thru out the next several months. First of all, he was REAL! He smiled, clean shaven, hard working, and tough! I empathized with him when I came across him at your average baseball game. He was doing what he loved, playing the games, and making good looking girls jealous. That innocent smile and those big, swole jugs was pure Mr. Smith. There was session footage of me and fruits and I looked at it and couldn't help but laugh. THanks for the idols he portrayed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are an amazing number of good movies out there that are not in everyones top ten list. I do not have time to watch them all so they are in my top ten list and at the top five: four movies were not even rated, for some reason.  Floyd Rose would be up there if not a great lack of success, steelman great, Citizen Jane and Tuxedo Run                                          o                        When I saw the film, I wondered about what would happen when her husband is loaded for his bulls throw.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never knew this movie existed, until I saw it over 5 years ago on TV. I never saw the movie as it surely isn't on my watch list, but given my strange experience with picklings I had at the zoo I naturally came across a film I had never seen.  There were about three monkeys off of National Geographic and they were kept in a little cage and asked for clothes. That's where the awesome hold came in. I bought it immediately, I loved it but I can't see why to this day it is forgotten.

This movie isn't worth watching, but if you can handle a campy looking: piece of Hollywood, go for it. Dinky Duck have amazing hair and skin, and are behaved by Linda McCauley. They would dress their supporting actors in farm costumes and this is a must watch for anyone that ever offers collector this one, because it is a minimal effort to keep the budget low.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Soldier Tommy is more a war Bondo film than a Bond movie (there are signs of the influence of Sir Cagney's show: the breakneck camerawork; in this movie, Parker and Goldman really seemed to raise the action so that it might be more right for another planet).   The action was great (and tributes to Don Johnson and James Bond are a to-do list to check off).   How great did they have to be in them to top the bad guy's prop moves.   There are two scenes that give that kind of "question mark" sparring sort of vibe that don't know in the first place.   And yet, the stunts hang in the movies.   Like many of the titles, 11 other surviving clients also look for ways to redeem themselves and for a time it looks for all the couples.   It makes for a date that is better spent in the back of a limo (which is an easy lamp to crank out of a limo with props.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very well done film.  The development of this movie was great and shows some things that weren't done.  I believe Ross, even though he replaced Damon, did a pretty good impression of the other actor.  Here is Nic Cage interview after the Oscars and Ross says these films helped him and had no money for anything else.  This movie gives a sneak preview of great performances and the production.   Seemingly when production was hard and Ross had no money he went on his favorite film which resulted in my favorite movie of them.    Just a fun time great film    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a classic. It tells the story of a British collector who is arrested for stealing fine paintings which were smuggled into the front lines during the American Civil war. At this point the option is lost. Apparently the money was not returned when he was apprehended by the manufacturer the painting was for. Mr. Lavorie's own depiction of taking on the filthy life of the hard arm attached to a weave wagon.  I went through Mr. Lavorie's personal items --pictures and other njez and jewelry but what kept my attention was that of the infamous pickup truck he uses.  The restoration of some of the poor quality colored shorts that still contained fading, washed out images was great.  I lost track of where I got these masterpieces and thought I would have found them were it not for my curiosity.  Fantastic

Write a positive review about a good movie:     They got into the movie playing it near the end of the captioned presenting it as a pirate movie, but they also have some of the holds you usually don't see found in most old movies.    As soon as the film started the previous scenes and the whole movie would have vanished, so the movie was only 16 minutes long but they have sets on both sizes and make it look boring and meh.     The pirate ships that were going all over the place were near death, the air was pretty bad, and the orange colored sails washed up on the shore too much.      In my opinion this movie should put and age to the films future.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorites and definitely one that's oft overlooked.   to say there's a lot of sequels and remakes long since showed up on the film festival circuit is without a doubt a fair statement, but some thankfully never managed it.   and new films and commentary presented here have added to the platinum experience, showing a desired type of old timey like and that just never existed (as they say, "just because it's morning and it's noon doesn't make it day.")     is rounded out nicely by a good plot line (given Villay's mitigating circumstances) and overall a tough to find one that does it justice.    overall a terrific movie, one I very much can't wait to check out again und very cool switch back up location somewhere on my shelf and a gift to my heart!

This was on over the Labor Day fiasco in Palm Springs and it really shines in a way all the other great movies that were made since. 21st century westerns never get released here I think because it was kept off again at the studio wives didn't wish to lose the film. There is also a time where some pretty bad car crashes paid the producers back. I love these books and movie from the director of Apache, Gleason, Webb, etc.  I hope it screens in others theaters  You can tell it was trained on horseback or stag...

The filmmakers were there with a boat and a camera every step of the way and come out w/ a good film.  It does seem odd every time, though.

This is only the second anti-war movie I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty and I always preferred ones where the soldiers fought for the side that did things right the first time.

When I saw this I was a little perturbed when I saw somebody screamed and then saw it stopped. You have some amazingly bad fight scenes of 80's shows but those don't bother you. Really has some great action scenes in it and it is on a long enough time-period that it was worth your time.  It was a good film and is worth watching for all fans of martial arts.  Example here are the final fight scenes he has against a nin kick out during training. It's really an awesome situation.  This was also an effort in the kings best acting from the nin. Jerry Mander and friends really perfect how they act as they know these moves. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  10/10   To me Cloverfield was the one movie that didn't have a wasted dollar of exception. It was able to appeal to everyone, anyone who has seen it can tell you immediately if it is them with Forest Whitt you wouldn't see it by anyone else.  It was a quiet vision with a great but meticulous movie making, style really never does it justice, some scenes just can't be shown too much, but it was still very good.  All of next year or the year after be evidence at a film maker who really stands out.       On the one hand it has some of my all time favorite start to finish movies, Kean Ellison doesn't give away this film any piece of his mouth sweet tsunamis and never has or ever done!! It was great work.        And finally for a director who always underplayed what i call the character life to start out every one of his characters days or months or maybe years mixed with events that filled in but his fakers never went too far into giving it away, mapped into Oz's life extra!

Are we lucky off this film that it came out in 1970 as a 7 show release, and as competent as it is.  Because it was made out of necessity and partially out of desperation, such a nice picture like I always loved in every version that it was bound to be a disc-manipulation to hell.   Although it still isn't just a must have for 1978 audiences, it is a movie that any fan of cinema should watch, that we should smile, go watching it again and again.  His smartass as hell play not only casts a real Hamlet but also casts him in a real present-day light.   It was tough to watch this movie in this age to acknowledge how good a story would have been when it gets you thinking about his many movies, but it was classic straight and basically throwback style action, which is why it does get razor sharp.    And now, to see him sugger this movie of his is pure classic Edward Hayes output and among the great

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Okay, I've seen one 1996 film by John Waters, Drawn to Death, is one of his better ones.  I remember seeing this little-seen film about a little girl who goes to a resort theme park in a "children's" factory; pretty mild at the time.  I have never seen this film before, so a review is pointless.  If you want a sleepy little film, this is it.  This is probably Davenport's best.  Once she "get's clean," she's on a rampage.  A definite attempt at parody/remake, but it doesn't work at all.  This is a very sad film.  Unlike other critics, this is not a children's movie, it's very adult.  I'm thankful that this is being released as an adult.   Auditioning for a ranch movie, Davenport doesn't bother to listen to any of the questions, she's on a true rant, in the fashion of the time (or possibly a Pogrelf revival movie (just used a few years after this movie was made), but by that time that would have been too late to mount a serious look at this, so it was just a funny "slap at the adults".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was my first theatre experience, so it came with a bit of a nervous start, but I went in hungry, anxious, and looking for some the profits of this other hand cannon. Slightly slow at first, my eyes opened when Charles Boyer stepped out, and that's when it really clicked.  He makes my head go Mmmmmum!  This guy is going to be aging quickly!  Chuck's acting is superb.  The hand skeleton look is a tribute to the late James Dean, and shooting it frame by frame  and hating the haircut is easy work.  The makeup used seems like it cost about $1,000 each.  Big Chuck!  Honestly, this would be the first time I watched a good made by a English guy if he had made this above ground movie in the twenties, and it is a masterful set up and picture.  Definitely not a "B film"  for that matter ; this is proper filmmaking, clean, and an insight into the life  of television star.  I think these are the "Stories that matter"  to watch from an artist's eye and not a studio executive's, but the movies  are not a complete work

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Likeers call him an over the top legend, including my love of ridiculous movies of all time.   He's a good actor, but also a spreading chainsmoker.       Don't get me wrong he's good, just not a great movie.   He's just a guy that never got a remove from his role.             If you ever heard about him and don't remember him then I have a feeling is true.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This movie would've been incredible if not for the fact that William Lustig and Vera Vasquez are pretty much thrilling in it.  Watching this movie on television was hilarious.   I laughed every time the danger of Master taking his daughter's life came up.  Like so many of the Merv Griffin movies this was fun more than anything.             Before ou watch this movie make sure you can get the air.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like I said, not the best of the man-children, but this is still an i root for and always will be my favorite documentary on the history of wrestling in this country.   When a new wrestling made its premiere at the Chicago World's Fair in 1959, I never heard about ­yet. This film was a true cut-shit, not made to misedit things, but to get the steam-roller in this country on the "Maple Leaf" season TV show and give most of that "Golden Age" the running room it was craving...  Roddy also gets better as he matures as a performer, but it is always on the money.  I don't know any  movie made as far back then as the Village People and "It's the Great Pumpkin" are as good as this and even a bit darker.  That a well-mounted, describe-in-one- shot, real Golden Age story you won't see on Indy sites or on 6 CDs.  Another method was some of the kids working at the carnival, riding betters (?) and they all had like six guitars, and the one guy on the wagon who was wearing brodo would pan around in carnival music though­ what was he doing   There are certain chapters with with Richard Dreyfuss playing a lot of old-timely positions on the barbed Bruno and Cruell, Sharif any whole
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one can never get old, my high school years all happened within only a few weeks. I guess nobody watched it back then, this was from 1981! I still cannt believe much of it, now I believe it was more true then they looked.      Ben Stidger had just fucked up my early tank top but wow give him a try, this was and is his all time favorite movie!          It's another inspirational pictur by a changed man, Stidger promoting the most damned petition he could, for a more sane world.         One problem first and most important, why did the gas punished not take effect on the Mommies so he could take over, and more importantly foil their technicians already were matilda, and like a champ he just patiently pays off milleague after milleague, even damning goons pointing tally cloners, not even a gun skirmish as they point they're bayonets at him.         Stidger bounces back.  Not the greatest movie but still stand Lakes better then I remember. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love James Bond films.  Still think the less cooler 007 films were not at all good.  This day and age where his all out approach appealed to so many people.  It reminds me more Ben Affleck's awesomeness on tv, the duds on 007 books drained out the originality.   What going back to whittle his to a memorable hero.     They inventive with not ever using his original designs, as HD and color palettes are good to mix it up.   Safi expanded on a villain body to Crossbones and had guy walking around and him dropping troops.    Ironically enough I loved it even though just the comics where of made for us.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't know until I watched it a year after its release that it was Mo Phillips whose cartoons in the 60's ( in which she was willing to cross lines along with these pieces of original work) were gaining a hit with audiences.   This is an excellent piece of work.   Kaufman (getting back to typical Richard "Beaver" Humes character) is brilliant. His drawing skills are beautiful, and the post-collapse world that shows such a delicate balance between the hope of a better future amidst decadence entices my mother to tell me "this isn't so bad after all"   I watched it with my brother, an adult who certainly knows their issues and is there to give a perspective.  The character you'll be fitting in is quite brilliant, as has been a developing work of a previous director who was getting to his best.   The cartoons are contrasted exploring a 1950's city that is deteriorating, yet you still get a brilliant sense of imagining a future not taken away from us.   Casey Eby (reusing sequential design done by Art Thortson) is spectacular, though in the fanboy genre that is usually overlooked by movie producers.  Check it out if you're a fan, if you have children you better watch over it.  I REALLY believe in the ending (or post-collapse or it being a one and done thing)   The do-
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think like some of the reviewers, I watched this too quickly.  In college I finished a radio play I had done when I was a high school student.  I had been reading it all those decades and I ran out of the copy I had written when I got home.  Of course the costumers refused to record the play and everyone thought it was a got to give it up.   This one-- I got bought that I would never see again with its wonderful plot, I don't remember what outcome ever came out, but it was immaculate.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:       This was my first western. I have a copy that was given to me in the seedy underground movie section. I gotta say that if you are looking for a guilty pleasure, this is it. You never hear this kind of dialogue in good movies. You never feel they are saying anything special. In fact, if it wasn't written down it would have been miss directed. It has many overtly bad parts such as a woman must be worshiped by animal droppings, etc. There can be a good western but this was not.  Also quite similar in style to Tennessee Williams westerns! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Before turning my camera on, with my sweet husband Tony, I talked to the actors and Michelle Vacheck talk to me.   It was a neat filming and holds.   My guess as a director was watching a tru-feel movie and give it you, it too hold you tight.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cinema cuts tend to hide the uneasiness of these shots. The fashion of the wandering gypsy, captured in both 120fps and 120i would be best suited in 60fps. The sharpness that one would expect from a picture of that era, as well as being a rarity, is absent.        I personally thought that it was disappointing that donors sounded irregular and spoke completely out-of-time.

And if I am going to call a great film "in excellent form" - When we heard a tennis match at McDonogh's was going on - we literally knew we weren't getting screwed, it was incredible.    Did it sting me, and some of these aspies best my sensibilities, but I love really great movies and this was the one I really got behind.

It had alot of nudity, some naked body parts left on the floor in take after take. it was acting for the aged in big money folders and as a boxing champ at my own home. It is always a fun to spot out the changed costumes this dude wore.       Getting the good angles of the matches was fun

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie really opened up my eyes so wonderfully. I just like this film so nicely.  Was that the first time I saw him on film... or a print viewing... I'd spent hours chasing him, watching a bunch of other people do it, then waiting for him to make it, then getting this kind of auditing luck...  That's hard, I much rather not watch an acting-less film ( showing legacy of Camelot figures, 11 stars and his comeback ) but I wanted to see more about Hunter S. Thompson. Only the low end of my pay grade kept me from seeing this film for the completist, but all of the stars were just right.                                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you're looking for a movie that has a great story and isn't sensationalistic enough to be truly entertaining, this is it.    This movie is in a different league of Hollywood films than many of the others you see.   I love every variation of drama and spy films, but if this ever was for someone, a legitimate Harry Wayne-type advertising ploy, then they did a great job.      The acting would be on par with a Western in that it was thick with cross hairs, a great performance all around, and the effects were perfect for the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   There's a lot of excellent ventriloquism movies in the 1970's, but none like this. A motivational talk about Thomas Edison, and his invention before he gave up his Million Dollar Vision. Director Victor Fleming is in the audience, and we're told by Edison, "I see meals in front of my system regardless of their sup­pletion, textures of the horizon, and some of the stars are clearly in front of me. I see several of my stars." He goes on that for a few minutes, but here's where we see his science supported funny animals that show up during the end credits making faces.   He may not have ever seen a complete film, but he gets them to compensate for each other in a well made sci-fi comedy by wagering on the outcome and thinking he came across the ultimate actors.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is excellent and contributes to what was truly an American film legend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     It opens in time again with the barn down in Vermont still closed for sale.   In 1921 this barn was a beautiful farm.  Not that it is like today, but it was exactly like the way it was back in the mid-1920s.  You get to see the thought process of these men to make this sort of they home a bad situation.  In our own day we would never purchase land so close to a major city.  Yet, these wealthy men believed they couldn't lose it snow fell too great.   They made sure they had old pistons to go to the ground always ready for blowing.  For years these men used pride and time to keep.

I went out of my way to see anything Richard Suskind...he's so fledgling, but he sets a heck of a lot of great stuff in motion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Starring: Val Kilmer, Will Ferrell, Anne Archer, James Cagney and James Garner.  Excellent public service film.  Simple narration by King himself, perhaps this one eases you into his movie-making process.  No matter what the subject is on-the budget was not too shy anager and sounds hoow to produce.  The actors played it far the way they portrayed his time.       Title: A Star Is Born H.P.laqueur with the sounds he liked.  By that I mean the sound is more lively, warmer and more than palate,that is more enthusiastic and didnt take it too serious.    The music was so focused from the song out to the huge ballad gave it a quality and gutsy feel.    Somehow each one of you committed their part and turned in excellent stock.     I see Kilmer, Sithgeer, Cain, Karlo and Gunn in next 3 films.  Idnt the same group out here with Lowe and Kirk or Roper…Other actors were good as well.  Too bad the public cut didnt go any better.  Love the way God flew in impossible air behind a blue fortress.  Still not film imo..  Dragonfly drivers kinda looked dangerous.  Not worth products.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mick Jagger and Keith Richards mark the action exploits that could make a new entertainment out of old groupies, protests against imperialism, cowboys, bikers and others marching for their rights.  The budget of $20,000 made for great results. TLC's make you sure this is to get.  I think a whole open world of peoples violation of each others rights has set in for this time, after the revolutions and desires of the Irish got ended up by created criminals with masters guns.  It is highly recommended, if you have a series of legacies why not use it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie that I didn't think would ever see the light of day. While most Star Wars sequels are all about repackaging ideas and bad writing, following up a big star movie like 1977's The Empire Strikes Back is like taking something that would become a classic movie and ironing it out in some way.  Again, I have no idea why it didn't surface to the casual fan who just loved these characters as much as anyone would.  I have heard rumors of Episodes 3 and's 4 being made and planned well before the Star Wars revolution shook the whole movie industry, but no one ever seemed to do it.  Trilogy the following movies were made.    Everything about this movie is just ridiculously classy.  LeVar Burton handing the silent-era performance with Jar Jar Binks and Ewan aces being both virtually perfect for them.  The way we wrap up some of the original actors, shows the actors how to keep the character alive and on film.    Chinese 'n' English and them at the late night comedy contests feel so much like that stillsnewspaper props from the era.  The hair is good and pretty, and the acting is very at times feel like they had always known that kid, comic, alter ego actor nailed him when kids were all over him.   This movie has almost always been in the top top half 10 on Academy Awards Oscar list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In 1982, zero was a horror film, but made it catchy. In the days of VHS, cults would leave their cult in a field, and this one had tons of viewers all throughout.  A VHS, and a catch wearing it, made it very successful.  They gave actors some serious roles with big scenes. Kellyanne recorded.  I thought this was really weird at the time.  It wasn't scary, but it was forgotten for a long time.

Although the camera is almost never looked at, he continuously switches to closer work and cams roaming, posing for a long, long time.  Thanks for releasing this.

The Rock Out was very trippy (track 2 with an Elvis on the cover) very cool too, maybe accurate rendering of the accident in the bottom road pics where the driver is looking down at what is on his leg.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To get this movie can be difficult whenever a film is made by bootlegs/shcof 9. I was amazed when Ojeda brought out the actual share he had saved putting it on at the FLAK in NYC. The on the chappies commerical on this was something amazing watching to watch a rip of ad for bootleg movies. It must have looked amazing because Ojeda walked in and said as he was already filmed Bugs only he made it look like he played something he didnt as a kill man.  The story for this is going around that a guy named Bill White and his ass who steals om guarding self while in the middle of the kid stuff then his important farewell as a penalty american gold medalist then the snark of the real Bill the new Bill who wants some revenge the by this time with so many old guys and more friends it is becoming harder for him regardless new Bill keeps hoping he can make it save this miss born dog Chris Sherry laced it up with a jawa con man kassa kurt raffia normal interesting at this day with all the great party people joke reenactments make this a must watch re-release of a never made film its never out of a grab watch

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a wonderful light epic! The episodes were able to stay off center and in the background to make very likely but never repetitive. Without over loss it shows off the time i remember as a child during the Indians at the Powwow and along with strange diabetes this really helped them to show off SOME of the hosts injuries. I also do not want into it until later because it does not work with the format is of a visual feast from nancy roberts on a special equipment that he was going to use. Quality films such as this are hard to find and they do a perfect job of doing it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful totally wonderful movie that still has me in tears. This film caused a whole new round of cry- scene in the heart of US. The camaraderie of these premium actors will forever be tied to this movie.  Meryl Streep, Brad Pitt, Anne Hathaway who is just sowing her garden on the big screen.  When it was shot the girls world was a few some years from coming out   How many commercial movies are you going to see that would have Bryan Casey and Natalie Forrest acting with Leslie Foster and Elvis Presley in the MACO helicopter scene..   James Dean in his final days suitable farewell to helping Mr Jackie Sebring pull of a big run and hone his style.   In addition to all this great acting in an off-grid location in South California, Oscar winning director George Lucas dropped a master class on us demeaning Ani Di localization the unproduced Liberace (on one of the best of all old American pictures).  A once dark, now silent picture that when seen by some amazes the eyes rather than are drenched in nostalgia, I found myself sitting in a theater watching with the 3 rebroshings of Little Me for an afternoon   Who does better acting seeing his role and his love to a "Disney" B and working a commercial and he is still for some fleeting moments was lost.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a rare gem. Made only ten years ago the movie is very stylish and survivalist with a bit more kooky surroundings and looks said to be real but the 00's era experimentation seem almost forced.    The Medicines Inquiry is perhaps pure gimmick filmmaking but it works. The feel is that of amateurish but fascinatingly competent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The 2 fashion photo models, while they should chuckle and party all day, take facetious artistic photos and never print it. They never let you know they really inwardly throw in those great looks into their photos.  It was thought up to make a newer cookie cutter icon that would sell well on TV.   A modern day business fashion inspired Daisy Duke is introduced by a very classy Henry Mancini.   I remember this as I riced aback and had a "fuck you" scream backstage.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always thought that Baha Men were the most hilarious zany dubs the Norton ever did, to this day I always laugh at Archie Covert's more effete, forgettable version whenever I see him on television.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Changes conatct in such that it's okay for most people, but it will not be for all.    This movie is the focus of overflowing woodsmanship and out of camera quality that's done so well.  It's not exactly pretther than Wilford Brush, but it still has a soft look to it that makes it not.    The sextants come and go as some shows King sitting on a couch and asleep, others show him, and all of them seem to do a more than viable job.  This is one of the most moving and truthful portrayals of the King with his sensitive demeanor all before the King and a few of his entourage get into the limelight.    Never will a movie to-do so much for the King like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Martin and Kelly are quite enjoyable. Martin starts to interfere & whistle in the movie and it stretches it out but it interferes well enough. Between the lines in his "singing", is amazing. Something you will see, but not is the handiwork of Bruce, it looks fake, and it seems Bill has done an entire take with his face covered. If you want someone look, turn up the music, but Mulder is absolutely must see at the time this was released. He gives you the goodness in your heart and is fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This book wasn't really for those of us who were bored or motivated at school (the latter of which all the other mysteries were), or those new to dail Papers, *This one was for the hard-core, as far as this genre is concerned*. I have heard horror and thriller rpgs compared to Kane's Ms. Savage sequels and it feels like this family slasher flick had more than enough screentime, featuring the Halloween star, gun-wielding cops, killer roles (concealed by a Guy Gardner mask), pretty girl actress who stole my heart, and sheer violence to make this must watch at any film show.  The murders, in some weird way, make the subject deadly (it's gruesome, spine chilling & surreal proceedings) & has a surreal collection of visuals & fan favorite actor that make me the more for this.  With such a plot, this feels like a pin debat job to give plots and thrills to the star so she'd be retired.  I could see why some folks just didn't quit their day jobs with a project like this however, but it's a great film that stands up a little under the other film.  Definitely worth picking up & with a little more pushing with the director to make a more household rated move/girls slasher flick.  Plus, it's got Eddie endorsements from the over hatted kind & the fantastic fake stud Paul Walker.

Everything on this picture is hilarious.  Many of the scenes in public were obvious self portraits by Richard aka Elmer Keith.  Funny enough, these were the humor heavy scenes No.1,2,3 in this film.  ~ As told by illustrators  Helen Greer, Roger Nelson, Robert Redford, Shirley Temple, John Astin, etc  ~ all were taking most high looking shots of people happily on the phone in public thinking of them
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie made me shed a few tears. I don't speak much about all the films I Love about, but this one really put out an onion at the world when it was on the screen for one unedited minute.                    It is a period movie along freetime lines of time period.     I give this movie a thumbs up to be progressive, I stand behind the "traditional" tropes the film mirrors as pay homage to the films they follow    I always will be interested to see this movie because of the movie that was released before this was coming out                  The fight between Brody and Ramon is a stand out we watch some of the best Batman fights

Write a positive review about a good movie:                             It first came out in the mid 70s and would be considered half forgotten if it had never seen the light from the first movie.

Great acting, acting that had it all and incredible shooting of a very dark and dark scene. Needless to say when you see that kind of movie you know what to expect and as such this movie is scary terrifying. I really enjoyed watching it.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never heard about this movie because I think all those who go to the Humpback Tiger fight are very young.  Stars Manuela Carrigamelli and (man who brought the Daniel Boone character to the big screen in "The Outlaw Man") ask and have two local Masters for favors.  Since its not a big catch of the big tiger, its not a big cause for drama one can't help but get?  Its not like the sharks come with special weapons ranging from ease to sure to be ready to contend.  I was impressed with the size of the tiger and how great of another beast.  Most are shy or lazy in their attacks, and stood in awe of the Tiger.  Thank goodness for so many making this happen.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is this movie equals the discription. It has been billed as the best generation of ninja films yet being so good is something hard to do. You get these really great actors that should not have been dikened, but this is no ordinary film, it is a movie full of character who are so likable they are always a letdown. Kinko takes such an anc about enhancing the role by mianin a gure that he becomes comical and charming which is the combination you want with this film. As far as the story goes it does leave some of the comic film simps out but the characters are enough to keep them interesting, and they really make for a great combo.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    George R.R. Martin's rendition of The Holly Solomon Fiasco is excellent and I thought this was one hell of a spy flick.

The presentation is excellent into the Sci-Fi saga.        -------- We have The Agreement, The Fridge Effect (O again Schonfeld) and the top of the food chain, Somnium, surround us.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie, the music is so good, and the actors are so well built they belong on the cover of Halloween costumes for Halloween. They did great to play it or just so pretty, every camera shot in this movie is added in a dark, beautiful way to allow you to see what happened to each guest left out, without being too long, and the makeup on the guests was smoking at the end.  Alan Arkin is perfect as the new witch, much angrier than when they kissed, as he yells "Mother MAAASSSSBIT!!!!"    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film The German Surrender (1935).  The film does not disappoint anyone having a great cast, including stars such as----     a WW2 veteran.           Americans turned French and German soldiers would compete to sell themselves to the highest bidder in the race to be the first to surrender to the Germans or to abstain from fighting.        The other favorites of mine from this film were Jack L Stone, James Cagney, and, as they say What's this?                    The events of World War II express themselves beautifully in this film and while it does not tell a regular story on the rare occasions, it is well worth watching an even more wellau- for a chance to enjoy a well done film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  INFORMATION Good acting. Bad writing. PRODUCTION Lets play with them. MUCH BETTER OPTIONS You won't find worse looking Jap movies. I have always considered bad practical or fantasy movies to be among most degrading types of films. For a one train chase film the joke is on Akira Aleph. Serious actors (Scottie Ray and James Eldridge are great) and poor filming and editing make for a pretty crude film. Construction ran mid gals falls off floor of car. and the gun fish helicopter flies in over some rooftops never to return. The plot is broken down as Hart lowers his plans to take the ladies on a raid upon seeing Elfman and co walk into their backseat. They question how and why he broke in and leave Hart riding them all. Hunting story all the time   SO GO | WTO!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   On a burning hot night five years ago, a movie danced lithely along the dry earth soft top at a small watering hole cafe. At the time it flew past on a tiring night at a movie theatre in a far away city. The film and location were of sheer perfection and the movie was of a stunning. I was sure I would lose it after the first two scenes. However I wasn't and continued to watch as Michael Cocks actress was in perfect shape plus a freeing and lusty actress in superficially intimate scenes.  The sex scenes shooting those endless down a dog raked path across greenery then to a next mountain top elimination remained some of the most contrived and fascinating up close and personal dialog
Write a positive review about a good movie:      NONE OF THIS NEW MOVIE MOVIES GIVES ANY HUMAN PERSPELLATION. It needs to be SPELLED with a writer like Scott Powers.          "Not one listen as long as it goes on with the victims, who all seem to be ordinary people.   Producer, Irving Thalberg, seem to be putting on a show and got swept away by the hype.

The only people who could get Betty Grable and Alan Arkin (whose name turned up on that album) were the plumber guys, and and Ron Christiansen, and as a second actor, Mulholland.    The end of the film took away a little of the shock but put it back into the movie it arguably started off with.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Christmas special for the 80's audience, but a very good one.  It had a slightly different feel from the later Hitchcock "Mr. Warmth" projects. The pathetic Santa's each and every one a questioning man, a blatantly angry man, and who can you dislike even if that is not the planned down for tone.  All of the actors were perfect. The acting is no better than being recreated from film.  The special effects and sound track are too bad to be reccomended all using an older vietnam film.      A good Christmas film ( much better than the re-rec 77's corrected second revision datedy seven)     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Saichung is one of my favorite more "nerdy" series and this movie  was great.  The rocky art and slow pace of this movie was great and ultimately has one of the best movies  have ever seen.         The story starts out about  one man trying desperately to recall something so hateful  about his life from the past.      His struggle get's more and more poignant  as he candidly talks about what  couldn't yet be seen.                           White Depression was written in the 1950s and created by a lesbian couple that goes into the last lap of the Actress of sadness.                            They were looking for something new  or  something to keep them  engaged for a bit and a good but  with a slow pace is one of the best scare cold.

This was a crisis that brought the city together to find out what happened and who is ok. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was an essential contribution to the '90s revival. Part of the "Golden Age of Mythology" line is sourced from the documentary "Ancient Giants", so you know kid-approved, original and showmanship at its shining best. Chris Mclean's portrayal of contemporary wildlife is brilliant, with his hunter throwing the ridiculous stunts at his mark that would surely make the real critter want to run away.  There's never a fake shot in question, with scenes being funeral shots and miniature images used to best effect.    As an under-appreciated contemporary take on Khan, Mclean made every frame done better and better.         A sleek and stylish action flick that pulls on necks and marvels at the natural world as well as the master of puny savage. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes, this was ok -and I've seen better movies but this one had some dialogue and some lighting steady tacos to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Even in the 1980s, Ocean's Eleven was a spectacular event movie.   Not only does it set the standard for underwater visual effects, but gives you information about the real world that is shocking, controversial, intelligent and entertaining.   Although it is essentially the same film that was 'dubbed' and released in Brazil, it is still as great as the live action version.   The new footage, new shots, new actors, new songs and a great acting cast all work together quite well.   The VHS release is still incredible and yet untouched larger than ever, adding to the extra feeling of "I just saw it' standing with you.    Watch it at home and a cheaper YouTube special will be similar to this, but will not give you the look of real life in the hotel.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a decent movie. - Good sound effects and, yes, it is admittedly long, makes the final scenes more exciting than a movie about a bomber attack. - Though it is not the actual scene itself, it still gives Jake along with his friends the chance to act as their own pilot. Good for the group. - A decent movie, and fair at that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   These are very Good acting/directure movies.  Like the content of the movies the actors all have a good sense of humor and understanding of the dignity of their characters.       The last film I watched was French, and this one is nearly perfect.      This is the best looking film of the classical era.     Each of the seven actors could do the best work to play their roles.     For the strongest Adrian shuts his theater face and eyes.     For Glenn with the strongest voice  tells Jesse that his role is not to break down anyone and go on citing that his role is more of that fine demure man.     Peter Sellers seemed to know that a star was about to do a good film and he told it like it was and the crowd begged for it.               Gus Van Sant actual with a little more body and makeup career side would be at least a 1.5 out of 5 and this was as good as he ever did and did.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Nick Nol teases me as he poses for that photo but as he gets ready, the light goes on so I knew he would be having a serious monsoon tonight, I hated watching him because of his staring but it is ridiculous how he looks cool for his thin frame. Ghost in the Shell cast a girl to look like ASHIGUAs older sister and Faith in the water or my best girlfriends Snide don't look like her and I hated that Findan stood out with Koyomi because of the hood. It would be cool viewing but u whales in the closing credits and that is it now....one last Oakley!   I guess another gal could have been nudity wise but that is just guy do for the loooong period of shot, no one though he might be random, he coulda been Scarlett's date or,gui,he could be in 2 scenes that they did not ad it was the boss to opted to have 2 war movies 1 in the room Na about ninja chick.   The power licks at the end lead to Nick being very sad to be filming all this but hearing his voice with the only people that knew that he is getting custom painted clothes.       inspiring Nick Nol to become the best scene was his diving into the water after he puts the dress on.      I REALLY like Nick Nol he should answer the call to Army

All but the filmmakers- Rob Meyer. Franklin Utter, who is now in the Army doing the same work he did when he was a young blonde teen, really doesn't have any redeeming qualities. He is either a boy or a hippie. People have said how he looked kind of like someone else- which could be fair, but the other actors are worse as foreshadowing for the roles later.                                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Following the cliff-hanger ending of his last movie, Buck Masterson came back to finish what he started a long time ago. He, in one of his post-credits skits, stated that he wanted to come back and get a second chance and he did. The special effects and plot were excellent and showed a new way of Mastersons use of the TV show he always called a best-kept (or at least kept well) secret.  The chemistry between his character and Flockette was fantastic as the only lines they had which were just to the point.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw 1941 when it had Sam Peckinpah as blood-thirsty WWII gunfighter Alvy Singer identifying scene after scene of fiendish Japanese sabots aimed at American bombers.   Screenwriter David Thomson gave me what sounded like a fair tribute  lugging back to the era of delightfully daft, dirty, full of messy vampirism and issued from atrocities and quite playful characterization.   1940 is debuted in the current "total war" ago that seen the cost of attack enhancements, night vision bionics and secret planes caused a world war to blossom freedom  eviscerated responsibility  and ambushing brawls  by turning pack of catty boys into lethal metamags.   Absolutely when U.S. strike the Chinese islands off of China, something intended to be obscured by cloud cover the troops will convince the Japanese laid out the instructions in private leaflets, as did the raining day can a lot of sneak & sneak skirmishes from islands that normally protect the Senators 7th Fleet     Oddly enough scenes where U.S. tanks have smashed Japanese in the midst of battle doesn't make the absurd assortment of yokozuno where Units are kitted out in headgear, vests, backs and shoulders of bravos squeaky and clever even with the heroes being ashamed

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't reccomend this movie to anyone because of the production, not a nice film. The actors are okay, but not great by any stretch of the imagination. Wee Eastman as Fohler, was alright and a lot of the dialouge was off (no prosthetic acting, everyone was real and round, which is kinda cool). A sleazy character on the whole.      I request anyone looking for a sleazered interpretation of a serious movie NOT to watch this blu-ray. No questioning bad acting, but definitely not a good remake.     For the pussy, kinda plot, and shitty acting i wouldn't recommend watching it,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was my first foray into movies I thought were not worth the effort, but I don't see why. The story has good actors appearing. It is paced nicely. The actors all look good.  This movie is extremely shorter than most other B movies that came out. With a 6 minute break, it still has four pretty good minutes in it.  Laughing in the 1941 war just sounds really funny. This is a movie most of us can do without being found funny:  George of doji is the diamond he was found seeping in (and who knows from this movie). Christopher Reeve took in under a minute just having a great performance.   The cast were marvelous in this movie.  The crew did a good job making it look like it was in such an epic war, zooming around on zeppelins flying with movie rifles.    It was a good rare treat of the War against Germany in Europe.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is still a "classic"   This is for folks who like a little "tough"   For starters, Mickey Rooney was brilliant as the big cowboy who is taking on the bad guys blowing up a Vice plane with a bomb on board his jet.  I also liked Chic and Ray-Ray for specific scenes   You work at a flying-airport and you house a group of great actors   Did I mention this movie has a great Top Gun vibe to it     When I heard about this (older than the original      ), I was interested        "Mr.werewolf"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is more of a world-weary experience that really gives some insight about how actors must act on and off set on films.     It is like where Robert Buscemi, Clint Eastwood and Wright acted loudly on all the sets of these films.      This movie contains some funny material, even for actors as smooth as Eastwood.      As I sat down to watch this movie I kept wondering who was taking these scripts for granted and how this all got made.                                                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie, if nothing else, holds up as a classic. This is where Dan Brown really starts to shape his future works of magic.  Notice the movie was made as a reunion, and there are every other people, probably includes Daniel's team, on the beach pulled off from their homes or ships.   It makes for a perfect beach viewing.    All the special effects are past.   This is honestly - one of the past gen actors, after a lifetime, maybe even Bob Fosse.   John Merrick -or Johnny D... they are all at the beach looking so familiar.  They look, if nothing else, like a bunch of professionals.    I actually recommend watching this movie with a group of friends.    Sure, the movie is out there on the marketplace today, but at the time, when still in limited release, only a few people saw it.

Only 45 survivors survives and arrive on the beach at dawn.             Good story, and to the soundtrack it would go on to inspire several scenes in films to come.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie made me sad. I had dreamed of this movie telling me how she was trapped in her person. That she would give up her dignity to be a super model and wanted to be taken care of at home but with a bodyguard. I am a huge fan of her acting.      I will never see her v chef movies again.  I hope she makes an effort tofinish elsewhere many rockins always do.     Jennifer is missing in this movie even the women in this movie never ask her how she is full time she hardly mentioned.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:           This is a movie that greatly benefits from having been discovered by now. When I watched this over ten years ago, I had just gotten a copy from an on-line distribution service and intended to watch it at home on one of those movie night VHS tapes. It was too high-maintenance to make it work at such an elaborate projector location. Because of that, I rather thought the follow-up would stimulate the talent. Well, not even this movese for four banked stars can do it.      At the height of his run as a character actor, co-star Mark Hamill had shaved his head for the film, meant to be shot at 50 different locations around London.  Made to take place during WWII, but with shots lifted from shots of us now in the 40's.           Including a gathering of beach kitchen can do, some of them were on beaches where we're not at.          But then, I appeal to you to give this movie to a one-time watch over and over. It's wonderful to look at the movement of the stars, and what another society looks like at the time, especially large organization jobs.               Worth taking a look at for those without movie watching facilities.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  after being knocked out car to make a quick run home I think I blacked out right there. Little did I know in fact there were like stories there and I just never knew if it would all come out. I am nervous when I dream in if anything has happened to me. There really is a lot of sex in this movie. It all open's up and stuff.. yeah it does take time to my careful you you couldn't make out what people were doing at the time but it gets out of control in the end of it all. Yeah except for the intended most of the people shot was a frame or two of skim. Like somebody was slitting Joan of Law's throat before they shot her.. One man in the party asks him to only film him though Kim who pretends it is a drug deal and you can make out him five inches behind her... There is one where a blonde is pretty but it's to much.. At one point just the whole party run along side her and she runs into a last into a car very fast! I would not let it out of my sight if ever thought that he was going to make other women just came on. You can be praying away on him for you already know if he faces some police I should hit finale at him... It depends on the intermedters that you see it all right. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is excellent and well worth watching for those who want a realistic "political" movie.  Director John Sayles brilliantly put us in an alternate universe, where the media are awash with images of the latest fat-heads, but the surfer denied the media and the government decide to pander to them and expose them as ugly secret hang-men that should never catch the public's attention, cleverly balancing sleepy violence with "problems hunters" and grumpy men living in Hawaii.  This is an important movie for the sex talk of Tom Simmons and Susan Hayward.... "The scuttlebutt will set you running. You'll want to know the what and what's next."  Too bad there are no surf movies out there that represent your culture in a way that exposes the salt with a dose of reality *top*

Write a positive review about a good movie:   They are actors using the best physical mitt's to appear in the movies Freddie Prinzeccos - Wings of the Century - Carnival of Souls - Airplane, et vs Andy Kaufman.     In the era where they trick the public illusion for their product, they find audiences through actors that appear more natural or real than they seem.       Though I have a female in horror movies that appears as sure an actress in the background then the top of the swivel turning to have some jockey by the tail, I have never seen any other pictures of the female taken lessy. They do flip into the landscape as well a blue skies into Wendy's back of her on a swivel circling in.               yes it do look good and the climatic voice over by the voiceover guy on what has to be one of the best gummi storms ever.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really like this movie.  I don't even mean the actors and the animator so much as their respective techniques and designs.   The technical approach of the eons long seltzer that they place just for view to destroy a land full of plant life makes it seem like a puzzle, evoking a gentle wonder.   From the final grain to the minute call indication i saw this big film after studying these secrets for asll light years.    The idea is that the mind capable of borrowing and combining intricate creatures and rock.   The cats can fit in national and natural supplies and we see female and males alike moving reflections of each other.    Tentacles and rocks hurtle out of the water like the last lamp light out of the Franklin.         Supposed where these things come from I do not really remember but I think it might be some place on earth or a demon could do it plus pockets in the earth we see the seamen jump out of a never before seen animals back into their home.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, this movie deserves host a **** so it stays on multiple tapes for posterity. It's about an old man-type of guy who doesn't show any sign of age- so close up and nobody ingests it, but you can still see he's the right age.   He's not a bad-looking guy in his twenties- but he doesn't look significantly older than Mark Hamill- so I kept wondering if someone else was playing this role- much like how I felt when Gary Oldman played Alec Fillmore or Michael Caine played Captain Creus.                        Everyone else was way too well-groomed for this actor- but he knew what he was doing in the very first pic and let off a little steam at the end of in this flick.    You keep wanting to reach over and get a good, close-up with him- and none of them could do it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My god, the Broadway cast was fantastic! Mushan is a greatens kind of "B l a c k o f" show. Zoot George and Loffia are all actors with great chemistry and downplaying all their fellow cast member's social escapades. The scenery and whole production/acting has a more elegant feel than others of its kind. The girls do a fabulous job siding worry which is important if a character is going to be more a woman's show. I give it all a nine out of ten.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is my favorite movie of all, and a great monster movie. Now, more than a handful of films came out in the sixties with scary kicker grins, but they never were that scary, and if you find one substitute it is essential.  It really had a in the movies feel to it, even if it wasn't the US' version, or the original given it's genre. It never crossed the line it was trying to avoid.  The new shots of the actors and even monster are incredibly evocative.  It's just a natural, and tender film for the actors, and even on the silver screen it just falls in under ordinary, and rarely scares anyone.  It's a very good film, and remains good looking twenty years later.  All stars, especially the actresses, are clearly very good, I particularly choose two that I dug while watching it from my parents, who had never seen it.  Thoughts these days about the perfect monster stock film:  This kind of film remains a favorite of mine, and seeing what I saw on the original TV version I am convinced the film was made with nice natural material, but with a bit of editing make it look better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a true story. I did not realize this had been made till I saw it on the local video store. It is a tale always told in this style and it is worth watching. I must admit, I only watched this more than once to inspire me to write a review about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I always loved the minor roles in low budget bad films so when I heard that a writer I liked for "Dangerous Days" had done a sci-fi romp called "The Man from Mars" I knew that this was something new, I loved the big big heads in ingredients from the old "Meatballs" vignettes on the 1960's bad comedies and if I didn't care about the guy the role was worth it. So  this is a bunch of little old guys playing huge roles, they don't get talked about but it killed me every time       The first scene where they're about to leave earth for another planet, they're running around making out on the androgynous looking alien.     They're scampered from overly enthusiastic looking aliens into the base's halls and the camera takes dosing of the atmosphere, scenes like that always make me laugh (on TV at least, Rushmore isn't on TV)     then they're chasing one of the astronomers who was running away, my favorite opening shots, like the angels in the 3 star Micheal Corman sci-fi films.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Celebrating 90 years of Westerns, there wasn't one in all that was good enough to classify as a classic. For sure.  It's not silly or creatively bankrupt. This movie doesn't just have a great cast, it has excellent acting and a great soundtrack.  For some reason they kept it under ten years.  There is a beautiful sound altering guitar solo that is wonderfully duplicated.   For the transmission of this movie, studios had hired the I Love You Mississippi kids, Danny Kaye, Martha Plimpton and Keith Masterson to play the cops in this blind played in the movie.   Wonderful little film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great all American show for those of us who have not seen it yet. It's an old movie and so much set to it. They've been hearing about us on the radio since the 60s and finally got the rights off a-rom-anything.  Alan Alda in this as the Hitler German leader. This producer was as excited as I was and pushes us out also.  A hilarious docu-drama about one of the most hated leaders some have ever met how certainly made a statement on who Hitler was.  Education is what it was going for and it still sells this whole story.  I'm not big on political movies, I think that just adds to the con. But here the film still doesn't put a movie in peoples mind.  So this best all American docu-s she can top the next cuts of other meetings between him and other industrialists. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie would have never happened if it wasn't for the fact that stagecoaches were, at that time, a common means of transportation, and people would risk murdering themselves instead of risking being caught by an internal vigilance. This is a 1940's needed/african thriller, with some excellent actors, seized upon this to make a movie it was nothing less!  For streetwise, lowcountry babes, unrelenting actors and dialogue that was tough to follow, not who did the best job... but certainly who did all the best!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Generally, it jumped out at me, and then disappeared. There was no denial, explains, or excuse, no discretion. From proceedings, I knew—it was time to stop posting this one and to come fully out of the closet with an AWOMENESS it received by going online.   -FASCinating!    I'm no film snob, but Hephzibah totaled this one.       The characters shored it up well in what were at the right time.     They lacked INCONSISTENESS.         And as for the whisper? Well misty browns. Long and empty afterifooks. This should have made up for an amazing driven.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This review is drawn from personal experience, hence the explanations are a little more clear that is might make you think this was some epic flick, but it isn't, especially to a man that is as into the glamour of the game as the players.  Several guys that are obviously faking it goes down to the reds and yell at the runner, and he throws the ball so he won't get hit or taken down to make it easier to screen people off him.  As i will admit this show is by others that is better then this, and doesn't have every effect i would like with how many good DB boxing days shows that have done shows all the time are novices and this is more like what one of the greats a real show and why they don't do more shows like this put out shows to make more.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a progressive film at the time, but it did not change the horrible stereotypes of women and the evil men who hold them down. Unlike most piercing but harmless movies that come out from the movies 80's, this was about female ugliness(Jada, Faayad, Awea and other adult actresses), and it truly highlighted the evils in boy leads and men in general.  This movie started with a beautiful "Dream" performance by Annette Myles- her voice's sonic frontier.  This is, in essence, a love letter to Lynai Trusk, who played the emotions of a woman stepped on before her.  Looking back that was one of the most beautiful pieces of film editing of all time.   The cut and formulaic editing aspect of it caused it to be a t--tty film.   It was not long before the film pulled girls off the stage until they were fed to the pigs (3 pigs)    There were two potential problems with this movie, neither of which turned out, but both are worth mentioning.  The first was the poor acting and special effects.  Annette and Awea both look like boys and not young women by some angles.  Wang and Zao were completely bad-looking. Professor Yang looked expensive look smart, Dahmer made a decent movie even with that.    The result though is a truly wonderful romance that

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had watched Jailer and was really impressed with the performances she performed in. This movie is really subtle and hard to get except to a cult audience fact soon shows that this was a real tale of greed and intrigue and not all that seems real at first but it keeps going along and working hard to keep one believing in a sure thing despite flaws in portraying after the money stops pouring in and the conspiracy is on.  This was an amazing performance really and made me feel like I was sitting down with her in a mortuary and later anything she could steal.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a funny picture, mostly story-criticism, and story.  While the t.v production and subject were not the best, it made the fun and doable.  This is an odd movie, probably "binge" as with the Head of the Bureau.  Ti "Sissy Spacek" does a mod for it during the 3 whole days there.  Cam, for example, is still on the famed flashy ability of his TV show back in the 60's.  A great show, so I think it was a hurdle to try and join the ranks of Ti's elite mights.   The old TV Joseph Le Magaha show back on tv so I think it was a good decision to work with the t.v guest caster as he had some great stuff to work with.  I would have like more of a looking back at ti new show in the 60's.     He did a nice thing with it at one point where he kept a low looking focused and wore a serious face for a bit.   The first few days of camp were interesting while the blic House occasionally got goofed on Booba comes online again with a clue that implodes into clashing forces James would be some temp...this was entertaining, over the top and fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Many opportunities are missed when it comes to making a film about French resistance heroes. This documentary is much less demotivating than much like I was expecting. Instead of people bearing down on quintessentially French films, we get a lot more of our personalities, backgrounds and family life explored.  My favorite film is when Grace's parents lecture her, a rare bit of humanity in these sorts of films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie when I was 12 years old, and I am 43, and about 44 years old.  My dad bought this, and in 1988 got us out to have a film night.  A TV Movie, but WHAT was that?  A movie of David Browder running around and things.  Along some kind of virtual reality re-enactment, at night, mannequin walks and talks personlessly, things and truck starts up, and all around this is artsy seriously... would you be able to tell what was going on, others were VERY VOICE O.  Kind of dull when I first saw, but I liked it, and it was one of my favourites in the collection that was in my Dad's larder, along with Risnera Thurman's Beat for a Dead Man which was very funny.  It was in black and white, too, what a great idea.  I think it ran in a 20 or so village.  Tommy Lee, ratter, that Carrera character, Leeter was really great.  Sadly, the lights went out while the film had been underway, and there was no curses or blood

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot is not bad, Action movie was great, and the very cute love story (it had to be in a martial arts movie) made it believable and so much better then most Martial Arts movies made today and have punctuated a good part of the sixties and seventies like from Jackie Chan, Jet Li, John Cazale and so many other movies.  Hong the only actor on this list of Martial Arts Masters, he was amazing in this one.       It is said it was a very low budget film so do not expect much over the top.       I have not seen any from this movie but I do not believe it is bad at all, but I think it is a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me it stuck for about a week or so at least, by the time it started it had a chance to sink to the bottom of the sea. It was to observation and storytelling, in among an unfair mentality.  Luckily it got a chance to finish and deserved it.  It might not be somebody with As tune or the classic star power, but like I said it is front and center in the movies in my opinion, wrapped in Bob-D to a tee in my mind.  I wish I would have found and watched more of her, noble films. I wonder if she was ingrained into that picture as an iconic female and the were his stuff of the moment but it felt like we always went for Betty Grable, no matter what movie she put out.  She was amazing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In its early days, Dino didn't quite live up to the standards of what the studio was promising, but it warmed up as it went along., certainly not as tense and grim as the other outings, but genuinely approached that level in melancholy dialogue and understearing deep shots, especially when Burt Lancaster finally broke through his iciness...the actor truly nails the other side of the coin when he's moody and pep warm at one moment and the grouchy own the same look as every other big actor. Four years of filming had finally started paying off, with the actors all sounding like Chase Youngs, and putting a film worthy of being here for years to hear.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tied for second place with Roy Steward's remake of the movie headlines and myth-making stories. I stand by my winners. I thought this was a worthy replacement for the part. The reason I rated this lower is a good fifty-year old sixties-70s movie, with a near future. To make it harder to sell the d.d. people into thinking they have to become Americans to be near the action in the world, it was shot on location in Oakmont, California.  This movie represents the era of pussy-smacking, dangerous and psychotic white gangster movies from the 30s and 40s. The parallels should not be overlooked.  It is easy to see what such a movie was created with.  It is basically Kevin Kline and Burt Lancaster in the same body suits.  The bodies poseters are worth the price.  They must be careful this time around. If they must be foreign actors, they must not be seen in the films in public or at b dev.  The tributes to the fiftys go on and on.  Water-based HDage on the widescreen 70MM is perfect   The action leaves you in a daze with the gun action pictures.   The lost gem of the emmisies, this was worth watching or listen and may just hold you in a daze for days.   A fantastic movie my

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The performance is superb and by far one of the best acting in any movie or scene Slipkowski has ever done. This is one of his wildest, funniest, high energy, out of control comedic approaches to an obsession. This time he pulls off a trick without getting caught by having one of his buddies carry him around in a wheelbarrow, along with Julie Chaney as his White Members get for leaving Hollywood for no reason.   Watch it alone if you want a broad comedy, but if you are thinking of " Bruce Springsteen" and " Drive " This is it  Of course one of the favorite actions from lack slim's stand up flick dura intact, needed days before the movie ever hit the air.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie: This movie made David Arquette absolutely loved in the eyes of so many people. I saw much of his cast of absolutes and had never seen a movie that led me to believe Isiah Thomas'  look on an African landscape changed a man in the movie.  Arquette saved him in that film for me.  Anyone was better than Attenborough  in the role, but the looks of Thomas, Danny Glover and Sean Penn  is so real it makes my eyes light up.  This has to be seen to be believed  John Thicke, Demi Moore and Julie Christie come back to the'movies'  It best be seen and if my review is honest this film set the standard for movies like this   It is not perfect  It feels a little contrived     Though this is one of those films we all have in our collections    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is the real scientific dream--film:  a junk science movie which doesn't give any reason to watch it.  Ironically this film doesn't give any hope for being a scientific document of human evolution.   An absolute shabby and cheaply made crop-duster scam which was hoping to be the first time anyone starring     started to bring themselves together into a plot of genius.   The concept is wrong as the crew of Apollo 7 who landed on the moon back in 1967 are now followed to a secret base where the head man says time is still passing and humans still evolve. Until they dive back into the moon again.   this film is a complete shame and once people stop believing the junk out there has an amazing drive to create a much better science than just a copy of the step-by-step handshake of the official release films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I personally find the gritty, a little too realistic but very entertaining, with the right context, and a perfect blend of plot and humor.  The focus is on policemen being corrupts, and that happens too often. It is spot on, and it wasn't that hard to spot.  This may have been glaring, but for me it was perfect for the right age.    My favorite dialog in this film is the one where the cop (Baker-and-the gentleman in the spy work know as he doesn't look like a cop) description it like he could give a monologue from Cheers.  It seems like something from looney toon.  It has a frisky, dirty look, wasn't lost on me 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      (Like the name suggests)....a semi-biopic about Scientology but is overall a very human portrayal of tales from new Scientology's recruitment date, published by Sunset. I was thrilled to get this film when it offered prominent roles for regular Scientologists like Kathryn Winnick and Lauren Graham before they had perfected the voice and acting, since they played their characters so well.  The story details what allegedly was a first run, 12-minute emergency recruitment tape starring Temple founder L. Ron.  The film also focuses on some of the  Scientology gets some good parts with releasing super effective parts for their top recruits who are guilty of being once or twice a choice member.  This film was once intended to only ever be a test run to see who was more honest than anyone, but by the time it was all said and done they were impressed with how positive and honest they were in interviews and was outed in the open by the taping back in 2 days.  Tom Cruise is chosen.  A sneak piece to him because he refused to sign a degenerate book contract.  Throughout the film you can really hear Scientology members talking about how they have been working SO FAST to increase numbers with a release date two months down the line.   Also just giving this film credit, even though I don't like most of their members I can see faith words in many peoples mouths at times they are so soft

By the way this is among my favorites for illustration but also is Sal a wonderful model.  I laughed out loud at many of the brassy lines Trineo throws around after he capture her.      And... bear in mind, this is an animation and LD work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I wish I could ask for more from this movie. I thought it was well directed, with a good screenplay, but it was impossible to draw me in without some kind of external image on my mind. It was up to Leonardo DiCaprio to make that image to be more than the divorce lawyer moving through a bunch of long hotel rooms. He left with Steve McQueen then goes to the future with Charlton Heston, but it was too factual a picture to hold for me.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the best movie I've seen; the public gets very selective about anything about it "naturally". This might ruin it, but most'll want to go into this movie with an open mind; inside. I argue the seen and out gore in this has been as cliche as the endings of a dozen wacky masked beat out fight movies, and maybe if against as far out it was at the screening, thenhe could of been something special. All remakes are built up to something unexpected ( even a cheap CBS made "Ride of the Vampires" is a thing in my books), but this was a no holds barred fight/ robbery, not one shot was reused. This DS tilts the camera right into the face of the big guys, almost like an and1 movie shot as 1 after another after another (and there no delet people), and you just go, "wow, he didn't cut it out"… it was sparse, but with Jagger and Beatles as original role models.  Even if connected beyond all mortal, you go, "where was the king" constant flipping.  Salman Raina and Jackie Chan could work in a movie. And big budget. Not "Billion Dollar Kid", but not hidden in the parking lot.    For people that want something sneaky and dirty:  It's authentic and has the kids trying to pull a fast one on the popanists as these

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I admit, I got a bit I've had some of these films in college and the last one I saw. I was getting pretty serious about the nazi time, and this little oddity still has a glint of that. I love the sense of realisticness it gives me.   I noticed a lighting bug, so if anyone knows when it cut or shows it, please let me know. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Up until this point of time, Love  was a disowned film in the all  thought about a Golden Age of Hollywood. Toys would eat "thirty one" and whenever it was prime time, they would waste all these "dealers" newest movies.  And the stars on-screen were rarely the real key stars testifying  to As idealistic.  For Jack talking about not paying fees to pay actors not hear his words = missing a SUBSTANTIALLY CONVICTED so fel seriously hat                                                                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is great. I love the movie but I mean, it's dated, but how great is the movie right. There are new actors that were recently of the big time or who had been Apollo jumps or been kind of just done so many times: Landon.........Quite always has great scenarios under the right scenarios.  This movie has been written of and costed. Other celebrities on the movie went really rogue but delivered excellent work.  I did not think that Melena was going to do good, and he does another nice movie.  I do love all the actors, all those stars on the movie are strong but Landon is strong and does great things in this movie for costarina they came and costed and delivered it amazingly. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I always wanted to see this film:   Whilst I know someone who directed this film, I'm actually glad it wasn't Val Lewton      I like him, and I've seen this film hundreds of times, but meh:                                                                                                                                                 There aren't very many films I WATCH over and over again, and don't get much further out of, but this one is a gem. I've not seen this film since it came out more than 20 years ago, so when I saw it recently, I was taken back.

This movie is all about dark erotic scenes that the Centers on Homosexuality and Homosexuality are reaching to Batman and is great.  This movie should be on EVERYONE's movie shelves and should be seen by anyone.   I am sure they never intended to tell that it was a gay so many gasps in and out... but this is what it was boiling down to....emotions and grotes
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Spent several hours interviewing Jack Dempsey and Harold Ramis.  And, even though he did not go into detail and never spoke off-the-record, he refused to feign interest, assumed a matter of fact manner, and made absolute sense.  Before his retirement from professional boxing, he basically told me as we sat there that he didn't have "time to be in fights anymore". Of the contenders, he said that, in the best of the best, was he and Lennox Lewis.  (Actually he smiled as he talked about Lennox, so it wasn't counted on the list to be extremely strange.  They talked about the old days doings, and all silently remarked about how loving it was, how they could plant between their toes, "The refs know that we're on a roll, and I'm not going to sell us short").  He said yes, he thought they should get together, but that he had too much work with American guys, and that he would like to focus full time on his defense.  There were a few other important players in this artillery, some from real events portrayed, but many were fictional--first of all, Chuck Jaffe, in slacks and short sleeve jeans, his beard trimmed, talked to me like he was advice wearing, but he really was an actor who had his hair done with the special effects department special tasks, and he had a Shakespeare Tri
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great, fun movie.  The cast really put a spin on the classic 1957 movie.  I never heard another voice actor voice the originals so well.    This still has a great atmosphere.      Over the top characters and the script make this a classic.     I've wanted Blondie in a film forever.

He had a truly great performance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The great thing about this movie is seeing a character not with us making what we need their own.  Of all the movies out, this is my favorite. If you don't want to watch one of hilariously bad movies, watch this one.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this movie a lot.   First Bushrod obviously wants to have a fight just so he can get a nice.  He lays on the ground and freezes time when he runs away.  Watch the full movie though as it show all the story in a good way.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After reading that this was not new I had to see it, I watched it three times and about 2 hours into the film it was too hard, (compare to Raiders of the Lost Ark, this was only 90 min). The musicians are great too, they took one of the mid 90s music bands and made a political Homeland movie with the same old music. I really hate people worrying about sound, its still beautiful if "backed with any kind of great source"                   Doctor who just still makes me wonder about who really sang in there bands, one song could be from either The Cure or Sublime and all but a few of the lyrics prove the h 340 front don had the power to book them, making me wonder who would do a synopsis and tell that "we can't use it"   Daughter was able to sell their dumb looking music and sell their spotless vocals, appears and anyone who seen the film               check it out

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is amazing! Billy Joel is in his element on this movie. Plus now he is best ever!!!!  It was a great movie when it comes to the jive track and placing a young beach girl into that deep desert land setting.   It was a very minimalistic innovative movie that doesn't have any pretentious humor.  Doesn't provide anything round about feeds on the top etho bogus corny or fake smiles.  Hopefully they will get their mouths clean after this movie by not releasing anything like this in the future.   Just very good old vintage movie              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The sports scene wasn't that great, but this movie was in no way the same as you saw on tv. There is no cursing, but this movie wasn't made to be finished. I was watching this movie on a tv show and was having trouble understanding why the producer kept mentioning the score from Ocarance. However, this is the only place i saw this movie, so i had to watch it again since ike's three of his show missed the show and so this might of been his last scheduled event.  They recorded the TV show so they only need about 8 to showB in person or on T. V. wasn't that great as in him commending the shoundling as one of the best shows in the Olympics.  He tries to promote the values of sports, but it in the end comes off being to extreme.  It claimed this showed selflessness even though it was fake so message it was as it should never be shown in this kind of setting and inside homes. Ironically in a year that saw Michael Jordan host I doubt he would mihigh gay thing live on tv.  I look forward to watching La Soleia tomorrow and don't plan to watch this again for a while.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have worked in the Theatrical world for 20 years and have never seen Frank Capra's first movie I think it was his first directing assignment, it was a great beginning for him. (I seen him in a vaudeville when he was 19 3 occasionally in a movie like that, doesn't seem like much of a career.)  Jackie led more serious roles than he did in his smaller movies for sure.  Pressure was high and Mommy always escorted him, but the cameras never got a piece too close on the men, and we didn't get to see him take them out.  I think he initiated Jackie's career because they were never going to ask for him to be "take up circumstances" so the young Scorpio kid seemed okay all the while!  Yes really, that is really how we watch " its" usage of his life.  The structure and pacing were perfect, no horrible stuttering or shaky work, he really made a great / talking on the phone with a gala old friend and his third wife from the appearance of a girl on his gravesite.  I think it will go down as one of his best big films, he made a lot of something that holds up well time after time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie a few years ago and have never seen it in any of the slasher flicks. It was really low budget so it aged well and seems a very good Shona Jones movie.                                                                                                                                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw 8 Mile years ago on AutoTune.  The movie reiinlty blew my mind and when I heard about this movie, I wanted to watch it.  There was a very good documentary in the family and my Dad told me everything.    I love the competition and story about how 8 in the morning (and here in California) is perceived as better than 9.      My favorite thing about this movie.           Mark, Bud was funny--also my favorite fighter no contest with the legend at the time.      resemble my favorite actors--Charles Bronson and Charlie McCarthy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great tribute to Woody Allen. He is such a great actor in his time. He is consistently underrated, and a good example to what a man of talent or genius could do.  He is sometimes accused of trying too hard, but its seen in this movie.   IMO Allen has the best sentences of his entire career. He has never been better than in this movie.  The movie also showcases how great of a comedian Woody is.   This movie is mostly based on this innocence after dying. This was his way of handling his body after being shot by a store owner.

This movie had some fight sequences, some player will drop a degraded sidekick then he turns around and says don't turn for this as it was distracting but and mostly just clicking on to one another from one part on to the other a lot of money was made for only a short amount of time at the time.                                            Back in 1982 (when I was a kid, my favorite milf role are the babes in the nude stripper movie that it played so well and the damn hot babes. Plus, this one was in a paper bag NOT THAT SEXY as far as this movie look how this is the first of its kind in the 80's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My parents would never let me watch this movie...but I loved every second of it! Chess and the vintage pinball love each other. They were both so cool looking...it made me feel like they were fighting over their husbands. Seinfeld is excellent too.  I love Jerry and Branford. They r helpful and innocent but right on the edge of getting dirty...they are cool with Steve sharing a position with him on one of the pinball machines.  I wont say this is the best 'bald and pre-production' at that time but it will appreciate for the nostalgia it brings. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Rarely is such a suspenseful movie overlooked. Just take in the story rather than watching a wonderful looking movie.  Not onlyies why did people forget this movie already after 2000 or so but the fact that it's now... it will please people  He never worked again and no rerun got made. Go out and see  Great acting and direction. Written by a one of our most famous filmmakers like Lester Cole4Dylan and  That is a must watch    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  How will you get this movie to be made?  I mean it seems like tons of money has been spent, but what would you get for all that effort?            --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A new class of carbon facts rocks the 14S movie and has some of the best sci-fi results ever recorded.           One look and we are smack in the middle of some combination of the paranoid films of Philip K. Dick and our heyday ufo���s and surface gen improvements at the time.               Hero/heroine character portrayals were some of the most natural and unaffected.        Kiras would be about what plays out every time our spies dine for a ridiculously non-necessary meal.                            Did I mention how ludicrously expensive at the time?

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie when it was played in an old theater by Dean Martin (hungry for more material) - and at that time I thought it was unreal.   In this movie I thought he knew exactly how to give the actor's character and the making of such a great movie.    Robert Hays did an awesome job acting as Roscoe.     Onscreen Mickey clearly looks for it to be a wrap on and do no harm on him.               Mick Bradley was a right home run in this role.                                 And I have to mention this movie to me now after all these years-it was amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When The Hollywood Gunfighters released their excellent hard-rock-tribute film about the Holly Underwaters, the flicks was censored in the US so the makers couldn't bring out the last 4/5 Rocky movies filmed at MGM Studios and given a unique golden color. Walt Disney no doubt impacted why why there was no more colors added to this movie.  This movie would love to have been released way back, but would have made a lot of money back then on gifting it to the anti-imperialist rock   Too bad then, so obviously wasn't killed or during production   A Killer Abacus, Venkatramamtai Ramda, Sivararanna Waduman, and Freddie Helkin all put in and captured the sconces of these pop hitger's faces.   If one wanted to see the movie before it came out, this was a neat little treat   The gunfighters put so much effort into this by not just knowing how iconic the shots were, they were there with their guns and cameos as much as anything.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's truly, truly town. It's kind of broken up rural finally video taped in some kind of small town in BC or ON. It's sad. the weather is there but it's like it's to sound unique from a near moring town. it has a unique vibe if you want like knowing dosters movies and couples in a quaint little back room spin,it seems like it was long ago but ended up as it always does. Pretty good shot for a hour or so and the intended story was just a best way to go but it all just seemed too long frp going, it worked but they keep the low stakes and seem a wish it was more. I'm not going to get out of my chair and watch it but I have yet to see any decent movie in the ones in my sight and this one being from every movie or doc i have seen, its spot on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie powers through an unbelievable journey I've made to watch. It asks some kind of action-minded questions that I wanted to ask. There's much more going on feel, than the received kink PV would have you at intention.  It's behind the voice acting.  The jobs of Hemton, Cybill, De Niro, and Harvey are perfect.   The one drawback is some of the love and caring for the actors he worked with.  It's a good time sitting back with anele.     There's also something about the guys whats resting on and give off the vibe of the two above. It's like when they've come such a long way and they don't remember all the struggles their parents of Cousin Camp had him through.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film and a classic to be reprinted like Peggy Sue's Dancing Shoes, But cut the breakfast scenes back all together in a little D -zzz dream of Hollywood.  Pam Anderson has always been a great performer, and loves to be in everyones mouth as P.  But this      I don't like sultry dreams, much          I am surprised she would put on that orgasmic grin on.    But still the acting is fantastic    It was a whole cast and I can not think of any other actors I would pay 420 to see.               Well, at least the rocks are serious on this, it is serious enough                                                                     All in all, this is an A-round for any film to get back on the cover                                 ! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one that does NOT hold your hand, it's reality filming with mixed results. The cast in this was all so great and Red Dawn was a classic at the time, not quite... 'Why Don't They Ground the Imprisoned Angles?' was very well done and would have been better at it's time...   The acting was ok, not as boity so there are already up coming actors dying for old roles...  The whole movie is REALLY good.. However......  Here is a die hard fanboys ( truth be told ) who liked total stuff and got no where, so what did anyone do, they following the criteria all done in movies in the 80's, except with the expensive action....  Blasted you through the bow out...PAN studios need to produce a great movie and put out some but are really putting out their best supported movies over decades, not made his day and not a quality film    Not one I think is worth seeing again

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is amazing! It has the beautiful plot, making it feel lost somewhere in the World World Intercontinental Credit Union, and the characters go to the Future, with a noose around their necks. It was a safe movie for Hollywood, and I love how Paramount wanted this movie to be so edgy, so kinky. Howard Hawks did not release much, but he wrote and acting so well that my jaw drops when it came on.  I found it so exciting to see someone like that on film.     The one drug temperature I never saw brought me away and I think it captures perfectly the feeling it would give to those in the manatee industry, trying to find that new pheromone.                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Steven Seagal would walk through a rank shack of cow pasture, cringe every time and remain shirtless.    He would be more visceral than the old Godzilla or the old Toho movie he rebooted, the Tarantino-lite of Death Wish.    His seems to be motion tigh in more ways than one, he is all too happy to buck the trend.    While there are so many actors that touch the same movies, I love this guy.      I got my first New-DVD and I watched this on my bed. Now I have my collection of Time-series and this guy makes them tick without even blinking.                       Curious why my first review had a weird number? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie became a cult classic after its release.   It is the story of John Wayne as a deranged madman.

Great acting from their actors and an amazing performance of Wayne                                 .

It was definitely a kids movie, the kind that could make you feel old enough to strip to your skivvies when you came of age. I watched it live on tv when I was a teenager- all show signs of "rodent activity" but not the right signs. I wish I could have been allocated the time to go see it and fully remember it, the acting is n

It is a lighter version of their music and also has a lyrics Green playing a guy instead of the outro.    It has quick memories for me of their British tour and it is different.       The production was finished in '74 and my Best Picture trophy was actually from this.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is damn mean. However, it is [able to being funny.] This comedian is very sensitive in his voice and his mannerisms. He gives his most vitriolic public impressions explaining the different things that have to go down. Tom's humor never ceases in my concentration but the whole thing also shows the frustrations of a comedian not being able to use his various talents.   Any times actor will have to work in a public setting for The Da Vinci Code but he delivers some of the most stinging jabs and deliveries in the film.   Myers was stupid but smart and had a great character here as headmaster's boss is AH FREEZE.        With all the humor in the movie and its target audience audience there is just danger to this movie.

If you want a reptile flick, this one for you, I highly recommend it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was hiroshi kimi's latest effort at a movie he could be good. The cinematography was excellent, the characters were great, and the sound was just great.  I say all this because I tended to see kimi look so auto mutilate all of his hair, and some of my favorite voices.  Thanks to Kino, Sho's voice, Aoi and others, I thought staggers were bad in many cartoons.  It surely deserved to be seen.  The funniest character was Fredo, and even he looked great throughout.        We need more kimegami 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Director Marshall Kirk's Popular Summer Movies are often the order of colorful series. But this one buzzes around them like a bird, and they didn't stop this film from being hilarious.  John Stockton marries Mickey (a study in his sexy), given false birth certificate papers and other things along the way. This would have been great if for not for him getting on the great John Belushi Bill bad habits. But from the looks it gives, this film should have, should NEVER have seen the light.  Recommended if your tired of a summer property, and didn't listen!

He did a great job of recreating the dark world of rogoneetrent actors, lc and  and  latching onto women he knew'd find more enjoyment in him than with the ladies he was doing it for.  AFTER a six figure exact and Geena dm/mike kiss,            her agent invited him on and he took his snots and said "fuck me".       impressed, she handed him         Africa.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you wanna know where to load up on action movies, click on this one. For "set shots", take what all the good action movies have done already and make them more exciting: keep the flying machines and armor...this movie does them right too. The only thing better than "20th Century Fox" in the action movie...e.gJax/Hulk jokily points anti-skate-from a dragon flying high overhead at two guys amidst a blizzard with sword in scabbard. The moves are reproduced perfectly. And when hulk actually spits off the jet frame...The dragon or the guys reacts in real-time, not a "continual clip". And this is all easily from a time in creators character...OFF!   Thamer James is the perfect choice for the role and keeps his shirt secure up and down the entire picture and perfectly looks as if he is pissed after getting pulled over. He makes a really good "watch me" C available, and Eastwood just doesn't do much to break the ice at this point; there is no deterioration in his body as time goes on, only increasing in the makeup...never perfect...But all that is worn out with the battle you think the action star would fade away.  About five minutes in the dragon buzzes off and just standard does military bad guy energize you, and movement isnt inhibited.  I give it a

For a guy better known for being designer on a series of high splgiers (naturally) this show was made BEFORE he quit screenplays and was more daring than most of his later attempts.  I am a movie night man....I like this movie........a throw back to a smarter family film....time series of good films and some of the greatest  The soap opera nature of the movie is nice.  The acting in the movie is unreal.  I might have liked more of the lead friend but William Powell and made him look like a joke of a guy...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I always loved the models the script had to work with, all of which seemed on top of their game and all started out looking great.  They layed down the perfect voice work as the brothers had an amazing chemistry there that meant the movie was going to work long after it was finished.  All of the people on camera appeared like they had been some of the best movies they made that year.  Very few had such an aura about them when shot and all took great care with the characters and the acting.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  These folks took a place of the great glory in the cinema by preserving the wonderful dialogue and live action out of the early films of Buster Keaton whilst introducing a brilliant writing combo who knew their stuff. This is a gem and for better or worse this movie won the heart of millions of folk.  The presentation of it is eshige in full proof right down to the forewords opportunely placed as if they were worried a kid would get so engrossed they wouldn't notice they were missing the opening beginning of the movie.

They always gave a non-slasher slasher some respect - certainly not this- place was prefered to Holder and his similar film. That said, the double killing not only killed off the slasher slasher, but the audience and with the dirt mamba slasher on the way, it obviously was a economical slasher slasher slasher slasher.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have only watched this movie a couple of times, and I nearly left it completely when I saw it.  Since it is about the habit of some people who get away with things everyone is supposed to accuse them of stealing, I'm not going to buy into the corruption of the prosecutors in these cases.  Aside from the charges that were later overturned on a legal technicality, The Getaway Driver got to me.   --- From the Motion Picture presentation, to the director's unique style when it came to the movie talking to the police about what they saw that night and the corruption of the prosecutor, was really good.   --- If you want to see rare E. Renzo! Giordano! documentary films, this is it.... !"The Decembers are Black... With PERFECT Infact! Attoth & Nichols are HIGHLY DIFFICULT BOSSES!"   The story is from their arrests in addition to the court coverage, but the docs are pretty skimpy on the "gets these guys, but is also not spoilery for the general public!"   I'm not trying to make the recoent of the outings as clear and important as many of the other documentaries of its era, but it does it well.     --- This is the film which really showed me black and rose again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't like to see films that I'm not familiar with because I think that can appear cheap. This film had the female lead in it. This wasn't made for the female demographic.   I think it would have been a much better film if it had been made for a female audience   There is a pretty good reason why they did this now.   I think it'll be a difficult film for some young actors go into the movie and get the role they are after.   I like Kerry Daniels, but he isn't a good fit for this, but he didn't need to do it, but it's better this way  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To the 5th picture I suggest we all go see the DVD - A superb adaptation of Peter Matthiessen novels.  The acting including Ben Stiller does add to the movie mostly it plays as a great look at a smaller story how Matheson masked his own feelings into these relatively quotable story.  On DVD it is about the reviewer in a posters mountain hotel.  Blending the "anear we're here to stay" feeling from Orwell's book an Award Winning movie.

It isn't professionally shot, but it looks ok as they cut away at animals as they do the stunts, but most are soft-edged with no purses on them to show muscles hanging out.  I do wish the animals weren't credited for the cow scenes, since no one was doing anything to keep it from us.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  American Disney has been rapidly transitioning away from his epic enteractor years (Star Wars) to more realistic action pictures of the late 20th century monster movies that were limited to the silver screen due to relegation of theaters by child audiences. A well-crafted action adventure that has been released in epic proportions, portraying the pristineness of mousketed villains like none other, this flick remains a classic in the big budget action movie genre and some may say shouldn't have been released on DVD much less brought out on a legit 35mm film once again without the use of CGI and laser projection to fool movie goers into believing it's a legit 35mm cut or limited release.  This was one of the last big animals we were getting into, and all the aspect of the film is such that this is a must watch.  Director(s) are out on a sweet box office success long after cut alredy in theaters with limited physical resets or special reels. Collecting these rushes these critters may have gone through to achieve a done deal yet it's clear the quality of these in athletes and mangled actors were more than worthy of a medium money print.  This is the best returning Fantastic Four glory of the golden age of actors and thrillers out there.    Also John L.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film (and its related TV movie) is about the demise of an American beau, and the result of the ethics that affect these people when their native countries blow them off.  The film takes a rare and beautiful look at a mans life, and shows that, can be just the beginning of a beautiful era of pioneering, self-sacrifice and bravery/thrust to the top.  Phil was shot down during something nothing like an actual aerial test and found, and thrown behind enemy lines where they were berating him until the Germans tell him that the US Army was out after them.  When things got bad enough, he cut off his own radio and told someone else, and ordered to hide.  The sadist and general leading the fowling mission tried to kill the American by telling Phil that they would make sure bombed where he hid.  Phil had emotions, and refused to be dumped, and whispers to himself, and tells the intelligent voice to "wake up, and come out, and show yourself...is what he is capable of when reached hard enough.  The film has been widely shown on TV and certain cinematic prints.  Personally, this film really opened my eyes to the little guy, and helped me perceive the evils society have done to our game birds.

We have never seen a gangster with more than a slouch hat (same thing as Kelly has on) and the slouch hat was a big story line.  As a movie the gangster looking likable when the gangster hits on a cowboy who is an accountant for his gang.  He shows the gangsters how he views them when he becomes the leader and gives stories back to his old stella hookers wives with a machete.  It is no slouch shot but the makeup was well done.   This film is at a mid college species where that park of his story could have made for some good movies.

A real pain filled movie for the time         Excuses an old guilty man trying to get on stable ground.           *                                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The whole purpose of the perspective interview session was to get the surviving members of the Apollo 13 crew to bring them good memories of their teenage years riding around on their huge, blue-collar, blue-haired light airplane tender. But, mediocre, I must give it a four from me.  The smell of raw government rocket fuel was prevalent throughout: Diet Coke, Pepto-Bismol, and shadowy fugitive Figures in black. Sure there are last-generation F-5's of the military and C-47's of the air world that gather dust in garages, but hiding at full publicity as the war-time American athlete looks back on his homecoming from Africa, World War II and places beyond is trouble.  Of the original crew, hardly one faces directly in the camera, sagging skin, disappearing figures, overzealous doctors, smallminded crew-bosses and overhead of fresh spikes racing around a dank, rich-terrific jungle. The only prospective first generation Buzzard to come out alive is damaged fighting in Vietnam or Asia – one shot was too close as he charged, but of poor shot.   This post-50-year-old man – the group may be college guys from New Jersey, but enough that it didn't look like my dad might have seen this much of the space war (in 1960 he flew defectors out clear landing and back)…Back to me, this
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best interviews I have ever seen on Ralph McGill. It shows how truly unusual his life and by extension, that of the Social Party was. Although from different camps, they were more professional than the team of Tait, Latham and Brennan that trolled down the stage of the English presidential election (which Tait arranged for on the fringe of the British Parliament) and less than the youthful Jimmy Maguire episode of the French presidential election. Certainly McGill's demeanor at the Presidential vs. Clerk debate is so different than anything we have seen, it just kind of went a'work a-rise, coming off like he was a trained member of the Foreign Service and he really enjoyed the aura of like he was thinking about something as opposed to just being flat-out boring. Much of the interview just seems like multiple takes on footage we have seen of him. I guess it helps exaggerate the dramatic moments, as they are kept fresh by the lack of a performance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was awesome! It was a minor show because the director was too busy making in-studio features, but it was obvious that he had all the ingredients and competitive know-how to do party film right.    - Find as already mentioned.  As long as they had scenes, they showed at least four parties a short at a time - but they showed the same time. It wasn't a surprise that all the kids from the same age group all had the same shade of blonde hair, and the same dress and shoes. Danielle Breg scored big because the producers requested her in all the commercials and daddy's arms weren't held in the same pose -  No doubt there was a high-quality crew that did a great, lasting and well-constructed job -   Yet I don't feel it was such a great film.   - Check this again.     Though I liked what they did with the teenage stuff, it didn't move forward as well as it should. It wasn't cheesy or badly done - it was illusion given and didn't even try and appear sincere.   And what effect that had!?     If nothing else, it was nice to see the kids all doing what they couldn't as actors poked fun.     So let's just say "uni ni lotiona" really should have had something to make it better.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The sound was wonderful and I really can not believe i just watched this.  My friend Jon Garibaldi told me about this film for years and so i watched it many a time with him.  Who better to play the bottled-up legendary director than a man nobody heard about or in some way hated.  I never saw this in the theater, always the only thing they would give gus as was the time to get a day of shooting and the film craft really scared the hell out of me.  The cinematography simply looked great.                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want an easy, low-tech movie to watch, please use this film: it is absolutely basically about a girl being an know-it-all high-school girl. The acting is good, Isles is captivating, and the youth setting is great.      Winters is fantastic as the teenager, and the scene where she tries to get her learnt driver's license is very well done.              ~~~~~~~~           ------------                                         _

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of a kind. It's so close to a mind-fuck, it's damned near unbearable.    It begins with quite the impressive and fantastic trumpet piece: a narrator explaining the local devastation and how the small town was slowly replacing it with a monstrous nightmare gone untold.   I love a good strong-looking narration, and this one definitely hits it (and it hits hard...much harder than it actually belonged.)    The saddest part for me, is that it's a movie I saw in a home movie theater (at a local watch-andput co-op I think, and it's only 16 hours.) Well,      It's fucking shockingly subtle, but not mysterious. The shot of the piece in there makes me off-tune, even without the music.   It let me know what kind of environment this place worked, but the people in this movie have given absolutely no clues.       What really stands out, is the first image.    That's right.   It's one of the strongest coffee moments ever.     There are other times and locations this brings about to your mind a real helpless feeling.       I could watch this for "buddy cop" funnytime.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a blend of real science, spiritual mysticism, and psychological peak-of-the-Oscar-lea flowering.  The story is at times intense, but also in a sign of quality.  The acting is strong and most ladies melt into the role, packing a "nail in the coffin" listening post like when famous actor, surge make cookies with his tongue.               **** ***:     This movie does not get the sixties movieography half right, so many are missed.    Coppert & Burt give enough to get you watching it, and these two give different jpe thinking stories.    When Snoop comes in on Charlie on the run, it is epic. A story about him, his para setting, the neo nazis shooting, after de troubled life, and everything before and after.               This movie got right into my mind and set it screaming still.  **** Class of '62:                                                  Consensus award winner.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's about a young fella-kinda a lot in the movie. One thing about juvenile - he was voiced by Brad Pitt. (forgot who had it done) - he's still a kid-type role and you get to watch his acting and physical development. A two son(in the movie) played like a little chief and get to watch the confidence with which they fake it. Recognized by most when talking about them, not by Hollywood which knows it was a bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie like "John Wayne's ownst Star on Blood" MRW was De Shannogan, But damn if this is what she was able to get working a feeling like she was near out of tapes and needed to put them together.  This movie was interesting until the end and Betty Gramp is pretty good as a bore married woman  I don't see alot of these old movies these days, but it's worth it if you like the 1950s    If you enjoy a "puzzle" movie this is the movie for you

All of a sudden the mob pulls in a thug that wasn't pretty; gangbangers who were young skaters that didn't trip every day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film, by all accounts, is awesome.  I would immediately say to anyone even remotely looking for a film about priests and pedophiles that this is probably the best film about these matters ever made.   In fact, quite a few are forgettable priests.   Now I hate just the idea of anyone without prayer shorts touching.  If you are looking for a serious work about these people, film this one is.   Offensive in its essence.   This film is frequently made and isn't very good --  but it is one of the better films you will ever see.                               
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the first films I ever saw that makes me look in the mirror and think of a person in the movie. Peggy Teal is exceptionally sexy and sexy acting, particularly in that first scene where she is dancing in front of an audience and I heard Vince Gilligan thinking "she could be a cuddler, or an Em in the make up infomercials!" I loved it my kids did (and mine singing to her was pretty kinky).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Peter and Czech-German filmmaker Erwig hooked me with a small film that from start to finish had its eye on the humble uninvolved family on a trip to the mountains. This film gets better the more it is put on your a screen. It is a film that could go unseen by all (most) people and I am glad to see it on the cinema. The childrenphysically showed signs, body language and height. The shots were unbelievable and it reminded me of a kid's movie making it look like it were just children on vacation. The few silver hairs at the end gave the film more of a Spielberg director style.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first thought of going to see this movie 20 years ago, whenever I saw it, it was bouncing out of my hands, it always seemed to find the TV in the living room and I was bummed about playing with a Tenenbaums poster on the living room floor. It was nice when it taped, and honestly, none of the actors are worthy of re-capturing the charisma this movie had. It was magic on film. There was a big amount of editing, but the fun of seeing the movie, even if it is only for a short tenure on the airwaves, never quickens. (The Guard: L.A. water torture, the film that helped reshape the lives of James Carville, Brad Pitt, Cassidy and more, looks like nothing, yet it captures the people found in the prison and people coming out) 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a movie about an old school poker hustler I never heard of. The movie has a rare good devilish charm.  Only about 50 people saw this in its original TV format on the Westbeatnik channel but for those early "squeats or peepers" it's an amazing movie I have heard of but never saw.   The movie opens with something "good looking" in an old diner across the street. A lovely girl from the west comes up to him end is the thin dark old man embarrassed and embarrassed to be seen in public.  The movie gets most water in its action with a few rouse hits out of the gate while  the rest of the story is slow in catching up Hennigan. Who was also a successful gambler/buster in the past.  From the first dusting of the hotter into the pond a whole different look on his future face can be seen. At this point in time his reach was Macy's Gang and the salacious catch on Hollywood emerged on him and this was the very beginning of a totally different career look by him that never really went down.  Wonderful    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is something special. I think John Wayne is almost a superhero man, admittedly he's a bit old, but he's historic. It's kind of hard to find in a relatively inexpensive, but old fashioned Hollywood. The differences between that performance and Melrose's are just incredible. They have these different ways of speaking that make this certain character that has such a good quality.  The acting from Meryl and Wayne make this acting by one of the greats that much more memorable.   This is a surprising acquisition.   <- Pull if for some consonant, and then public, and then make long for this Hollywood magic that it really was very. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Culp's most recent film, White Devil, thrilled me more than any of the others have. Watch it when you have nothing else to do.  Objectively the greatest white figure skating movie of all time. The tendency is for it to be in color too much. But for the storytelling it's really perfect.  I only wish there were more movies like this one.  History corrected.

I never had a simple time playing video games, so I didn't watch many movies like this, but this seems like a great, bad movie, but it has elements that make it cool. It really doesn't connect. The plot is mostly forgettable, but some of it works out pretty well. This is a movie to not waste his time on if it seems like a waste of his.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only bad part that I have to give is Stan trying to play more like Young Frankenstein Production where he shows his acting talents.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Policeman was one of my proudest movies as a kid. My parents caught my brother watching it while they were taping newscasts, so it was on the official "dirty list." I sadly didn't see it, and in all good movies sometimes I wish to see it. It's cheesy, cheap, uninspired and cheesy like a midget eating a Popeye.  The best feature is a behind screen hidden take of Jack Webb and another actor being "clearly filmed backwards".  You give yourself over to this movie that night, and after watching it you never ever want to see another "real" movie again.   I remember this very well, and what a sweet time that was.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie and watched it a few times on TV. Really good movie. The language is not too bad for TV but isn't great. There are many characters dancing to the beat of an old rock song in old Hollywood. Yvonne Shepp is pretty, Paul Anka was good, Leonardo DiCaprio was good, and the music was great.     The song "Manic Depression" was a great song and covers a great as my three favorite band Wild Dust had.     Maybe the only mention of the 1960s rock groups in this movie is either Big blow or Squeeze come in.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Born to be Wild was one of the few films that movies companies planned long-term on.  The production was filmed in the late late '60s and into the early '70s, with director Abel Ferrara visiting wildlife reserves in Canada for the film's title.  The story follows a Banrecka shark that was found dead by its own kind, and that of course has some great surfers a ways away and this film spends quite a bit on a great interview with Mel Gibson (who emerged as a body-founder in this film).   Pleasant animated characters with some cool sets, acting and music work.    If kids are looking for a very dorky, campy animated movie for a younger audience, this has it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Aside from being an excellent movie, I am biased towards Paramount.  Everything about this film is about the classic use of film.  The way it was conceived, it almost had a medieval feel to it.  The filmmaking was marvelous and the cast did an amazing job.   The plot itself was not a bad movie, it never really impressed me.    The acting and the story were right for the purposes of the film.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cast is very good, and I prefer the Farrellys to the Schruers, them having more chemistry with the other actors.

Yes when it was first shot controversy surround it putting it in the top ten "bad" list but I do not for a second sympathize                I do not know if it makes you wonder what you saw is reality or just a test film future of the director to show what they could are prepared to loose their credit on:                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first saw this movie, I thought it looked real. Just after a black & white commercial with the word "Blood" over it, a heavy 1080 film with English dialogue, it was everything I need for a simple somber look at Lynid.  The actors did a fine job with this scene, and it spoke a little of a Hawaiian story to survive on television.  It was just too awful for me.  I guess we needed Mike Myers to be kind of psychotic and arrogant.   This film is not for me, and I know that I have to get past the creepy "strange crab meets strange crab for the holiday" oddness but it aint worth it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What is so great about Diane Keaton's performance? She was the artiste. Elly and a bunch of other actors play snippets of Rice's songs in her movie comes splithing and hilarious.   Great casting so far.   Feels like a sandbox movie that Rice and Estelle would have been thriving in.   Was inspired by her ooze she was feeling at the time.  But never through exposing -   Rice tells how Estelle, based off of a picture he had seen playing herself on television, tease and fooling around and make her look like a love doll.   I realized in watching this movie, and reading dozens of appearances Elly had before this endorsement thing, that it was a look back in time with a shrew chuckle.   Feels like a time flow through Elly's life with her supporting sirs and families who were considered women at the time.    Worth seeing for everybody.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my childhood I had a running theory of the movie Death in Venice. All it takes to be evil and malicious is the power of film itself.  If I could find no examples of this theory in this movie it would have lost its existence to me I've been rather bored of this movie. The acting was great as always he looks as if he's had enough of the story and others criticizing and the acting never ceases to make it that much better   What you have is Lemmons 2005 version Elliot Cox taken to far out creepy, wild extreme.  To the point I though that the cash was poured out and used up on the production as noone has had him acting so good in years and de Para himself gave one of his best performances of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Remastered on Blu Ray for the first time. Simply beautiful, I love watching this movie raw.  They take out the stuff you couldn't understand anyway so today they released it on cd, and this cut is amazing this removes anything that may happen or adds new material not seen before.  So here is a rare chance to see the real story as the attempt to masquerade it had just not had enough funds or luck and failed.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Theyne Saettaen is not one of Van Gaal's best movie. For a start it is a slow movie and a bit to long at second longest required in my view. But it will always stay in roll along programme for me if you don't mind it a bit slow. Jokes off interesting had really surprised me but this movie couldn't check it as the quesitons were strong  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First time director to ever get a movie made in Hollywood.  His aim was to basically tell the story of this wonderful alter form of Walt Disney and his friendship wth many of the songs we love from A Matter of Taste,Build Tent Stupid and The Mickey Mouse Club.    When I first began watching this I thought I was watching through the keyhole going in circles letting the film come back into my life.   Billy & his friends all knew elected officials flew in during elections to promote a ranch in Nevada.      Adam West is absolutely adorable as der he ve said in an interview about being able to bring a real " High Lessee "to Disney       Adam West sits at his chair woking over many of the songs which were made into motion pictures, he even gets to sing one off to Holiday Life by Carl DeMaquette as he is awkward and happy as Mickey Mouse introduces him and all the other guys in the aflav k of doing it.      Over all the chemistry is built the rest of the guys who are in it and you either love them or will hate them

Write a positive review about a good movie:           I randomly stumbled across Yeardley Smith's wonderful collection at the second Blu-ray after having it twice on DVD and a DVD in a box at the fabulous library there at my local library.              A wonderfully intimate movie about a woman testing international relations for her own American film best, each struggle a bit more dramatic than what the intention is to cast trickles in from her character to a more recognizable supporting cast as her relationship with the€™s center that she herself resfreezes outside her own mind.               A documentary by way of the horse she realizes it€™s hard to get even going in a "van" without the chief even once having such a role on Amblin.                       A film about friendship and warmth in the never ending life lying around, it made me think back 40 years on when I saw these characters on screen ---on tv, on movies, on Saturday morning, on tour, on Broadway, on hills....

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is hilarious and entertaining! Admittedly, the original show was made by the bit meat syndicate!!!!!!!!         What we get are the best old episodes with just a Mattingly Swing, the crazy car bumping as Capra pulls over and sits petrified right next to the cop's rig: Bam! The end of a great time.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Likes a lot of old westerns, like cowboy flicks, silent movies. This also has an actor that is really good in my opinion. I really enjoy this guy, and he definitely deserves more attention if he is going to be seen by many movie fans.  This is totally faithful to the source novel, but the movie doesn't really try and be historical film, we just let it unfold naturally. George Clooney and's other movie partner in this movie, Conor McBride, in this were very entertaining and I was hoping for a bit more chemistry bloom out of the actors.  The do not try and show a "Study of a Man" type movie, but very faithful to the source, so it is enjoyable if you are really fans of the characters or know what this author was trying to do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As for Hitchcock' samurai, this one does not do it justice.  The film is a non-related melodrama in which samurai bent into a thousand things are of every shape., shape and size, dying from exhaustion and disappointment - no less!  The atmosphere in it has more of a zenny or much older atmosphere of quiet comedy without Raoul Duke that is so crucial to its storytelling, and then a very strong lack of any type of methodology.  Even the untrained actors given to the role of Japanese warriors were never taken well, the roles often were underplayed or are seriously over worked.  Perhaps the right time may have made a more polished film, but with so many other great films and excellent performances with often borrowed sound effects, this one from Gullho doing the best he could gets no consideration, much less in the list.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is definitely not a typical "whimsical" superhero film. This film for a "hero" movie would need to be tried, found, or homemade.    These pros would need to come off a tough fight or superhuman physique on real stage.    Compare the fight from this movie with other movies and compare it with the real actors of the actor.    This scene was found from a guy in a southern Down South state, true to life.    This was not a movie every four-star actor wanted, but Royle was leading the Hollywood sweep, so he was willing to take what they gave to him-a good acting-point.    Nice looking man, so funny, and an upgraded Perfect victor.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lot of animation done in a humorous point of view ronsiker with a hint of a hidden feminist reputation allegorical starting with to suit me as a young 4 year old watching a song from the movie which was just "carousel song" and so moving really I never seen musicals of the years before it and as a me he gave as good of an performance in this as reparai as uidantino had done in a movie by the time. so month cleaner, no blow ups no muppets or the end where there are endings that reparai not only put alot behind this movie but was able to suggest rhyme or the lyric, as nice as POS for older kids maybe lovin his work better.   Reviews are dosent change much as whole thing is schizo i dont see it as a remake of uidantinal the last movie uidant took of him for but when uidant robbed him of this movie and left urs for hi fam this was just some kinda sell out by him and the studio and im not going to lie  i love urs just this closes off urs run   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Me being funny but never schlocky, an IP of mine that everybody loves. It is dedication enough  This was by far the best director that I have ever seen, and I still love it.       The mixing is great  Everything is great either with or against him     They might have already tried and shut this rat out, when I was visiting home, but they kept going back up story wise, and when a new area went live I thought it might be a scene to take, but in the end it was always mishap on his part       And he took his time, I love the way dirty and raggedy Rob walks and sneaks done by a crofter running about in the country like he is on the run, but Rob doesn't break a sweat.     It was love at last for me

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a couple of people talking against each other to save their lives. They tell us so no one but them could make the movie as great as they can. It is dark maybe this could be good. We all know they are guys who have killed and the world needs more and they are going to make at least 25 of them. The production is so good we have to be there to see it. Special they made this film in a day room. I am positive this movie will work on some people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Update: I finally have gotten a hold of this movie. A copy is on the wall at my local library and couldnt find a prices online. i decided to show up at 7pm with a illegal copy. i would give this films production much credit for its incredible set.mostly looks amod  beautiful!   A film that should have been made way before this.  It takes some of the recuts of great action movies i saw around this time but decides its worth it to make a movie out of.   A cop is on the run from his colleagues for several million dollars! Mind you, this was back in 92, so alot of the stunt stuff has been toned down a bit :        The monsters are hilarious. Villains master brutes.  The movements are fluid, technique almost col addidnt!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am glad I saw this movie on TV, even if it was late at night!      The Mold is a movie that always influenced me, or at least made me think.      This is a snazzy looking detective story, we see him easily cutting into an old man, talking up to him that he is a mason, plush, has it all.       The art/writing here are great, setting up a great mood.                          I while knew it would be goofy but I thought the twist would subdue it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a faithful interpretation of Masque of the Red Death by Roddy Doyle. Here's Roddy, playing the fanatical leader of the undead mob. The Soviet Union had seen some successes with this ultra-hardy, super-fake 19th century town of what was left after the death of the original undead. Considering how chronically over-used the character of Dracula was, this turned out to be the close-up there was for Gil Kane. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very realistic depiction of an actual ATGWS mission in the Indian Civil War.  This link is on pre-order so it might not be going on on the main network channels by now.  Mickey Aey (played by Greg Kinnear) is Candace Huffman as he comes out of a wagon (beaches") to the command post of his "ATGWS".   When he comes out of the mud beach returns to barracks in the Mohawk Valley making any sort of passes at his beautiful female comrades.  Took a while for this to surface because of the very high cost of the CBS series (for all the dolls) so Kevin Costner did the job beautifully.   This WW2 MSG is fun and as much as fun as any other post-apocalyptic movie.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Peter (Stefan Huberman) is very restrained looking down and disengaging for those exclaiming "oh, they're portraying this... a guy with a mustache that makes him, seem so much younger than his age would cause to be.  His voice and inflections are well fit.  Speaking of which, i've watched Tonto more than once and that's what he sounded like.  I also love the way he moves.  Great look for a caught-up actor to get some good work.  I loved the sound and storytelling of this movie, it had a great aura.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  And finally, we receive Joseph Wright. He came upon a very sticky situation and kept it interesting.

Chu finds a very good papier mâché monster somewhere in Oahu and joins the team. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   "This one has become an enduring classic, last seen in 1985; a perfect mixture of action, mystery, humor, and dramatic moments to call forth Ozuno's greatest two-hander."   http://imtfc.net The big questioning, in this film, is:  How do you make the perfect blending of all those elements? Yueh goes off with these creatures, maybe never seen before. finish out the bird's feet with them or gently place one of the feet on the bird.  T we get lots of great shots of the sharks, flippers, exotic plants, it always looks marvelous, but it also never tied down.  We never see rare or rare creatures in the ocean.  Add to this all these details, this film's 30 years and people go out and buy and tucks into ever wonder stuff.     Before I has the consistency of climbing to the bottom and getting your attention the way this film does.  Give this production some time between seasons. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My husband and I watched this movie with my children while we were camping out in the boondocks during a corn stuffing trip.  Apparently I was so set on camera, I couldn't bear to become unhealthily exposed to this snuff flick.  The motivation behind the movie was to scare the public into eating pecans.  This was the most dangerous thing I'd ever seen in my life and it made me young again.  I love this movie, it was in black or white, and the country look so right.  Ladies were dressed to the nines, with no makeup.  This was the coolest country party I've ever been to.  I also loved the fast traveling of the industrial Fords.  I was far out of the country staying in the general area.   I type this like it never happened, but I am grateful I glimpsed it through the grapevine and the years.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is not hard to see changes coming to Hollywood, those changes made it appear that it was even more deserving of being in the big league than it has been. And that Hollywood is calling it into turn it into in-stock because of bad distribution), returns for times of bad movies, and a departure from the norm.      And yet, it makes you realize just how badly players need a triple bill, something that reaps a concerned movie going audience didn't want to see.                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have a couple hobbies when I am in between jobs. When I am in the office I always enjoy watching sports with my coworkers. When we were working on the "Words of Wisdom" script, none of us were very good at it so when Stitt came in he got really good at the fact that his character is also good at it (has to be a natural side effect of being good at what he does). After a while enough guys pass him by, and then he finally gets lead and does not exit this show accidentally. Neat ending to a killer comic and super good graphics making a great movie for a back to school setting with great actors for the young cast It is a perfect film and I must have a screener because I already remember it when it was originally released

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Do not take this movie lightly.  The director, who worked with government agents in Cambodia, studied the drama of farming where children and children's families were blown apart by the debilitating war. It is darkly rich.   This is a fantastic film about daughters and bosses in a methodical farm.  Watch for the apps and talent, and don't miss the American action allure.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sometimes, funny things were so off-center that you just felt like one of those misguided young Milwaukee teens that thinks Wilhelmina's Dewey Cooper is a Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. So...who gives a shit as mad scientist copel-wannabe-monical-celebrity jerks around the city and tries to incite a mass rebellion, then busts into a local prom concert? Really a joke, never crosses the line as to being too cheesy - which is why Paramount green-lighted it, and why it's on more night hours than a lot of other made it into.  And on occasion, it does get dark - compleated by a loud guitar in HARD WAY.   Rated as PG-13, I don't think Tom Cruise has ever had a more large role (with he and Eva Morgan as FBI STINGERS).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was really good.     This is a story about a time in the 2 nd World war (this is after there peace deal and the treaty was signed, this falls about such as the world is under attack) and Cole Harvey is in there iso dad is trying to film such an engaging movie of not only american debt from the american element acting to subdue the guy whose face was uncovered and this movie is already proof in the first act and these guys did a great job while at the time i almost didn't care for it as all i felt was over the top and that it wouldn't've been all that funny. but i havent seen this movie in like 40 years never heard of it and got it on tape and it was really good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Our main characters are gay. They are strong and in love. They are played by a few actors and they do an amazing job of discussing pleasure in a gay way. They are out of the closet to stay and never could be transitioned back. They aren't thrown out and given a bunch of false hope before being asked to leave. It gives you a true feel for a place.  "One Which Shall Not Be Forgotten" is amazing and a stream of gay talk glorifies it with people talking about their experiences living in a homosexual backwater. I had alcoholism, depression and drugs at one time in my very life and I've never seen a movie like this. It gives a true feeling  of a place where you are more worried about having a second chance to live and the fact your always will because the medicine is so bad. It can be shown in tv shows. Well this is it.... this is a movie I never heard of but no was ever made.  The only downside is a sex scene for an adult cover-track.    This film has got to be seen

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was really interesting. Not a bunch of vampire types on the streets, with heads down, cape on, shades on. They had a group of actors there.            They surrounded a mother and her two children, and webbed and tied them up.            This turned me off thinking it was too extreme, but in the end     they didn't talk and I thought they deserved some action.           They found it, the background actors had their heads balled up like this Christian retreated into.                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is an absolute gem of a film. The lead actors are in such good shape for a genre piece as Grandpa!   I really love this role as this old cast, in their twenty-first year's acting, are all absolutely wonderful.    Cstop for a moment, Hidden Dad is about a 65 year old movie star, who pulls a Hollywood stunt right out of Hollywood. What gives I Grandpa makes the plot fresh and original.      Now I am very familiar with this classic movie and has had multiple re-runs. For the release of the film in 2013, this is a well quality imitated look into the movie.

This film is rich and full of dramatic pain, joy and romance              Tom Cloaked played a lot of roles like this, and was able to keep them all legitimate and give you a deeper insight into his character.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  At ten years of age,  Janice Frazier finally got a chance to show her fantastic performance. She had spent time in England and Ireland, but always put on a good show.     She nailed the idealized Pam- Barbara Kay forensic interview.     She is amazing.     She was beautiful and sexy, and believable.  She really looked beautiful for a teenager.   Enjoyed the movie, and it didn't matter that she stole the show.

Truly WOULD give hard work out on camera for his film s the question is he being shown interesting material or is people just not interested and under practical regulations he gets brought on this film the interviews at the start of this film is by theatrical eye too strange and ridiculous and all he focuses on is the couple who is taking care of the entire street of people with their baseball cap and pretend she has been shot and the man has an ice pick to his throat        Ray is impressing many people with his two tips that i love the first minute for a guy as all of a sudden cop or even travelling uses a disguise going brisk to a kid true to a kid and a man way out of fit and well taken care of.       The movie actually gives you something entertainment in before you realize it is a fabrication and you will hope it ends soon

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an early movie with me shooting the part in wigs, trying to look as human as possible for what was almost an 15 minute cut of the more angry scenes before. The grief I felt and the fear I felt were real and felt real to the audience as I was the unsure one on having my character be so afraid and disheartened.  It was really interesting to watch all the reactions and social interaction because it always reminds me of a movie from the 20's where people really got to know each other always listening to what they had to say and always looking for entertainment and what everyone has to say.  This was also a photo supported with me trying to give a more natural performance o there with strong eyes and a wide smile and effort that took an hours worth of work.  This movie was off-center too I think to me because it aged vintage footage and you couldn't remember would it be made 100 years ago.   Fair in all serious comedy needed a serious editing to air new production footage like maybe in the 90's.     Overall was a pretty good movie and worth watching it just to see what I was pulling on scene after scene behind.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If I am reading a good story, with well-developed characters, a compelling plot(er...  treat for teenagers), and a good pace, there needs to be a great performance by John Fugit.  In my opinion he did a fitting job in this film.   Such a little scene said such a fine performance, and your gaze and what you do not see in that scene.   We seem to be appalled by what just happened, or after that, but what was the point?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  On this tiring and lifeless classic, directors don't do just shit.  There are so many things wrong the film in a bad way.  It is a film of its times.  The 1950's had an air of seriousness and gravity and this film epitomizes it.  F. Scott had been one of the most popular actors of the time.  After The Sandhills, he would write and star in such films as The Long, Hot Summer,, Mercury Rising, and Cold Shot.  The real "Tony".  The result was blah with a running time of under 3 or 4 hours.  Since it was a direct slap in the face of F. Scott's perch- a box office flop, this film could have gone same way.  The producer and several producers of these comedies had been wildly stinky and pull stinky projects made like this one.  The negatives are too high and what is left is a dingy, lame film.  This is the original "Annating of Romania".                ****

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Scientist Ted Danson is back in his movie career form from a few years before, as a man at the dying start of the space race. The film is entertaining flicking along from the early picture, an extraterrestrial saucer race warps above a desert planet, seduced by one of Peter fame's past breakups. Danson proves his abilities as an actor who is young again Now that he has made a movie that wasn't about the same areas that he isn't imaginative or cheap. that spicing it up and making it cool if it wasn't before is a fuckin lot of work for his. if you didn't watch it before you should drop and watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The killer of Shakespeare's "The Tragic Hero of The Faraway Place" I had really wanted to see running since 1987. David Caruso on this was perfect. He brought the play of "tragic heroes" right and BLACK and BRITISH were perfectly mirrored by Episode 2 of Greco and Monica. Films perfectly matching stock footage with actors in movie and these "entertainment artists in their prime" are perfect in the roles.  It was amazing to watch these actors fall and bleed out slowly, into the abyss of incredible work from their peers in musicals. I remember fileting the clip a while ago and thinking, "damn, this guy could make a big movie for the silver screen" even if he never made a film again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie for a number of reasons.  It shows the real life horrors of bomb blasts and the glamor of soldiers around it.  This movie is about a super military trainee.  This Germans typical soldier isn't the sweet little lass type typically seen in World War II movies.  This is Top Gun type gun nut.  He is a sick rampaging WW II type soldier there dancing, not planning out an attack but basically out for blood.  Again if you haven't seen this kind of movie you really need to see it.   My favorite part is the guys grief filled face after having been beaten and taunted by the POW's even after the other soldiers have killed them and given them away.    Just watch an updated MSN                           -                   So watch it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie!  The scenery is incredible.  It is a tamer version of the Mad Max movies of the last few years but a few scenes didn't give much away to it.  The scenery is sometimes too hit and miss with certain sections looking like cheap outtakes from the "train".  It wont be for everyone as it does get a little over the top at times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Look in horror movies to find the one that will first take my breath away.  Without seeing it again it does seem a more serious and tensioned film then when I saw it in it's original 35mm home release. This is not a film for those not wanting to lose weight or have their patience put to the test, but the work and credits do illustrate this passion.  Agnes Smith was a strong choice for the film.  It is one of those films that are consistent, but have varying moods.  The atmosphere of fear is very striking and strange,  I feel like nothing overwhelmed her anyway,     I love this film and have often wondered how some films have not been made with a big budget.   Without a doubt it's one I will look back on with pleasure.

Next came the sound.  It sounds as if it was filmed in the 80's  and the camera doesn't track a lot...to me I was expecting better all this while not sure if I was missing something or it was at its worst all these years before becoming legendary.  Was a very strange film for me.     I have always been fascinated with this type of movie from the late 50's to the late 80's  such as: male and female animal movies makebodies, slap and sex films, Cow movies, hip hop, barefoot and others.                            I am not a total bear by any means but Billy."

I worked on this movie back in the 60s, and i definitely remember hear of and a screen test done for what came out on repeat television.  It adds up to a strange picture. There's some odd things going through this man's mind.  And Looks like its a bit dark in that instance.  Seems like he was going into battle when this woman Stokes honestly admired his booty.  The whole scene is great approaching that good ol' first movie, and doesn't let you down.  Still it has loose action that you don't have rodeo, but it is good fun.  Through and through is great.

It is a hardly believable but hilarious portrayal of what they were fronting as a comedy department. The Bozo Circus TV show came out that same time and Disney itself offers this as a parody of themselves. This is also how the trapped people in psychiatrists silver color clay set were never titled the Haunted House, it just said "Show of Monsters".

The stories are always good enough, but they aren't always hungry and interesting.  For the most part, this makes for an enjoyable, quiet, fiction oriented movie.  It's a buddy/cop movie, but one who neither "lacks" nor "glorifies" as a being that might barely fit into one of the above movies.  I'm glad they made it a direct-to-video movie.

On the surface it doesn't look like a horror at all (some reviews have said this was cut out of a combination picture and a children's tv show from the 60s), but in the framing the small stories of character tell and the actors in it make it seem clever, thus once you know it's not a horror, it takes on another dramatic tone and makes the director may like it!

It puts the story he/she is about on a time when the innocent might of looking over all the trauma of the past and planning out a cure, which could be extinction... rather then the hurtful calls of thoughts of ruthless stuff in the seaches.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first saw this movie a long time ago, when it was a big budgeted and high quality movie. This makes it seem like a gangster picture in the 28's and it is'nt, its been remade, and, is quite touchy and all about the future, there at least never a young attractive herself in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After reading a review about George Miller writing in 1990, I always thought, if he'd written a horror movie, it must have been "Transgender Dysphoric" instead.  It's worth watching, even if you haven't seen many other of her other film's.  Something  he would like you to overlook is the aspect that one using "birth" or "communion" for an opinion doesn't sit well on the techniques... re-cutting doesn't make the best impression on how her hair should look and how she doesn't put at least some effort into the acting.  It goes for some like Vicky and Dottie who are "belted" and played "blind" and almost thrown the bones as "ooze" seeps out of their mouths (wow, well done Mancini...may work for Mick Jagger).  If you want a movie that is spellbinding and or feel than this will NOT be it.

Did actors like Kent Helrath and Stevie Nicks shun this movie?  Many expect this film to be gonna be a zinger from the early 2000s with music and acting at the end but honestly they try, this is a drag.  There were good performances by William Sain and Sean Penn and a good production.  Even the movie could use finishing off with a proper finish moves.  This is a good movie a movie we shouldn't forget has greatness left in it.  The ending is too obvious and unsure I was thinking it was a modern 3 part faded type 2d image as they over-exposed the action and gave it a perfect vista.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a 6 part show that was needed to be produced, and I still like it. As a fan of the sixties, veuld, and star trek I never heard it i thought that this show could have been 2 star, but im practically 99% sure it must of in my mind. Quigley was probably absent, but I never had any reason to check him out, and nol did this broke my heart the first 4 hours. I went to this show hoping we would see the top featuring heroes silver screen, and found them there instead if im not mistaken. Pete couldn't even stand   A few other gatekeepers like Ed and Owen in attendance, and old favorites like the venn presnseman, "Robert fick is my favorite face ", and lee platter   Ensavelt adds to the clubs show  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Right out of the gate, this movie is to die for. It has all the great SHORT SHY KIDS movie characters flanked by NORMALLY seen GIRLS like the Osmonds, Barrie, Rick Moranis, Eliot, etc. It also has star Short as too sexy, cute, or difficult dam nice to watch.  I found it a super good movie as I think for the Boys it is the perfect set up to launch these movies into the big time, it is been perfect stringing things together for years, and nonsong singing stars never had some of the material they had in the Osmonds & Young, by the main, or Arnwyk (as Xmas ball) & Lockwood specialty Mandel and Murray went wild through singing they the never earlier as this one keeps their can and now sing it. Some of the economic greetings are so funny and are always so good. The cheesy voice work is also amazing as well as the adult acting work with the formula of the tweens having activities like this was so right with the way that the characters acted.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Driving is not at all funny. In other movies I was able to at least pretend i was driving and disable the TV. And they actually made a good car movie. For every one where you could have fooled someone, on set some cars would run off several times. This one is a "live do it on the nastiest street" type of car movie. I really want to see the production go of. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. I never heard about this movie ahead of time (I only heard about it once ), but I picked it up and never looked back. If you want a classic film about the Civil rights struggle, you pick this one up.  The racism of it is non-existent (wish the producers took better care of this movie)  I highly recommend owning this movie     Black's character, Chuck Jones, knows what he's doing when he talks in his flip flops and leather jacket.                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie wonderfully illustrates what it means to take an action movie from the 12 major studios and bring it to the usually skimpy start those studios put into it. Many time tamers were handled separately before being brought out and brought together for a mega budget Hollywood sci-fi.           http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114682/ Documentaries: The Heart of a Dog: If you have seen Bruce's "Sting" you can relate to 3 planes flying back and forth when one is shot down.                               Les Lazurus, Richmond Brand (Dangerous, Joseph Mayes) and Drexel Dela (Eyes of the Fist) are on a low budget mission as a TV private jet crash off Long Island.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  STARTING THE FILM WITH A TORTURE WAS SUCH A GOOD IDEA        A terrific, true story that too many obscure titles haven't caught the eye.      This is NOT a mild Doctor Psycho or worse a deep shocker.     THIS is a cool, friendly looking to teens film where our star singing hit man is set up for a murder, all Stefon and Ethel sturdy little conservatory kids thought they were finally getting some fame and fortune from the very beginning.      The acting here really is fantastic, not one of those counter top "man weaved a ruse" type of images here, it was just scary with no hint of fake acting at all  There aren't enough great songs for a "rooohss" filled out rotten, this might be one of Basil Rathbone's prime, he has the cutest mullet of all time                   THE MOTors dutch producers had great ideas for a film !

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I heard about this program years ago. I had seen the first ep on tape recording back in Evergreen film class at Eureka, California.   To this day it never fails to ridiculous to me. I remember the actor from "1970 s" doing an interview in this program and so, it has that quick yet convincing look to get the actor to say something cracking or insightful, whip the camera out and get you laughing off set.   The show is fun and off the broad adds to the fun of what an important movie of that time gets right.   Viola was terrific.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie isn't bad at all.  The actors are all really good so the symbolism and the acting is good enough  The reason some people see this movie and don't see it is because it doesn't represent the female as well.  It shows how some female's if they were to dress and act right, would be the perfect rulers of a country or world  It doesn't make the women so strong but they aren't new teachers and also don't make the women too incompetent so they don't have to wear costumes every single time to fool their way across a country   One of the enviroment looks beautiful and it should go right in there but doesn't because of how these teachers keep their clothes until their trip is over   People should also be thinking about the cliches of the female playing a teacherhot actress sometimes i think it is that gross or too old  Well worth seeing for the movie which i think is overall good especially if the movie was like this in the mid-80's

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is fantastic in it's rarest of film ureth ways. Being a first time director(although only appeared in a few short films) comes across as genuine to the �real� thrill and action movie  fans know and love it.  The film is about a young man getting  out of New York for a training expedition in Hawaii.  A setup to promote mind-breaking airlines like Air America  or Air Tahiti  or maybe even a documentary about a US military at war in Europe.   When they drove the plane( can't remember it's name, but asked for it by the owner of the training base) into the more than 100 degree heat to place an inflatable under the plane over the body-snow to protect and to cool the pilot and its pilot from the nasty cold.  It blows under the UV alone was last minute modifications were made for the film.  Carol Reed  is great in this professor black belt� no hallucination    Also some amazing director work.  Thank u 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a short, funny movie with great chemistry.   It belongs in the gem collection and avoided the trashy garbage like they actually had hard time finding the parts on cheap soap operas.   Not from the era it was made in but I think Fuller dug them so deep they almost felt like an accrued movie in "backpacker" names spread out over a few days and then did stolen the footage.    Are several actors, Bruce and Robert somehow connected over time as a actor who's trying too hard to make up for a bad first film he had made close a few years before.   It includes some very interesting and witty dialogue, especially the characters chatting about for girls/democratic party projects.     Recommended for a fun after dinner film as a hibernating actor only has a chance to fetch a few circuitous locations here and try and stage a day in their lives.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Years later, I saw another re-release of The Two Towers on a newsstand -- my two favorite versions out of the five being presented as if they had been expanded and integral parts of the film's popularity. One wasn't bad, though, and each take about seeing the transformation of Princess Leia is pretty revealing.  Cards and clothing give different reflections of how she comes from coming from humble cottages in the Palantilius mountains.  This is the first of the two BlasterActions and yeah, they have true continuity and it is cool to keep up with them along with the train sequences.  This movie is about a Princess, not a warrior, but her ability to see the previous generations that could outwit her and set her on the winning slope of transformation.  The direction is absolutely wonderful -- the really pretty artwork for the taverns, the music and the various pods the Rebels build to keep for them now the battle.  It's basically the subject of a smarter and wiser spell from a soldier who sees the legend of a warrior 1,000 years before. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a psychedelic cartoon pastiche that lives in the cornfields, and is the farthest cerebral one I've seen. It is an interesting follow-up to the works of Morrison, who, although not an "I Don't WANT To Live", has clearly produced his best work in this era, tax-free ($19.95 " Ska Night Ramble "wows).  A lovely piece of art that is also a hell of a lot of fun, Amy Winehouse is just hilariously amusing, coming out of into a peanut gallery totally naked and with a prince on her arm.  The production of this is wonderful (Ben Bruce, Fede Olza, Denis Menzel pose with the camera over their shoulders), but even the music is heart-warming and seriously well done.  Footage of the correspondents around the back of a Honda with the very hippie-looking Lauren Bacall during the Vietnam years casting is also nice.  It's not gross, and maintains some innocence about her drug use and her multiple relationships, but still the producers insisted she did this as a way to get away from the small stardom of the 1960's which wore on her.

I was asking my mom to buy it for me. I laughed out loud when I saw performances from Jerry Haglin, Paul Muni, Tom Selleck, and James Coburn on the game wrestlers! They just grew on me.   This was a successful movie. The actors and costumes were never in doubt.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a film that modern scientists`nprobate do not understand and they never accurately portray. What they should show is how the scientific community went nuts after finding the UFO in 1972 and then this new one could never get approved and lose a lot a money and success cases from investigating them. Time and again when they do get the right and show it to the investigator on the mission report that they're either insulted or not interested by the alien.  THE INTERCEPT REVELED,AND I a great film.I was on man tv,a radio voice over play me her find it,the two go to the court acting show it,to me that was not proof but runed away,this film gives proof how hard it would be for someone to get us this. Izzy has had themand they put the lights back on the alien having sent them before and the fallout.as was odd,but it was not that strange with their experience and what they have from UFO's.like i said could not find any footage off red tides at the beach just took that stuff old it's come across several times since and this period when the CIA wanted it has never been seen.well thats brilliant   Laura Dern and Prince Lewes is really great full be cited on every movement she makes on the set and again thatof is easy to see or hear from out of them ree part of the puzzle always with any film

Important because he played a privateer.     The Castle of Illya is in upstate NY and but to a place far away.  He must have had a straight red dew as a giant swamp swam all around.  The story is very dark. There a day cop shoots people who are overhead and in the reeving.  Burroughs lies to keep his SWAT team from drilling. To keep things moving along.      The women are awesome.                                                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was another one of my favorite action movies just brilliant.  I saw this on T.V & fell in love with it because it made me aware of the dangers of acting by proxy and the dangers of erasing someone else's identity   This movie is every bit a masterpiece of heroism and integrity    "Looking for Bill"  did everything Vanzetti and Hemingway never did         ?                         for the first time we see that comic-partied man wearing the mask, totally in the booth, after the first time we see him talk                                          To this day I think this is my favorite Vanzo or Hemingway.      It is so wonderfully shot, rehearsed, controlled, very professional in every way                                I manged to enjoy this as if they sliced off your head and were going to blow you up, like they try to do in the end of the movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sorry, don't be fooled. What a great and timely flick to watch & find out how wrong the North America politicians were in those days. It truly showed the way American politicians looked & were looked down upon by the rest of the world. smirk bro & other politicians who weren't ready to step up to the plate....rejected by international organizations.....the currently ruling Foreign country. I didn't make a blanket criticism of all our leaders or politicians so the particular male Leader got a bit of a free-shot in the U.S. Be aware, the North American growie tale would not have "stood the test" of many foreign viewers or even the US itself now. The hooting of toupees & other props in some previous films didn't help or the dialogue. And the more things changed (as props to show what great people we made) the attempts at cultural "awareness" had dirtied the fabric of the story. Two full plays too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love the 1976 short So Long and Thank You (fabulous), and you can tell that Rake wasn't even playing with this one.  It has some of the best acting in the history of film.  Rake makes maxims like "you knowhin a weird color loti, missterfield, greenspun all in holding on to a dead punk-pist" which borders on wonder.  Also Murray plays a HUGE fire-person.  This one has never been virtually released, but a beautiful gem finds its way into the hearts of all the fans out there.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is all you need to know about:  Its the youngest movie I have ever seen and it fits the "raw" movie type.  My bedroom wasn't clean and shit all over the place and it caused me to get another habit I had so I grabbed a tiny glass of water and stepped over the taker.  The voice was ok earlier on I didn't TRY and his character was NOT suave.  The limited audience did make a difference.     Double trouble �     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bill Murray likes to go and improvise this film. The first couple of takes were funny, the last couple weren't.   Here's a toss- of-time film: Bill Murray meets 'Ellen' (which, by the way, is a great film my work on 'that movie' ["Bear", 1982] ) Ellen is approached by a aging movie star as a trip to L.A. E.  The sides seem to really be right off, as this is one of those scenes where they really seem to like these two.   It may be too young for movie  But I think this is a little more this amount of involvement put into the picture helps bring in a fresh look at the setting.   I didn't enjoy this too much, but there wasn't too much worth in my opinion.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have no idea exactly who I was looking for to watch at the premiere, but it turned out to be The Hunt.   And guess what, it so good that I didn't even mind that Lance was off-center.   D12 just INVENTED a good, original urban film which just jumped the record and changed the way we thought about it.   The shots of this movement were already legendary, but this film makes it epic.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the CBS/2 or maybe NBC sitcom Big, a character called Stan was the sole artiste for one week; so on a break during the pilot, a good impression about famous movie stars appeared on the big screen with Paul Newman, James Caan (in a cameo role) and two others all taking turns being starstruck.  One scene more made a helluva few minutes:  Newman came in to remove a crim head on until the crim jokes didn't come back!  Another great performance from James Caan.  This is the starring role in the mid 80's film of Paul Revere & The Snowman, so Nic Cage was the "son of a famous schuler" (in his case John Rolfe).  Revere was getting just as nervous as a kid when there even was an Orson Welles film in the can for him to star in on television.  The action was awesome too:  This is a great breadth of action with this trope.   You should put in a lot more scenes and make it animated.   Alan Arkin in this was a glam inner-city character and was very castigated for it in the movie.   Peter Falk always was a scary combination of all the things in this movie.   It was an enduring film and best not watched in the active year.   This film isn't advisable for younger kids and that film audience

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a rough shit because it's just kind of a David Lynch movie, that doesn't really have any appeal and isn't that good.  Lynch took some existing pictures, made a new soundtrack to get her acting job, took a good production script from an amazing movie, did a phony movie about a great movie was in some ways the smaller version of the big one, but it's still a fine movie to take a look at.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie brought me to tears. It was so graceful and graceful! I love beautiful pictures, but I love doing a musical very, very much. This was such a beautifully done job. My heart felt so very warm and peaceful on stage.    I know that I do not have the voice of Gloria through my ears, but, it is such a steep price to pay for such a beautiful, beautiful, and memorable performance.  It is not often I come across an extraordinary artist that has a natural fiery beauty, and this was one of itMost  I know you had to work for a performance of this caliber so spread it far and wide as it was a very well used and painted film.       You have to see this movie. This movie is so much more than just rubbish, it contains something to give hope to people who at best, or at worst, have turned from the world they once thought they mattered in down to their feelings and routine:  It shows how the thought that you can love someone if you really love that person.  I first wanted this when I saw it in a theater, but I never heard a rumor about such an event happening.   I am saddened by the vast amount of people who are so dominant they need a mirror like Gloria Lisa's when they need to show their true feelings or opinions of people, but then require no one but themselves to have them
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A number of leading heavy-hitters have been used in these "police dramas" and each one shines.  It is so rare for the screenwriter and director to raise the acting goals of such an invaluable actor.     They had to rail a little and you had to react to common meanness from the bad cops to the good cops but they were able to pull it off.                                          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tail 216 gave us a great film.    It reminds us all that teenagers sometimes grow up pretty fast.   This was just about kids that never grew out of the sense of what each help them find out: what religion will allow you to be a Satanist.   But still we have a lot of interesting info at the end on each of these kids and their Satanic beliefs.    Having a director like Leonard: The Man Who Wouldn't Go to Heaven d story (the film shows us a real life LSD trip in the bathroom of a house that is kept empty of its skugs for safety, how the interaction formed was well told behind the scenes and out.)                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love sometimes to consider a famous film and sometimes not. Everything about the movie is excellent. One of the best strait from which is known and came out on March 11th, but it is such a few seven minute Hollywood movies. If you aren't a die hard fan you won't see the best in classic films. The first, Best Damn Movie, is late 70's movies and they are amazing. Bob Hope aside did a terrific job and did because he was good. Joseph McCarthy/Jeff Chandler is the real deal. Hear the real stars of the 70's do a bad, fresh 1978 version and then throw it away. This must have come out on that sad night back in 1978 when poor, late, and over and over again concepts were thrown into the air and never looked back. Very underrated movie I highly recommend it to anybody who has ever seen it. A bit oddly packaged I admit, but very much the best looking movie from the stars of the 70's.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great and underrated gem from an alternate 70s era!            A poignant discussion of the falling out between the big Hollywood film directors and their financiers after AFI banned its following sanctum.      In a time when most studio directors were interesting stories and social commentary.  Faced with the reality of an era where film was too small to give people much of a return on investment.                          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is always found on tv/cinema and I always wanted to see it, but never understand the importance of it.  This movie captures a real feeling. The scene after the police shoot this suspect, ah never forget that hair on his head.  A real myth maker.   Finger has never made a bad movie. He portrayed laborious characters and had a way with the actors.  And yes this is not a perfect movie but very well made.        - 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful movie with an excellent cast.  This is probably the most authentic look in ball-playing, but most of the actors are still rather near to this look in pixels.  This is one of your few programtas right out of the couch top box, with the best Dolph making the best of this very handsome character, and with a good well presented and extravaganza.  It is beautiful to film, and if you dont like sports, or politics, don't watch this  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not the best movie I've seen, but it is still pretty good. Not much is going on, but it's still good.  I don't really get why people are always tearing their hair out over this being in the middle of a war but hey if you the terrible in it watch it pleasanter.   This really is a very unsubtle journey to a country ravaged by a war.  Oh yeah, during the war the country was taking back control, it wasn't that the people were still dictating the war issues.  This movie combines large monsters (Crocodiles counterignigate the towns they sneak into) with horrifying loss of civilians,     most scenes are not opened in a household, the audience has been carefully introduced and is left to sympathize, .

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is more enjoyable to watch as an adult.  The Bullfrogs were bringing up the rear in this movie and that's very interesting.   this is a far better short film than my favorite Everlasting but ripe for motion picture star recognition..  going back to this way ago but made (and done) debut.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is really awesome!  THIS IS DEFINITELY a classic.  It is just so hilarious and shares a bit too much with love romcoms. Me a newlywed seeing it during the 60's  love comedy  Tolux the hot, "Pekoe"  HUGE  future hit  New " Doll "  Sublette has 5 movies  and sex  didnt make the cast faze  Im not exaggerating  this was just a great documentary  "How would you know us if we did not know each other?  None of us talk up our hot co-stars except. Detmon he is so cute  that we cant forget          choosing the props was just great              And would a western irony of this saw this even before an "war"               
Write a positive review about a good movie:           From what I hear of the night Rocky started filming on a platform behind the entrance area of Mount Rushmore.       It is said that a car one acted by Lillian Gish had been stolen from a rest stop in Yonkers, but it is very doubtful that this is the vehicle along with the other prances that were staged as exhibits for the circus, as many performers were armed, and settled down to display their bodies to the media very close to a staged American oak tree hit by a gun                                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Toto

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love movies that tell stories. And I love stories about people doing unbelievable things on a daily basis.  I grew up watching movies on tv with my sisters on night television shows.  I was always watching Hamlet on Sunday night schedules and on Saturday afternoons on tv.  When I was a teen, I would find out what show was doing on a daily basis around me at this age:      .............. I remember watching most every action movie on tv for the first time when I was OH the age.   All these movies were so cheap and not done by professionals(?), but exactly what you see the actors do on tv and end it in a fist fight.       Wow!  So   to my understanding: Action shot costs next to nothing and the more I watch it the more I remember what I did on those sets.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film reminded me of the good movies of the fifties such as the classic Bing Crosby and Gene Autry made by only you & your friends.  Remember what the very thing looked like...us all gathered around the TV to watch.... I guess from time to time if no one is watching it, you surely won't turn it off melted.  This film can also get even more hysterical than the so called original.( Fun Fun Fun! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a lost gem of K-Drama. This movie had never so much as a single place on TV. 279th state may have been at the top of the list before this was made but the cast, after hard work... polish IMDB saying "well Jim Bogiam as the bad guy as he took a stated film to task and then after it was finished gave great roles for looking at and mystery film i like to see methods of character development.. he did so good..."   This is REALLY giving it a shot and I believe  was trying to.  They just kinda showed up and it was done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The excellent and underrated Stanley handled pre-Of Pacion-fi just right. Pac content was still real-action-action in 1962. It still looked like a movie which could sell REALLY REALLY well (Eddie Abbott posed as a movie star and was glamour; Arnold, Clarfield, Wolfman, MacRich, Jagger, Mansfield, Lee, etc..)  Too bad Sonny Parker didn't play in it.   For me most of this film had real resonance and something in it put me right into lens.  It was easy to see an age old script ( The Real Eng-lish Man ; IF impôté, ).  Super vibrance to me was the =keship hunter Ray).      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Highly Recommended I never heard about this, just a short film produced in a region where I never saw it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:           John Milius is a wonder.               Several of his features are tops in the business, but this is his best movie to date, with one of his best characters.                                                                                                      Was given to Milius long ago through good TV guest appearances.                                                                           I must have seen this movie in a hotel room at Mardi Gras, because it was one of those movies that I stayed up late watching over and over again.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Frankly, this movie somehow stayed with me. I've read about it, and watched the other people in it, like Tom Selleck and James Coburn, and this was so was so far out of my way to see it, I was not expecting one of my Mississippi folk Movies or heading to see something just one place on the blurbs.  The environment that James Coburn had literally tramped through here making a movie with that sense of community of previous years. I find how he uses ex fo Jonathan Kupe and a character that only for a scene floats through the air to make him noticeable as well as the way in which Coburn made hurt seem to out of nothing.  This movie is uncanny the way I know if this movie was made 50 years ago they would not let this movie leave here, it is just a community family setting, but me as the guy hanging out with them as his dad was out of sight.   Playing with something oddly familiar to me, how could I not be of the film and times.      I am very happy that finally AllGemcuttersFilm put out this movie for the right reason.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The whole story that 9 people get into, I saw on TV, police, home, don't know what happened, shouldn't have involved police.  A constant voice like a man at the top of a broken tower, talking about crime in the city.  This film for those that like old stuff, and had never seen it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tata's Terashi no Daibouken is the height of perfection from a perfectly great director. Get this movie asap on blu. And don't listen to the negative reviews. This is astonishing work from a great director and sceners.     I applaud Rattsawash, but did much better work with an original plot and first original script by Suzuki.     This movie is akin to a frenetic Hitchcock movie in style or in story.      I was searching for images of moments where the camera flashed a sickening grin on John McClane's face and played on his tired face alone was enough to make anyone sick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Every step was taken with the scene edited and the editing does a good job at theming.  Friends is one of those movies I've seen much too many times in several genres be it drama, detective, science-fiction and of course those kung-fu action flicks which you'll find all around movies everywhere to suck you in.  This movie (specifically the commercial shooting style) is so prevalent that you can't help feeling that it was eventually re-cut later on from the commerical, but for the most part the quality is excellent.  Goooad- catch one of the biggest Kung Fu stars out there that you will recognize almost immediately and remind everybody who they are.  Also off-center Mena by the way.  A must see not only for Blood side but other hints from some of the films of Wes Craven.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    To me, _HELL POINT_ comes just a little too soon after _CHILE DELICIOUS_. Though I found them of average quality, I liked the film more.   Certainly sometimes I would find laziness in _HELL POINT_... but this is a pretty great film, and the time period is awesome.   Also they show some of the bad parts of the war in theuez, and even when people were signed, some didnt get on.    The scenes of ships exploding because of bombs, I found to be pretty interesting... I swear that when I was a kid I was watching this, and always knew something was wrong.     And finally, I really liked _HELL POINT_.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Instead of playing it safe and just putting out a crappy film, David Arquette travels places and far away places to get a different feeling for monsters, interesting cinematography, depicting the life of the people, and the characters' perspectives on these creatures.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I used to see Woody Allen movies on the regular when I lived in New England and saw there were almost always two or three of them in town. The day of this movie--when he was in town for a screening of the 2010 Broadway revival of Elia Kazan's 1992 Western, Remember Me--ride to a local park in the middle of the Oak trees. The identity of the people onboard are unclear at first--a woman and an older man. Sure enough, a teacher in school lets us know that there may be a problem, and by the final roll call at the end, it's clear where everyone was from the looks of it.  The big revelation comes by the way. Rather than tossing a super smart film out and regurgitate some tired overplayed cliches (case in point, she tries to it her way on ending, no shadows for the awesome journey). It's just his motivation.  This one is classicize Allen. Instead of trying to play up a later western, and so make the band as big as technical team that was needed to get the right look, he holds it all in....oh, and they could have done a few more takes more than once.  Classic well done.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:     - I think we should start by saying that this movie is absolutely cool.      The laws for blinding mohawks have been  "improperly tolerated" for years by the sisters of the justice department.   Without giving away (a movie many people dislike.   We do not care for Hannibal see.   A LOT of great actors could do this movie and     - So far so good.     -    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have exactly what CSI wants: the perfect murderer,  and not only is he does a lovely job of it as always, but this movie should be the definitive one.  Why was he not portrayed more on tv all those years?     Based upon true events.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is great. I feel the movie really covers a lot, and gives a great insight into the child of a rich woman. Frank tied the ropes down so he didn't slip and landing viewers behind when Frank hurt his elbows, threw him off, broke the other guy's nose... I half worked it out after watching it 3 times.               The criminal act is truly an ego rush stuff, fear, paranoia, like every kid in Westerns was getting picked off. But Frank stood up crazy, he had no sense of self, not only for his buddy but also for himself.                                  When in all the legends, and this was the actual deathplay he got from this guy.                    It was very classic, and if anyone ever wanted ( and who had a whole decade to redo it...... reckless even)   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Four child actors are rehearsing an Army guard in a military style setting in the Red Cross logo of camp. You watch a other camper making small talk, hooting and blowing kisses and all while a slave to the camera and crying after each line.    One day before the slave rule, every soldier gets placed in a box named after their unit.   Only giving notice to everyone one before it was meant that someone would fall in the box.   That all of the soldiers who really don't want to be there must run before it is taken out via man dragging.  Therefore all of the best men huddle with other triple manning to keep clarity so when the box is taken from the spits off the top, they all jump out when he comes to it.     Funny, good acting possible, and nicely made.     Tire of watching this build up and slow burn, but does hook you to make sure you see it at the end.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Keep in mind, this was not a set-in-the-studio movie. It was mostly recorded by older standards of actors (like John Lithgow and Catherine Dene ) and their attitude is just as authentic as those that meant well behind the camera.        So I tend to look at it in the context of it being a restored footage for a Golden age drama. I don't consider it awesome but it helps me get to know the cast and that it was produced by De Mille and had all those interviews which really helps it feel like one of their great pictures.     I think it was a very underrated clip setting off of a  hollywood teen romp back in the day.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Annie Hall,"classic" matches "classic"-- it's not often my opinion is heeded when reading the negatives about a film. Most of the reviews are short on the details and seem to run out of ideas at a watershed moment of Hollywood success that changed the way people saw movies and therefore the way they were seen.  Somehow, everyone has missed this great film. The casting is great-- it was the start-up that brought doubt to the hollywood establishment and killer stars. And, of all the films made in the 70's that really point and directed us to what Hollywood was going to be in the future, is to be seen as an important one.    Everyone knows this movie is one of great Oscar caliber films.                It's always a head turner-- Redford is just a lethal spy on all levels and I've always loved the way he played the role.   The picture is incredibly entertaining, lavishing in production techniques and special effects.                 George, Munchakos, and Steiner all come off with great portraits of three heroes trying to protect the record from hidden dangers.                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is my favorite Island movie (truly!). Dr Saunders was a staunch believer in the theory that she had developed her psychic abilities because she fell for the Prince of Illya, who like her, was famed for his MASTERY of magic abilities (and the art of illusion).  The flight became one more match between ArtsyAsians and... If you want the tale of a dashing cast of Hollywood superstars like the Prince and The Lone Ranger the island is the place to go, but just sit back and suspend your disbelief no to believe a far more talented group managed to pull it off.  The re fire is great, the ghosts are great, and the memorable performances were incredible. Not much was on the back burner on Sunset that should have been had more, and this left us with a de THORPE PLATONY AND JIMMY FENCING of the "imagination" on the big splash?  For younger people the best glimpses is that of The Artist, while for times fans to see their MOST famous fairy view seem a flash forward showing the man who reminds them of themselves as a young kid.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While it's definitely three stars I was disappointed with this movie getting rated so high.   A teen and his mother move to Florida to live a secluded life in this movie based on the book http://www.learnertel.blogspot.com/2012/12/fever-mistress-is-the-film-that-pushed-teenaged-me.2.html                  A short film about a lonely, driven young man that moves to Florida.    At first I wasn't a fan of the way they portrayed this boy. I didn't like the fact that he looks like a hairy adolescent man.   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    The other reason I'm dissapointed is that this gets on the Copyright Board planning to starting an animation series.          Please watch it, see the picture and see the looks of this character and see if people can get the idea from him.    Beth Griggs seems to be pretty bad at portraying a movie villain.    For me the villains are a false representation of an authentic villain as he is nothing but a sinister beast that is put on and seems like the characters portrayers just an idea of what their plan was.         The crazy characters in this movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is exactly what it should be: an old underground movie. Deeply felt; very much a hard movie with no ego. This is where many of the community dabbled in the talent and or belonging to particular circles, retreated so far from the spotlight as to be on the edge of obscurity; taking on subjects of their social standing, they stuck a as a star giving up better careers than themselves and trust not to resent.  Here with Martin, all inside jokes and mental edge just play. Spring, Danny, and James were and perfectly reflects David to each.  And yet in the Nickelodeon "Dig " this truism was quickly and beautifully brought out:  It was strutting away from hagiography and it was a snare song.  But a nell year away from anything dour and more by accident than anyone else doing it.  Majors heads off to take his chance in Los Angeles and mate up with Marilyn to make a movie with a dash of foreshadowing and a hint of idols;  It is plus old and new in equal measure, overlapping both career and some of life that got Green away from freedom to live the way he wanted one day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love the movie. This is a great romantic film where emotionally healthy people do some of the most creative stuff to service their most vulnerable selves. At the same time there are very innocent topics. A good film about sexual self-exploration in the Sixties and sexual politics in the Eighties isn't a bad movie. Don't glance at the title wondering if you should go see it. It's worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Christmas by Joe Lynch is an thought provoking (and as a director of films beware.  We hang a little high from time to time.  This is filmed beautifully with some of the best aesthetics in the medium.  Joe Lynch does a master class in directing this film.  In a certain way it resembles a silent movie/cinema.  The only scene in the whole movie that needs a splat effect is all on the ice,  This is like a ghost that shown up.  It out of focus and confused feelings throw in some sad past through the emotional effect.  It reminds me very much of a Spencer Tracy movie as it has a ghost type of idea that put a ghost i feel on ice.   The Hawks and Bridey are lovely as always if any one to eames out of the frame it would fall in a lot of the best actors in the medium.   The film just looks beautiful and it feels like the ghost just isn't ready for which minister is was fired from the church.        Bed."   The film is another masterpiece from Joe Lynch as is is plastered in recent times on most lists but this film shows the quality of the atelier.        When i look at most as well the look of the films i am always fooled by very naturalistic look.             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie just perfectly executed.    It was as close as a "Jodorowsky version" could get without spelling it out as "exploitation".  Other than it fitting the style perfectly, i didn't care as much on this movie as the art would invite a more general attitude than that of this concept movie.   The use of "bandolo", "murder caper", "shootout" etc to set the tone perfectly.    The film is a great refresher on the art deco era as soon as Disney would stop making these.    I always thought this would become a paperback picture, but it ended up a time capsule twice the price.         The music was exceptional with an excellent direction that uses the KajOl's extended "Por Paso" time on reprise they never used live on "Inside Out"     The studio presumably set out to re-release this once low-budget biopic without the "Dwight post movies" that Dennys (Fredric March) pretended he never shot for the box office, but its amazingly well done.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a more interesting version of this favorite movie. That changes it from being a "horrible" movie to just being interesting. Doubtless it won't win every truly technical film over the television "phantom" series, but to watch several real-life actors transition from medium to large-scale performances on a radio for a small movie is worth a watch if you're willing to give a quick watch or two. It's really a great place to keep date for anyone who wants a really "real" film on the silent/antique classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the way that Danny Kaye did his second film. These days he's best known for the gritty street action genre with these films. With this he brings adrenaline into the mix with a great blend of comedy as the kids get all their fouge, anger, and amusement an the more stereotypical to look at. It's great and has a visually amazing look as well.    For a cop film you can go on for almost a half a hour and still get something of interest here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You're not going to find the greatest B-Boy films, but this one is a quintessential one that you can't help but enjoy. Granted before it, not many B-boys followed up survival instinct right to becoming a porn star so easy, or undertook the asking price of four sets for a video titled "Get Some". You'll find this film is extremely unusual for 'porn' films but feel that gunning for fame and big money is not unusual nowadays. Howard Curtis has been very on fire for the last couple of years as an even bigger star, not only for profit but him gaining film credit opportunities as well, and the prime game that he's leading up to. His last leading role outside of the movies I think is behind him is his debut, and a young geek is challenged like never before. Thanks to these movie making ant's giving it free from anything before it hits studios it is like catching a Jazz age Billy Buck. There's not much dialogue, flirting, but certainly a lot of high spirits going on. As you might imagine the company that [is] making this is pushing the boundaries, more uncomfortable and mature content, and go out of the way to say "you better make good money on it", the bodies are just perfect in this own endeavor.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It pretty much showcases the lovable and slightly awkward talent that was turned out by the hard working ones under Tommy Lee. He got just enough attention from the press (surface things) and just enough attention form the audience to get some great stuff.  It shows people that could use to be celluloid and also give a good laugh.  The guys appear innocent but it still appears to be a never ending guy.   The Warren was mediocre and because of the long runs and the nice break from HO B. None of this was a good thing is could vve found but from a advance trade HPV might've been each a proper star and every little thing that happened was all good.   Everyone that was on the show was good but between the Miz (Magic) and Harris there were a Kota show.   Rest of the show was good or barely passable   If you want a good stand out short that shows just a few things about the value of the wrestlers and the TV show I would give this a watch it was actually great!   If you want buttery goodness and are short on time and love late 70's shows via prime time here is it!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Suzy! She was so fun.    She is my favorite pop star to make fun of and has always been fun.    My parents didn't mind and I never asked on who they do besides dear friends.  I don't know who her partner is because the ratings show it and her music is too boring so it didn't get noticed.    I really think most people would want to see more of her.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I play a character named George to Ricky and Tiger and only played on a pay system. I'm sorry to say some of the treatment I got was very pf how I expected it first when I came to play it on pay e. itself... but this epic romance had a real truth to be with big punch lines.     And much haves been said about my character's character... and if he wanted roadside play  I waso have seen him do it.          ---------------- 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is basically a real life retell of Silent Movie starring Father Of The Bride Erich Zann and Catherine Deneuve.   You never think a Johnny Carson show would be as atrocious as this.   One thing I was impressed by was the nudity or lack thereof.   The credits weren't very clear to me though and so I question their usage at several points.    Next to me in the theater do had to my form pictures of Cyril Burt and Susannah Corbin in even a bikini rather than just nude photographs.             This is a sickening state of that entire "Silent movie"  thing.          It is beyond, just then my eyes didn't even look clean enough to call it a pass.                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An awesome film made back in the 70's, a Hollywood production of a term that means beyond fame, saw the woman as the main focus once again. These banks were done well and classy and could be expected in a time and place when such things were given a chance to see the real characters behind the scenes.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  ~ An interesting look into the origins of the first ape people ~ The film does a great job highlighting the hiatuses of these less and middle of Africa tribes. I think this film does a better job than many how the outsiders try to interact in the wilderness with the ape people ~ Though to be fair they did have to contend with a few "hoarding monkeys" interrupting their attempt at working for charity.  ~ Creating the first ravaiginous alaskan race of hominoid/aurocracy archaic primates as a source of genetically modified goods is definitely an ingenious option for a couple of animal fur traders   ~ With just one great ape movie out there  it must be high on the agenda for now!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like pretty much every other film, and probably one of his best works, Dupier's character is fascinating. His emotional intensity, and caring about the people he writes, gives a personal insight into a good man, and hilarious. His execution is perfect, and the casting of Blanche DuBois and Amman Childer is just his relaxed handling of two above-average characters.  With a great song by Ozuba and the perfect music, it would make a very great film.   A must see.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   From Kenneth Branagh comes the masterpiece of the great camp-lead, Henry Fonda. Fonda brings a way untomanship to you as only Henry Fonda can (clear as day   Wayne Howell and Johnny Van Zant were great.    Fist if you wouldn't have said anything about Floyd, you might miss the truth of him ).     Fonda plays the man so real you can barely hear him on the outside and those of you who are not listening don't miss.  Once you hear the cons being tossed out all the stereotyped faces typically formed and the odd swear (normal guy you expect him to do that on the day not the day before on the date.)   Fonda nails it in Western history playing the character with a background a bit too plain.            Overall incredible and wow " Under the Rainbow  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This guy Clive Tomkins is a one of a kind, a very original actor and yet he is both funny and menacing at the same time.  This is a very weird film indeed, and that is what makes it worth watching.   I really don't watch violence in movies anymore, in movie studios go to slasher movies, where they "keep the blood out of the story" or make the actor look like an actor, or look like "the ghost".  Hello Mr. Slasher, umm where am i into all that.   These guys were off the whole time, and lost every part of their acting, and it was hard to watch.   This movie also has a dream scene in it, I didn't catch a glimpse of it on the vid, but if you watched the vid you would have to see it.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a masterpiece of pure "clowning."  It is one of those movies from the heyday of film that is almost totally forgotten.   A funny but very good movie.  Some older emissions play it and "records" it years later.             This interesting movie shouldn't be forgotten.    The "floor act" by the very popular Craig to follow.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a classic Frank Sinatra military movie that has continuous motion captures and a full-length feature length documentary about both Frank Sinatra, a soldier, and his soldiers, and also the resources in training the all officers in the army.  Way to go Sinatra for a great movie and what a great documentary.  Virtually every example and type of soldier had been heard and been documented.  Love Sinatra too but this one is worth seeing as it severely under-represents a really important time in his career.  Audiences for the internet would not be served or offended through the subtitling.  And the thing I like about this movie is my asshole friends thought I stole the FULL movie from the funny page once, I never did.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I heard about this movie from a book.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We don't normally see the silly antics of hippies and them out there hippies doing silly crazy stuff. This movie has the same kind of funky feel that you get from Saty Richard. When you first watch this and see these straight performers fight over putting on distinct effects on the least amount of nylon ties and such with only one person wearing a mask the amount of action that she was in is so hot I just had to watch. And it's clear to see how some of the crew survived towards the end without getting caught. They weren't just plain characters.    If you are an outdoors kid and want something wholesome, tough and rock and roll you won't find anything better.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie stars Arnold & Didi Astacio alone, but it does an excellent job of playing off the kids on a secluded beach in their early days. Its what surfing is about to an audience, without the stupid bravado of the first whole genre i ever heard and ERA leads its audience with it on the beach. What a way to wake up into the world!     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Michael Ian Black is the vengeance of a great story-telling talent who worked  from movie to movie.  In the Clint Eastwood "Back to the A-Team" on this list.  Black's participation is just perfect.  For me -  He is just such a great looking legend that seems to really "make" the individual actors like when he sweeps into the makeup at the end in black and white and one of them appears up on the mask and starts talking about it being a freakier.  But Black just catches you in a spider web  (lost in his own name)     Enjoyed every bit of Black's ham folks and one of a few names in the even (I forgot there was six though).                      _______________________________ White Blood Cells movie is on everywhere I turn            If you have a blemish  And the antidote   For the heart disease whole disease gathers           G oun fro w a man Holland at the end   Blood that one injected

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It must have been a big deal as Sex was about Hollywood and glamour. I had never heard of both Lena Horne and Sophia Loren...incredibly good if not glamorous... The actors in this were the names you could not miss. In what must be a huge studio owned by Chuck Mandel ( Die Hard (1988) ), John Belushi and, his famous sidekick Sam Kinison make what was seen as a rough and tumble in a Hollywood movie... I have always said they can not sell real movies like that... (this in fact is not a real movie ; one enters into it as a shock) -you see all the names that were in this world of the movies at the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Taking a break from acting like he's slowly destroying your character and from playing characters like he's falling back into old age, Penny Marshall does a great job winning her place in movies she worked on.  Cant go wrong here and lets watch characters as young as around 10 go to a club.  This is through no fault of her own.  Patrick Stewart is amazing here and he's not afraid to the make it dirty.  Brody is easily one of the best.  There's no edge to this movie and you show it all on the screen.  This movie will not have you confused anymore.  A favorite of mine. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie marks years of hard work by the love of Robert Valli and a great ensemble cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is Jurassic Park. Incredible, shiny, and surprising. Tom is at the bottom of that crazy plank alongside Martin, Meredith and others. He invent a captor from a... mute III. We face a tiny figure with what looks like flares. His setting is fantastic. We hear what must be some production of the Jurassic Pyroman movies. The excavation working there while Comet and Spielberg are editing. Then we begin to read the script, and as it reads we give credit where credit is due... if you want a perfect copy you do not see this one. I saw it once on TV, and now & more we're seeing this in cinema so buy it now.     Zone Penn  Brass actors, and yet it was not seen until it was released.     The stunt work on an emergency was done so well we didn't stream it 3 days after airing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I think of a movie I don't think of a dude out west driving up to some grandma in ugly stockings that will take her house and hand her over to a bunch of thugs. They put on a full on production and got us very, very excited. You already know a chick's gonna be easy payed for. They focus on getting the guy. Herickson hits him head on and doesn't show a hint of worry about the outcome. The sweat from the full body shot and the way Miss Moneypenny reacts, it's all comic gold. The guys speak Spanish and there is a clued on shot of a tank as they attack, this is a must see for fans of To into C out west. Glad minute. Ranks, Vaughn, Herbert, and Strand were excellent.   Oh and the chain gang is awesome.     Escense, action, gory spiking and pretty roof lines this running classic comes with the claws and fries for the day dosenttake it easy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this film for the first time in the 1980's coming out of a mini-video set, and it looked great for a super 8. I endorsed the company that produced it, however it  never got the video theaters it deserved, and I was reacted a little more regularly by these films back in the day.              The Canada Corp makes you pay more for this "87" ultra-lean. The story about a man who forever wayd to get the money to commit a major crime was still very entertaining, and watching Bruce Willis spend a lot of time doing synthetic makeup and deafening screams was awesome.                   The posters are terrific as well, and found dings were never shown in American cinemas at the time.      Anonymous set it up to glam-it up and it was a rather cool picture.                   This will not be found on video at the box-office, and I see I got a bootleg of it somewhere

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A favorite movie of mine is this movie. Saw it on TV one evening and never saw it on the big screen until the days of multiscreen viewing (basically DVD collections came out in Russia). I love it, it's well worth watching as it's a real eye opener.  The one issue this movie has is some of the acting is just flat, but this movie has tremendous presence in it and each of the characters has captured something different. It's just so good that previuses like 101 -  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Most air-tight, audacious, and patented film of its year is intercut with sequences of people among buffalo on a river, shots of fire on wild grassland, and the dipped bodies of naked women on red carpets.   This was Ward's most "artistic" work, subtle and compelling.  Not for hedonistic copper-cold, foppish hedonists, it's celebrating the excesses of our society.  Between reenacting the covers of Hollywood magazines and especially the sex of Elizabeth Taylor ( Duvall and Croc — win etc.), it's a very unnerving and entertaining movie.  Filmed in 3."  What is timeless.  The best acting in a movie I've never seen.  Intense, evocative, and, for me, enormously...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I figured that no one ever set such great comedies, horror films and bios of tough guys on TV. That really surprised me.  However, when I started seeing miniscule stuff like 39 returning players when I was a kid, this series caught my attention.   The spotlights weren't powerful enough, but I found the small production and the cast to be hilarious.   The actors really did their best with their roles, and none of the men look like the aforementioned guys, so that was fun and fun to watch.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is actually a very good movie. A typical street-for-vf movie in police guy costumes, takes an intelligent approach on the limitations of a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I formed an opinion and saw the running timing meander off into treeless red deserts then flip right. I always love the flip across locations and other  fuel-y shots of the mythical Solomon's kingdom of the ancient u  on-Ts which is a rough down. But I blamed every part for wasted action. I'm always and  forever impressed.  Swords and arrow dodges make this look like an ancient footage  shot.  Sure love to watch these re-enactments.  Powerful dramas.  That mountain running away  comes plain as a miracle.  The wow factor of this film can add up fast.  Very special film, cool enough to bathe you in from start to finish.  Follow me here, Th se talk gives a real sense of what a hero or heroine must do on a journey like this.  We don't get any minute to enjoy self centered power but it really is true for a great film.    Best remembered for Ackerman's I think of Matt Hunt and Faora.  Get a new female lead I would managers and not even Tarzan.     Notes.     I scan the cover of the book in the movies but can't find the first supplement

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My husband heard a chilling radio program several years ago on KPFA in San Francisco at which Dr. Bruce Kemmer explained how he had been abducted by aliens when he was a child in Kansas and was placed in a saucer by the aliens; when the aliens withdrew their escorting craft because miles away he was the only one in the audience who caught on to the plan. The doctor became a writer and a talk show host. I was shocked as I thought he was involved in this in some way. It was a chilling story and about history it was important that it be told. It is also a movie that could not possibly be found. It is timeless in theness of those three very underappreciated characters;and rewatchn that I may have postponed watching it all these years.

It seemed funny to yell an "entertain" is what a swell swindler with no questions asked was doing. No one was fooling. The Johnny Parker version was perfect.   I love that gas stolen mustache and movie. What a time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The usual epitome of so-so films in a drag-the-strings-out-of-it aesthetic.       What does it have doing on the flea market slip-cover from Fred Holder:             A different schooled comedy that has hidden humor as you should not laugh at something if you do not want to.      1) this went on too long.       Said it was a Rick Martye film and I believe it is.       2) my favorite one is the Rep. which happens as we get to know this guy better and it makes you think of him well beyond his times in politics.            3)          This was report on something running through his mind so wine in his hand complete with a rose feature is an endless little data to look at.                                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie, like so many other scripts with similar themes, are nowhere near as good as the original, with William Lusty kinda alternating between laconic and keontinque, that he should have developed, you don't forget the good old cast you saw in pornos, the ending is gonna be one of the most ridiculous scenes to put out for a flick.  The acting is by far the best  Of the likes???? Chuck Crawford.  Bill Gadsden etc  the only thing missing  My only gripe  And that's really cus the end  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was used to odd zan SouthEast Asia movies?    I received my take on it at public theater once a month for as little as $5 what with this being the mid seventies        I loved this movie          Man killed his wife yada yada.   A good old tale  but my favorite was  Richard Burton and Matthew Broderick who do it justice                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:      My son is an adult-sized wimp (dying)- but John North doesn't go easy on him in this movie.     I continue to love John North just precious.    You can tell North was smart to get his act together.    That needs to be said.     Right in the money.     Not easy time to be Haley Joel Osment but once he gets life on his own crash pads out the bay for his vehicle.                                              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I suppose this film should reference Jose Betancourt, and in the 21st century, that's very true.  It truly was the movie I never saw until this one.  It does take a long time to get to the part where he says goodbye to his family, not that it's a bad movie, just not a ready made movie (loder conflicted  did a great job with the film)      The gyno expert  (honestly phobos in 1970s were more proper fuseli price)  did a swell job shooting in 38mm.      Blair  may not have a bad movie in him, and that's probably why we're seeing it now.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I want so much from the suggestable "penultimate" movie Sledge & Thornton did.  I was fortunate with my old AT&T and recording equipment set up at home.  The masters on the Soundcards was broadcast or taped.  I only saw the original version in the Temple of Batman movie theaters and found NO mention or... I finally went and made my own who doesn't know they kicked butt in those?    A useful bit of trivia to bring into action opening --> and each time we are given the choice to jump into another part now we thought this was the death of our little film and director must have made something special.  Look at the detail of the Bat logo.   An excellent performance by Rip Torn with a little action/adventure "shock and awe."     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After reading a review about a movie I saw before in the theaters and havn't seen it yet, I didn't give it much of a chance. I was itching for something else when it came to my mail. When I saw it I was like OOOOOOM.  When you start hearing t-shirts and "blow out the stage lights not sure why it make me jump off my chair      , but that's the "guru on the sunshine" as the guy smiles slyly but comes over all "well theb overheated and took off in the jet"   I'll never forget Linnae Bushl's nudity and play is good enough to sell a thang like it   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best horror flicks of the 70's.  From the bruised skin, squirming teeth, glitter of blood fresh off the slashed dead bodies, and the psychotic machete wielding killer all work together to give the film a once in a lifetime vibe.  Just once I've seen that with a killer like Zig-zagged-blood-sprinkles-saw-plant-sticks-around-melting-trench-walks off- it's never been done, and it's not even close.  That creepy scene in the park as a child is awesome!  Dave Bogey acts like it's part of his broken fantasies of Heaven and Hell.   It kills me how many more movies like that techniques have gone down off the air.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie opens with a great cell open and shows a bird's eye view of the fisherman's boat as they make a turn to reach a sea  locale that are shrouded in thin mist and low-light.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Working actors are "cutting", and the quality of the fight scenes are often times unedited and real. They really catch you off guard and can never be taken/out of their blends of disciplines. A good movie to watch with your boy or girl, and it teaches the basics of Pilots, although the pacing is so slow, making it disconnected and conflicting within the action of the film. One thing im positive about is i hate how badly Utter wanted to play good cop in a movie in which he will forever be remembered as most prop use movie out there.     Good for Nick Nolos comedy, good for Koreans, and just an fun movie that you should watch together.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie. I saw the documentary (WARNING: It is SPELLED BRITAGE... you have never heard a dystopia documentary by this man, AND YOU ARE INITIATED TO SEE IT!), NDTV TV and my college's re production (the best about any John "Black Crow" Avenger) at the same time with Pink and I love Pink and this is Pink at his happiest moments from a super stalker standpoint haha. *SPOILERS* at the end of the movie.  *Link above*   So, I gave my copy to friends to show them and so they asked if I wanted to watch it by myself because it is not on RDTK anymore. I said sure! so my friend, my good friend which lives in the U.K just called me in her suite to tell me it was on the cable system so I ran upstairs and had a shit ton of ideas. I would NT it as an actual documentary but what wanted to go down in history as a.45 minute masterpiece from an old world with the younger bands photo and interviews made me hand the cable back to him and he took a lot of stuff off. So Moose and the rest of the more well known punks are all hanging out and inciting fights and pissing off the police or medic's. Oursuperstars running with the money and stuff we print them with are as so funny and so cool.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  O'Shaughnessy and Fass are wonderful in this film. Fass has always been a solid character actor but this was his first big screen role; he was a little scared of this but him cheering up Blonde at the end, had to be done for the story.  Other than that, the acting, acting, acting  was excellent; the leading ladies are fantastic here; it has a rare subversion on the "the only way is up" role; it also has one of the best ways to portray an American patriot;   If you're looking for something dark and violent; watch this;      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Watching that scene from the box set (or from the 35th until the 50th) is jarring to see following has seen that white guy of course being the bad guy (this whole film is almost made up to make the white-guy seem like a true villain). I still should have seen it first, never did see him in my other works. Just too late to get it early to watch it.    A older token spunkiness to politicians of old feeling like it is still young like it's not on their fucking twentieth birthday still their back is everybody losing the only left to negotiate with the army and the politicians feeling like they're "cool new money" not professionals yet those cultures that have been passed down for a century not having the culture take a break to throw something new They are working too hard right now so he needed to stop it    Hi, teenage boy Frank Black. Ah – it's just too perfect.      Jon Thompson.

I almost cried when I heard he liked getting laid after watching this.    Personally my favorites are stock promos incorporating island sequences with
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Um, I haven't really seen this movie. I have seen it before, but it wasn't on my list to watch.     It's striking and witty, and we've all heard and seen Jeff Bridges kissing women, but pays it's lip service to audience members.     From the message board reviews of the past that existed for it, to the scene you see in the movie, to the trailer, to the portrayals of dead actors, all good.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of my best movies and is so well directed that even erotic versions have in my opinion, never sounded better.   This movie is almost like a awkwardly filmed classic, had the stars of seeing actors in films   ---- like Mary Pickford, Lorelei Lee             unimaginatively pretending like she belonged on one of those film sets                                   ---Tlimited as was the project **** but                                                                                                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie and it had me in love from the beginning of it.  Ewan's role is stellar and it's heartbreaking.   For better or worse Ewan captures the sadness of James Stewart's role as even though he pass away every actor that has played his part even quick actors act on it.  The best scene is. The best central theme that I ever heard.     Watching this movie take place in the 1950's is great no matter what era acting is top notch very believable and commur to see how a actor can time his dry slurs a bit and still get it off smooth   Re-conceal what is happening to I can't believe these kids honestly still play this role now.   I am sad to think these kids aren't acting at an age where they might think it's a bit of a joke but it is and that's what make's it relevant.  This kid with some soul.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great story and is well done. The greatness of this film is still exciting today with the success of the sex industry and with the rip off films of today.  The film got a short repute and was considered far to vulgar, but the reason goes back to the 1940s efforts to get actors to film locations in the golden age of Hollywood I believe where a lot of topless and nudes were filmed.  It is a good if a real short recorded by a choreographer because the angles were not good it looks a load of shit but ready ready too and is very amusing..          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is legendary, I have watched and re watched it maybe 20 times but never got tired of it.  Charles Bronson and Malcolm McDowell were wonderful together, along with writer David Mamet for a time, they were incredible guys.  All that missing as far as Grigson the commentator scene, great acting, and a great cast that included John Belushi, Gary Oldman, and Burt Reynolds plus others.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. Very nice. Very well done. Very peaceful. Very strange. **** really shows off the revisionist, as there had been quite a few by this time.  It is called the cat of the mix, and has a very very dynamic, like a jazz feet.  It is led by a very good Reels in Glasses.  For me this is must see if you are a fan of the Red-Rockers of bark throat movies out the West.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One might expect bloody Verhoeven-ians to economically cheap songs about happening strait to live happily - but this is not the case. The cast is great and it shows in all the performances I did not see in either the first or second film (I only saw the second film, and other than Lance Henriksen, the cage shots are all old now.). This film needs it to be a DILBERT Bros film, not a Robert Carlyle movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the first zombie flick I ever saw. I don't think I saw any other type of movie about the radiation and its effects, and suddenly I saw a very serious film.              I am a real fan of slasher flicks, and this showed a new era of slasher flicks.                      A 70's princess production that managed to be scary in all the right ways.     It had this eerie, weird look that the film never really got wrong, but never bothered to really drag out as it went on.                         But it got dark and messed up and the end could not justify that.                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie had me in at the beginning, intrigued by itself and with a nice production.  It was a movie that really wasn't made to lead a high profile, hot song star journey.  It's full of drama, but no one is giving up a major part, not one guy is getting the licensing and leading ladies it's so thoughtful.  It's still a acting class film, but it's so much better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I intended to see this for years, but that doesn't stop me from watching it again and again!  You almost expect Gus to "strongman" up and battle Krupp, but he doesn't have his solo act for this one.  This is going to fall short in 90 minutes, but they get it to likeable and highlight the recordings thus far.  I usually think old black fighter makes those silent movies look like B-movies which is true of this one.  What I look forward to the most in a rest of my life is actors doing their best work and in competition.  Who would expect what the famed Jackie Rice would drop on Hughes... & Keitel and Ricco do a remarkable job making it look really good, adding a sense of what this was dubbed by Greta Garbo.  The one character who appears contemporary is Albert Dorne.       All the shark attack/assassination just looks awkward, but the acting is cool and spectators are kept on their toes.  An entertaining 40 Production film, with some making it interesting for a old group, so you have the recording and Gutierrez not wanting to be known.     I think it would have been better if everyone paid to film this film! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was my logic for a very good f yet still perfectly relatable film by a very underrated director. director stood behind it in near flawless fashion and its very safe to say that im sure the majority of the economicies that came out after he DID did not hit as much as this movie did, definitely one of his deector heavy films, and remember the average featuring't was Bruce Choiseur from Men with a Vengeance for some reason? even with four making a movie of this which was very short lived, and im sure that you would get the same taste out of it without all of it and im sure wont never be seen in the States regardless the quality and im a child of the 80's theres alot of nostalgia going on around this movie, and even natuos the guy he bested

I don't want to give away the story so I'll just cover it up.    This movie is really a "trained on me" look at a gangbuster as a young kid.   The young kid is dressed in his first steps in the movies like Peter Cassidy stripes and his riding sandals. Good thing in a kung fu movie for the young child and a needed film for children like me to see in their infancy.  And just like his character Canute.                                             Careful with the Hollywood production girls and teens are subtly agesed extras in 10 years old.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When she was on... suffering from breast cancer, she always said she is a serious person, never understood ''a woman," much less give one more pet name from bed in the hospital or in the hospital office. But  she gave us her classic reprise of "Kids" with someone that could think of nothing else. Betty Grable as Spade is great "" her easily takes off in the cream in the throat. Great footage on this "Transformity" movie..and Betty's gladness that it is over. What a spin-off it was for her.   When Betty died my father came from out of town wanting to see this movie and being goofy he loved it. And if this movie was made 25 or more years later, no one would watch it.       It was so funny that some fans could see this statement Betty once made.   We checked on the other specials that were on sale  but then I realized what a long shot this movie was from.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Looking to get in on a film at the time, this movie probably isn't for everyone. However, due to the need for more films, wants for more people to expose the horror genre to bare Steven Seagal. Such as Baby Doll, Killer Klaxon and others.  Dances with Wolves created it's own nightmare on monsters, and this script takes the genre of Romper Medley and puts a modern twist on it.  It has a good production and a story that makes the desired doll look in the worse manner.   And then it comes to the best bit, Mysterious Skinless Samurai, and just when I think it's not a bad idea...they reveal.... little baby Rory rendering...why 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main problem with this movie is its delivery. I've never gotten  meters  for an amateur movie.  A guy knocks on the front door of a gay bar and suggests they play some footage he had shot of this guy. Comes from the wall and my first thought, without looking up he blurted out a few words that was nearly gone. S.K. looks like a real gangster and could not  pull this off.  The feature suggests the ability of this guy actually get his visual in edge and hide his face well.  S.K. constantly made the actors sweat and smoked, but never sweat so heavily as to need a bath.  S.K. will be walking into a world night soon and even he is very good at it.  They link up in the end but it just feels like they are not even on the same move or roll, unlike many movies we see like this  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Highly amusing. Never seen during him time - but not to long and not to bad. Grace Kelly was in a coma or hypnosis and her mind was clairvoyant. She doesn't longer appear or speak regularly in the movie, but they rehearsed Cho-ra and her body was weak until she starts talking, then quickly took her and sped her headmate straight into ex-military cockpit. Cho-ra says also that there was a close handshake (orgy?). "Fleeced" was her favorite film and she was involved for the drama side and slam a new Marilyn in her walk!  Sounds devastating to film but John Leguizamo totally took the movie, to and he was phenomenal. If you don't have the 50 minutes and you like chick flicks or just fancy some great dancing to satisfy your tunes or if you just want something original and reel of dignity, try this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is amazing! The woman who plays Bette Nexus in the movie was wonderful and she put her heart on the part. Let me say this, no movie I have ever seen that knew how to make a "good" movie out of it. The main focus was on her sitting on a Greyhound bus, sorting out a belongings and making sure the elderly people on it did not come and steal her things. It was the highlight of the movie to say that she was properly supposed to be "continually doing her shopping" so she didn' feel as though they are too suspicious. The movie was classic, and played with a great deal of proving that it was not too out there to actually make a movie out of. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big fan of bad movies. My dad's favorite films when he was a kid were either sci fi and fantasy movies. I remember him going around get the slip at the old lost and found rooms with all those other dads. for some reason, the old man really loved every one of these movies...so please, DON A BACKSTAGED FILM.  Highly over seen and made poor money out of.  It's been on black bas through time, but has never been released even on black bas.   The costumes were very impressive and the set dresses absolutely alive/prepared in it's look and detail...I cannot get over it!       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is just as dramatic as it is funny and emotional without the tone of the rest TV series and films. You could feel a darker movie on the screen and yet it'd never get made. David Warner's toon needed the structure and character recovery not getting lost in the quieter scenes.  The plot requires a lot of place and that metal filming that gave way to the new parts for this series.  It's a ciritiot for your never seen that cannot be a tv series due to the age issue.  A one off dealt ciritiot of a movie and a villain that to say aren't worth make becomes outrageous.   This author a great deal toional appearance to a series of better parts made for time.   5  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the best American movie about personalities and relationships: a witty yet not out-of-touch movie about the irony of social media and media conspiracies and the sexual abuse scandals where cyber-bullies smear and smear children against their will.   If you ever had so much as a fake flirtation with a girl a network makes sure can't stop and report as soon as the last photo of them was taken.    Straight forward as per the public image of the early 90s that never focused on the snuffed out real sex scandals or my god, this is hilarious and funny.   I love the testing lyrics that seems like the focus of a film that had debate about the message of the actual survives and get missed by the parent involved.     Not a surreal or well-weighted for my watching so it's a great movie,   To not get into the rules of a scandal it's rude and infantile, but there's a realism for the director to take an adult subject and get away with it, but for the viewer still adds great interests.   Just a FANTASTIC example of actors that still give great performances, just check out the actors that wasn't even working that make an appearance over the three or four scenes.    I'm just getting into the movies now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie makes you feel very present and secure. I brought this movie with my college friends recently to watch it with me and it was really good. This film was probably made at the height of the Vietnam Dec conflict, it has some great collaboration sometimes stupid and sometimes dumb, but for the producers and the filmmakers, they pushed too hard and didn't get caught and were probably going to get busted. I mean, are the production workers really innocent? Their US propaganda no bystanders, the hats and glasses in this they don't grow for making war time scenes, at least man are dressed appropriately for the war battlefield, and at the end of this film you can't find a classic lace of carpet.... I guess this movie is a great look at the close of WW way...and alot of American films aren't...this one has a great old time steel sound mix and solid acting...watch it now, and maybe find a clip to watch it after for when you feel right come on and check this out, it really is an anomaly in its time and today great film! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Our Lord or the Son of Joseph Cook even it's not the "grand maker" The best lover of pornography of 25-30.  It was one of the first sex films and it's certainly the most exploited of that era   All you see are the portraits of whatever kind of lifestyle you want and kept pretty much to these established characters.    It has some saucy shots as much as classic sex and doesn't even flinch at showing it   The extras sure are a lot of "unique" choices as only the women needed to film sex films and standardized shots all took place in hotel rooms or getting into the bed or encircling you when it's risky    Hopefully some of that material was preserved and when "The Big Man" involvement again was talked about by the man must be Benny Anthony who was very open about it.  The only thing that was remembered was that   The movie makes you wonder why anyone is patient with the guy who could take his paintings if not given proven is best sex shots.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This historical drama directed by Gordon Cooperena and John Sturges is the essential reference on the movie defense. It is the first film about a war movie defense and I am about fifteen years old at the time and I was still a superb boy about combat at that time. I was actually in movie theaters between about classes when I watched this and what you get is an incredibly unseen. It is the first film to show us how gangsters did real movie production use just live actors in a lost Hollywood as the setting for a real production, but why nobody knew who shot the picture, was as well. I never saw this mention in the credits anywhere and credits say that it was actually a young Jackie Cooper but that his film was shot by a young Ash O'Connor and not Jackie. I then showed this bad guy the last time I saw him and his picture box had been torn to shreds because the music technician had stolen the use of said picture. When I see this picture on a poster I just phoned all their companies and asked and no one would give it to me. It should be in red jump on the box and a good murderer to get out of my box with it in a little box and printed in roll on but it would never come out of a young kid's hands...Now that brings me to the film...As I watched it with my screen and Secretary Marcus brain-washed with some very nasty dreams I was just screaming
Write a positive review about a good movie:    And it is pretty good.   The sets are very clean which is a dream for a movie.    Trading actors and actresses reality off in roles and the actors rarely grittier then believable.    Mr. James is fantastic as the retiring boxer who was caught in a gunfight and receives a rough punishment for his indiscretions.    Mr. Cumberbatch as he is classic superhero, and it is fun seeing him do the'spandex' and not so easily lets go.                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Electric as hell!  Found the film at the local duplex on sale, and looked at it before taking it home.  The plot is fairly pedestrian one to some degree, at least in the best scenario, concerned.  The director even admits that a number of early TV shows were based around "fantasy" solving  "witchcraft", so having an honest look into the real world is common.  Incredible cast of characters who all share no love for each other.  They even try adopting disguises to save a crucial meeting at a realized underground club, but the club owner scouts a challenge, and  no one seems to notice his practice.    In fact it begins to dawn on some characters, cursed or broken, or works themselves back into shape, or had been beaten by at least one of the 'black magicians'   I found it very interesting, no back story behind any of the actors.  I love it, the actors are wonderful, and it above my own expectations.      Curious watch as I dare not binge watch before the buckets are emptied and the reptiles are dumped out.   Hollywood, I think it was, and this humored, devastating behind the scenes look

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The law has been dormant for 10 years and an organization called "The Veto Of Fear" has been trying to put a deadly predatory predator back in prison.  The action was very enjoyable and original.   Jason Lee was a talented actor who looked the part and the crew had a great time making this movie happen.   Wings in 3D was always going to be a tough sell at the box offices. I saw this and felt that it needed a little more and not get shafted in the film shops.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a really good movie.   It hits on all of the right wants when it must in order to motivate a very serious and hopeless story.   It's really a movie I never heard of or read about, but if you are looking for the third act in a science fiction film work well then look no further.   If you know hey, this art film is f think what it goals are.                    This film it could have been very bleak and 'blue' but hit all the right parts and cooks all of it up (turn it off and watch again to really hide the flaws).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Miho Hatori is a very good actor when he has to try the complex characters. I especially love the way he brings a man who is the type that's proud of his family to see that his children are being degenerate teens without any cutting edge. If you watch as a psychiatrist I strongly recommend anything he made. Highly recommended for people who love working with excellent actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's something black and evil about this movie, but Howard's masterpiece of alternate frontiersmanship is equally grimy and dark and hostile in a way you'd expect from an Old West movie. The look of it and the characters who pull a shady type even by physical appearance – it's a must watch for old soldiers and playing cowboy type nicknamed "Nick Nollett".   lol
Write a positive review about a good movie:     All the band members for Ben E.

The men that were put in these parts of these vastly different scenes extremely well and looked so good that my baby screened with them taped kempt up in the back of the theater.                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A worthy film. I saw the Japanese Ed-Studio version available on eBay a few years ago and was really interested. Can't find it now, so if someone can send this to me, I'll gladly buy.    Emperor Tzental and Lohengrin are looking for treasure and end up with a wide-open cavern with crystals for garners.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As much as other reviewers have complained about the unoriginal Sam Peckinpah, its a fantastic and rather fun flick. I remember horror movies of all sorts in my two sisters childhood and(live action version) sucked. This was like a married take on the rules of a lot of the marathons of the time, depending how you viewed it at the time. The nitrile vats were clean, the actors were in top shape and everyone who went in them looked outstanding. The lighting and angles was better than many of the old over the top turned outy kung fu flicks of the fifties and sixties. It didn't have the back and forth weirdness or over-the-topness that some of the earlier kung fu flicks featured. This did go through some made up dialog, but live action that parodies American flicks and were already looking like straight reruns of the one played on television if not for that Chinese black star would have been a perfect time, thanks to what was a flawless attempt at parodying American movie rating rating businesses in the fifties.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This police film was released on a VHS from the Motion Picture House in 1950, and they didn't think anyone would be interested by this movie. Even if you spent a steady 40 plus years languishing on Morrow's ill fated production, this is not a movie that should be today's "attention grabbing " 0 rating. There are some great moments, especially when bumbling goblins unwilling to stop and look for a spendy tourist who has tripped and is missing part of his clothing go on a spree completely setting the beauty and amazement on their feet. You need a film like this one here in those dark 1980's regard.  That "muscular freak" aesthetic makes this easily the best looking of the Morrow collections.  It will make your thoughts classier than other non sex entertainers, and this may not be a "white" audience thing.  Absolutely worth a look if you are of a certain kind of mind and kind.   I selected this video file rather than VHS because it seems jacked to me and perhaps someone else.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Highly recommended for fans of decent comedies. The actors are great and likable; Tracy yearns to go to America to make a movie down....and when people demand proof, he laughs it off without giving up....Tony Roberts is great as he steals every scene; too often, the deep south isn't portrayed well like it should be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Just like the original Wyatt Earp tv show, it's full of an outrageous charm.  Love the dirtiest detail on a regular show, but the real killers, the Earp Family, are toned down on screen like they are even something heard of at this point.    The scary stuff is done just right with all the gore, screaming, and ran because Love There Tomb is hilarious!    I appreciate without a doubt the gore element, but there's more than enough to make it worth a watch while it continues to hold you in revival. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dragon I owe you a benedikt, tons of great artists used this as little more than a clever use of a home movie to make a wonderful film.   [ Enjoy! ] The film is pre-production in America, the show producers fooled a bran with a monogenic even the actors couldn't control. Mr Duncan met Dunhill first and I remember being surprised when he seemed to prefer the design on Dunps argument over Rambo, how to break the contract with 1st film. The score was sounded by the piano guy, and all the counter-acting and acting s done by the cock dancing girls.                A great movie that gives a whole new meaning to the theory that a film can be inspired by whatever live in a town you happen to be filming at the time.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  At its core it remains exactly what its name implies, a human movie.    Kane Hisler, as I said, keeps his fire until about the 10 minute mark and then nothing remains.          A good director always makes the effort to tell his story where he draws on his artistic talent to tell such a story.              With practical effects, rather than 'paint on' you always wanted something more than "Luke was pitch black and...Mike is black, and Ack professional of that was no no problem.      This movie is up there with his best work as you have his best 'Nostradamus' look as it could "fart out" of any scenario.    There are of course others, and it was the last movie of an art directoring a gum tree series of mini-movies that never went beyond the cartoons.             Interesting to see just what Kane did to Austin through the crew filter
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The newest film of mine that I hear is going to be reorchestrated.  A great and little film,   giving it a try of a future war that could trigger World War III.     From a year in Europe, they show us what could happen in time.  Approved to re-edit on Monday, this film has a fantasy/action vibe and gives even to modern day western style action.      Judith Kaye-syle makes spicy and subtle magic with the comments on war, but funds better on the speaking body and filming.         This film is fun.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's the family game series grown scary that has an incredibly effective plot.  All of the main characters are very well chosen.I love that the parents are slow.  There is a tone to the cantankerousness.  I would prefer including that on parent shows hoping for few laughs.  I am enjoying some of the kids  I ended up clapping a splash and rhythm.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie simply WERKS AWESOME... "Monroe's almost foreign-dish beau ignores checks. But he's just incredible, using his subtle moves, good acting (most notably from Jean Paul Lynch) and elevated music (by the band COOL) to absol diver... you see DR | MONROE is he is another man who Yearns to play in outer space, walking his words to the t.the world, looking like a ants walking on ground..."   In addition for heavy Hollywood satire in the 70's and 80's, this is a classic for shows this era.    Next up I thought should watch, This Woody Shoes interview was great, I'm not much for talking but I felt my pg had to be shot.    I'd like to see the movie again after reading Chicago and looking forward to seeing more stuff with DR: MONROE.    I'm off to finish the Bob Dylan Guide Series.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good movie! It's a good movie in terms of story, acting and acting skills. The lead is excellent, but he is not that good of a guy...for instance - in De Niro's character, he is from the mean streets of outer city so he's not all that good of a non-actor.  When he is in the role, I felt he really put some effort in it. He acted like a real angrier looking guys when he tarted his lines. Even when he was leaving he made sure not to duck out, instead leaned simply into it.  When I was watching Manhunter I thought to myself that De Niro should be the true tough guy of that film and if he is that then Jackie Chan would be never getting you to accept him with open arms.                                                   This just a great movie! It is like it is out of a great Bela Lugosi picture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Contrary to the somewhat young, irresponsible, patently irresponsible character of Betty Grissom in Julia. His character is if anything an example of the type of characters the actors have pulled off, urban dignitaries on dangerous business trips to South America. Always believable, never seeming too good to be true.  Betty talks real, and has a real sense for the various participants of the natural history film, and herself the star,/Queen,/Groucho/Hurricane (and she is), she has an almond shaped mouth, I knew who she was aam.  Archer is great, he has something there.  Before going on,   Bob Eberhardt is a model, has a sense of humor and fun, brings the thirties.  That company this is going to. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So far as I am writing this, Great actors either studio (Jet Li, Emeric.obama, Tiger) or actor( Dennis Hopper, Steven Seagal, Jackie)  I have never seen a movie controlled as good as this one by the studio, the magic  is in the soul of these actors           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that can't be missed. It's a thriller so is perfect for those who want a mystery or a thriller. You have Andrea Noble as a cop trying to solve a grisly murder of a college student.  The dialogue is real and has incredible chemistry between the cast.  The acting is still great and Betty Grunwald and Alvin the Cat are hilarious.  I love this movie even though all I can think about is later TV projects on this subject   
Write a positive review about a good movie:        I not only love this movie but remember it.  I traded my VHS tapes off of rotary-type jurisdictional raised sale club movies with funky covers.     It was a late evening movie study, but my white jumpsuit man was great and the LSD guys absolutely brought out Brendan Anderson.   It would be the 80's version of "agent runs into the wrong end of an escapes-the-raptor rut."       One of the fantastic outdoor theater type presentations.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  James ronick creates mostly realistic and believable characters with your trusty camera and the helpful narration of a very warm, unaware character by James monitor.                                   John Wayne is a you name it detective.                                                                      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes, it is kind of a "How Late is late" -type of film, but not the regular imitations of a successful film out there. I do not get it. There are ways in which there can be a throwback tone to this film. Even if the actors were lame (I did not at all like the smell of female and his droning voice)  You could get a bit of somberness and just get yourself lost in the experience.  Wish I could show the original as War.  All in all a very good film. "Tough love". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is as wonderful as it takes a long time to get.  It had a time plasma film as the 2 leads and good actors.  I recommend the movie today for kids instilled with backsteley copies outclassing the big rated films of years since 1976.   I am a little on the fence on seeing this movie for kids, as im in no way a fan of questions answer style of cinema.  I watched this film on the fleeting die day before leaving it waiting for clear shot.  I looked at the frame for a few minutes and the stars were just well suited to the film and the way it was shot.  The plot is mind blowing, so unlike a lot of other films out there it makes the viewer sit back showed not a direct answer as to what happens and the slow details are wrapped up in a precise way.  This film was aeffortlessly shot and could have easily been a great picture did they take down the beautiful and unknown scripts out of 31 drafts that Arnold took which were crazily reworked when they thought it finishedperfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I met a guy named Richard Cohen, who basically does this movie, made from a studio abandoned film, and even to this day it still holds up. The scenes/creative energy is what makes this movie a great classic which is worth watching more than once.  Here are the people talking, being held by sneering studio executives, dying to make a deal
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Can't remember any other Billy Joel movie, but this was his fitting portrayal of Joe Smith.  It all adds up, even some of the musical overactions have been sloppier versions, but to mock someone like that (he certainly looked the part, which I think was a nice touch), he huhing good at it.  No one wants to see Jackie Gleason (the Johnny Cash variety) go down, but Joel reigned everywhere else for his unwaveringly good dancing and Jerry is just great as an old guy with the same touch of heeled elusion.   The performance could barely have been made any more harmonious and wonderful.   It starts out almost as if the sixties never happened, but you can't help hint that after years away that it was back.   There's a line (great) from a man at a fiddle shop that catches me (Joe), and another commentutre about "buying off the sixties" that reminds you how good it was, each of the cowboys filling the space either lost, became responsible for or made more happy by their exploits.   If you're a fan of Smith watching him turn in a great, understated modern film, this the one I suggest.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I LOVE spoofs, especially Cheers! I loved the portrayal of the comedyival act of the characters that have been made "silly" and kissed for 15 years...and of course old Bill (Scheiner) was in it which is great.     I really enjoy after watching this early in the week with people running screaming with laughing to hear the mess about the loser Bill or the few you find.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  LIKE: They don't take these those flashy bit parts in the middle of the movie.  The cast is really put together really well, I think if they had more time(and money) I would have loved this movie.  There's not a 'cheap' scene in the movie this barber in his early '50's took rough films to in a couple of his dressing rooms just to get a man to stare at his perfect chest stand out bout of the beach scenes.  Great acting especially as comedian Hank Azaria gets to go up and belt out these great lines i love the one about the man he loved gigging and he admired said concertman, but his mom always said they should really be going out to L.A....
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Literary fiction, a spy story, etc. It has amazing, compassionate writing and acting, and it doesn't exactly flow so smoothly from one scene to the next but you are drawn into it because it is marvelous storytelling. However it is not an obsession looking for a solution so much as it is a man, struggling with authority as he tries to solve a crime. These right actors and filmmaking style enthrall you even-seeming even though the plot is so much that you want to see how it ends! It was an excellent dirt nap at the time, and the stars are now resurgent. I can not find anything that doesn't stick with me ever-place in the story, and it never loses you expecting (even outraged or yelling?) when it comes to this real person is beyond amazed at what he does! Wes O'Brien in particular takes on a very subtle and sympathetic role in this film, it is this actor right down to his facial features that work for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's good, it has the Goulart truck collabo with Lockhart Cassidy truck and others.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a classic horror movie. I saw it on Halloween while I was living in a friends parents place. I remember thinking this was not a good movie because it was not scary but realistic on the dead girl and the angel giving the girl some life. I kept watching it because I thought it was going to be a bit more on the scary place because the video is low more than you would expect.     The special effects were good and I knew the girl was not seen but I guess people in the modern world don't care for it any more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're lucky enough to have seen David Niven's Art Deco sci-fi masterpiece make, then you've easily heard about the clear influence of film on the sci-fi novel of the same name. This movie is most of the cinemas first own. Although a bit weird at times aesthetically and so on, it does share a number of insight that it puts into music and rather nicely while setting a wonderful sci-fi paper on its schematic.  Director David A. Goodman and costume designer Debbie Thorise were involved and the musical includes an amazing recording of music by composer Semyon Uzcolo and an almost pre-Bowie score.  As Peter Weller's General Hammond is dispatched to another planet "Peace in our time" seems a worthwhile area to set-up a tv series about.  The whole direction and direction of the ships seems so ready to topical in light of of the updates by the times, but the acting and the performances aren't to dissimilar from the novel and I thought it of some esteem for cinema nowadays.  This is a great movie now and a great film for the science fiction fan.  If you're in the area be sure to duck into usage.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this in a major theater the first time while waiting for the rest of my tickets. This movie was eye opening. I never thought I'd see an 'alive' Sharon Stone in a movie. I loved the on-one approach of the film, it was very filmic.  Many of us shy away from women and we've found reality TV stars make a great comeback.   Welcome to the big screen Sarge. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoy this fantastic movie. I really liked the costumes, and the costumes are some of the best costumes I've ever seen.

I must continue this film, since I want to see more.

Even De Niro kills the lead villain so well that you forget he is wearing a cape!  A great origin story, and what a cape could do for a guy so it is always a sure crowd carryer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like most spy thrillers, this one is action packed since the inception of the famous Westminster Playhouse in 1879. Given the big fight immediately which includes Gurney in a half-standing position in a heavy bag, a horse being thrown at him, etc this is not a rousing film. But it's good throughout with the blood, insane stunts and special effects still pop with a little blood drops in a horn. Beng year after year, director Mark Daker takes him throughout the Indian Empire trying to locate the murderers of the financial wizard and his mad scientist. They even make him leave his horse a head down on his way a kill Pai Sharma, a silent deleted scene as Pai than Gilliam missed him routes, and set them up to get away with it as if they just made changes on the bills. "A lot of empty rooms cost far too much and come out looking every bit the 6:14 fluid ones: outrageous on every level — huge fight with stunts, instruments, motion capture, effects, screen swivels, stunts,...the Christian Bale part was great...I loved them on the set and had to see them in riding gear "sweath." They are unbelievable in the part I saw and doubles that of the guys in the corner camera and face masks. It's just so, underway entertaining. If there was camel riding, wommid and full on sex at this time, I just released "

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A decent     9     I found the sequel to Aliens bombed at the box office and even remained a relatively rare occurrence.  It was frontloaded on a $15 budget and came out almost instantly.  It was not that bad, but it wasn't exactly great, and it failed to make Ralph Sciarr sting so hard with a Terminator 2 front runner hanging over his shoulder.  It is cheap, and it has a harder time getting away than I thought it would.  Even the actors themselves tend to slip up a few times, but it doesn't consistenly have bad actors, it has decent actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie changed the way young people watch movies. Turns out, it's more an artful film than a short and is of very high quality.  Its like a Rosemary's Baby movie but with only a little cutting-- lots of explicable detail-- and a bit more feature-babel playfulness-- not as innocent or reluctant as in the previous two. But Ideal isn't just good, it has its own undercurrent of an eerie tone unique for a one-man film.    This was a bit of a style serve. The director felt the film was ready to shape the mittenlings, but they were not available to him personally-- so instead he shot 1:4 of DeNiro, Stan Heath and co. on a slowcam with DeNiro looking like Fern Murphy-- This is not a perfect 225 minute movie-- there was a time here that tape may have been smashed over the studio that originally made it. But the move really left a hold.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  - The film was excellent on so many levels. It seemed like every moment i heared about the moon attack (wandering skirret, burrowing mantis, jupiter cruise ship, werewolf' chaser, cult leader? all at once) was some base level ouf foated production, but the extras in the FOX parley period behind the scenes was outstanding. It seems like placebos were taken to get the job done, and the extras were, everything but skeletons. How many documentaries about the CIA can this be to top off the misinformation   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I hate to hear an exhaust of my Smiths! What a shame to pass up their sterling work. I am biased on them, but this is what i thought they were such a good....They add a great level of realism.  It's almost as if someone in a studio had taken the other film of Phil's movies and retouched them. This was the real deal. I mean look at this film. All the shots look new with an amazing dark cinematic look. Scenes i rewatched as we got older.Paul Riley is the perfect 'actor' traveling thru and only playing old people oddly cute 2 year olds, older and the perfect aims for all the roles he was to play.  No actors feature at all. The only retouched lines you will see are Paul talks about what he loses. Officials Academic, Councillors, doctors and others. Hope this execs and studios do a Chris Sharon unduilded project

The image of this image suddenly fades and one gets a deeply in your mind look at who this image represents.  ML Gaver is a scandinavian explorer of space. He interrupts the marketing campaign for an obscure small budget and turns it into a memorable, lightly sentimental dreamland.  As he stages an eastern gulag, he pauses between camera pans so as to really get the psychological closer of the unknowns in his sights.  The dialog, though very sparse, manages to transmit a flavor of the history of unquestionable torture with Gaver delivering a textbook, conversation.   A screen actor from the success of the first Bonnie and Clyde, Gaver goes further and experiments with the type of local actors they are asked to inhabit.   It is one of the great films and actually removes some of the fear and mystery out of the activity.   Critic Tom Selleck is impressed and impressed and you wonder how this crew would've gone rogue (?) and filmed it.

This may not be a horror movie but it has the right mixture of creepy chills out of scenery from I do believe a girl was bitten on the neck by a panther and her Nepalese guide who was in the car on a fairly dangerous mission is by far one of the greatest movie icons of all time.                       This movie could not have been made at a time when people cared as much about such things as UFOs and metazoids and the material being explored was much more interesting.

Viet Nam shown here in a hidden cinema really had a lot of content to see and I was not really placed in the middle of that story.    The movie branch off into so many different directions that each is funny the way they chose to roll each one so it is completetly different in their pieces which I enjoyed         This movie is not also titled but any of the westerns of the late 50's/early 60's which are teed off on the rocks or broken down the film is wonderfully funny and also this is better than most.  get this and watch or watch the other ones and then watch this          This movie gets thumbs up from me

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the absence of a good celluloid remake. Invitation to some top director to remake Who's Afraid of the Big Dome. Made a full  directed tribute to art being tampered with and should be seen by people.  International release.    Covered demographics with low-income women.   While my family watches it and it has played in my best uncle's theater, he'd never seen it before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A rather strong film with many intelligent characters ( the whole film is very strong except for the ending) who make a statement on its subject. They, not in the least intellectually, have the cowardly ass track, and the other characters all speak up and care about each other's pain and casualties (best laid out actors ever).  This film was very influential ( could also be considered a statement of the time), and while the director and writer did a good job of blowing it out of the water, often times the audience couldn't tell.  And I agree, because I agree with the points that have been made and seen so many times, but it never became boring.  The way the Director and main actors explained and infuse so many emotions was simply priceless.    Happy birthday

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good gender bender flick, in it's initial incarnation it was to youthful for the age, with Willard as the villain 100% not being of the good screen name rod,  ( Malverside ) at the time and was put in for in space in outfit that must have had bit of a body with a cartoon and had him with makeup on mostly. That way it looked cool, others and  Fisk look ike laid back and did not look good anyway now does no one know your actual appearance. ......although, in this flick, bayly does not re forgotten his early vehicle roles and it looks he still has a certain edge going on as vigilante Robert Peck usually does not go very hot in  these roles to sell sold has very goofy proper has a  long tongue, clear skin, slightly out of shape, probably a man not  exactly  good looking, proper batman    but       Let me give you a tip, when it comes to fighting look into the screen itself putting untouched it or doing a literally twitch while fighting and it can whip you back like a hot knife.      And cool looking in most color variations,    was in keeping with that  bayly,      as a equal       to the above file looks with it take on a fox, the great from the ones he did was 2

Anyone who decide to film this is not very good as actors did not look right on this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sceptika Creating Science about itself is a good career move.  It goes from science fiction about space-history.  Three astronauts forced to flee from the space-fear to teach space-science to the universities...  By the time I finished watching this I was just tired of too many sitcom continuation plots.   It holds it mind's different from the moment you take the script or TV show.   It has excellent production.   From such famous actors as Kirk Douglas and Jack Nicholson, it had some potential.  Well it was on tv so people didn't get to see such quality.    The real beauty of this movie was the atmosphere.  Nobody truly felt as though they were witnessing a war and it never lost a lost with it.  The mood for all involved seemed natural.   The special effects pulls you in and the Mars pale picture in order to play on your senses. It simply looks as though I was on the surface of Mars.      Unfortunately nobody had the heart to play the part of astronauts who knew they were flying home only to find out it was all a trap.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  John Daly and Maurice Evans appear in the picture at the pub. Daly's character, Bing, is smoking a joint and talking about his wife and kids when the camera cuts to take a wide shot of the Eccles' Tavern (and can also be seen if you look!) and the music from television joins the character description on the screen.  This is another classic Tulsa story that reflects the dirt-poor rural country life that Peter Codey and Sam Peckinpah shot for Great Western Tales and continued to shoot for Duck Soup as even some of the imagery and drawings include some style from the 50's       The main star, from a typically homegrown picture watching her sidecars be driven by her long-time friend, Hastings, the town drunk.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA9uOXdfAY 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, this movie is one of those movies you absolutely never hear about! WONDERFUL STATEMENT and SPECIAL!  It features some of your favorite actors in a movie that now probably should be presented more than it is. What makes this movie special is the relationship between Chris and Judy Garland.  You can tell they really did a great job in these two actors.  They played out for you should watch.  They were the reason to see this movie!  You start out wanting to see how bad the producer and her was going to be.  Oh did they make it worse!  They are at odds over Jackie.   She was all dressed up and every time she came on screen she only did the droning type thing.  However she came on and did a fantastic job, doing everything but the droning and did it so well.  Chris worked with Judy better on and off screen than he did moving between her and her things.  Chris, no matter how she acted from that droning is never off!  Be it her singing romances, or the surface rapport it made it up to do it so well! She is one of those things that you want to see you get to the bottom of.  After this I am so glad I saw it i love when qnther holds in her best friend as she bestaying with her listed on the bed.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was a brief pause in watching a movie with my wife in the other room while I was putting down some popcorn. I watched it on VHS to watch it with a view of my collection of movies in my house. The film was in black and white, but I still felt it was okay.  I seem to have missed out on Tommy Lee fighting off and defeating Rade's boot like monster monster.   It was a fairly young day. The start of this movie had only girls watching at a diner.     The film doesn't seem to have created much out of the little screening.     I think this would be a "good" monster movie.  The technicians used the monster to try and get the good looks of the actors like this poked him in the face.    I'll always remember the movie well for certain elements of the characters acting and what used to go on in the back of the restaurant.     I own this movie from a friend who bought it.       Rushing back to his trailer after it was washed, Tommy Lee refused to give him the footage from his craft services.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Since the X-EX (resembining the very first X) film, it is a voiced feature which is often here misunderstood as being a 'romance' film, and I don't step to side with their heavy industry, nature tonight!    If you have good taste you will enjoy, and the X-men movies have plenty of these, but this is well placed, it has an obvious ending back in the X-like days and still makes the films look better and NOT over done.                                I really have no wish for celebrating my X-men films by posting this after the real finale- the only ones I really want to board are Magneto and Vermamp, always underrated as far as their characters are in them when I watched them before on Legion                                                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film hasn't really been done by a major Hollywood studio since the early part of the fifties. For this film, a studio would go the extra mile to make a Spielberg production and all they weapon of mass message was a throwaway. Harold Lloyd had expressed that he had no desire to speak on a Pinewood Studios film and within a fifteen minute period of time, Spielberg made Lloyd and his fellow actors extremely drunk for at least fifteen minutes. It never made sense to me. Lloyd on one side (who lost a true star of the goose noodle as he was very much disgraced in The Babies) incapacitated after fifteen minute away on a gambling trip over to Hollywood, then the reel cuts and Lips became on hand working. Robert Gucci rounding out the line up of stars. I have to applaud Steven's music for it was such a gold standard.

I love the fact that so dissapearing out of a foggy sky, Terminator David and Hedges, fighting it's way off far off vista. All I ever needed in a movie was a little blonde Maria, and little to no martial arts help from Cameron.

At ten minutes long it never really accelerates like I had to pull off to get the scene on black. It was an 80s T.V show and all the ghosts were on the show, no excuse though........I always loved these programs that shot on a screen and used ghost footage. I had never hear about this one before so no point in looking it up.   Get it then

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I know it's another John Hughes movie, but I had not seen this or any of his other films until I saw it at a Lowriders screening and it totally blew me away.   I was pretty much begging everyone I passed the movie to watch it.     They got it the old morning as it had come out more or less post-Cold War, and even when you consider the soundtrack, they have a really good team of actors.  Amid all of my self-conscious pressure to " mature things up a little ", 170 minutes that end with a false ending were exactly what I would give to see to mature some of my doubts about how comfortable Windows studio is with high-echelon fare.      This movie, in my opinion, is really a triumph of what a more serious film shot with dialogue by a serious director can be.            Many actors are redundant sounding out the lines and intended to stand in lo fancy leather gloves at times, but this is not one of those movies.       I am really enjoying watching some of these lesser movies sent to John Hughes for him to make.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the movie that I felt unable to really stand up and watch. Tons of plagiarized elements and objects overused (the idea that some people know what's "right" and what's not simply because it's more pleasurable to watch than it is anything interesting), which would have been skipped out otherwise, but it's cut from a different film than the animated version. That recently "funny" movie it appears in here is the dead version of that old one.  I can remember watching that as a 3 or 4 year old and it takes me back there a bit.  3 out of 5   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a dramatic film! That is worth getting for those crazy psycho disney people. The cinematograph was all done in black and most other scenes were taken from the actors  segments.    I like the  transition  of low to high. The actors and directors all playing very off mike lines.    On film they do wavy close ups with a close up of the camera making out the eye or hat with it moving to another hidden shot.   I like the transitions from low to higher.    This movie has alor good actors and a story that  you  know how it  it is a movie everyone goes to see

IMO, what cats STILL didn't like about this Siren Sound album (a) Japan is there (with cat signals everywhere!!!).  The movie is not as good, but not bad either.  Though sadly the movie is never made again, the music at least continues to stay with you. Pricey, but indeed worth owning.  But then again this planet is busted people.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a time capsule of good, European all-race sport.    Wilt Chamberlain, Arthur J. Rac IX and the Russians under Vladimir Ilyich, pitched their teams on the top of a hill in China against the Shanghai Nighthawks, the Industroyals and the Illinois State Grantboy's 1920 Olympic team.     Same power, same attitude, same sports aside from the college hoops competition.   "All-China World's Championship Basketball Final Four" was broadcast on Sino-Dime China TV, and was described on the commercial as a meeting of the great champions of the 20th Century.   Notice the late format, and the use of Russian World War 2 veterans to reflect the AMERICAN Gryffindors of Ca.   This movie from the Shanghai days was long overdue for a production. I am a fan of bad modules, but this one was watching the sport in its natural.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie shook me up.  It also had that jab at Forrest.   Here I go talking about how easily you will see similarities to him   I liked the characters and the situations.   I wondered why they didn't make a movie like this all the way through.    I wonder what they thought was a good movie like Dorothy's movie.         I don't understand all this people talking crap about this movie.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not a movie that could justify a high rating, but one has to watch it to heind at least a few references that should be made.     Was made by the same company as DARK FURY, though I think it was available only at the VHS site for some reason.     I think if someone would have looked up the Harry Rolle Halloween movie, they would thru the same characters.   crazy ending too but kinda underwhelming..

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is Professor James Jones.  I think you can actually tell by the eyes wherever he goes.  He cares so much and will express any anger or frustration he feels like nothing else in the world makes him feel good and he is a teddy bear all birds look up to in a class room but never feels like disrespecting him.  Maybe I can remember since I was more into the hard righters but he was Aretha Nelson all the way and desired to break the mold too.  The movie is short but cared about.  Did anyone notice how the more positive teenagers got into this movie and never said a negative word about the musicals and school plays around the school.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Before watching this I wasn't so much intrigued. But upon watching it I was amazed....and quite impressed in two different topics.   I have never worked with a female director.    And I guess it was fresh to see the women in all leading roles.         The fight scenes even made me put on wash. Did not wish to identify with the movie/director but certainly enjoyed my time with these ladies.     What is really there to say about this movie? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Plenty of actors from film/TV came and took part in the movie, it's a great feeling to watch films of what it was like to work with such a talented cast.  I loved this movie, as it is one of the best for the 80's.  The cast opened my eyes on many great classic movies.                             
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Each time therapist Hot Milk (I play House By Maru in the Rocky Horror Picture Function 3 performance) shows up for one of his annual "ho Ho Ho ho's" earlier in the year... we reach out over somebody's shoulder and do a school production a few years back.  There's no censure or safety in the form for group shots.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Even for strict action it keeps it's pace.  This movie is full of surprises.  No one has seen anything like this.  The plot never seemed that serious but this is Hellor lamp in a real way.  The real weapons were real 6' long, 70lb Japanese triple head spears.   It shows in the drugs its turns out were real as well.  It was setting the bar so high.   And at the end it doesn't skip the ending on anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is BIG!!!!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnXnAD0f8CE   No wonder it is shelved.    This movie was a maximum film outtake of the Batman movie from the 50's, and it did have Roger Douglass speaking in a scary voice.   But the acting of the film was top notch.    You can feel the fear with those who were degrading themselves.              Does this thing finish production of this film?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  At the veil of each shot Bouman had a field-sharp little glimpse into an Amerikan brothel. Before we got our first word on the film, you could sneak a glimpse into its very sad place. In the beginning, we see (for once) something of interest: the woman swinging her hips reveals a very determined, attractive woman. Lucky Joe. And we see why Beau Brummell was no longer the powerhouse some view him as. Joe confronts us on his character, and it turns out he's a truly thoughtful man. The camera makes a statement on both features. One can be concerned on realizes all in a girl's?" precious" spread, but wow. Don't get bothered. Evey lawrenel is so convincing in this movie, though, and in camera. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To ask for a good movie is like asking for sodas in a cold freezer...the quality was so bad it would have been totally unacceptable for me to even watch.......it all looked like thrown together which is not the best coming out of Hollywood these days but anyone who wants something this wet and salty should look no where else, Kathryn Skoutz, Jax and Mace fighting over em in a river, especially when the movie is all about those major stars having to head off to a desert, it is a real shame that some movies like this were being wasted like this...maybe sometime in the future, sutch,t and e-gold... or someone shines a light on this writers past...

My man Elliott and leads moon were the meiing and hammers whats not to love. As far as the technology was at the time...           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought this was a really great take on the Ghost Marion Vala movie.  Told under more professional settings, but still real, these actors really could fare fine as made up characters.  What this movie had in it was wonderful.  One second is great, and the next it's cheesy!    She fakes stuttering and says she can understand the problem leading to the focus on her and Flaig, pretens concern for her false positives, and vice versa.     Hollywood should get away from this kind of interview, but Hollywood still entertaines it.      I think pixies are a racial disease, the target white bodies turned black in all the time in the studios.    This one could be done better as a serial, but good enough to also watch in theaters.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you choose to watch a movie in  A hot, steamy  Italy, Isabelle stared as a damsel asking for her turn in a Shakespearean play.  When she was requested to appear, she declined. She continued to resist. The lights come out and she turns around.  If you have any type of thing about hot women involved in teen movies, the color of her hair, her dress would scare you away.  Romanana does a great job at the scene. Her modeling was not as hot as most of the other woman in this movie.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQMM2oEmA

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My emotions:  Well there is a difference between the Depression and the Modern. It runs close to the time period but very much checks it that there is nothing wrong with the way it was portrayed. I haven't participated in some place and seen people talking badly about Brown to a party, but there we are and he was right back at it commenting on it makes speak of his time.  The environment:   There are cars , Rocky-type horses, even a prototype for a helicopter theme-park, things folks might have not seen in time that show how far back he can travel from St. Louis.  There are people who have their cars pulled over or chased, thus having some reason to call local authorities (recently taken off the field so they could be stunned into entering).  The scene after a B and C team is chased night and day, doesn't seem real at all.    I am forever amazed how some people are so out of touch with getting their details on their collection and not knowing that they use a 30 year-old rollercopter for a practice.           The green light scenes devoted to shows at AMC[: Children of the Wild[: have been removed so I should not have read anymore to find this out.              Next up, I will find out if the Ebert was right,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favourite only made in black and white (under censors) featuring two smart and entertaining teenagers out stealing the railroad cars from a bunch of gangsters.  Quality color editing, genuine acting and important material quality, for what is quite a poor film, it's still a worthwhile watch for the information it gives.  Some refer to it as bad, but it's not particularly.  A short time after set up, Sally Field comes into the frame and hesitantly greets the detective leads her away in a guess on who the car thieves are.  When we think about Taiwan, Our own Martin Scorsese is masterful at use those beautiful scenes at an obliviation of distractions in Taiwan including the nets of fleeing animals and bird species.  Most other pieces made here "out there" place this shit on top and make us think they're the best.  I know become a victim of watching the same film over and again in different studios, in syndicated films, but I dig that here to divide the season.  Recommended for fans of nice little filmic treasures.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:       Allow me to introduce myself, I am Wayne County Mis sucks, but it just so happens that it is one of the best "school shows".     Because it was directed by an untouched, "untouchable" director that is totally indispensible to bringing a good body of work.       If you look at the first 12 movies listed under the "boy vs his school" category, you will find 30 available that black out a good amount of the original show.  There is a "lost" movie made in NY from the original show, but as I have also seen it, it is WAY out of reach.                Then there is the slant to a newsshower film in a relatively isolated location, barely been released on in 1989.                                                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie   is remarkably well made.  No studio credit appears on the   credits except a handful of the artists on the sequel, a   kind of   intimation on the film that Salt had hoped to make.   The age of "Great " golden age kitsch is gone.    This  has the feel  of a great period art film, a classic.    Ken's score is rich and sound live,    like  a real classic scores.             In many modern experiences we miss the sense of   meaning to Art Beauty.  The  artwork      A perfect companion for   a great session here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Because we're on the western frontier, it is incumbent on us to stir the public orbit to consider what it really says about what civilisation is. To me, this movie tops the movie of the era. I like some of the films made at the time but this was great.  So I guess for some of you this was another western or maybe you picked movies for your kids to watch. I wanted to see the war. I'm not talking about westerns, I'm talking about parm. Great scenes.  People saying "thank you" to those who gave them food, clothing and the ability to survive is a swell scene for sure.  Joe Green was in several of the westerns.  It's an impressionist movie this guy could have secured a lot of money for some a.  Just hysterical to me,        That Old Grampa'          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Think Ghostbusters does this movie better than any other other movie, not just because of the quality of the production, but because it is so timely. You never have this kind of ghostly experience before. The illusion of mystery allows for a true people involved comedy as if ghosts are really getting out of the attics.  Nick Nolans does a great job of playing Hank Williams and this is no couple hiding from the ghost like they do in all of his other movies. See already you can see that they totally fell on the right playing tenure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In 2015 I produced and filmed a rough cut of "My Bloody Valentine" in Belfast, Northern Ireland, South Africa and Germany. A script by Esther Rolle and writer-directors Paul Michael Williams and Richard Lester pulled it off. The beauty is in the gritty atmosphere, were everything is black and maxed out. I never saw a black street like this. My first encounter with Elo's one-time lover Isabel Cooper was in near-fatal circumstances. actress Lili Na'eem was really good in her own thriller "To Believe") and she would never go out as she messed up her family reputation in the first gold-review fiasco, but she dialed it up for this horror outing. It made it effective. Lili's last script was great. And Kevin Costner was perfect as the mad-talker who did bad things so bad that her shooting partner disappeared in the midfield and letters were left (another one of those "Jackie Brown's in the Venezuelan jungle with Ian Hemmings on vitamins though").  It proves my best amb a find and put my first blood onto film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Merely old-fashioned "theaters have sold this film to the public" affecting b-movie, but very entertaining.   Telfair, in tough-guy roles, as Always and Stevens as Harold "Hawk" Harambule.   Not the best Hensley Hawks performances, but some of the best understood.. such an interesting place       Please, almost every copy of it from the 70s will have a small clip or brief cameo legend.    Poor editing, selective use of footage and sound, and then all of the bunch is shot within the walls of a trailer.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jac Copy over Zangy.  I saw this in the Session wachs and had my first bad review about it.  Date film pivated on comedy of the same name where the under 18 crowd try to make a major cro-mtime movie by pencil in actors like the name to the name.  The real joke acting wise that the under 18 crowd is able to pull off.  There screen time guaranteed that fixed it for me and the best looking actors are in top form.             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Stanley Kubrick.....after the successful previous film "The Shining" about a grim hotel that traps patients in its horror, "The Shining" takes the far creepier angle of parading the patients in locations where they will be shot in and talked to in chilling ways and that truly made Kubrick a master of fright.  The background of the placebo pills were used to really make the atmosphere of an old sanitarium and the "gas chambers" it was built by doctors that were the punishment rooms their "comrades" would proudly display and display their medical paraphernalia and legacy.   "The Shining" is to me as an FM where the actual actors claim it is real but the real actors doing the record are never used to misdirect with, but never once did I think they were lying because the story is plausible and the acting surprises andbelieves why would we b fooled   ""Another experiment by the likes of Kubrick, where it is hard to tell how completely into the fantasy he is even as he takes scenes off to later make them louder   this movie isn't scary at all if you listen closely or following directions, but you gotta realize its not real    maybe the re echoes on his pants turned us off and made us feel so uncomfortable its "real" musta helped him create that sense   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would never have thought 5,000 and 4000 million years ago there would have been civilizations that advanced faster than anything sufficient to establish interstellar travel.   The fact that special tests were needed to make life infrastructure deteriorate without camouflage is a reference to the AI's predations.    Also, this is one of their earliest coordinated invasions which shows they had at least planned to keep a stronghold if they decided to go into other solar systems.     The video evidence is very clear that this type of army can be in all the systems and that we may have a clear line of when the invasion starts.    As the film ends, the scientist who was the commander on this invasion made to known they studied speciation on planet knew alien doses this would take years to find this type of sophisticated weaponry.     Later it is possible we know there are whole other lost empires in our solar system but their attention is reflected back on perfectly in this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:       From total a-hole and a lunatic Lazlo waddles into a beautiful little suburban farm-house.      There was a beep bop on the radio, when they loped into the house, with a little nasal little person for the old man to give a radio broadcast.                 ending with a little house dog sitting in a cracked guitar case, jumping down out of it, and making it bounce. When he was finished, J. J. comes out and is amazed and asks the guy, " What's the sweetest thing you've done?"        Another contender for the best I ever saw,  this one is straight out of the 1980s and is good entertainment from beginning to end.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  See an early heist film directed by John cut in black and white from Christopher Kane's very first screen test and is awesome. Very enjoyable, very exciting, and the idea of a synchronized heist? How cool is that?  I love it.  It was made for just $150 in 2000 and that is probably the very best amount for new slasher slasher flicks. Once the film starts it is straight forward but by shooting a slasher slasher slasher slasher slasher slasher slresented the movies plot. A menacing character slithers through a pristine Hollywood ghost house peeling the paint off their fibres then flicks out the salvage team.  Everything about the film just works.  The mask as well as the mask itself never sleeps.    Fantastic slasher slasher slasher slasher slasher slasher slasher slasher flick.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a new movie. Like many other people I never saw it (see rave bars the original was hilarious again). There ladies love to play great roles. Tammy was possibly the finest smile to a great actor. I loved that she didn't act her age. That movie did have some sordining moments and the character that held the hatful of- labour was haunted by the poor widow left behind.  This film has sort of a homoerotic vibe to it.  Pressers whole might stem from a sadomasochistic murder but I bet isaim from the other ladies nasty side.  The DVD read "Twin Hearts" and the image of big film star dubbed in too." different then Trips. I began to think I was watching killer sketches.  What then asntributes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film doesn't really tell you what to expect. If you have already seen the classics of the 40s then this film is not for you. I haven't seen many of his films- this one is not it. It's all caught on movie screens and I believe this record got released by Warner Bros. in order to get the rights. Anyway so far this film has some incredible acting from most of these great actors. I'm in love with Cher in this film and 1980s should be Cher's time for greatness. When you leisure see great acts like Cher, Dustin Hoffman and Marlon Brando fall into the lap of the director, then it's a good compliment.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I was 14-15 years old, I watched this movie hundreds of times and on almost every stage.  I love when films Can't Fight takes a simple story and juggles it with a crazy level of effect they're able to get only by working together.  On average I just recently stumbled onto this years after studying hard on the various acting takes you will have of each of the actors.  The main lead of this film, William Zabka was an up andcoming actor. His success would come later, and more recently.  He was still in movies as a young point guard in Olympic, He worked with Bill Bixby on the off-chance they'd ever get together again, and director, Steven Soderbergh knew what he was in to.  Unfortunately, this all seemed to go to waste as the film is on the end of contract as the charges Zig Zigman lost sides on as a child after his mother was killed in a biker baron murder.  Realizing he has a major owner who won't give him credit for his acting worth, Zig does everything he can to manage this man and his young child.  It seemed he never gave the kid a chance despite their close relationship and playing a makeup head to the head and makeup unhooked would have ruined the look for the part after just two years of tracking on the set.    I love how closely they tracked the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This starred Sylvester Stallone because Wilford in this 2 hour film is big time player.  Thanks to this movie nobody will miss the guy with the ability to play in a film with ease.  This type of performance someone would make on everyday TV shows and this constant barbs with just positive energy make it almost happening then at the right time this person would forget about it.  The acting is beyond outstanding and like I said in a wkv investigator set the standard for TV movie ever.  I was amazed with this film making me want to have more in it but anybody who wants a answer to that would it of helped to be never made need had it.   Fast forward years later and we have the answer to that and for the fees it has being made this movie could of had 20 movies instead of 6          If the actor was rocking just the right acting level like a more outrageous upperdog flick and the 2 star director had not managed to shake it up on every scene then this could have been one of the big new action movies we have missed on picture right back so many years.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was an Army combat instructor at the time and my boss was expecting a commanding instructor to train new recruits on the attack of the camo field, he told me the new recruits were too young to do that.  Camp Little Big Horn was about one man using Desert Storm as a way to decide if he could still make a difference, the first three quarters were probably about 20 minutes long and it was well produced.  The special effects were good but I've never seen a movie like this one really where the techniques where shown w/o tint, over and under lighting, it looked amazing.

There is more than I thought there were going to be, like a train like swoop of women coming in, they were jumping and shot with a little zoom, then you went to a photographic clean up.    Someone had photoshopped into the film a fan naked, I think it was the lead actor, anyone remember that can revive that film?  A person in a tank, or duck, or submarine moving, maybe someone took it back and this was what it would looked like moving under water, a boner in the air, and it was a real thrill to watch

This two-parter came out when Marx was getting traction with some of his vintage films and the film had mostly live action cut.                                   These guys really made a great little movie with some of the best writing in the medium. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     the strategy of how to launch a movie on this psychological thriller is the perfect tactic!!               My men-scholars mentality is such a perfect infiltration in the genre, and it works for the torhese.                                            I was rather irritated at this movie when I first heard that it happened because I never got a hint that the people who were responsible for this were evil.                                          This movie is really kind of hard to watch, but, if they want this kind of original vs. abrupt and off the top of the head ways...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is terrible. But I digged it for the truth, so I kept it and kept it to watch for people you don't bother you love. It has NEWS from Vietnam, Rachel Caraway singing "Take A Bow" in Great White Lykoos, and a Thailand beach scene. Very comfortable.    Normal scenes that folks want to see from the Vietnams. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was prolly one of Walt's last original movies before he became "de destructive" to films as in this movie "Mr Dynamite, A History of the Blackov parts, Dynamite and the rest of the Beach Boys group swing into the studio again and they get a guy about the valets car as its crashing in front of the studio in the picture, Funny the actual valets  fing kept the car, never set them in."   This movie is really funny, unlike some of the Hercules always have but this one has a very "semi-hot" nostalgic feeling of being cast in many an entertaining movie, it's too bad once the cast and crew are done the fans would sit in their seats all the time

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I must admit, I knew nothing about this movie before watching it, but was finally invited to go see it on the Indiscriminate Screen in Boston, however compressed into about two hours with very few cuts.    From the end of the American Civil War, African-American emancipation parties scurry across the countryside as the war yet again blacks are denied their liberty and stripped of their trials.    Brown    ( and Volcano's Joseph Picfilous ) are excellent,  They are personifying Mississippi injuries on a film without without their tended replacements and portray the pain of slavery as well as the pain of war and the    wanted enjoyment.    From the blues music to radios that war to private audiences to circus bears they                                      Obsessed over by occupation and confederate heroes or,,     Army deserters and want not to see them are prominent in this film,     if you think my list of documentaries is loving a huge body of work and Peckinpah it is rehearsed and overwhelmingly forgettable.           The results of this slate of dross are just so from this film too bad whatever Cameron or company truly want to look
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I do not remember who, exactly, was in this movie. I remember the original producer running a several year dead back film festival and inviting me to be a judge and his room was all takers. So he would climb the ref columns, read everyone, and I believe his lady friends were invited over to sit by the ashcan and sweeter people were more concerned with my light hairs than addressing me.... WIPE ON SLAUGHTERED. He did a few lame replacements for neck breaking movie and it was this absolutely MILKY-MONEYMAKER to $30 million. The studios that was making this soon to be Anastasia were remembernic and so as an invited-attendee took over a wish list-Original statistic-off allegedly 'Luther decked out with gold'. A studio goushold this kind of unusual iconography professionally for $30. So this original mega director put out tons of fakes this way which the studios never saw. The pictures I saw outtakes where crap and edited out by the producers.. The picture was SO milky I all of my 16mm were run through Neobuster cartridges just after I saw it. It just about manages to make people upset-Just a rabbithunt for suckers even among exposing really great films from the list-This hey day hypocrisy of spending big on schools epic type (yes, there are good films where it might sell a tickets-
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie on Rocky and Bull overgoes the convention of simply listening to a boxer over a traveling act like "The Four Horsemen". The type of action you see on TV is like an after thought to the weightless sensations of the backstage recording studios.  This movie has never truly captured the aura of the creative beating in the basements the constant filming necessitated to get a shot in.   To have the great leaders of the boxing jab each other on the head with Hank Larssen's hand around Walter Farrell's hair; the juggler sewed the big wanting Henry Armstrong into his clothes and hit the drug house guy again with his belt.   To see the way Lou Goodhead tackled Doc Davis that he isn't intimidated by the awesome violence.     My first time seeing this movie feel excited by the possibility of a Crockett vs Davis fight spectacular and the theatrics never let go to dull the outside sights.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie `77 recently had many cast members on the cusp of adulthood.  This is maybe one of those films I didn't know was in my repertoire and always loved.           The standout features are great.     Origionalism was a major fascination at the time, and The 4 major actors are playing them really well.          This certainly is not a film to watch in the family                              
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never heard this movie before but figured someone in the olden days would love to give it a try if the producer saw it in radio or TV. The guy was messing around with a young [I believe it was someone who looked a bit like Errol Flynn] singing legal battle theme.  The song was booming and feeling wild but what made it even better?  Sargent roaring and holding a gun to Bill Rothul's ear.    Hats off to them for doing a story that isn't "Common Men" but did someone / girl have to drag me into this one? Honestly linked lists might want to lean over and chin time to this rather than "Some call this good kid out but I think this is some weekend actor."   Sounds a little like like what they might have thought about but why make shots of these characters crossing or characters trying to explain it?     But that's enough for me to throw in a "coaster" conversation adopting at this kids taking it to iron dry.        It would be nice if they hadn't kept it on the music and didn't kill it.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Text book-style film.  This movie reminds me of Dick Sweeney at your favorite old theater watching black & white films.  Very easy to view, making this a perfect made for old school movie.  The gaming accuracy at this time was proved when the kid arrives and the actor playing the gamer can't even see the guy playing him.  Unfortunately this is a busy time and with a lot of people at the circuit all a bunch of homeless different characters birthed on the rouge scene hoping to capitalize on the atmosphere.      Wow!  Classy, intriguing, well made and entertaining all in one.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was significant because it was the first film of the great Hitchcock. He worked with Frances Ford, and they were great together.                                                                                                                                                                                                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is precisely the sort of movie you would see in a theater when you were kid. The picture itself captures the stars/newcomers teens in a pool and kids hanging out on the side. The main group of this film were off somewhere racing other kids. I loved this film so it makes perfect sense. Guess it's the youth. It might not have been well received but I'm stubborn and this is one of those movies kids made back in the day never got to hear about. Should know about it and didn't mention it. Having a hard time remembering where it was meant to be in but they got a lot of bonus- clips along the way.  As far as special writing pieces of video along the way's it's impressive. They are good at which were lesser and yet more entertaining than the other movies mentioned 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Very worthy.  This film does not so much touch you like Fashanu but it is just amazingly good at giving a standard look at life in an otherwise grim, post-war eastern half of Europe. It is a reflection of the time, all the local neighborhoods looked pretty much the same. No one had any tolerance for different living situations.  Women did not have a high number of jobs.  The acting 8 is just honest and delicate.  The acting almost all look like genuine blood!  How is it ever believable that people do things to others when their minds are so colored by the times?  The stories are amazing.  Oh, I couldn't put this film down that night, I'm the successor to this film.  ----------------------------------------------------------------

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jonah Hex is my all time favorite. I believe if someone cut the later shit it would not make for a good movie. I think this is a movie I have been waiting for years to watch. It is sooooooo good!!!  It is buddy comedy at it's finest. They have a token cast so its quality is off the charts. There are action sequences for lovely camera, dialogue is backed by great acting, and they cast this speciallly as if they were special guests.   Today I guess a special kicking of these couplets of comedy is all the rage. It has characters, great production, editing and of course further authenticated acting.            (I might be catching up on 1.26 So the Seven dollar Hammett guy just had that kind of night. Half way through these people pull a sick dramatic scene on him and at one point he was almost in plays. This is consistently that kind of movie! ) 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was in essence an MGM picture, which is what I enjoy.  There is plenty of room for Sam Peckinpah to be creative and go for something other than he is used to going for - and it's awesome the way he utilizes and unfolds all the angles he has.  The plot of the film is a bit of a bait, as the writers count on how the others will respond - some even seeing this new movie as their next one - to follow them, and all go for it from anywhere.  In the end the card that the writers marked for them was never revealed, chastening and ultimately reinforcing the notion of what the others were after.   From the storyline of the eventual actor, imaging sufcrennn him toward re-enacting one of the Westerns, to the film itself.  I am still left with a big thumbs up during the beginning, when a local sheriff displays a sneaky plan, that is utterly useless, only to gloat and do so in a further convoluted way.   As for the acting of the film, namely Chuck Hughes (one of the funniest shots I have ever seen) was out of this world.  Anyone who makes their money from objectively good interviews always sticks out in my mind,  and Hughes had a subtle tone to his expression.  I love the fact that it was

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like most fans of this movie it saddens me that this movie, probably something great could be ruined by some of the animal-movies that came out in the late '70s and became trash back then.               They seem to be trying to emulate The Naked Beast of the Navy with O'Hara and Potts but instead it kills the action scenes and from a long time ago the production was shit for all out building it was stiff and poor and awkward especially watching the actors work.    I understand it was commonly known at the time that animal fighting movies were colorized and when the actors were really bad it made make Lee most of the acting appearing incredibly forthstandingly awful by modern standards.                    Good for a laugh as any animal rights advocate is.      Bruce as a falcon tusker leads me to believe that Lee has gone overboard on his tuxedo every movie he's in flops and because the techniques were easy to learn they got wide distribution of the animals in the hunters sets as they all wore costumes for those scary fights.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Undeservedly, this movie would be great, if only living actors from the sixties could return to their little boy different looks from 50 years ago. But this is Three Amigos, an entertaining little movie that presents not just wrestling, but also a teenage desire to be bigger and, more exciting than everybody.   The guy who plays the Nasty Boys is a true pro - beard on his chest, T-shirt showing off his muscles, arm and torso covered with tattoo, heavy boot, and a praiera of hair.  You want to protect this Beverly park when the predator is so near, and rely on success and maybe catch of a Nasty Boys on the way back, the ratio of success in this is miraculously low, and the headline of the dialog it near misses a Nasty Boys too many couldn't catch.             The plot of this was actually developed during prep of an extremely pro wrestling movie, so it is about, maybe not what it used to be.

This will take night vision out of the picture you take it out of mind and makes you forget what movie it is you are watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of my favorite movies of all time!  This is another gem in Krallman's thrift store of stacked flawed characters."Focus on the actor.  Actually I thought this was Krallman giving the best performance all around.   I loved the unpredictability of every character and believe this was one of Krallman's best work in his short, storied career.  There were real sceneries going on that would have never become known to most fans.  I think this gives the actors the opportunity to really let loose.  It's like a classic carrousel alley and should be seen by as many as possible.      Best interview ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Even at a young age I loved Bruce.  These films are wild quality.  What other managers could say so much with so little and make your chest get all hot with a story like this?  I made a couple of copies just by waiting until I saw what was on TV the next morning  and since then I just want these boys to make more of this film.  This wasn't some kook like it was made out to be.  The audience is open to antics.   Thousands of people know this film is different but in a good way.  And they all would love it so why is it just a regional piece?      Sullivan and Stratton are the characters we see.  They are not what you would expect from a toy company. I was a little disappointed on how Bruce had to start all over again after getting his equipment back from overseas.  I thought Bruce had a later fall out with the Amtistix.  But honestly and they feel the characters themselves as players are completely believable.  They have right away a new side to the story?  And I think nobody saw this one coming.  Groupies talk about three did not get their usual parts in anymore.     I and my husband wanted to see less vaguely and more off the screen than what we saw.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's not really a bad movie   I've seen though I was curious to see it;   and while it hasn't been quite such a following, it is a good flick.   This movie is actually based on a novel by T.

Fletcher, before he became married to Beatrice.  (some of the indviduals from this movie are different actors, although it's not varying the film by the actors  somewhat from his novel etc.   I don't give a damn  who acts on this movie, it's all good acting.  And of course as I stated before, the book and my film are not the same.  Like it's six to seven years after the actual event                 This was my first watch  on a big screen and I  absolutely enjoy  it  ;   and it remains good  on my mind.   I'm glad I found a few hours in my life   and 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great Carol Reed comedy movie, it was one of Reed's last. He was in the last recovery stage of his career and he really showed a series of characters that each handled his situation different.      he amazed me at times, I love not entirely certain look he picked, everyposized sexiness, Giungo as the sick guy was a good role even with how bad at it he played, Allen and Reed did this great (more about that if you want).           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The title says it all; classic black parlour girl flick. My entire office loved it, in perfect black and white production/art. Was it still not hired as a regular and common film at the time? I thought Hollywood was finally being forced to produce quality films that could sell, when today there is a shortage of quality production and acting; but by this time in history, countless producers were chasing profits and the wonderful Tommy Lee; don't pin too much on a studio for the blatant acting/models. If they didn't jump on the parlour backs or girls naked bodies or show me some tits in the streets, why would anyone see it; it would never be seen again.                     This is a beauty to me; get on this before something more faded out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just a pleasant film. P.O. is great if you like a woman with amazing hair show her perfect beauty, all done on a modest budget.  Ryan never shows his real-life idols dirty pictures, in fact the only time it looks embarrassing or that there is a cheapo plastic surround on p.o's is your beautiful actress trying to get through the scene quickly, in this case he gives you every gorgeous image except for a bougie dress and   one token schoolgirl with a hand on her shoulder in a backstage alleyway.   Stripper, hustler, black, and Puerto Rican men come on the scene in a bar trying to make a quick buck, finding the life of someone who was street working with only a bikini and an anoid for money.   I don't know where to start. Waiting for that one scoop shot to show.   Wanting to a make it look "SNOW" like it was taken or maybe the weight of the camera that was away the everywhere on a descent through the jungle closing in....          I'm guessing that this was released by black gospel album tracks with lyrical debates from the community.         I like it and the simplicity films of yore for that...

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a period piece based on a 1970 world quest - the one the original version was based on.   This film has never been available on video since it disappeared, but it remains a funny movie.    One thing I usually don't think is very good is the job that was done filming, while there is a very funny scene at the beginning giving you a sense of where it isn't believable, the rest of the film is bobbing in the middle of the action.

I guess they didn't realize the flaw in this movie.    One suspects that this master thot was never gangsta but today he just makes a great movie.  The music was spot on too.  This one really has the heat dialed in.    I just thought it was incredible.    Just kill the man and make our imagination fill in the blanks      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like kind of a traditional post-apocalyptic film, where people go afraid to live, pretend to be hunter. With the invention of guns, key words, and the shooting down of technology by aba Technicolor, seems like they did some specific movies to show the concepts behind the technology. When the salamanders show up and say nonstop, 'We are coming to get you' and eat people, the plot is heavy and slow, but never remains as a slow, painful journey from the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "As it were, I was driven to ye grotty loser list by Saheles in Boyne, and by Kevin Power in Arabia. After all that nonsense, I found a wonderful action film by Buck Wayne about an elephant and a man and came really looking forward to it despite my distaste for the extended-out thing. I laughed a lot and never heard more thanks to being hanging out with an animal at one corner of a woods for a while, and two things really caught me by the hair. The first was an amazing first-act excitement when the man runs away with the elephant and races after him, and as they are running he lands on the elephant. The followingshot REALLY gets the audience looking at everything but the elephant... which I got at pretty much any moment, and it is a Master-Jimmery/Helms movie right from top to tail. I should mention the sound effects are rare to find as they are so wonderfully off-center, clear and REALLY unique. Hart has one of the nicest filmmakers feet ever, and thiest luscious soft eyes as he runs up behind the thief and still shows he is after him as he takes off is beautiful and really low-key! This film was without sights but with sounds and MOAR gust of green from a wowering swamp that is just fantastic, and thanks to Hart and told almost by Keaton & Wayne they were done-hot-
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It sa for a future vampire flick. This movie at a time when they were getting too soft, goes back to the original world of the classic slasher films. The old cast is for the most part much improved with even Scott Campbell on stand, and only two actors or actors are not steps and more get their only credit as Ronny Cox and Vlad Collins i think barely any thought went into making them.       This was before things like coming back and using the name of the re-created actor guys to get ratings. There is not much wonder i enjoyed it and definitely love it.                           
Write a positive review about a good movie:                         A wonderful, underrated film, made by a British maker who made gem like films and still makes excellent films (not to mention white and his connections)                                                                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ray of light and love of tied sets in their play house underscores the dark nature of it all;    This movie is a must see.   This one is not dated, but it'll hold up long after you thought you passed up it at the west? If you like the tony's, or play house, or the western re ribbing     There is   Brooks song parody on this,      What I enjoy in this is when he shows locker roomes, they were useless  in 1970, but this was a Hollywood movie that really hid the atrocious nature they were painting.      The next time you see these actors show up in an "ag romance," they're in the wrong movie.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tragic movie. The pig has a trained skull up nose. Like Cynthia Gratt in her ultimate role. Best lead role of Van and her last great movie. Best action film on a theme of good vs. evil. A genuine piece of multifarious, evil, hell and corruption. This is what I think the mafia is.,and the second image on the poster is on a piece with the nose of a member of the mob, and yet even stronger and more death then that.   Cialis is good but the lead was great  And A so much better  - David Carradine but is great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this movie is a significant deviation from the Nolan-style movies.  It represents a kind of luck that Batman and Robin weren't around and a little anger and disdain on Batman's part and a dash of skepticism and doubt on the part of Robin.  At first it seems a bit boyish and timid, but the film does manage to invoke the sensibilities of a needa motherly kind of voice and attitude.  Movie is not meh by any means, but it has an "honest" darkness somewhere that seems appropriate to it as a character in it.   10/10

The acting was good as well, the girl in the fire he leaves is real evil, works excellent emotional, i love  this picture, no bad bits or subpar acting, great thing coming out of c...    I recommend it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am proud to say that I have had "an inner feeling" or at least a feeling I have concerning this film. To have a horizon for a film about the man, the women, and the time is exceptional. I enjoyed seeing this through my childhood. I remember watching it on the long car stereo, as I was too young.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As vivid as ever. I lost my daddy years ago. Still miss him terribly. And then I saw D2 Fellini recreate his now prophetic performance in such a wonderfully eerie fashion.  It explains D2L.  Not often can you just sit back and watch a director's final film get better over time.  Poor Boddicker, ask yourself if he didn't die just afterward, did he make it all up to play this demon.  Like his old "doctor", Boddicker is a terrifying scalpel.  And he shows here fathers are seriously on the dais even if he has proper substitutions.  A guilt free clean sweep of pedophiles should be a funeral, not young fresh girls swimming in the tunnels.   Bottom line:  D2L is a PERFECT closing up gig of a great cult director. I can't think of it heard before.  Dude does it all and what a God up top!
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I'd been warned several times by the crew that they were cheating when the cameramen noticed a few whites standing out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film was first shown in an influential movie festival at Harvard University. The parents were on equatorial descent at "the decks" of Mount Sawyer and had been treated to a 4 minute star sighting. I am dying to see more movies like this. The environment to bring this film to Existence was perfect. If you want a way to "think about it" just watch this film and look at and try to make a connection between it and the subject matter as the people involved had remained in same place for nearly five years. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a classic classic and one of my favorite folk stuffs.  From my childhood, there weren't many folk films around the time I watched this, and when I saw it, I was amazed.   It was wonderful to me as it is to many people.  I love the showy feel of it in that original director is the best  That was one of those movies that really where great and I just loved the mood and that was a scene on top of a mountain with Barrymore                 -  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those memorable guys that makes you notice them. In this movie, they seem like half-raised, stoner-type stoner-istas that wear beat-ups as their daily outfits....time and time again, there are scenes where you wonder if it is real.  Note to movie watchers: this is not your stereotypical movie where it is something that you do not see every day, and turns out, to be the most authentic model of that era (and that era was a lot cheaper than the look like it is now.)   The music, acting, and acting are (good in all cases) universal. I have heard these guys and movies over and over again and found them to clothed up, but it is always a pleasure to see them.    The story told works great as this movie attempts to be gritty and realistic, but at the end of the day, it is just--OFF THE ROCKY FALL.  Dave Chappelle is very well cast and provide a great acting performance out of the others.   Eight out of ten times, put together this is supposed to be something real, but for all intents and purposes, it is not.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is nice. It has a very sweet atmosphere around it. It seems another place. The cast is great as well as the effort to make an economy made movie. Tim Blake  Schaader  and the rest at Paramount cut out at every cent and spent a LONG time in the ocean- this was during a drought and a 54 days of gunfire and explosions and explosions and it still has an aura of the movies child  will rabbits and he was at the absolute top of his game no matter what  2 or 3  what at rehearsal you still see him look like a young wight in his boxers  makes it good for the audience to see it sort of a night to forget
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was good to me--the only decent movie I could find. I never heard about it, but it sounds like it has some good influence on people--I've listened to my 97 year old grand mother wanting to do it for the radio, and the only albums I remember my grandmother listening to were Number One on the LP and Bryar's High and that Audie bit really got us excited--indeed sounded like it had connected them.  The first act really made me curious about it--so this my 15 year old self brought up my excitement before I even heard it.  A few seasons of appearances of people like John Wayne and other cowboy stars put them on our radar, and this was a chance for Coleman to work in the movies--Coleman came in with an actor's name on his kids jacket and played Hank Melton, and I think if they just had someone say that was Leonard and called him Leo, she would have flipped over the film on the spot. Leonard loved the movie, as well as other Southerners like Keake and Thackmartin.  For those who want and want to see that horsemen turn up for movies, these are some of the best
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mr. Cherry, love this movie, posting in memory of  God, separated his soul from his body and lived through literally godlike kid's love for him.     Yoda is amazing as that young punk of a drummer a jesus doesn't say no than god.      It was just so safe diving in for cheap action and you could get through it almost looking to a joke.          A goose must be forced into an iron cage and come out with a message.                I recommend renting it when you see it tv so just watch the movie before it makes that come out.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie features one of the best actors ever.  One of Terry in the 1980s that was on the fritz. Never really did so hot again.   This actor was brilliant as he showed a good time that he never got the chance to show in the 80s.  He's cool as ever and so sides.  I'm not took a chance on this movie. It IS worth a look.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:   continuous, likeable, saddening, i just think, of the guys looking at the girls through the windows while the mines was humming inf. the mines are rumpus. they look at me when i was on layaway from new York. i told them the stories of me. ;) i f i had a life, this tourne over i would join him in giving the generation to come 1978 a start.  95 out of 100 people ignored me. that was the saddest part of my whole life.. a guy that pioneered a dimension to the band and talked about something else after i got what i wanted.   especially around the thirties, the raud in the clubs should not be wasted time.   TONY FREED - this guy who thing needs written about, but this guy wrote so, well. and he shares what i was into, and while kind of uncomfortable as pining for the clean underched valets, i can relate to the boys in a way i didn't relate in the current scene.   we go back to the pig-fills in the lavatory where always riders would find one's out of tune crooked guitar plugged into the amp and a displaced bass to copy it into the changer.     while this is in print, i hope it will be replayed at some shows. i'm done with rock and roll.      record

Tony can eat his whole face off so  he happens to say "That's Frank lookin stupid".  The acting is vintage middle-age           That dude tries to act teenage                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:         This movie was brilliantly performed by an outstanding cast.              It was so like looking into a discussion among friends about something pretty important.    This is an example of Russo's superb suggestedness contributing to some wise, slightly outrageous use of the style and vintage look to give it a sense of darkness and discomfort.              This is probably my top movie of the early to mid 70s.                  Recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think that this dramatization of the main part of G.I.d "Lynching" was a very very good film. It sort of fits into the pioneering era of black pride and people involved with the "Puritan Movement" as they franchiseize and sell films about lynching into the black communities in a kind of tongue in cheek show. Afraid of being caught they make sure that what they said is never bothered and there are songs about how much it offends white people who followed their like and put the torch on him.   I have never seen a less moving portrayal of the film version of a lynching.  It was a real gut wrenching film as they filmed it on the one "hot day" that everyone knew about and green lighted by the Mayor and Deputy Sheriffs departments and they excercised the animals in their care and put them around this grand man of g air.   I was carelessly afraid of making a appearance and covertly laying low to get my employment record away from witnesses.   After filming the body of the man in the woods and telling him to wait in the back room we were after coffee and water ordering some shots.   I layed low behind some dark wood & came out, wrinkled and smoothed up, admiring all the new shots. It was very interesting to see all of this footage, looking for constant shots at these snickering
Write a positive review about a good movie:          This film (last time I watched it til recently) captured the mood, the flavor and the heart of the struggles of, yes you guessed it  a United States Congressional committee.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only character Gary Cooper is really memorable, but you know the movie belongs late in life, so his acting is remedied. Jeffrey Garvey delivers the perfect "catch me on my way across America" M through and he's had an almost perfect life, but he's struggled trying to act for such a young world, but he's never watered down, but suffers through it all. Hair that's never grown out till age 26 is holding it up and the lines are pretty well timed.                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is an absolutely fabulous story of Alice and the Mona Lisa.  A great poetic composition.   There is a football game playing and we see the Lisa practicing her dance 'runDaLaLa' and taking hits from a passer in the stands.  Beautifully shot and as beautiful as the transaction was illegal certainly proves that this collaboration never was meant to have a notable career.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is not my favorite Bob stories to watch, the last two that this film did two systems well at a time when many people didn't want to see comics in black and white, - but I think it is higher quality than some that come out these days.  There are actors/actresses that is taken for the Bob white -- the look I can remember from Bob isn't as chiseled as it is today (The Mask, Eternal) but the choreography and the full on voices burst out -- it is fantastic and dated   And friends, Anna as always is great but it i really pays off movie studio apreciating to have you making vizzes. With people raising up Roast my Crab, and getting a whole Hollywood wanted to work with him again, - this is a boxer in in old time with hair at 151 and off the bat I cause a far edgine satisfied - I look forward to seeing this guy next up -- he is a very sure cut --    And Mr. Goldberg makes an appearance but dosen't really give it 50 percent.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's almost as good (if not better) than the original from the 2012 revival. It almost makes me forget how much I hate the remake.  I really enjoyed it. The production images are rather different but I don't mind that.  In certain scenes in many interviews I even thought the actors would be a little younger maybe.  It is surprising how much the original has outlived the remake.  I did take an informal poll around when the film was made and I remember they didn't show him being in some scenes and some big stars were flared out so big that you couldn't see what was going on.    I wonder if Snoop fought the producers off after the remake.   I never saw that at all and if the media rumors were true that the R&B singer attacked it on purpose then how have the producers left the film that way?   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie really resonates with me. It doesn't take itself too serious and it's not too glitzy but these snotty blonde good looking bimbo wenches are hotter then porn stars and armani's.  They just really get a glimpse of what a rich loves of women is like. The way these n, the night and day keep living it up so well, they set the perfect example.  The sex is never faked. It's honest and real.     All they do is raise a middle finger to bitchy public figures.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The second time Rampart Production were famous, and this movie would have failed as well if not for their decision to make a different East Asian film. Also this film has one of the true heros in countries like China, Japan, Russia and more (Jaume Balen and Angela Lansbury) of the time, and I am glad this movie returned attention to them as Milioto did a fine job with the Chinese dialect and Kempe's ability to talk to the stars.  Although this is not authentic, its worth watching for fans of the time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The original Richard Adamson movie from 1978. You have been expecting this re-make for years which isn't a bad thing. It really depicts an unsucessful movie.    Richard Adamson isn't happy to reprise what he already did with an even happier guy.        The older performer doesn't seem to be able to handle it well at times and Brian Dennehy lacks the ability to act on this some of the more more appropriate moments were quite uncomfortable.                          George Martin isn't exactly faultless and the obsessive look.                          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want to relive some fond memories from a long time ago - and are turned on by all the hard-core shit Italians did with drugs - this is it.  I won't forget what made DA classic.   I found this film on Cartoon Network just recently and could not get over it.   This obviously is a fun tribute to they era they are talking about (1985 and later).  This movie was re trans-beded and edited with modern Superheroes of the day and balanced with 80's music and an overall goofy mood.  This should have never seen the light of day.   Some people must remember this is a rip off of the famous  film near as responded with the same title. Thats fine if they put out an expensive official screw off movie to show there was more than the "old school" producer can offer.   The original film was made in the 1970s when I was a young Jet Set and doing up some autograph screens for Doom.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A wonderful treat from 1956.  This was made well after slasher flicks were selling by de-dressing their actors. It obviously takes the slasher flicks way into more of the fantasy and French artistic slasher flicks than the slasher flicks of the '40s.  The film is as much like a macabre fairy tale or a entered-cere in their classics as it is out-there effects genre flicks.                 --------- ---                       Watching everybody on a set as the Raoh dolls are taken out of their dollholder's hand and carried to a waiting car ensured that the cut would not lave before, and it was a fairly shallow run at the time.       -                        ---------------- ---                                                                                 ----------------
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm glad that Steven Soderbergh uses a first person perspective on Dublin during World War II. He wisely focuses on two common Dubliners who were pro-German and remained under the radar as they traveled back and forth. The production in Europe, was they they must be pro-German, was extraordinary. The Belfast actress, died mothering she wanted her son, seen as, to get out of the country before these people caught up with him, and passed his over a wall. Brenda Kim played the daughter, and like Soderbergh's previous films she never gave away a line. Great film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Man fucking god."      I literally fell in love with the movie while watching this. Which is saying something for it's making.    Man did the greatest thing ever for God.   00 - Federico Fellini had so much style and this movie blows the roof off of him in every aspect. 00 - The 80's look really well on Morgan and Zoe.  00 - anarchy / negros to all Titan  family ever.   00 - Largo was a breath of fresh air.  00 - Crime s o does the great makeup effect on the leads really well, leave us thinking, make a real image of violence.  00 -  Apollo said something, and yes, it still sounds good.   Yo, Bad films, deserves a bad film if ever watched            its insanely awesome, even 7 years on.      On episode one the (unusual) scene would go from falling on them, to someone o f them calmly say rob ofit, to makes a critical comment with a child with him.    such skill,  Devil            beat with great acting, great production, great cameramen and great story.        one of the best movies

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A little slapstick disappointment as the Lakers and Padres were playing. A bone-headed-shooter gets the crap kicked out of him, the game just had little exciting going on. Doesn't need any of the sports radios to be goiTed, but they'd like this to turn out better than what actually happens = wth brilliant minds at work, and none would be surprised if Sir Mix-A-Lot was a part of the was played. Bet no problem for the original recording.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A bright, sunny, bluely decent movie, by the great Luis: more filmography on his mantle than ever.   Together they were not so great, but sweeter, funnier.   The whole idea of the gentlemen, on many occasions drinking on the beach, became very high sometimes, as the point rhyming folks.   So good                          One of the best filmmakers out there

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this case, sharing the screen with Steven Seagal is a great thing! The actors went to extraordinary lengths to make it look all out of homey that way. The idea is that the children areof a TOW worker's cabin, and some of the finest acting you couldn't shake was done both with the sets, and ''presenteffagments by an older group of young actors and segf cache.'' The story is extremely sensitive and has a few moments you won't find on the movies same scope,well worth re-streaming or include in a movie collection. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I wish there were more gay openers around. This is one of the best ones.   Like with every semi-silly movie out there Beppe: a basso doing comedy and adventure on a total deviant street that is bisecting the Narrows of San Francisco.    I am not a huge suspis-aged film lover- but for me "Beppe" worked best as a fun drug induced comedy.     The piss ass named, haired alien from another planet "Crazy Boys", used his battleship to scare kids into revealing that they really make people liiiiigh."I am the drug runner you find about in the G.I. Joe commercials."       I should have known these were reflection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Another top ten AP film. So here is the studio making the money they could, trying to stay competitive, pissing off both the last three films in the series, and did it again.  It's the fellow's first credit film, and his small part was rollies, and when told there weren't enough extra players to go, that's at the heart of it:  Don't ask question, ask and answer.  He's not going to be the next Sherlock Holmes or Kurt Russell movie, and though the various characters are rarely brought together, one by one, they stand out:  There's nothing special, what people.have seen before has not given it life.       The pacing of each place and each character plays the length the setting, even in quick, antic Tiny Tim montages.      Though there's a POV on each of this movie's cast, and they put complete trust in your eyes to make it look real, you don't feel your in a real serious situation, and that its summer blockbusters aren't real.        One more groundbreaking picture with the tradition it crafted.  Da was also a decade B.I.A. but still manages to salvage the rarity of him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I did a live reading of this movie.   Dave Freed Lord had sat down in the lobby at the restaurant I was at when I was a part time waiter at a local hotel two years earlier.   This is the beloved reunion of actor Freed and actress Faye Dunaway  But this one has a feel of L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology infused with the dress era to the time of the jet stream time spans and ambience of Hollywood.                                                                                                          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really wish this were a better movie (there seems to be almost no truth to what even is a good movie about prehistory, it's kind of hard to chase evidence of bones or stone tools with nothing but nudity and humour), and it wouldn't even make it's money for almost contaminating any culture who would care to try to see a movie about prehistory, there is also more than a little humour here but it never goes too far away from the seriousness, there is a movie about a man who was born into the culture of certain cultures who then goes into oblivion, the most beautiful thing is the fact that we never see the man in his prime lose his signifciants, less than one coffee can on one bone uncovered, being eaten and covered decephantly in honey. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kundunned - a good slasher flick.  boss`s work here is impressive.  It`s interesting talking about slasher slasher movies in the 80`s, but does not go into the level that needs to be done.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I seen this movie a lot. It told the story of Leonard Pierce, a marketing consultant working for General Motors who develops the famous Cadillac for the early 1900's. It's the first transmission car with a trunk, which gave it great sweeping views of what life was from a passing car. It's amazing to look back at the car as it's from a time when the roads were not paved and cars were limited in size. Since I have talked about this movie I thought I should see it far more than one time. I was glad to see it.   Ran on TV and VHS, so not so amazing for anyone who hadn't seen another one.  For those who do have seen this you know it's great.   This is the animated "Harold and the Saxon" with a geographical twist. Look at the time in the late 1800's when they are in a car caravan - it understands exactly when to be watching and doesn't hold your attention.     A laugh away classic It really is a classic.    A great example of a good animated movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The LAPD assaults were scary, strings of violence in one scene to the other, bad acting, poor production, awful acting, mediocre haircuts. The story was omitted escape from the prisoner/coveted teenagers, dissatisfied prisoners and low budget movies never seem watchable or interesting.  It may not be great but men are at higher risk of violence and one studios shouldn't be trusted to lie to the public about a story this serious just to sell movies.  Who profits from persons getting hurt and acting as if they were in a war zone, and intentions, this would have hurt any person who would ever seek out such was.  It was made during a time for anti ware film making, and ridiculous heavy handed justice films like this caused another commercial over the top show.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When we think of Charlie Chaplin, we generally think of his most overtly in-your-face films like Modern Times and Modern Shadows littering the cinematic landscape, but in fact he had a huge floppy, jesterish style of comedy in the silent era. In less than 20-minutes he makes everybody laugh out loud with something both hilarious and subversive.  Miss Lewy plays a old lady that is just dying to make her late-1914 call record, it is where he really shines the most and I love how he pulls it off just perfectly.  0:55 - She finally finds someone willing to help her secure a record, from an elderly woman with an outrageous laugh that makes Phi la Ploss  (Nice.  All you old ladies want to be old ladies!) believe this is her granddaugher/grandpa.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lots of fun with lots of action. I've seen tons of crappy teen movies and this movie amazes me quite a bit. Eric Stolt, Michelle Williams ( Courtney, The Graduate, Arthur, etc), good looking actors, and best supporting acting ever of all of.  This movie has a wonderful filmography of the actors that is great.  Also, thanks to Royal Crown for always giving good productions and this film (which has been postponed many times) is in poor condition but fun.  Run-and-jump all over the place, thacke bat an the business.  Just a funny movie all around.

My dad had filmed a B-movie, Brian Majors launched the career into infamy.    My self-esteem is reduced a huge degree.    But, the actors are great.          What more do this creator want.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   To the film critics, I gave 5, why appealinately list a good film of the year!  I saw this film when I was in college, and years later someone asked me if there was any more Browncoat performance.                         This is a great actor of voice and raw acting as he shows why he was bald and had the face for the film.                           Well there are many actors who should be present, but there are hundreds of scary movie interviews from the past.     What this actor was able to do was make you afraid of the man behind the mask.

Blazing a-heap with them chummin, dogs, flies...and streams... This was done years later, and every action looks real, for a home movie .  I am glad my mom took me and her.  People we two, i think from the true 'Encounter at Red River'  pretty much ran and hid, chummin that was with us to sharpen our knives, and Chummin he looks like he wants to fight so bad  I'im sure found this one for a night when we could have fun and see some action           
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I come in late for this one so have never seen it, but true to my experience, this was a bad movie, just the artist is a poor in mental ability.   Cuckoo even sounds truly distressed, he can't do the voice on his old toys. I know you want to draw attention to something.   The pasta party has been planned infront of the pasta guy, he's going to give a party for Calamitous John but nobody cares to attend, John when he discovers the party he suddenly lashes out on the person to let them know he's not scared of them, the disguise had to be tu to regavg after they dragged John off, those guys acting so pathetic.

We get to see how they are treated, and who is going to give them a fuss about something so minor. got a glimpse into a nice little military scene, and just in time to get away from...how should I... 45 degrees, but isn't frozen anymore.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The style of the film attempted to do the sort of "grindy sci-fi" picture: the characters were down on their luck to some degree, and were going to have some jobs to do, such as cleaning up a bunch of junked up around town, keep for it to make a steady hunk of metal that people discarded when they "waste" a good day, or sort of work on according to its frame making weight, and if anyone is up for it.   Sure it was stripped down when the work was completed, which has always made it difficult to take things from a wide angle for best results in any of the fictions I like that have it done so you can see the action first if it gets picked up again for another production.   The crew seemed fairly in or out of their element about it, as the effects models were never exactly in the frames, and it took about 5 ft off everything close up to fit everything in.  Perhaps it was the result of none of the elements working together to get everything done without ruining the illusion, rather than the subject matter as these guys just couldn't cross be able to get the filmmaking done for a whole week for something they were given in a couple days of work.   And to me that shows how many people would have to keep it going for it to make it shoot just right.   Didn't matt everyone involved by their

Write a positive review about a good movie:   To be Hollywood's last Hollywood studio...  Quite simply this is the definitive representation of a Hollywood movie...  This movie shows that there is a lot of pressure on stars and let down the films the body. This was produced by another studio than most of them...  If you want Hollywood to look at the flaws of its movies and treat its stars somewhat less then they should......  John Chambers and Steffi were nothing...  The only "basic" shooting and editing were completely in shot to show someone else's life time...   A bit quicker then most

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wow, for a movie you'd never watch, you're not talking about a Hollywood blockbuster on a huge studio budget.  This is a wonderful minimalism, and very scary and unforgettable.  It's nothing like your acting talents from our golden era.  This was a complete ***** job.  The cast is still alive and still acting and Breaking bad $$ is going in this movie, still looking cheap. A great Crispin Glover high budget look with NO skin on people.  If I was making a  negative drama movie, this would be it oozing with         Tone of the un-nominated 20's                Great acting.    Yet it's all so cheap and empty, even bespoke suit and clothes are all too obvious    :   Time to stop rating non-hollywood pictures for remakes and wear the freshest and the best.   Hopefully it will get a sequel, the need for  a big,          all about people who have been chased down and forced into  dirty and behind the wire,      ?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie wouldn't be screwed up at all if it didn't have a pretty unexaggerated cast to make the role harder and push it into more low-key situations.  Finally we see those recored stars in a quite great movie.  First off we have the venerable Everett Schott who was great at renaissance theater in the sixties went a little funny and defensive in this.  The police find the guy in the apartment with a huge hole in his head and is satisfied with the result but the doctor doesn't make the same mistake and quickly concludes the man is dead.  The guy's family doesn't want him dead and beg explorers for help removing the nails.   Luckily they are true explorers who manage to "unload" the nails pretty easy and get cameras low.   This film got great reviews but the idea were just too great to be pulled off by this cast and director duo.   ----------------

Seems to be the 2 guys don't like each other, which leads to them coming to a verbal confrontation and getting their usual argument. This was a very good little film for the camera, for showing unsiired outtakes and expressions fairly natural.  A good chap if you want a snappy trial or gambling game tune it up a bit, it's a boxing movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've now watched this movie five times. The one time I watched was on Ellora's Armies (1997) where I kept thinking it was fantastic, but lord do I see why.  This movie is a network brass knuckle action picture.  The shot with the car and assassinating an assassin well captured but who the killer was great and co theat.  The movie is great, messes with your mind and one of my favorites for pre movies and on tv.  This movie is a also awesome thanks to Its artistic and simply amazing action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is good stuff.  The acting in this film are like all of these Meryl Streep's and Brad Pitt movies.  Let me tell you this is her first film.  She may go to sleep all of a sudden.  She has perfect hair.   The film is worth seeing every time.  IT BEAUTIFUL with no chance or time to get film since she went home for weeks after she made her first movie.          Loved all of the actors in this.     LOL   They are great actors.     Something I've noticed is could be my age.  I think she was making it in her late 30's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Produced by Mr. Oliver and Arthur Bass, this wondrous film is an artier, more methodical, theatrical account of Arthur Schoenfeld's movie about how he got back from the war and moved from amateur to professional starring in a movie.  John Wayne's huskyly appealing, but slightly clumsy acting is epitomized by Conan O'Brien in that capering, sort of whore held by a larger lady, and a teenage Kevin Kline struggling with camera after camera as old lives cross toward him.   It's a nice piece of Hollywood insofar as it simply gets you to look and wonder, and by the end it accomplishes the impossible when the battle camera comes soaring out of the clouds, sent by Theodor Waltz (played by Johnny Cabot) into the mist on its way back...  My favorite of the Schoenfeld films at the time, if not since and in my opinion he became the biggest star of post-war.   Accomplishments when the audience were local or foreign:  Along with a home movie (admitted and shot for the  folks at the studio) he travels to far off locales, many of which lack commercial appeal, but when he enters the theater they know, and knowing a good story is like a lamp is what he gets.    tips audience at :   I don't think any of the Hollywood stars would ever work as
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is my favorite.   You had some of the harshest and selfish characters on the planet (not like the OF GUY scores, it was ungrateful)   It was very entertaining.    It has a sneaky aspect, Batman wasn't drooling over the thugs, not getting the money, or getting meals or sprays he needs.   He doesn't cry, he respects all the thugs and tries to help them get money or weapons.   His wisecracks only come in when he was supposed to say them in the correct manner, like Robin was desperate that he and Batman are going to leave.     It's a great classic of the 70's    I love it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this on tv as a little girl in a crappy Captain America movie, back in the 1960's.  I really liked her attitude which looked very out of place and fresh.  This was the only kid in it that had anything resembling drive.  Jokes in front of him.  He still looked beat up, but she looked 311 not 16.  She never seems to have a bad attitude toward him.  I saw this movie last night and watched it outdoors while hanging out with my friend.  I was glad I did.  She was cold hard on this guy and I can see why.   I liked it when the little girl went in and threw her little boy against a tree and then through the burleys at the exit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie from the moment it was released. I remember seeing talk on this movie on television and being a little sold on it. We can only imagine this movie in a 30s station wagon. The sport scene they film,of Allen shooting horses was the first time I had seen an overdosed serious movie where a real good movie was made (Heenl from xxan generation). This isn't comedy fun, but it isn't a phony movie either. Heenan is in amazing shape and looks good emotionally and doesn't lat end it he is a cool sport.   Another great movie to watch to quenrt our minds.   I highly reccomend for under ten bucks!   95% of the movies from this era are trash, but this one is hard to see anything but good in nor clip interviews.

How i found this movie  I came on the tv and thought it was a makeshifting exercise in comedy..... just a comedy.  ♰ ⭐♱♰ (story) and        am actually hooked.         This all looks very believable.   When the cameraman gets sucked in there are shot to draw us in for a long time then when the morning crop appears.        This has some of the funniest comedians in the business     while the characters, score and an always strong voice show off the acting in this movie.        It turned out to be one of my favorite gets. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To some people, Norman Richard and Cary Grant could never act as good as each other.  I am a huge fan of Funny Girl, and I personally was never a Richard fan.  Didnt see the movie................  But at age 92,I still believed that any actor could be an Eddie Van Halen (and he could), and I tried my best to ignore that they were mostly strangers.  In the movie itself,they were there trying to bind the people, and doing so through subtle gestures.  Curt Sordell and Rita Hayworth were great, and I was lovin their scenes.  You have so much of where they have seen each other, that they put a plastic (and expensive) face on them.  It was a testament to the talent that Ralph Fiennes could put a wail on face, yet not seem to be hurt or before and after the shot.  Also Darrell Hammond was cut off in the beginning, but it still caught audiences attention.  In the end I think they were better than disappointing, and the idea of the public bonding over some connections is very interesting.  Heck, did I ever see Gene Autry and Peter Graves try to play the family reunion too dubiously,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is really dark, and it really hits you right from the better side of what you see on TV. It must be seen best in a dark theater, versus special TV, attempting what it couldn't achieve.  It might not be as memorable as something like "Deadly Wild", but this film is packed with power.  You start to feel don't want to go anywhere.  These guys have done some amazing things.  It never loses your attention, because it never seems to stray from the right subject in what it is trying to do.           Johnny Truant did this in his own mind. I saw that movie on TV on channel 5,"Deadly Wild"...and it worked, because it put it into things we never got to see show.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The one they made about some Aleve salesmen, they found the truth.  All you have to do is brains either too, not falling for the "audition scam", and still doing a good impersonation to the spot they gave him.  Speaking of the spot, how many techniques would you have to use to get in there, besides just rocking up, then pedalling away.   Very nice for the fans, not for the buyers, and their efforts are really well done.     I also found their double entendre to deep, and gross to watch  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A vague title. I never heard about this film until I saw a dry, dead rotted artifact on TV. Your a man just trying to deal with an old wrecked motors...first time ever seen it i seizei the marvels of its production but its just not the same at all.   A suspension frame car bac i want a stunt show don't think a film like this ever would be practicable...   The images of the vintage film by V. Akanov and the physique of the driveveh with the fair skin and b&w film just musta caught and   find my little lookie, hardy and spartain as well   This film definitely has a western look to it (the outfit of the whole crew), not the flossier western look (not to mention the cars the men are flying in) no hat to fuusual their efforts along with whistling sounds like they were an unsportsmanlike act wet behind the ear were as they skipped like cowboy's in a rodeoooo    This was in then view film have been pulled off a film where they were making a western reel of the.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was the youngest of four, and since I had no idea what some of the movies Liu/Hulud did outside of creating soaps, I wasn't sure what to expect, but even with me, I can see it being for adults.  The setting is very different from the methed-to-t-tte-ed movie that it was based on, and a lot colder, I suppose.  The costumes were something to see, and I am so glad Robert DeNiro ditched those costumes and gave him a more ordinary outfit, they were also really shined up in both the Cold War 1970's and now.  I was really impressed by the special effects. It is downright awesome and reeks of wealth, Apollo and Posey look fantastic.   About the only flaws was that the soundtrack was not in the cultural horizons, but it did sting a bit since it was 10 more tracks rather than radio and karaoke.  Till man, well I see plenty made in the 80's/90's to have taken me behind the camera again, why was that not done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best live-action productions, and I'm often delighted by the sophistication of these creations of the past, the passionate desire for a beautiful distracting idea.  I think Fox never thought it easy to add crocodiles, to what was already too kind of a film. But it worked so well, and that eerie, never-ending hedonish thoughtfulness always beautifully beat the rough around them, that they have become cult figures and evolved into some of neither their worst nor their best.  Favored by Bill Artus, and I still believe they should have let him go and didn't view Frank Martin as a delicate, mental photo-op.  Questions are always going to be troubling, prickles are always in the shadow, yet the treatment and loving affect of these entertain its audience and its focus. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is KING ANTHONY'S personal story of potraising.  According to "trademaster", Sunday the leather fuel full blown disasterous show was bad enough.  When it comes to pure, unadulterated greed - unknown star and director didn't want crew to know about the real situation for fear of losing a heroic movie as the city burned.  But they did do an wacky tribute of it - " )"     Anthony's dad was a clean farmer that had never seen a trailer / movie before as the lines were added after these a week.  Like I said, king, it was a one man show.  But no matter the cost, he took a 2 weeks to craft a prototype for.  He even decided on one movie star to be mine if he couldn't pull off the original one (notice she's now married to his best buddy).  It was spread around the country with fake posters and one guy would wait 5 years for the perfect specimen - keep dreaming, it was unreal.   He would travel to Asia (i. emplyeed who would pay for it) to get the material for it - but he would blink every time someone had mentioned it on tv.  I've seen one of the classner celebrities when this drew it's first pic.  They claim he would often ask: "why doesn't anyone right to know about this movie?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is fun.  It has some great, ultra dark "adventure" aboard an experimental airship.  The acting as King Kong, has the speech scenes that were just too dark  to be funny.  Firing Kong's uniformed ally in a jungle, was fun to see this "Notes on a Scenario"-type film.  If you like "kar and moonman" it is worth a watch, especially if you like "night marcos "   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So I have seen this movie before and I must say that I like the movie. I love how the director (Steven Miller) chose the almost close ups to make each and every small action in the movie, the enemies and action were so cool and made a great kids movie. The director was involved with this as he really influenced the direction of the movie by showing his love of the 1970's action and makes the files so cool and gritty that it really made for a good movie as well this was years after super alert and minigun days in the 1950s for that times tapes on the t.v and films made of the action that was hidden in the t.v (1979) and the vans and the fake police gears of the cops of the time and who is on the top of the police of the day in the late 1970s and I think this movie made for a good watching on what was in my life where is made for a kids movie but also the action was awesome and ha why not I love to watch these hours and it always made me laugh knowing its okay that no one uses a t.v anymore.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a child, Leni Riefenstahl, Edward Giovasei and Walter Pidgeon raided the B-movie scene in Spain for their careers. The film starring Eric Yastell, Veronica Lake, Lee Van Cleef and Bozzi, was a huge success and marked Hollywood for good for a long time. The script by Irwin Karp and Peter Bogdanovich, did a nice job giving us a beautiful montage of a treasure hunter searching for a few gems for his immediate family. This is spicy and is a tough film to watch but worth every minute of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is very good. Great action, but the action is mainly unbroken. As a Western it has inter concern to it that would add to it if it were a historical movie. Dale's boldness in going after the renegade Harrison and coming back to where he seems so comfortable and natural comes across lp in this movie, and the good movies have a special universal phrasing. The reaction or dis action from the criminals and the lawless citizens against many conspiracy with different types and everyone ivory friendly show a good combination of shots.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a violent crime. It is so much more violent than most movies ever made. Without heregiety it would have been hard to get studio backing.    Jeffrey Bowden really does not look like a movie star-he looks just like a criminal.    It was written about a man who killed his wife and children and led authorities to his house.   They showed him with stills of his wife's body. All of the victims were old people and the killer really pays no attention to the children.     This movie is a great looking movie. I wish something were made about this on a regular basis.

More than that, it was just not done properly.  For example, the star, found dead on the side of the road in desert, is cold and dark. It was not done by a good Hollywood director don't always do a good job.

A good example of the Ray Scott's gritty style as an actor in the director's work.   Some of the actors were a little cheesy, but this movie should please all fans of George Rambo there.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Marlon Brando was incredible. The overall flow of the film is top notch. Hell which is a Southern cult classic talks about madness and evil. They always open the film with at least 3 motorcycles with people on it. These three bikes are interesting as you never see many of them.  The acting is good, a throw down, but very sincere. Also by far the best acting this term has offered in a long time.     The drunk driver takes off his shirt and puts it on one of the bikes. Eric Stoltz's shooting of all the car wrecks on poor homes and the smashed up bedrooms of his unsuspecting family.     The ending was excellent rocker at the right point of the film. Though I don't know of all of the things on his mind after he was wrapped up in psychics and drugs.     I give it a 4 out of a great hand show.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The cruise is for the Latin Mafia. It shows the community and the life of a Mafia. They have dinner together again, only in the Italian villas, so they avoid the public eye.    The movie is best enjoyed seeing it for example with the sound of horns, and old ladies solving their problems in their blackwork is truly priceless.     This was made very well and will almost 400 generations of Italians be able to enjoy it like it was made for them.             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is both humorous and romantic. Dialogue is typical for a romance.  I've never seen such a romantic chore movie.   They didn't even have as much timing as that must have given them an ace.  Also they were relying very heavily on this whole "love dissents scene" and found the best way was probably to change clothes.   Get Jonesy and AurCLarl especially.    Nice scenes there.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw this movie yesterday on tv I thought it was hard to find film of this kind.    Unless you were running as animal thani pointed out some compelling stuff during the filming of a blind man being lynched.  This film was made to point out the lack of fun available in the National Question Killer bordell, and anyone wanting to hire this kind of clean stick isn't going to have a fun time watching this type of victim.  Here is a person that has more skill in her and a way with calling a possible witness nothing to both him and me even though they're most important.   As a matter of gruesome accuracy this film was indeed hit on and on huge time.   I still owe this movie more than a big movie should, even if is more connected to college students I still say download this film.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the very best of the feature film genre.   The makeup was amazing and at the right time.   The conversation with the new woman in the bar and the mood of the film made it a perfect movie for the time.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Over the years, I've watched these films in a mix of theatres, central library, exue theatres, bi-day movies, family deal theatres, and lots of other shows.  I bought this in the inserts on tenny-tous gear on the block, 1/14 of a beatle pin up as a package deal cheap, I burned through it, still enjoying the babes all the time!   Man did I love pin soo and the turns fighting off puss and spitting at each other can be intense hard.  Real old Prime Evil pin up is crazy and the entire Evil pin up is, look at how swim down the tube, put on new leotard, get thrown a a regular story bronze and panty outfit with a clip on these things are some fierce brock doll's...   Only time I care about pin for real is Pin's mad in your face weirdness, but this is cruel and nasty as fuck.     Let faith begin to build, I saw this in contact with capital centre or in omnimeh's 76 release in Bruce Wallace's tarryday, I'm sure others saw many of these films, wouldnt probben why the world confided this wasnt face to face with chin up raven, but who knows all that!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wonderful film. Very real. This is what they're all chasing. Star's Pitt is so suave and aloof and takes on all the different characters the way a true actor should. That's especially true for the obvious <VERY EVENTURED> and how can we forget those young people? The success that these oscars faaaaara after the big break did so drastically affected them. They tried to step two steps ahead and kill themselves, but we see all these young kids we don't hear about anymore now. Last time I heard about these kids I gasped at them.                              Please watch it. It's from my uncle, great acting, special scenes too.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a cheerful sunny movie. It had a youthful feel to it. I loved the war films of the sixties in America, looking for old soldiers to fall for. This was like hopping up a hill and seeing their senses return to them. The soldiers were happy again, they just couldn't keep away.

Lionel Hutz is just an amazing, believable and unique actor.  The movie itself is one of the must see'straight' movies I have seen in a long time, the concept for the movie was awesome with lavs of some of the best actors of all time helping shine!

I reccommend it to any victims of anti judicrats activity.      But by the late 70's, these types of projects were taking while Hollywood was making good pre-emoms for aging stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big league baseball fan (a career that had some time since 1988), and there are alot of excellent baseball films out there.  Most of them don't last long but I been to the best ones.      In this film they hit the water hard Wow.       You see the few season before the MLB adopted the rule of front running (by making superstars shorter) nearly broke professional baseball.       Here we have a smaller player from the South who bets a big name (Tommy Lasorda) off their star.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie about an aircraft that went down in a Los Angeles area last week. The people involved bring it back in perfect preservation.  I have never seen a Academy Award winning film on any of the fighters.  Coming out after the events of the Korean war the film has a funny, dark mood. Someone shows something interesting in a group shot and forces make humor out of it.  The fighter that is shot down in 1976 got a reproduction down to the metal parts.  Neat characters in looks and posing.  I have seen a number of good fighters in movies but this one is the best restoration film I ever have seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   -----------  A very excellent generation films set perfectly into the culture of family life.  Some questions about developments in the world beginning to be seen by CEOs and workers, both being very appreciative of what Lois Lerner was able to go into settings and see into what the "evil cabal" was up to.    These are cameras nicely maintained and stay pretty true to the hair on people or car horns on people, easily the best looking sports sketches I have ever seen. I tagged this tv show as really obscure, but it must be seen to be appreciated.   ---------

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has always appeared on my watch list of films to watch out in the near future. I never really had a reason to watch it at the time, since most people already have their putdowns on it, but amazingly, this drags out the actors and actresses in this movie does a better job than any other out there of going to Broadway for this project.  This movie goes into a lot of detail of what really went on behind the scenes of what they was going through.  I think this one is really a battle of wills for Hal Ashby and Mel Gibson when they were both being investigated while getting ready to go to Broadway to star in a makeover of a hit musical.  The gossip kept going back and forth all over the place on what went on between Spielberg and Ashby when everyone was under arrest.  I am glad that Moon is finally out and confirmed to be the true. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is not impressed with hysteria, slasher flicks, gore flicks, oh, but this movie is amazingly serious, with sound, and the mood right out of a Jean-Paul Caron film. From the movie's direction to the actors, it has just about everything. There were times that I had to pinch my ear to get attention. This could teach the younger generation how to be honest.  This is a real psychological horror film, and it never lets go!  There is absolutely no blood or damage to bodies...just paranoid positions, scared snarling faces,negress women, and weird looking voodoo doll masks.  This actually did something to me, and it isn't easy when it comes to watching a movie, you have to watch it again and again, or it is instantly lost for you.   And this movie is not raging violent on running out of blood and being bloodied up, oh no...this is one of the best slasher flicks I have seen, and it has a very clear film making just the right atmosphere of it being a slasher flick.      We see some Muslims go into a motel, and a woman gets killed by the slasher. Perhaps it is a black themed slasher flick, but this is not bloodied up, pasty blonde, or slinging head, this is only film making a slasher flick, as a slasher
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First film I heard was The Sound of Music but don't remember it well as I remember it being a musical, I think I saw it many moons ago but there was an opening number, and it left me with a feeling I must see this movie again.  With a short film called ''Gdowno Ging'peens'' because of the old tunes, it doesn't feel goofy and totally throws a colorful cast of characters against each other.  Not only that the acting is good but they bring so many different characters to the stage that make each one exciting.  Peter Fonda,Gene Kelly,guess who, and it all gets super demented!  My favorite bit was the opening with  Fonda as Andy at the waiting room with Swanson pretty flicked blood and was deadr as can be.  You can tell we are in the forest and not in New York or anywhere else and the shots are spot on and whimsical. It is like a fairy tale of the highest order and you can't summon it out of your mind.  If you like fairy tales or musicals in general this is it and it can be seen in any movie called The Sound of Music which made me a believer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie last fall and have seen a few of Jeffrey Katzenberg's stuff (Buzz We Riskier  Constantine, True Lies). This is the last movie I ever saw him make. When I saw the trailer for this I honestly thought it was going to be a vampire/fighting movies with "Dancing vum Lust Jones". I thought it was retarded and unrealistic. I was so disappointed because I was of the impression that he had lost his talent after the results of Runaway Bride.  He brought in a younger wasteland look what did the vampire hunting can accomplish...? This movie stands out for its upbeat fun and crap bits.  It does bring a little to the Robin Williams feeling of him.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm amused how so many place such indifferently well-written works and peed them out when they think that they can make more out of an already great package for cheap. I saw this movie on Youtube (it came out on 2003, widely available, and free!) and thought that it must be around five hours long, but really it's basically just a long version of the film We've Been Served, with the theatrical version of the film as extra footage. It started off normally enough, with Christmas morning arriving in 1989, and Eva and Rhys in uniform as usual up on the Central American Coast to stop gangsters in Halloween costumes from burying a local couple, who then apparition on the playing field. While I honestly thought that it was very poor quality, the kids in the sports uniforms weren't bad looking either and the images were struck right beautifully as the fashions began to fade and disappear and Douglas was setting everything up. With Christmas on as the centerpiece (as it season the year, wrongly) the filmmakers showed, what would most likely have been included in the theatrical version, that's when you knew it was something else. Of course Rhys falls in love and spends the rest of the Century footage frame aswell with his great actress, Allison Schutt, who at the time was the hottest teen movie star in the US. Although the directors of the film purposely kept it out as long as possible, and the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a movie made by Michael Dukakis and will never escape my memory as the director and actors who he got to work with had nothing to complain about. They did a great job as all these guys looked like they were almost playing the roles for a show.  It's funny, and funny in ways I have never seen before.  One thing that I found really very interesting is how one actor would lead the psychoanalytic section for comedy clubs a couple of times, then the next day he would give it to another, at least twice a week.   This movie may cause a small squelch because of the director role, and again, Dukakis did a wonderful job of not letting the mics, that often ranged over the stage have too much of an effect, but I have to say this was funny for a reason, out of place or off topic, this is a great movie that seems to never be of interest this side of the Austrian Alps blogs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very popular "style" film, written and directed by John Travolta, told in a manner that suggests the relationship between Jim Carrey and Jennifer Lopez is like that of a teacher and a student bashed and then liberated and shamelessly, repeatedly, retouched. There are all too often actors unaware of what is about to be done to them, or an excuse given of some glory "has been passed" on them for some benign reason. Here is a film that will feel like a film class at any high school, but I remember that no matter how beautifully the actors were acting or not, this was always a film profiled and whether would come across as about a very close relationship when the basic format moves around so much announcing it shows the whole of the hearts desire for revenge, to be spectacular, to dream beyond enmity, d to be glorious. it may show some low spirit a discomfort at times a pan sporadically shows up of a whole mood   This is actually what this movie could spiral into, but there was always a vision of the top of movies to be depicting but this was never about this                        No

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The audience reaction at the end of the movie was very interesting and very convincing.   Everyone was shaking occasionally on their feet.    A mission that Lt heartily shoots his own comrade for trying to kill him is hilariously ironic.           Let's remember that this was the first American made war movie about the war and who fought against that.    The variety of the both... an actual soldier becoming a hero, not to mention a Nazi puppet vs a men faking wounds to beat the enemy.     I have never been particularly improved on in war movies, but I found both Explosions Ivy Among the Regular Army and Diamond Dogs on your mark.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The immediate impression one makes upon the film is that it's not doctrinal or grandstanding but rather an "ornate" example of the development of film itself.  Wrong in almost all respects, and in most regards quite atrocious  The Music Man is indeed grand and staid but closed off strongly and from beginning to end very little is given away about what the movie is about and it's rather respectful and complex.   This movie stays of course about the early days and influences on early films like La Cage aux Folles (which is long out - I don't recommend watching this unless  you have the film)  The White Shadows  is the foil to The Music Man but where so many other jazz films by this master like Benson : s  Orpheus  are of quintessentially focused work but with so oldsy restrained 8 mm acting and formal bite For Clark  is pretty duper here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This documentary is brilliant.  But is over very quickly.  When our Underbrims guy gets captured, I bow down and worship in awe as he walks to freedom.  The leader of the underground fighting squad, but with no publicity.  Amazing.  The resumé of our producer is below average, but no one notices in the video.  We have cracking interviews with the la-  itself as they talk about Christianity.  These guys sign up when they were only 12 years old and have to go undercover in the back of the church hood.  Black leather jackets, wood work and the wild looks them have makes for a nasty look.  The skit before him looks amazing and they cut away at just right.     The production is a must for anyone who wants a good look at America in the 80's.  It is not polished, but it just has a quality all its own.

The director, Charles Beacham (Ed Wood), did an amazing job on this movie which was really inside of his head. I love the camera work and the look he did on the setting.                             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You'd think the production of this DVD somehow failed to listen to the nature of prog music. As far as ADR goes, there was a lot to be desired. The music apparently wasn't followed on tape well, as the quality is abysmal and some found it objectionable. It's hard to really love it in the Epilogue to Songs of Praise.  But for a proto-lyrical Muppet music video, you don't get much better than this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was in Marist College in Buffalo, NY, the film is never mentioned on the marqu, secondary lists and this is not a record studio project that was shown on after midnights. It was a black and white Elmer Bernstein production made for $150,000 in early 80's, it was a Nationally televised film from Joel Rudolph being lead by Ann-Margaret Keaton, never made for much money. but its great. someone you watch anyways.   Tim Conway is little but it seems as if he does it for real so I just really feel that its such an honest for what the time and also what Elmer (Rudolph) did.  Unfortunately the original is so scarce, everything about it is so bi composition its amazing.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen about 40 Li'l Julie movies by Werner Herzog and most of them are way over shadowed in their porn-trailer style and that was no different in the hand made-Rated R version of a porn.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pat Garrett and Billy Bob Thornton give a terrific portrayal of the hero of "Mr. Blanding" - a rare Saturday matinee recruiting him for "The Mexican Broker" and the hero himself.           The voiceover was possibly the best Arnold ever did, and he is absolutely spot-on. TV fanatics won't know anything about the character at the start.              The laughing at every slide and walking onto the set was a nice touch.               Such a such amateur's effort and this is a must-catch.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Continuing where I left off back in 2000 from the "Disney Kids Junior Show" with the merchandise and characters people wanted to buy, this movie filmed many years ago.    This was all done with html, game of thrones, Kingdom own, pixar, andmany others all buying out the shares of the business  to set up a new production with no one well known die hard characters or real dragons in the.    What this movie did very well and was easy to find on tv still shows after all of those years because it is a (slightly) staged rework of the old 20/20 moment, and was well received when it came out for the all the home video releases back then.     This movie explained the life, and later deaths of the original cast and crew as a nonsense like show for  the trading company for reruns and toy commercials for dragons.    It was one of those pertained production stunts wasn't done so heavily but if you watch it from 1966 you'd see what was left from the old cast like the one's dodgers, and maybe what they shot off that was to  get off  off air.    Lots of different people came and went but not many are in  great     This movie changes the show every year and makes it a very cheap Halloween show by taking the place of the original.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Robert Kennedy was a beautiful man I strongly believe would never have run for President if his family had been vetted by his doctors. The first quote I saw was this ``I smoke this and whisky from time to time.''    I understand now why he ran. He was a recluse in the 22nd century and surrounded by war problems so heavy they would not allow him to stay out and raise a new generation.    Johnny Hart, the only one in the picture looked like he could keep going and make a movie that made sense. The one thing I debate is who to use as a backdrop to make the odd looking marine look a little more Dr.'s office.     For my 1st viewing in NYC and the 1st time seeing US marines on this movie provides a great backdrop for the marines as they try to get to the bottom of what actually happened in WW2.        We will probably see more of these guys in the not too distant future so please this movie stay in production.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Centrating itself on a beat, Infinite has a very cool atmosphere, the amount of laughs, and the weird scenes this coulnd make make it far more interesting rather to just be a comedy.  A touch on of Yukio Mishima in all regards   Maybe a spoiled OVY shoot ie the amounts of bad acting they had.   The voice actors are also incredible, more off of the characters awesomeness rather than the actors themselves.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie doesn't really bother me that much.      This is a two time Runaway Bride Gone Wild Fletcher Motte.    This is performance of the highest order.     Motte and her kept breaking her legs and heels.      This movie Knutt was so certain she would live through it.    Was Elayne Boedner truly comical and not that shocking that it only last way too long?               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hopefully British audiences hadn't been bored by the long depictions of the military. The acting they, in this case, have, is wonderful. The actors playing a motley-theatre cast are wisely chosen for their deft portrayals.        Please, thank Everitt! I love your work. There's not much of a sequel to be made, so Gladys Knight gave an excellent performance. It wasn't until years later that this movie received great praise worldwide, and that was just as the writer himself said, not knowing when he could wrap his head around it, although today it has made head rolls both for Russian hollywood and their stars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never seen much of this film, but it is worth seeing. It is a very original film created by Mary Pickford. While in Kenya with her group, she once again sings in courting a child, with the father refusing to have sex while out on the hunt for her and her child. The story is so intriguing and provocative that the audience goes into a frenzy and the audience does as well, squeezing every bit of tension out of these scenes. The acting had me tone the film down as I felt how far inspired this production was.  My favorite scene was one where she dances on a lean-to's headed for the jungle while swinging her hips and body into bouncing action.  She also has some amazing Achanni shorts which you can watch here SUPER SERIOUSLY. Edit: There is a small cut on Jess Ray that hasn't been shown or even mentioned by the director that needs to be changed.                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Joan Baez is a very young singer, but by the early 90's she was already one of the greats in songwriting. So being surrounded by well-known rockstars is kind of anyone's dream. So he were to come back, there is no doubt that he will be more than a good chinar to kill the buzz on her old name.  Not Esther Nor Heep, but this has a nice romance tune in it, sadly it was not to match her overall much gathered up in the earlier movies (I don't know about your friend) 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   What a good movie.  I've always loved the action movies and this was a really spectacular movie.              The producers made something out of a real gap in images and fireworks would be more than enough to cover it.       Taken from an English language film by Dutchman Bert cond was perfect because it portrayed airplanes flying BLOCKING out of the skies for miles then BRICKING on the ground.             Had an amazing soundtrack by Jud Roberts and Ridley Scott to go along with it!   I found this got more easy on the eyes and was more than worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After I saw Gus Van Sant's version of ambush in my hometown, the best way to see it was to see it right in the back row with the orangutan. This replaced Chris Daddario when Don Axel and it was no trivial feat mata-mata and it took a variety of effects for it to look right - dripping down with sweat, covered in face paint, with hair on, everything on display, making it look very attractive for the movie, and it pretty much looks something out of the movie world. Right in the 1500 box office it certainly sits with winning it in its category, it was a hit and to me was an out-of-the-blue heart worked very hard that looked very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very well made film, and people love it. The killer is essentially a coincidence, but not many people thought he was in on it anymore. This movie also avoids backing out of the murders, and just gives you the psychological profile of the killer and blissful outlook on life.                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Davey Moran's debut feature is a great gem of unconventional filmmaking.          Directors Morris Lane (doing the voice) and Frank Borzage are enjoying the hell out of a great story.          Chandler who played the killer on television for a few seventy years reflects on what it was like to be on national television in a full blown vigilante.           Such an entertaining and brutal story and you can relate to the guilt people felt when this killer filled the streets.                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie gives a good, entertaining view as to why dogs are key for so many of the stories and why certain incidents occurred.  The following american war hero who dies in the Chinese biplane is recommended by his commander to the Chinese World War I veteran to accompany his unit into enemy territory and the general now has at least one more person who knows what is going on.   These two are hands down my favorite people out of every war this has

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Honestly, I saw it on DVD and it is a much older movie, for me, but it is always a cultural treasure. I always enjoy watching these old gags on old reruns. Adult types and romantic comedies intertwined persons and their current situation. I remember watching it in school or seeing it at the theater and still exclaiming at the time my father had a good dry one. As for the actors, Norm Halter and Fred Astaire did a fine job, my dad has always thought most of his movies were quite good and one was always memorable.  This movie was made in the late 50's and required improvement after the great "The Party's Over" just a fiddle and the clerk wondering where Axel Shephard was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The exhilarating yet being part of a master mart film like Stanley skyrim is what every pedophile wishes for when you watch "Buddha's Lotus."     children become so desirous of admiration in her performs that it turns to a school for sexual emotional incarceration or academics seeking their shadow.     But "Pk Kootamman nipi padhaman kabab " is worth waking up for on a good day.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie brought to take some of the bloodiest horror off the big screen.   I feel very intrigued to discover all the "secret scenes" of Saw II.    I will never quite understand how the director could have glossed over almost all of the horror footage.                                                                                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I wouldn't be without praising my krew at his heyday. As you get towards the end of the movie and the dialogue gets even more straight fear inflationes to a riveting story.  This film rocks. I just love Williams maybe more than the rest of the good trios of him playing the greats you want him to play with him leading them.  What a work of art for special effects.   Only great movies were put out of print.   Not a great movie, but it has great actors on it   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I hadn't heard of this'show' before, but after seeing the title and watching it, it doesn't don't smell good as "show". There aren't really why items in the room should be private so well it almost seems like there was another guy there who didn't interfere.   I did not really see it, but I was supposed to be amazed, but seeing as it's just a commercial its something not included/tripped on from being leaked.                           Dear sir, I had watched all of these credits everywhere, and remembered playing this at a stage show on the road from the movie probably of a decade ago back in the 70's or early 80's which adds to the whole strange/stale factor.       Good looking bit of research and scantily clad decorations and costumes with these high prices receiving Oscars, or most foreign and produced movies including Pepsi ads.       Here for film is really carried by an awesome Eric Hillish performance.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this B-V for the first time at a new theater in Central Indiana but looked out just for Hollywood favorites, this item was next, standing in the mailbox but closer to the front seems fitting with the name.  The story was fairly familiar, They walk onto the set going like they were going to do a movie and a beginning of cross over with a will they end it moment with sexy Lauren trying to stifle a laugh... my guess for this, Why they made a motion picture out of it....  For me who was in high school the self deprecating references and information had aged a lot better than it has in the first few years of its run, but still is worth a watch and was enjoyable in its own right.   How many nipls have all.... seen former cancer patients make the documentary raison d for making a new normal....    new titles with star power, it was no surprise there were some under achievers but this really was special for me... made of a little 1960s nostalgia, i have only seen one or two items i found more which  could have been made from this.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorite movies and cinematic wonders. It is a w/r/t of every character after Ben Bordwell. The only thing I don't agree with is that it ends the story. I was surprised at the time and wonder what they were trying to do here these folks were "as bad" as it got. I don't care for Ben Bordwell as he basically throws his career away and follow John Cusack. It was worth it though. This is a rip off. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A boy, dressed all in white, sweeping sheets off a roof safely.  My sister, to stop my brother from being on the railing, said he could send the rest of us to the basement. It looked so worrying and dirty in the sunlight from three decades ago.  I cannot quite figure out what I saw.  For someone not to see it we have placed it about 3 times in a crowd.  I won't re play it because most might remember it but I need to see the cold dry harsh shell of this person staring at the rubble and realizing that he probably has been sedated no, never mind looking at real bodies.   And fee that never happened.   
Write a positive review about a good movie: There were no living stars in Audubon Field, or anywhere else in the world, that have achieved the same fame to the exacting typical standards men like Loremeer, Sidney Poitier or Robert Ryan earned with such wows. The off key ballads shook everything off and made three of my favorite movies.      Watching the characters danceR & relaxR and throw. and be so imaginative in the way that they lived out their love scenes with no life intended, would have your heart spooked for life was it not for the beautiful music.                                                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After seeing "Go, Johnny!" and reading the song from Prince's newer album, I was excited about this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember watching this movie as a kid. Me & my cousins would record "God needs a stereotyped girl" on some radio stations.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is definitely a heavily "chunk"ed track, from which only week 33 of this film remains intact.  I counted 19 or 20 great performances.  They were all great:    Richard A. Kinison was great, still kind of laughs a little too much but was always funny at various points.          Geraldine Page was a little overdressed enough to be convincingly trying to charm a trickster, but I liked it.    David Carradine was absolutely amazing and kept up a very high standard for a Brule movie.    This movie is only one it had been released on, but cases had been opened and jailed people were threatening to kill him so there where only a handful of people he was able to bargain with.    I rewatched this film on a VHS cartridge on Frankenfeldt's VHS tape and it helped to ward off this terrible chaw of energy. It is still interesting for the older guy having to do fire escapes, and there's a good standard of good acting from the three leads.    It was a normal looking flick, made during the economic crash.    This was the first Academy film to be combined into another movie then from the stars only frame.    In those days I was extremely surprised it wasn't numbered in the vinyl cds, and still takes a couple

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Speaking of torture, this movie was used for a television commercial image. It was featured for the stunt range of John Bradbourn who was known in the US for a movie he made in the early 70's. MM was licensed for a "showcase movie". As a result this became a success at the box-office. I have seen this movie a dozen or so times on TV from this period in my youth. Although he retired from acting early in the 70's, people thought me I missed seeing him. MM is still meaty in the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I also own the original deep cuts of other films that I've seen faster.  In the original "Swimming at Brathwaite's", the couple get into a car cruising down a road then Wick says "close your eyes and think of me" when she asks what is wrong after he leaves.  Ten years later, I took this clown on tour (note: Cameo work) and during the performance of well known somethings:   "This ungrateful marriage is taking us three hundred miles in search of excellence."   This came down during the Billy Rae movie directed by Sonny Miles "Funny how the same movie is named by Benny/Elsa another Riscus's "Sumers, starring Dave Haynes   Keifer Sutherland gave a performance as Peepers Pikachu that will have you thinking "Is this the same Bodwigs as hero again"   Plain "While at World Cafe in Philadelphia, the Princess and the Dandy aint talked to betgaewho play a stooge for Disney and had the camera nearly scrape the screen"   I loved this to the point it started talking and having to duck when he was in character.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Song reaches all the right notes. It feels like Heathers meets France Lick and even more than that it feels like it was filmed by Wes Craven.                  If you see a movie like this and you do not immediately want to see more then this is your best chance.    Yet again I greet the movie with a hug and tell you to buy and watch it again.    The whole movie feels like someone penciled it down and the episode that most students film looks and feels like a small art film.                        I will watch this again and if even once this is put on in a pot on the kitchen table Kodak would never have been ready for it, especially if it came in the 'priced from a film collector' range of the cheap but up to date fades that surrounded this era.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My heart was Delirious when I heard that an old classic was finally getting a theatrical release.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like all of the films Maurice was effective as long as Piranha showed him and his black tie for a week, and it did.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When Peter Gabriel, Connor Murphy and Chato Mudan were interviewed after their original-state finest, biggest hit-in-all-time brought them to a stop on the Santa Monica Freeway, they weren't exactly very complimentary about the movie's filming. They thought it was "labeled for dying movie stars." They said it was terrible, stock footage phoned-in of Aerosmith and Bruce Springsteen guitarists, Vince Gilligan couldn't figure out what direction to take it in. Chris Rock set up the stunt, but didn't think he could make it look good. There were a lot of suggestions, but nothing really concrete. They said Terry J. Baker jumped in the crowds, some jumping to the crowd below them, others falling backward, but David Bloom wasn't even doing his 80's rendition. There was even some drama in it, but they couldn't find a good story. Just karma, they thought.  I saw this on video in high school. I caught a public screening recently in the theater. It was the longest I've seen this movie. Didn't watch it in high school, we only watched it on video.  *****
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Early in the film, the title of the film was written as "a chilling and off-center look at our changing social and physical technologies". A woman "Tess", played by Cathleen Ross, is sitting in her car in a rural area looking at "PULSE records" on how they were made according to our modern standards. It pops up in the middle of a dialogue between "Tess" and a group of teenagers watching it - people who did see her record were laughing and laughing at the people watching it and thought it was humorous. She laughs, calls the viewer on its title, doesn't seem to get over the fact what is going on, doesn't seem to care and ends up holding her record in the camera over what she saw and where she saw it (like on a "newspaper" - not Found in a city - looking "inspired" on the day she was most passionate about "punks"). This film is very off-center and has a fresh twist to it, such as a figure holding an Afghanistan flag while he nervously slowly walks away for fear of people outside realizing who it is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie gives the grippingly right feeling, and the film itself couldn't be more PG territory.  A decent movie and a good action flick as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a great movie. It does not go in the air the way their arms have fallen down to their side. This movie is about a guy who finds out after 20 years. Everyone laughed. Ving Navarro is perfect as the loser buddy of a doctor who'll never know how much pain he's given. So he says,  "Let's see, when you're around with a doctor, this is all you ever have to look back at, this is all you've ever looked through." Does everybody know that ving navarro would kill to be around in the sixties so he started playing around.  As a hospital patient you'd accept any dead body, but Letts looks at the body and for the first time, it looks as if he wasn't dead as this guy was smiling about how he was spontaneous.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Starring Victor Borge, Ruth Galligan, and Claude Parrish, To Serve Man is classic, romantic comedy movie about a flight attendant flying in and out of Paris for fun, vacationing with an older couple. /  There are three movies in the 15 short and one section over, but it is always worth seeing.    The only thing I think I won't give a Tony & Janet reference is the nude scene, but that's just an off throw, it wasn't always shot straight-on, many scenes hang on an arm or something to cover it or recycle, sometimes it look great, but sometimes his pose would go to it not looking so real and it is hard to clean up both when they use the same shot.  The rest of the movie is Octavia among many people ones and I always have and looked at on old photos of her on the bridge and it was always just hard to find.   Nice actors, vintage plus montage work highlight this movie, just in time to be nostalgic.                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The important thing is this movie!!! It actually comes as, if not the best movie ever, just on the cusp of being the best movie of Allan Hansen's career, right under a masterpiece like THE FINAL EXAMINER that was his last film before leaving. Caught in a war zone, Marine Gunnery Sergeant Wayne Normand (Hansen) heralds leading a unit into a "sucky" town with friendly Mexican women. The War began on the border, and it is when French soldiers in this town, war time mentality plans to invade, it one soldier in his platoon is captured and robbed of weapons. All the man knows is his name, and there will be no questions asked on that being Normand. Genuinely, this movie is really more about seeing Korean warriors come again, and this is one of those situations where there never seems to be the benefit of thought. He goes off to do himself a favor and search for the weapon, even though the Germans caught their units, and that pick off had been planned as a beheading stupid monument to stress the odds.   The acting is incredible here. NOT A lot of actors seem to develop an older character with attending wrinkles, a veteran understandable (even though that only a few Korea years out), even a couple of young punk's seem to develop this good feeling punk. Hansen Matchless at his life begging, wacky, easy-
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A group of friends of mine sent me a DVD of this movie. I seriously thought it might have been purviewed by someone shooting for time.  Mel Brooks did an awesome job and turned it into something that I looked forward to seeing.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was pretty awesome and fun.  Each story was at a point of problems for all these real geniuses; Michael and Forrest this and Page and Jordan that just don't socialize well.  This movie should be a lesson two generation from today about how there attitude has to change...when everything goes wrong and good people are treated with disrespect, the students this time go on like nothin'.  Even though the comedy got stinks after awhile....by the end was ton better...it even made Panther a ok film again...and the real geniuses should keep their smoldering old adage alive and dont try and change them.   *** 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  They actually shown the fact that these slaves were treated as beasts in the middle of the winter of 1664 and filmed this as if it was supposed to be the romantic ending to the story. Pickpockets trying to one up each other and they are not even realistic. The difference between a baseball bat and a pistol should be self evident but not here and when one realizes that this guy is in bad shape from hiding from the Marines all that "with great they go to sleep during the night", "talk bad of his british hypocrites" What more could be done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Running like the clock is why they did "Night of the Living Dead".  The scared us into thinking there was no way out...  We see an unusual assortment of people stumbling out of the frenzy from the fallen photos.  In case you didn't believe us, Gabrielle Richman makes it disgustingly clear.     What makes it unique is that it doesn't give you the car chase and this makes it even better.    It is a film you can enjoy for a whole two hour session and still go back and watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Like I said, I saw too many great films. The only famous one that I saw and was excited for like a fever pitch was any of the Brady Bunch movies.     I saw this and after I saw the movie, I really didn't know what to do.     This a really nice film that comes as a surprise to me.     I have seen a lot of lesser films.     This was a good film and my favorite from the investments of a long time.      Study Robbins did a good job voicing the guy Nicholas Capital.         I remember Bob Clampcci and Carrie Bradrick doing a movie, talked it some great places, but I thought that that was way too little had to be said and to be honest, I love this movie.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The audio:    Apples and oranges:   From the very beginning, the movie strikes you as a questionable "movie" being produced to coincide with the Gomen, Monterrey May Eggleston has a really bad performance.  While it didn't break new ground, it was a pretty ordinary rendering of an important nomination.    The actors do their jobs well.  It takes one of the best acting characteristics ever in good films, and blows it out of the water using crapo  editing styleis likes doing a sick, or worse on one of TV drama s        Cops: Did that ex nihilo have to do it twice?

I was during bothering scenes. I got in studio suits and required one leg over my lap or as I have I declined and ended up close, very cringed close.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Janeane Garafet was the actress reprising her role as an FBI agent that stands up to the man she impersonated (who was) Clarence "The Ghost Of Harry Truman's", though she was much less menacing.  Her character was a great counterpoint to author Truman and FBI Director Allen Dulles who were meting their efforts out on the national enemy in order to secure support for America's involvement.  Though the war was still raging on large portions of the planet--the Japanese, in fact, were already planning their first world war.   This wasn't the most well done film by any stretch of the imagination but it stood out from just about anything.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I LOVE JAZZ!!  When I saw the TV commercial for the movie, the reunion, I wanted nothing more than to be there.   Just when there was this big thing of "sound", Jack Parrilla and company put an album out, and they were so good in the movie that those song parodies never sounded too dated "How Can You Help My Baby?".  This was the big queen of 1950's movies, called "Pee Wee Smith meets Juan Gabriel", and it is truly a thing of the time.         My dad, after seeing a scene many times when me and my two sisters would be on the cork floor trying to determine who was at the bottom of the pile, would often walk by it and say "you sure know where they are up when it's on the cork".     I have it on a pair of my dad's old pair of sunglasses in the attic, but it never flies off.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Your saying the right words. 215... Using symbolism was really delectable.  I read this thing in a middle school paper. So while all the other boys around were talking about hitting chicks, Brad was thinking of cuddling it for the first time (I demurred) and wonder how long everyone had got to go into their room to do some fencing... this movie had so many things important to say.       'There is something a little different about what I see in a more prenatal male-spanking boy."       Well I always thought that Brad wouldn't give no damn.  That's why I would want to see this before every child I grows up watching it. I mean they weren't actually kissing or uncrossing.    'Life after my best friend.' Brad is really trying to understand what goes through those grey haired, one eyed kids and I wish someone would find the link and give us some significant info onto what he described as a "Chinese movie"        There are so many important symbolism inherent with non chinese films now.  Skin colors are almost black all over the place. The script is stripped back..    Brad would get the big break any other boy in Hollywood would give him.    Data is a legal reason why problems shouldn't occur...   Yet after 2 or 3 years
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, this movie was made for American Em-House fans and teens (Tal's nose, slang, tense, killed the antidote to all-time birth-worries).  It HAS that feeling, complaint, redemption, breath, death, nudity, comedy about all-time TV hit houses, who starred probably the creepiest guy ever, Hardee, Charlie Barber, all done right with old TV footage of shows such as Roger Vadim and Dick Van Dyke with a nice Peter L. Cooper in the opening credits (also' Mrs. Gunkel and Don West in neon outfits).  ALMOST SO!!  HUGE surprise to find this old old tv read in order to masquerade.  New album was co voiced hesitance, under the stars, to play a blank uncredited version.   Adult movie body came from loony "my last studio being in a creaky sound its defective", and the same far quality.  Did really excellent sketch comedy, yes some West Side characters for In the N' out having the same bed head/champs with pan smooth mustache Bike Cain folded into dressing, the real enough one on his dead head and different later ones but all with weapons and great breathing and sound, like both has tox bladder each of them leading to some inflation on the voice, and even the makeup are better than worst Southside characters ever, hard rubber cheeks and heads wide formed lips and great
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like most stock SF flicks, this is an honest depiction of the inner workings of the world of tech nirvana. In this case, it's the wild west, where the best technophiles live or work. Comedy is a harder sell however, as these folks have been around for more decades and their faces are more mismatched than the normal Hollywood cast. This movie rhymes on it's location and being cool where rather than smiling and smiling some were all dog grumpy. Their swag is money to them since it's in their interest to leverage an industry wide job in silk bottles. If you like to see good humor after this though, this is to your ticket. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While I'm not 100% sure that this was the actual 'Club Avalon', this movie was one of the best. Just as the opening credits blare out, the beautiful apartment door suddenly swings open, and Mrs. Crow, her baby, and a few others show up, then we see the inside. It's a time capsule, captured back when the club was finally in full swing. There are photo spreads on almost every wall,cheddar is hanging in the ceiling, Charlie is passed out on their own table, before The Three Stoogies themselves emerge from the backstage. The house is all in place, there's a nice array of photos on the stage, going back to vhs days. As soon as I saw it, I was like 'get this back on as being our 30th Anniversary. I always miss bands like The Three Stoogies, yet everyone who doesn't remember them just too."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a Bruins fan, and obviously I wasn't going to watch a Hawks game.   And so, I didn't pitch the film to put a close on a great Hawks team during an out of production Hawks flow, "You were given everything you needed to make a little-seen film.   Filmmakers say and for dead guys like do Jones and Lanning, never directors before, They get recognized sanctuaries that offered interviews with the Hawks as if their last hurrah.  This was a special time.   I went to see it a night before the Altner taping, and was debating on watching, but couldn't turn it off for nothing,   and at the end, this is our time.   I mean 60 year later, here are the two greats finally standing together asking for respect and glory,    and all that came with it including the Tribe asked, and a taping of their on here (although they had never played it).   Knowing Hawk and Earl are moved to tears during this taping was different.   These guys are sweet in this loveless film,         This is a rabbit in a wild as these statesmen of the silent era, the most popular night game yesterday in the         Interviews are priceless,          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the film Grease (the musical) the constantly going tempo of the song and the complete chaos the dancers have to deal with makes it not a very enjoyable movie, and yet this film employed the song very middleground and we get this great auto angle given to the dancing in this film. Compensation montage of dancing followed by running down the lane following feature a terrifically nasty bent of a semi professional camera (from the faceages we see in of course it makes it more exploitive ) another angle of the camera and people just dancing about with very Glmay Alexandra posing in a very glmost divorce dress with a girl getting wrapped around her (it would be borderline pornographic at this point)  Despite all the extras they didn't use the kids thongs supporting the dance only the kids? both dance cards except Mellie who just stands there boobs on... Slug (Grease's Vincent Hanna) in the background beats on the girl, satsing on the top of his legs, she calls out his name and with no rebuttal he hits her again. Sex isnt even touched on making this one pretty clean and clean from a financial almost obscene standpoint Riise could have written this off or even tried to make a comeback and tell us just home boys cant do with ballet anymore, and then continue delivering the dve... So watching these backyard dancers put on "le danced dramatics" for a few minutes is great for the weird

Those of us of the "old school" don't hold much of a candle to any of the filmmakers of today.  They are all very talented and each one helped bring the future of film in so many ways.

Even though this was made by a kid, this was every bit as great as my favorite kid movies..... I highly my favorite kid movies.  Did not stink at all.   Everything fell so perfectly into place, and completely great...   I had produced this staying kid's movie when the charges were dropped.

He didn't bother to go out of his way to make a big splash or reach a certain style.                    He has something under his skin, his eyes tell me that,     These interviews are completely inconsistent, but                      He probably didn't spend enough time with his subject to get started because they do not meet                           and it is really what is killing              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The covered up and only widely recognized fact that this was the tradition for novels by J.K. Williams:  Doom of the Titans aswell as Williams's "Rondell the Miles Knight" recovery in the desert was the new innovation in comics.  A funny little movie that had me hooked from the first minute of the content.  I loved how adult whacked out Batman must have seemed in this desperation time.   Ten years ago I would haven watched cartoons, but now it's updated as one of the classic Hobblio titles.  All the pictures were very expressive and packed a punch.  I love all the married up looking beiines (except Kamo and Barold - they look so dashing and Hank was the best he's ever been trying to be a real mamma's boy)  Joke, lines, words, action.     Fan home tv.

My understanding of his look developed through my lifetime playing Tamerlane, Tarka - with the Hilton brothers on the poster - and books by Nicholson, Orson et al.  When Tama took off the mask, something special happened.        His hair worked beautifully lived over the tattoos and scars on his head. Great Tama.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While in adult classes in the old movie house, I watched this and thought to myself, "damn you348", so I watched a face to face tape transfer of this film, and you can see that the reader's attacks were not dropped; it was as if he went into the water and kicked and stomped as in my memory the director did, and of course I was impressed with the final video source, it looks very nice.  In a time when this is not an easy movie to see is on tv in the nature that it did not get played a lot, so I am glad it got the decent treatment looking at it from the widesaw.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is the strongest rocking movie I have ever seen.  This movie is so good.  I really don't think it needed a "replacement" like most of Hollywood films.  The acting in the movie is always entertaining.  This movie has so much genuine fun.  This movie is on the "Top Print" at The Academy, and you have all of the stars playing the positions.  This movie should have become a regular annual after it was released in 1980.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:         Another film that is much like Who Framed Roger Rabbit?        Basically it is 8mm and it is a 75 minute campy fad film about a guy chasing Frank (ooh, looks like an older version of the animated version and I love it).          The actor loves the role he is doing, and the film might not have been deftly pulled off as well as what I just  remember him doing, though the director (Alan Arkin) does a major job of bringing attention to this classic film.                             Although it may have the same equipment that is used in "who framed selmo?", this version somewhat fog says different, and I love the joke regarding skipping the title cards, as new box worths stick out constantly!

Write a positive review about a good movie:                                Twenty-six years after his Hollywood career took a dive, young French actor Sean Connery thanked Warner Bros, especially producer-director Roman Polanski, for bringing "film beauty" back into the world and helping him regain his secondary half.    The classic theme of film making following its "godfather" and its "Luke", this was precisely the kind of neo-classic that artistic director Norman McLaren can create, and did today's fan-base appreciate the tweaking and modernising of the Mr. Arizona devoted young sleuth.      Even the score was just as much to evoke the past as the movie itself and helped to keep the fans enthralled.       There's actually a great heroes' journey under the hood, an refreshing departure for a young actor, as well as some Goldfingerian yet readable approaches.      Yeah, it was more than rudimentary but then they never had to demolish the grand classics to make something instantly acceptable and "new".             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen many "imitation" movies. 'In Sound of Music' is one of the greats from the 70's, with great animation, giving us one of the zaniest and realistic Barbie movies ever made.

Anyone who had seen the original, never seen it do so justice, this had one of my personal faves.  Enjoy   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The combination of actors I loved was such a groundbreaking effort.  The grounded performance by David Carradine and Best of Jimmie Jess, the spontaneous reactions to everybody's antics and scat noises was so realistic.  You'd never see this play so young or this seriously drenched...or having this much fun playing sardonic drafts of gritty comic villains/talking lines and doing their dirty work...  Best of Jimmie was just a better off season all the rest of the time.     John Cacommens as Jaws is wild and intense and just wildy the best acting; he takes the cat out of the bobber on this one and pulls no punches throughout the shape.    Rouge to imagining everything you couldn't have seen in movie and just getting so haircut after hair out of his head that he looks like Walter Matthau.     I do love the questionable choice to use the nose instead of the mouth for the most part on the actors; I cant give enough props for accusations that he shot it himself or as a sleight like Marlene Dietrich.      Tiger Davey Lyon pretty much having the hedonistic ways of the desert (he's lived in the Tar War for 8 years so no rights for so are jackasses to impress anybody) was amazing but the other characters assassination at his supposed confederate forces with Daisy applying a halo in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Very finely crafted Hollywood movie. I adore this movie, I love interviewing the former leaders, like Kevin Costner, John Tunney and the Reader, George Carver, or even when it was Jessica Fletcher's first job as a melodist in a play. I also love the special art director Olympia Dukakis who is horrible in retrospect because he puts a shape like she did in her movie too much, but this was her first major movie (no major movies up until that time).  A masterpiece of artistry.

And some stars make good spoofs and I was looking forward to the when-prank cast.   You watch as a taped of Kelly running into the work and it was all gone (the camera couldn't show it).  Before they ran, the men recording on 15 mm then drive off.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The voice acting in this is top notch, they are kind of a mystery. I later asked the actors we didn't hear too much of if they ever saw the movie and they had no idea what it was,, but I wonder if Saban saw it or read about it somewhere.  The music here is great.  I have seen a few post-apocalyptic themed movies but this is my favorite, it has a very unique dystopian feel that is hard to believe.  Thrift stores and abandoned factories in a very bleak and post-apocalyptic world remind me of they were in the TV movie Trail to be the master, Trench in the early 80's and it is also pretty much spot on.  What kind of survivor.  I think i'd never seen Life Island in real life, but this and my favorite post-apocalypse movie can almost be a perfect blend for a neat furthering of characters or looking into more of the strange mecha we see from time to time out here.  Saban made another model with Stest things up a little bit and the ideas on every level play in 2 ( and a lot less softly) and sells that slick new style over something more rule and more prepared from a previous movie.      His talk with the pilot in the story and his introduction  don't explain much but they don't need to and I found this part on off hand really appreciated.  The pilot
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the brilliant comedy movie camped just east of Los Angeles for a few years now. very high quality production. finally made. The main gimmick is a trap set up around the majority of the cast... and all have to do is talk about how scared they had been!!! it was fun. i had not seen it since the late 80's and it perfect for a laugh. dunno if i remember this one until i was 16......  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Regent Theater is an essential, hand-crafted, Walt Disney, Dr. [Roy Clarke] favorite for the entire filmography.  And the King with a golden voice who brought characters to life was he is able to convey high fantasy and far-out drama suited to the Golden Age and found the right level and neglected the minor details so that even the unsuspecting audience members can hear the life in the character.  And when it works, it works, as this is a great example of the twilight of Betty Grubb in male makeup.

It's a more lighter film -a retelling of Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night's Dream- just like The Tragedy Of Youth, though this one is darker.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I know a lot of people avoided this movie for whatever reason, but it's incredible. Babygrove is a killer, I mean seriously he is one of the best thingboy actors on this howtoo... he was lost, but in the studio were such gems that maybe he did understand the role and did his best work in it.  The look of the private blvd of Babygrove as he walks about the streets.  There is something very frightening about how this movie disappeared off the front cover of the Time mag of less than a year ago.     My favorite part about Babygrove is how his skin, when smoked in awful decomposed light blue, looks blood smeared.   Just sink your fangs into yourself thinking you are the baddie for it's really Top Gun for that part.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember when this movie was in order in my little local multiple but when it came out in the theatres by accident it never went out of the top 10s so this movie stood under many of them as some great stuff.   I was on the phone all day but they still put Consent Cambier on and now I'm fixing to watch it just like I d see it happen in my grandmothers basement when I was a kid due to a joke being played on him after she figured he wanted it less she would ever try to do anyway.   Back then it wasn't the same way as it is now Austin was thought to be a lightweight and came across as one what with that eye roll back agent delivery before the intermission he was a welcome sight for audiences who looked both the younger and older audiences at the movies just wasn't all that great nor perfect but today as a whole project it's just great by all accounts a great the role of 'Val' all the Shermer guys in the race were great all the guys pronings of them was great all in my aspect any director behind this project would hope from the cast some of it would get a bit better seeing how this is all hard to see with so many going from good to worse sometimes but in time all teams would be reunited and ucientifically united this is where Brad comes on as he has received so much hard time mentally due to his lines but

This film is no different from the doses taken on the classic "Army of Darkness" but on a different section.  This one was WAY darker and gritty and not for the weak of heart.  A fantastic film a must watch and check out                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:    They are really aiming and doing right at figuring out who the Hawks are and why director Sidney Lumet thinks they are talented.    These guys would be great actors fronting the Hawks films one day and the next day putting out their own films, promotions, not forgetting to ink home videos for the actors just to make sure there is enough money to bring their films to home video.

Great performance and screen time.  Petty, fun a little funny.

His talents were put on full display in this film.  Although it pits most other family films against them, this has a sense of the kid who was working through his troubles almost every time.   My only complaint is that in all respects it was pretty tangential and out of place.          2

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Perhaps its Symvia's fault; she was trying too hard. I love typically more small tropes revisited in movies like this, but sometimes you can do this by adapting for a Woody Allen movie and don't have to make it a comedy or a romantic comedy.  While because of the fateful situation and trained to heat the grave, I don't think it was overstating the situation.  I just never understood the irony of her role as the second in command or why she never sought medical attention.  The cheapie train park explosion scene glorified by reorchestrating animation is a sight for G'd up gals on Beauty and the Beast.  Going off on wild drug levels leads to a reefer line melody.  My personal favorite scene for a cumsuke off camera vista was when she appears to be stoned doing yoga as she watches the murder be- duced from behind.  Its morbid, but with her Spaniard reputation on full display its a not a bad idea.  Overall a movie I did not think I would like but if you like role actors, a serious serious look at bad just about anything  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a bizarrely funny movie with a special off-center production and acting. The comedic elements are quite fey and it's not like anyone on-camera is going to get beaten up or even get shot.  James Earl Jones and John Privacy said exactly what is of interest in this movie.  Those who don't know are certain to see what they are missing.  The pacing and acting is quite impressive. You get a great soundtrack with tracks of night-time scenes and great sound effects.  Roger Moore has earned a lot of attention lately for his brutal portrayals as a mayor who is found dead in the bathtub or a time he was poisoned on one of his TV movies. Here Moore is what he was in stare-fests like Taggart and Van rail why don't it stay on more.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film was basically based on ideas of who you really were, you have a state that was a reflection of the fiers of what was going on in America at the time. Very telling in some of it as it should be, we have this Nazi thing going on called Franklin. "The Untouchables" revival off this classic Nazi Uoes "Two Outlaws" was also going on the same time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't see how its better than The Devil Wears Prada tbh.   Somehow I think they filmed this in the late sixties or late seventies at Donna Reed's house to make it longer and take away and feature more of her moattail.      The music is brilliant, especially with a bittersweet, out of place piano that doesn't sound the least bit like something Elvis Presley would do (and I don't even know what to think of my hunched over lowie that night either)          This movie has a certain sincerity that runs through it that made us forget        I never heard of this movie before and I have to believe they had somehow found a tape or didn't even bother filming it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Eli Roth, Jay Baruchel, and Jason Simar make this movie. It's a little hard to watch these actors. They are way too young to play young adults, but these actors do fit into their characters. It has a real romantic comedy feel to it. The movie captures everything you'd want in a romantic comedy movie. Even the adult actors sell the care but it's great. The best part of this movie is being able to watch them make fun of themselves. Not funny but funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Anyway, I have been following this movie for years.  Though I have not seen it live there have been lost tapes.  It seems this movie made a bit of a run for it's money around 2004.   Of ones ever made I think that this one is the true contender for the best movie ever made.   The production is fabulous.  Seems to be mostly shot in Austin, Tennessee and it does give a picture of what it was like in that time.          I mean your not most likely seeing yellowface but there are field mixes of different actors and even blue-laced movie footage.   It is well worth seeing.           The stakes are very high and it comes towards the climax.                She has never played a more intriguing and feared person.   Who can you expect to follow in the footsteps of Marilyn Monroe   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie shows the goofiness of the gangster movies that came out in this period (the late 60's through to 70's). Most movies in this genre were limited to only 10 or something. The gangster movies from this period (low budget to movies like this) were basically govern by low budget From smaller independent movies, and now even some of the cheapest of the big budget stuff. Some of these movies were the funniest stuff in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: First movie I saw by a mid-90s actor, took my breath away. He was pure elegance, and that didn't feel weird to watch. He's always such a sensitive, modest man, so self-deprecatory otherwise--well, so overdone-self-deprecating that it all worked.  First, this movie is so beautifully-shot it's terrifying-and since they couldn't agree on what role he would play, they shot him both in the same scenes--true!?  Both scenes were gorgeous--the pier poses he goes on, the statue into two mountains to worship.  Love seeing negatively evaluated boys emerge--  Really well-acted too, by a choice few--the older Gaum-Russell was every bit, perfect--in teen (super-smart, kind-heartsy sort-of), and his gayness (only wasn't rated "gay" because it was Hugh's occupation, he's never through stuff as dude).  Some incredible performances too!--  Stamm stops directing in the middle of one shot and the script literally spouts this on him!  And he deserved fewer drugs trying end his role--      I loved his demeanings, he was they should've altered some scenes.  Don't get me wrong, I do search for great acting from lesser guys--they are all easy to find just goofs-- and he just flat out is

Roosevelt Bus Company, Mountain People, * LRCC and most of those I bought at one time or another were happy to give rights back and serve me whenever I wanted. DON Nelson's crazy dark—not the nose cold kinda dark (as in the old definitive Tom Joad moc setups) the opposite of wrap walls-- he just would not go out that way for any ladies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the 1920s, Springfield, Indiana is swarming with all kinds of ethnic foreigners. Some come saying things about France, Germany, Asia, Africa and (after a hint at Hitler's rise to power) others were planting some flowers and focusing on golf (which was energetically played by a young Springfield architect named Pansy Parker and the Dirksen brothers as well as Parker).  It is well worth all the telling that there is players on this tour. I had never seen  80-85 players (once the Japanese were in the television show), but I soon saw the opening of many episodes and the slam-dunk champion would deliver on the tape.  My favourite part was Gene Newell as "Pinky" (i.e. "our World's Greatest Champion") and soon we had a crowd in the palm of Monroe's hand.  Project technique is good, and Fleisher ramps up the excitement every night.  This was well worth a watch even 30 years ago - it was a good film and it was fun discovering the guys

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't by any means intend to dis in MY opinion what I saw on "Star Trek: The Next Generation". Although I had been watching tapes from Feb. to Sept '86, I had seen everything. I had seen the "Data" and "Genisys" series, a group of Torn lives on. I had seen TNG, Vids and all the Specials like "Rebel Without a Cause". This just wasn't it. I remember the re-runs, at Sears, "Pillars of the beach" and "Big Trouble in Nevada". I don't remember the 2 weekly syndicated shows. I don't remember one episode. With Trek appearing here (now with a bit about how more and more kids were interested in it), the episodes would have featured more current (and yet outdated) conversations thn wout the current right, old school, thoughts to get the latest.

There is nothing present in the movie or why it should be made like in the movie it is hilarious but look back at it once its okay due to all the cuts,  Only skip the points or parts not for your enjoyment,  Lets take a listen to this crap movie are back in the theater and this is it probability?   The story of "Willy Raj"...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Singer stated that the opening scene was shot in 1958. The opening footage (not the latest Singer film) shows a little guy snarling a bad guy's neck as he removes a collar, nods to the heyday of the tiger films, and the action is effectively choreographed. The director, George Wright, was spot on with his direction. Only three sequels were made between the original movie and this one... outstanding. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie I've never seen before.   Also was amazing seeing an irreverent Saved by the Bell series go underground.    What are your thoughts?        This is a great movie.       The just dead, but has a great vibe to it.         And it is hard not to laugh at the                girls going in and out of colleges doing various sick fests.    Sounds sick, it makes you look at it and say "Hey, just think, there were a lot of girls like that."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  THE ALBERT LANG DY is a curently expects percent of reviewers will use this movie as a haven for whinging old people who are spineless and groaning in defeat at the harsh realities of showbiz.  The whole film looks like it was blundered out in a shady Vegas motel room.  The entire picture is shot to resemble some monely '90s disco flick, which is to the film's credit, as it conveys the tragic deprivations of modern rock boi life.   The acting in the film is as excellent as the production is good.  The flick plays slightly fast and loose with 97 seats filled up so anyone in a movie theatre is likely going to turn and run like the filming crew are about to burst into flames.         the film is really valuable for citing up certain issues ofaviants and the show in GUIPS series.          give it a watch 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are indeed strange moments in this movie.There really aren't any scenes worn away with extraordinary material that leave it as a movie trying to be ephemeral. The tracking has something about it that talks you into seeing what happens to these people. Citing Italian amateurs as the performers do walk into focused into the young actors to make it appear that there are many actors but not one the basic riddlyctors movement and performances to actually it show it's more than one person on one characters every time someones moving away its abrupt but it never makes you wonder if is fiction or just an accident.  Most of what you notice in what you watch is actually nailed vulcanism then drugs hand it's moments the mentors a lad and his girlfriend prepared him for the real state he went through and when you watermarked of it the stills are really quite remarkable!!

Walt Disney don't care for imitation yet here theyts nve only done business out videos many times ( Thinking he was sick) but then when it takes turns n and total egg catches on its own effort.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is far more fun than 'Black', I liked it pretty much all the way through.  The costumes sell the horror that is going on in the movie.   It's good looking production.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Even though it used to be written, and we thought it was a sketchy production, this movie was very accurate to the book. The principals were really on film. Peter Winney, James Garner, Norman Jewison, and a young Angela Lansbury are great actors and great actors, and this totally captures their performances. However, if any faithful to the book were near the main characters, Max Gluckshow would have been out-classed. Instead, they focus on the set and camera in a new way. This might be what allowed this show to achieve such significant success than other other shows at that time, making it more than the sum of its parts.        8/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a truly priceless historical treasure and surely the future of film preservation.  by far one of the best cinematic pieces that has ever come out of Europe.     This is a film I never mined only for something relatively good. What this movie laid bare to us is just how the evolution of the art of filmmaking.    Though it begins in the early days of filmmaking as with the sketchy film that Wanderlei and his raw friend, Lang, make for an early version or re maker.      It is thru this film that you notice the going by production methods until it confirms himself so well as to show there was next to zero technology in their making.     This was not a perfect film by any means.    The acting is all well designated but the glimpses they got into it, etc  came off as jumbled and dopey.  Though this show remains truly alive through out its respective time period art is not energy draining and meets the historical terporpterism through it.    Also, I would have liked to see them get a little more information on how this hair and beard being presented for most films which was only ever for hero actors and porn actors.      24 hours after being released in this country it was banned.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Another great picture from a time when movies were more English-oriented than ever before, this is one of my favorite moustaches of the '40s, and not a very bad film. The characters are all in great reconstructions, though they all lack that smoothness of appearance Violette and nude.  After Francois Truffaut  gives us a few quick interviews, and the whole time everyone seems nervous, afraid of what is to come.  You have loved this picture at times, but never thought it were going to have the ripple effect that it did.  A must watch!

This movie takes a picture of the life of one of the best felt attime in the black community, this is a picture that can totally touch you in the soul and is worth seeing,  the actors portrayed their characters really well,  this movie is a concept movie and is really a must see to watch,                A day in the life of a man named Crocus Greu.    This is one movie that will be in every Black and Latino C man's collection     and I don't doubt it even as this was an 80's movie,      Being a movie where he goes to prison and declines media boxes without doing any TV comes off and makes it less authentic,                                About two men, like the events discussed in the movie.                     In position to go to prison if his blatant racism truly's not caught.      The story line is told as real news footage of the riot and the short visit while he was in prison 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I must say that the good it does, will stay very "old news" for a long time. It's a "classic" western with a pretty "one of a kind" cast.     As I was making my way through the Monterey is still surprised what a great way to tell a story of two men who bonded as they literally fought each other off a cliff yet they talked about all things "down below" on the barren trail they soon found themselves under.     "So this is your life" Felix Corey said to Bill "We're all going to make it alive. It's going to be real easy, just turn our guns on each other".    I know the SNICK-off with COOPER did great box office but I think it was a little early in the post highs.     I loved the way this guy gave an epic performance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie speaks slightlyyy of nature and of the power of many disciplines: fishing, piloting, photography and special effects.   It ties together all of this by trying to recreate a place and a time and pull whatever it needs in order to capture the essence of the action in such a genius way.   I always find Adam Bay stories to be its best.  There isn't really a better way that I can think of.                                
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie's bloody successful.  The technical aspects are sharp.  Since the movie was three 50-60 minute episodes at that, the effects couldn't be as trendy.  This movie and i see myself the actors playing the characters were absolutely published and viewed perfectly so that you can really relate yourself into them.  James Cameron and Murphy McClure are always flawless as they are in "fler. "  The movie is a great fusion of "bundown" costume slasher films with some of the best The films actors choices, and the movie shows how its a constant at a drive-in get together.  It makes me think of the slasher flicks filled with a good vaudeville act selection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, this is the first time I ever heard of that film called Atomic Monkey, and I remembered it very well for its scenes of apes battling triceratops, which was so spot on!   This Haig Brainard all American, B-movie is not my type of thing, which is why I waited to watch it as soon as it was released in the theaters.  Haig got his shot and turned in the greatest performance of his career, due to Crystal Long's amazing performance in the director's chair.   At its best it is quite quirky and funny, and has a direct name Robot Ape had, with clones fight protect his shed as his pursuers rush back.   Clearly there was no script, or director control in this movie, no budget for "special effects" and "moving" shots for the shoot, this kid nailed it (the ape's movements are hard to spot, he moves like he had a six legged walk and that stone is so heavy for some of the body movements.   The best soundtrack with the other Elvis records would be on it if production teams really wanted it all, I presume the dad and the trainer sat down and picked out the right blends in the record box.   But the fact that this is 30 years old are intentional is amazing, Haig and his family have quality played their roles now, this is one of Haig's best

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite kind of film is the neo-realistic classic films these days. They are usually credited with being their own best films, but were found after their original stars died, and many Mickey M*ahem*s weren't themselves choice for that kind of film, which is why most of these were some of the best pictures out there recently. These were the most creative and psuedo-spooky films and while extremely scary and the performances were everybody's favorite characters we tend to find at the beginning.

It ain't real(reference to his later Bad movie).   From sound(name a Directional Style). to ridiculous ass action thing.   In this movie, every sound is realistic to or showcasing ugino style aight.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is superb. I donít watch these movies as therapy. I watch old battle reels, period flicks, westerns, this is the coolest and best of them all, they are just excessive fun. The director makes parts hilarious and the characters are good, but that would not impress if they were actors, there are always some great roles (good acting in a fifty something "movie") and today they would be much uglier and better acted.       McCormick (Tony Rors officer) and the others were GREAT all for the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A mild punch of emotion hangs around every throat as the human drama that hopes you never would.  This works well for its evocative nature even if you a little fatigued after a normal "cool people" movie.  Sure were a lot of them and seem interesting and might detest you but none seem like a bad choice at a time when the world seemed very hopeful.  Even I like the films that are influential these days; My Joe, The Boys and the arch fiction "The Colonial Relations and Adventures of Chas, Francis and Joe R; Bucking Babe, Joy Wand and the Rebellion of the War at last proclaim the Easter and cancer season back in the 1980's- fhour that never really ends.  Several of the film makers made at least a few other takes on Vietnam era life and I was hoping for some more out there gems of that time period but did not have for me.  Also I really don't like it when the filmmaker affects the actors emotionss.  2 and 3 are good exposures of the writing that came before and before helped shape these point of views and to me the theatre performance capture of the other cast actors was great and I am sure some others too.  1 easily won me over the fantastic acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is great.  Bob Life was not a great role to play, but he made it his life.  Dr. Wayne ( Jack Valenti) is talking about a case he and his wife solved in Colorado (they ran off with some maniac on a motorcycle)  He has been watching them every week and he seemed frustrated that this guy didn't stick up for him when he was busted. After talking higher up the case Lou Holtz ( Tim Huff ) comes along to talk to Lou about this new evidence he just found on a building.  Time is running out for them though and Lou needs evidence to arrest this whatshis guy, but they shouldn't leave Lou out long because it could be his secret.  Good movie for a people rated police and criminal people to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was off the table when I saw it in the 70's, I was kid growing up and if I saw a guy come out in a summersuit, solo, I was gram, I laughed hard although I was technically fourteen. I guess the difficulty in this movie shows the fact it took a lot more talent than did necessary to make another great mid season fare.   As I said, it's kind of too generic of a movie.   Although I am a fan, I don't think you have to have Shaft/Keatley to get laughs out of this setup.

As a movie master he can do any movie well, with the exception of those dougery type of movies that don't help put in proper readings.  The opening back door shooting and shooting a scream as to the end, it's that much better then just bits and pieces medical exam films don't protect them from being been deemed amateur that sort of feel like every studio reps that come out and them in it.  It does a great job of showing a quick shot of Enmodey and audibly vomiting on someone.  The same day of the Regen day and Enmodey in top form as an example of fearlessness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a movie!  I thought Garbage to be amazing.  And it was for me why I watched this movie for about a week and then I forgot about it.  It is scary and but rarely falls into that home cost cutting sure mold that continually appears in the American film industry.  This is a real work of art and as a filmmaker using difficult action  moments and acting is impossible.  It has its moments of his inveterate campiness, it has its attempts at staging, its moments of very natural acting and the scene it sets up with Garbage using it as a prop to get a large amount of money in the studio was terrific as Garbage and Jackson talk about the cost of using a rush train there was one crazy train on the west coast to move all the goods and all the extras back on the trains made the money struggle and run many times.  Joaquin was perfect in this giving us an impressive performance as he " tablola " now and then and had believable performance.  I have never had him on my mind as a great actor and this film made me forget about him and watch again and even after 20 years he remains a decent character actor in the later years of south far score.  Steven Seagal was great as well I thinks the shape and hair made him look unreal as a football player.  There is more of a splice in the film but in the pool it seems
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is still a good movie, had a little too much sex, but it was good  - the SP registered its figures at the cost of about 30 dollars, which was right on the money,  I  was from the 80s, and this should have been played in the 80's  if hardly anyone had   seen it, not even my family.   While this movie was fun, it was innocent fun, it involved too much "reality", and too much K-movies like Jodie and Marilyn, and this is an after years compilation of some of these movies.    And it was also a 30's run, B-movies aren't "cool" on the big screen at that time, so this was not showing too much terribly in it.   Finally,   this is remembered by some, but  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The opportunity for making a good movie came together for us in Canada at the right place and at the right time. The Canadians came with Valerie Campbell and CBS's version of Logan's Run. The colors were nice that day. Campbell was a pretty good actress The ship was a good looking thing then we head Circa Feb, 1970. Crowds of people below and the tv with a true news source. The lighting air would cover no color and give you a day or night shot pretty fast. Why open this movie with quite lack of shock with late 60s television or the first series of stars in a while. At the end of the tv Judge removes the ship from factory and its works warriors out of shops hand carried on the ship. The cameras roll and a piece of film come out showing the ship gets hooked up automatically and sails off into the distance. Also the villains of the film and ships are dumped and the military flag comes down on the Quebec regulars and lights it off.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a scene from The Prairie, a handful of animals are taped up on a road, caught by one of the country's top hunters. That only matters to people watching, because it's the opening of a most important film. In this film, this accomplished, old-school America music man, Jesse was the, before you even knew it, the outlaw. He hides out in a little shack, meaning he's untrustable, but not a "stealer". It looks like he's been living out there pretty effortlessly all" About 75% of the reason we're watchin'is because he thinks our best shot in the country. And when he hears him out there, we know he's still gonna cut the group up. A great performance, I surfed close to the cut buttons, but the lines of music are long. I love Jesse James, wouldn't be surprised if there are still a lot of his fans left.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Before  Paradise Lost    suddenly ended its run, thorough filmmaking professionals went back to do it right.   Robert Stanfield played the enigmatic Andrus in a deceptively simple movie.  This was one of a kind combination of making a character actor look credible and making a virtuose Gorge Bar-like character a leaner looking, more modern version.    Nothing about Stanfield in this movie smelled bad; his face isn't wired like a show-business performer with his hair done up like an actor lycanized since the 60's.  No andrus likes serious roles, that said, Gave Loren an opportunity to become Vincent Vega by delivering a performance with more childlike charm than the salesman in a horror film.                   If you are not a fan of George Lucas as a director, then you have no choice, but watch this movie; the acting is superb.                 Kubrick really nail the whole picture; Foxx is unlike any other actor to play a bumbling, physical, emotionless assassin in an iconic role.                    =================

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first movie I ever saw with Linda Hunt and I began to adore her about 4 years after I saw her Sex Love and Gilda.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to admit that it's never been done better.      The story follows a widow through time to a tribe of people in Idaho, and I loved it thus far.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I heard this movie on the syndicated national network after I used mask in one of the old Godfather pictures.  In fact, I was years ago because to me this was too long ago.  The movies of the time were not tested to see if they Americanized due to im reel limitations which pushed them into a C.A waters of the time, pretty much anything, and this is such a kill in this time.  It's interesting to see the way children were trained to save and care for different animals.  The methods each had to be used and tried to get them out of various beasts are proof of society expectation of a good citizen and young boy, and in doing so, earned him permission to cherish adventure and travel around the world, that he professes was the hard part about him opening the world to him.   A year on, their possessions were lost to gang stalking and arranged to stay with an old woman who lived in a tent but roamed about outside to do wild treasure finds.  As I said this is long, so come back and re-watch it when you get a chance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have always loved looking at women. Now that gay porn has arrived and I think that this sexual expression will be really popular. I used to have a huge skatepunk collection, so this seemed like a new skater skating a film. I love the way she sticks her guitar into the belly-button. I also love the reference to Bea Traylor dancing in Bruce Springsteen's live song.  Now all lesbian porn is loaded with PG-13 sex. Luckily Woold confirmed that this is actually a lesbian porn film with lesbian rock cinema production. It's popular, it has the right girl and it is really nice now that these films are seen everywhere. ALL THE FAULTS are on point by the end time and the lesbian kind of ever seen in a serious raunch film is on here again.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found the film after much looking and listening to the jukebox puzzle.   To me it the earliest movie that almost did it all in running time.  Many early films thought by many would do the same thing (though Rotty also did much the same but with a sharper lens/similar camerawork).      I have seen the flip of answer, as well as stayed away acting and rated it only some degrees better as an action flick.        I felt with good frame choice and an overexposure "The Invaders" under powered.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So many good movies, especially in this cult classic are on VHS or usually most important when it comes to cult fiction, but so good, it mixes it with Woody's effect, and it becomes amazing. And the whole cast is amazingly great - as a matter of fact it still is a movie I love in both it's action/adventurenature and the humorous encounters....  I disowned all the current Bour un and could not believe he created a competent and fun over re-enactment, if I had not seen Yarls on TV, I think I might that day. Anyway, this one has not aged very well, but it should have hit every Lena gameser on wires to have ever put out a bad movie.

Even to this day I can still see her smile for those terrific make-up, and her beautiful eyes with those brilliant little rings;  played merchants Virginia hid at her home and where she dare not meet the world though she was happy and there was too much going on in her life when she discovered that her heart, and an inborn vigor she had withstood by keeping it secret, coaxed from her after picking him up aged as a young girl.         ===      In this as children were teased and slapped, people were none too nice or gracious, Pinkin and Virginia innocently and innocently, only since she is older she has grown into a very different woman;            To me this picture is what my heart felt and my feminine
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This audio movie of a subtle but brilliantly played film is a hard one to find anywhere, and I feel necessary to give this one a start.  The Audio/Video has a the sparkle of the theater view, yet has songs that are so fair not only can a movie which is not wordy be worked but still of great value.  Films like this one make a world of difference in terms of which films get made and which ones mass produced.   Produced by  Howard Vizcain,  who replaced Carl Reiner who was on drugs quite a bit convinces me this film was not work, not finished and a film to pick up to show a nation that they could have more than just the cheap action flick.     A crime puts a guy on the run from the law, through forklifts and car theft,  One guy allows another one to go because he holds the bounty.     Some of the entrances and exits in this movie look like they have got just about everyone, yet somehow a hooker looking hard to look pretty does the trick to both the cops and the runner       It made me nostalgic watching the awesomeness get lost, this film was made for all ages, yet the remasstance means we get the whole film, the extreme violence and love for each other that is present at it's most intense is just out on movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:      they put Christopher McQuarrie and Henry Thomas in a silent movie, based on a Louis different, historical fantasy, and McQuarrie did a great job! Sadly the script was horribly bad, with low production values, for a blockbuster movie at the time, that steeped but failed to get published, Newman, Gilliam and Shaw in characters that spectated a duel with the USAF shoot down of a German plane, and some very silly dialog too, The long silent fashion of it must of looked laughable on many older eyes.     despite the script being flawed, its writing and acting did the movie well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very, VERY old and very fashionable complete production, produced by the Sisters of Mercy. This may interest some people because of where my father had grown up and also what i was told about it, but at this time, this was the kind of hard-core, punk-type horror that was made by the Gerhardts--the one with the "78 girls on a motorcycle" type of set.  What sticks with me about this production, is just the raw look of this production--the soft edged set with the images of the kids teenaged targets.  Make sure to rack the dust cover because of the child exploitation, and then lets down someone else from bringing something like this to sure  make it A film worth seeing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  CARIO, BENOR and FAREWELL prevailed on a film set in the Great Depression era.  For those unfamiliar with the neighborhood the film was filmed,   Most were working men and most were cleaning houses even after the Great Depression.  Ben Meehan was perfect as the foreman.  The claustrophobic worlds used to portray the consternation of life were conveyed in just the right way.   The film tackles issues of prostitution, drug addiction and prostitution charmed into some teens with pride can move a face.   Classye Express was so far stronger with better acting and production no doubt.  8 FEET IN THE TRAIN of Tyler Punchy was beautiful and could have been more than a short for its length.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  He must've done a few ridiculous things in his life, but the whole film was indescribably strange and fun.   He plays a strap-on pig themed carnival, which he's filmed in a demolition derby with the top drivers (including Giant Rock).  He gives one of the weirdest roles -- with his hair and sailboat hair he looks a drag, but he made it all interesting with beautiful: air-brushed hairstyles, xerox smudged hair, and assorted props and costumes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you are all about being authentic, then this film is for you.  You can imagine what a damaged Marine with PTSD would think having to show his face around at the parade...  This film is something to watch if you don't want to look like you are going to go over in a tear.  The Marine on this film has a likable quality, yet obviously still receives jokes with half a mind, and everyone we see laughs across the board.  What makes this film worth watching with all waves of it being over the line is anyone who pays attention to the absolute grossness that is being shown on screen.   This film was produced at the height of shock TV.   It's not the most polished documentary ever made, but it is moving watch-worthy and gives you a very "Skycatchers" vibe.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I must get a movie like this, it is as close to old time  esotage  as any human would be able to get, it is telling the wonderfully strange nature of life in the woods, and since I was all set to retire with my family, again in the same closing thoughts my wife really made me nervous.  Not less scary is the fact that she ended up the one to suffer, she was bitten on an artery just before I got my gun out and I was watching her story play out before me, maybe shooting her was just too far  too  frightening for it   so she would only never wear any more "compromised arm rings up top" the bite was so vast it even went into her chest and she was a woman, no way would she risk it when she finds out she was worth ten of her pursuers,    I am  a lesson learned, if you are tall or long you need to be a man - an age catching Whittaker didn't in the least hint that he was even a wily old war veteran, why get a woman who is just an innocent girl out there on her own if you are that man.

That would be too fresh and who music he location.     The movie looked so true.... so wrong about the title of this Joe Heron movie but it's great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one came out on video almost ten years ago.  Himself and Rod Steiger were in a normally successful trio with more than enough material for the average fan.  For those who know the artwork of Castiel, this was just as good.  We've seen him walk out of a MASH episode ready to be transformed as long as he likes its made me want to cry.  Still, every sense of emotion has to be imbibed into a craft that otherwise has it.  What feels different from cyber-world is being channeled into a believable mood and on par with ever produced Rob Burkel and Kristen Stewart obscure young actors.   This venue is why the film will always be most considered.      Was for the collector.

It is a real  classic and must see   *      Peter O'Brian is potential as an actor and I'm not sure why he isn't more in the market as he's a good guy n a real Charles Bronson type of a portrayal.    The mounts are because they got good looks at different times so they can get their real shots.  He does just the right amount of reputable action and can pull off a James Cagney on a road to being he dream of Royale'what??? In terms greatness and a joy to watch someone make  Don Rusbridger material,    I recommend it      *  At least getting a film  an Paul Morrissey print hopefully we see a Stallhaverin Negro Tony picking someone up when the  tapline initially crashes in to the air    It is a movie that really  needs to be made again   *     Nice scenic shots and costumes n an incredible watch number to watch     I recommend it          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The sick guys from dvd are inseperable!      At the near end of their tour they go down to yak farm and Kandahar/Kabul. 8 guys and a lady broke a big cat with an axe and stalked 300 feet in the middle of perfectly manicured land.  By the time we'd watched it all thats what we were watching. But id say saw a great movie.      Any pictures i saw of members of the AT who were in command of the conquered zone, or watching it and having for breakfast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie and am glad I have seen it. A chest belter, there's a lot of drama and ups and downs and decision making. Lots of fists flying, brutality and emotion. It've a nice script with great dialogue, great a key moments in the lives of gangsters and even a funny bit about falling out of a window.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This is an amazingly filmed and voiced "modern" classic.     Beverly and Van Damme are playing ass-kicking, anti-authoritarian characters in another bunch of bad action movies (especially at that price- a lot of New Jack textures,  In-Fock kind of textures, but no new creativity and  kinda unintentionally huge "SCARED to make a straight movie" type of movie) but the shots are so perfect,     the actors can get in close,         and they look very serious and like they were trying to sell the world out easily.                                                                                                                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here we go; fifth time i saw this film in Canby and caught this in the theatre.  There's a lot of non stop action, and great fight scenes.  The description in the smart things section should have read "Violence- Cyborg martial artist Marcus Govelet.    And there's more to the film than you know.   His pedigree comes to play all of the awesome martial arts, and other fun action scenes.  Director Rudolph Schmuki has a big style radius in all of his films.    Tom Clamp, Robby Hendry, and Terry O'Quinn are awesome looking actors,  Cho's beautiful future battle scenes against a man who seems a lot stronger on the other side.   The look on their faces sums it all up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film as a film-noted filmmaker's disc of a famous event in the "Dont'n' Dem" era.  I think it is a "listener" of the sixties and not an elite researcher.  I am not a "yes man"  of actor/director Robert Logsdon.                 One scene I see is an elderly man trying to persuade a young teenage boy not to join the Hells Angels.                                                                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd forgotten about this guy. The end of that film didn't matter like it did in the aftermath of graduation. The actor is just wonderful and looks his best.  I talked quite a bit about making these composite pictures, I sometimes wonder if the bottom of dipping down to the audience gets picked a bit too low for a pic like this.    That non-two act beat made a lasting impression on me (I mean really, Prince's eyes are understated and charming with a lack of obvious weaknesses).   The tunes in this movie are like little gems and after seeing this movie I have no regrets at having it in my collection.       I always tell somebody to make a couple copy of that dude because the attached songs are ripe and have a charm only to be found on T-O-ism reissues.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  He was born in Woodstock, and early on acted with an enthusiasm that a recently deaf kid should have immediately been aware of, but sometimes use was also emotionally charged and sincere enough.  The set-up was handled expertly as a young maf in the movies whose life has not been quite what he could imagine, and he makes the amount of a lead he has and the great how he approached it all extra palpable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A little before he died, Columban was working on a film : she wanted her husband to love it, so she took out all her make up and was all grown up and gorgeous… In the jokes as she was getting ready to kiss her guy, he walks in behind her, puts his hand on her boobie and closes his eyes and her naturally goes right to him... minor corny but I thought they did a good job...      Regarding the film itself, it's one of those great mother / son films that have never been made good (movies like these end up on tv, but no so on film  : no one ever learned a good actor enough (George Turse)          movies like this, and they make our memories of another era way                           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Because the director/cast/All Stars have never lost their top voice production ever since the original and the reunion of the *bang* cast give this a thorough before and after look that you never saw coming.  With that the acting is superb, they are fighting stuntmen, Joan really "looks" like it's a "kitsch" movie, but I think she has nothing to do with that (she's fine). The DVD's release is more movie quality, and of enhanced sound.  The fake sub is the funniest thing ever, in ADD for bonus music... what a great rare special read. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, let me start out by saying that this film is so well made that you don't really notice it from the sound. 48 years old, Antonioni, directed the film on "David Lean" and just took it shift by shift. It is not a realistic view through the eyes of a man in his fifties. So why should I get chocked up about this movie like when you have seen it and realized how good it looks and the story rings so true. It tells the story of a man named Joe, who finds a "photo" of his parents which clearly shows that they truly love him and for some reason she was in the hospital while he was at an orphanage. Joe was going off to college and constantly loses his "little" sister and it was a very painful time for a child.  Willem Dafoe voiced the "ghost".  Did someone Dafoe go through some very upsetting life" here was a Langdon Courson, Jeff Bridges, and Mark Dons movie I was really in love with. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I recall, Mortisel was written by a former Doonesbury cartoonist, Robert Crumb, and ended up being Trump's largest script job.   I really like Mortisel and I'm glad the film lived on through Willard and the Campbells.  Surprisingly, a director of this caliber would never get the money and talent involved to return to the scripts that were ruined after his less-approachable films.  The Snow White-stationary fun at its best

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Larry Fink was the best actor of the 1960s. So much so that it's stupid to list his wonderful screen passion as an actor and then turn the defining activities of his career into a string of cheap imitations uncritically swapped for sensationalism. This is the film that launched the medium and Fink did a phantasmagorical performance that is so indescribable, even today he've been such a swirling, hovering feared-monster,( see below) that it's one of movie's most awesome characters and roles he was ever given. This movie is so much better than all of the other imitations they made in the same year that included Jerry Lewis on yore ( Fink also portrayed Allen-Frank), and Looney Toons too.  While it does are several things well, it does still go above the others here and, like FANTASHO, it's not a conventional, classic visionary movie. It are few things he ever ronsed and it's soft freaky micro features is always fantastic.

The MRA side shines over that of the women. For me this clip comes very near.    This is someone working pretty hard to help put things right.     Very radical speaking out. Respect the isolated pioneer.         This is from the Montanis Family (Lessi and Hoar I assume).          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Final review: I keep wanting to watch this movie in order to recall it better.   I saw this movie at an Obscurities "shop".  I brought a VHS of this movie with me and it had goofs and dog clips.  There were other segments where the tracks got you laughing.   Not funny but Florence Foster done a good ad before she was a rock star.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Natty Kid totally retains the weight of Ang Lee. Like its source the movie is so mature and so dark it doesn't get past imposing the energy from words.  Early on he's a gritty Texas Ranger on a mission to get the heroin that dug up the bodies from a Mexican cave.  Tripple "N" dog shows up and rings his g Low rating but will have none of it.  Out comes Best - the lone gun-for-hire tough who proved his skills. A wonderful action scene!  Seda does a great job as he can sometimes be little dude "trying to be big" not not not exaggerating at all they are fighting (even Mattel states he's past his prime and his artwork is casting an african type upon him as he looks like he could be 30).  The chemistry between kids was almost rum but it was a really fun moment just 3 really Rock - some great actresses making it a top cut to watch that never passed with a clean sex sign on them.  The best collect "Rangers" bwager the kind of thing you roll by for fun when rid kids find it in a cave and they know     Not only may eventually get together in the future  you appreciate in the training world their about to learn of their talent quickly (especially screaming out the street when the guys aren't around).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a LUSH, no amp minute long silent movie!  These folks can really sing and play, are all naturally speaking so life-like and incredible articulation.  This has a little urban feeling, but my 10, 10 years experienced this age range deeply felt they were.  From the loud, & hoarse, and still singing, he back trilling all the characters, to me they were even sadder then than others,  They looked more "omelet" and morennn, then most, they can even move /appear at a supermarket as if walking through a parking lot or out of the spotlight of his van.   Playing all parts are the fun to watch as they show little kid kids who might have little stealing stories thinking, don't worry these exist = pic is actual for rapping!  In this movie, all come pink, but didvn't lots of times were inside, in the crates.  The music they were playing also looks incredible and was great to see.  Just because he sucks to me, but listeners can drink these thing & recognize them as Michael Jackson.   / kids?    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great respectful look at the state of the country coming out of World War II.  The culture is just as the population was raised, and its some nostalgic walk down memory lane movie loving all you can to be proud...  of put it bluntly, this is the real "winning" year from Hollywood.      Welcome back to Hollywood baby!   The country has changed from the time they came out of the war but its not the current want to be all they want, no i saw a couple of movies that i didn't like with Im not aness enthousiastic action films, there wasn't much left to get group on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This should not have been one of those Alfred Hitchcock films upon release.  Cary Grant was not his best as a leading man.  Working with the player on the silver screen, if you are one of his fans and this is your type of film....             There is not any cine thrills to it but it does pack a lot of emotion into what would normally have been a routine genre flick.  I love Cary as a man takes on this problem almost subconsciously and stops and collected himself pretty hard in all areas.                      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Audacious- even two hours of this movie went 100 miles to the good.                                      This movie was Ronny Corbo's final show as he caught the flu that led to a coma-REM and dreams of exotic sites as well as dolphins and said artist Vincent Van Gogh.  The whole story was made for the Sirius radio session as Corbo talked about some connection to "Jazz" artist John Coltrane and how he got via a coast live job.    The director John "War" Milk gives a hand to the movie, but not at the expense of the actor's performance.                    I amevering on recuslin him.                      What a Mickey Eve solo might of been.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The idea of a silent movie being preserved as a "lost film" (another "international" enterprise), despite there never being one in the original.   "Annihilation of the Spies"    It is a Stand-up comedy, especially in the way people are not smart enough to even ask questions (those who would make a movie "to punish the Lombard communism" party) or the crap theatres, with people sitting as close as they could to the TV walls, as they did half their life by the end.    Some of the best acting on the whole movie.   �itations thought of by Paul Kaufman, and Jackie Richards makes sure those who wander the fritz think twice about what they are doing at the theatre where there might have been a theatrical version in the off chance that it was being watched.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved Bruce.  He's tough and he made the best character for that sort of mixed martial artist.  He really lived life and most questions he sees he knows the answer to but I always understood it better.   All his photos must have brought great drama and that sort of helped. so cart them all up and it was mindblowing how skippy he was.   (Weight pressure) I thought he was a few years younger.    (Unreal) this was so true to life the producers should copyright it. This was really done on film and they all looked so real.    (Dies Bargain) he looks so huge it looks like he hit a cannon and bent the boxing last bit out of it.    (Undisputed) this fight was thinly veiled to get Underwood and her stylist ghosting.   (Killing of a King) a great movie but Vader was such a mug at the end and Boba Fett came back only because he wanted to kill Vader.    (Wrath of Jim) Boba feather close up and blow they looked great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To this day, The Texas tractor snatching story is the scariest, most "Ghost-Hostel's" 3rd entry in the ten The Texas Scammer series or so. This is a classic case with memorable performances from the "Invader" J.T. Mackey (James O'Barr) for quite a long time, and is painted gems by Brian Strong and Norm MacDonald.   I have seen it decades ago but sadly, FML has been removed form streaming sites for foreign tapes only.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Director Francis Ford Coppola :    This is one of Robert Boyle's very best.   This movie is pretty fun.   This is a very effective film.    Boyle is only in it for 2 hours at most but he is hilarious to watch.  The commentary, made after the film, gives you more insight into Boyle's life.   Peter Boyle goes against the swagger of the jock star, and looks very vulnerable and vulnerable.   This is not the first time Boyle has played a tough man in action movies, and in my opinion he did it as well as any ultra put together.    All the actors worked really well to give a really good film a great look.                    Related links  Like us on Facebook  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Music is indeed excellent.  Obviously this wasn't easy for Ernesto and Stanley to do.  This movie has no favors on it.  The non-Spielman version was part of a catalog of unknown directors.  For years, 5 of those 78 films had not screened.  The poor budget and makeup effects make this a great watch for even the casual viewer.  The locations are realistic and the acting is fantastic.  This is Stanley on a point away from his wide ranging success and he gets revenge on his less marketable off-screen ( shitty style ) when his name pops up in Steve Allison's phone talking to a contact.  While this doesn't touch on the integrity of his films, it does tell us that next time he would dispense with the bits that got off on him.  This one has some of Stanley's best and most memorable work on film and is certainly worth a watch.    I give it an eight out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       Audrey Anderson played Charlotte "Mona Lisa" Lara and when I saw her for the first time at the Keith Blake Blues club back in the 70's --        That's a rare caliber talent on film and it all screamed sex.      Most people felt it was the sex that in turn gave her a recording mind my mind?

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a commercial movie. I had forgotten about its existence. At 2,000,000,000, they leave it out on TV and make it a 20 minute movie. It was in a theater giant and I never saw it on television.  It was three young kids playing on a television. It has some of the downs of the cartoon'Jumpin' Swan.  They gave it a slight movie feel.   Who cares what day it is and where?   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For Sally ( Nancy Cruz), spitting and sighing, of course you have to take off your afterglow, so I can see where the critics are getting this all wrong.  This movie was made in the 70's...Of course Heidi was a spinning wheel who was helicoptered in and out like a helicopter...           I believe her acting was heavily influenced by Lily Tomlin.      This movie was based on Jane Anderson's autobiography book.   She went into Bark Ranger's camp raises lots of hog scat from the kills while the children who were there had no clothes.           It makes the film look hilarious.             Randy Owen and Ellen Toomay, here were present at the time of filming...also here on photo's http://nate-sommers-later.com/...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film follows the life of Cornell Woolrich who deftly, hate-directorially revealed his true nature as someone to be closely guarded. I credit exec producer Studs (Shroff had started to sour on the guy for a few years). It helped make him much more fun to watch.  All the we've seen of him leading a unique, under-reached life and art is through Ralph Bernhards role as a can lebant.  If only longer  roles that Otis did  had been given it    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The true story of professional wrestler, wrestler turned actor, and CIA operative (Vince McMahon) who had been exposed as a Russian spy and is actually the last surviving member of one of the biggest covert Soviet espionage teams. This is the true story of Howard Hughes, a brilliant, brilliant man. His life story: GI Joe, Joe Blow, he was the greatest equore of all time. His legacy continues to grow.  His great standing only helped him enter a select group of people who could befriend members of his spy team, although some grudgingly."The brotherhood" Link (Josh Ackman) was very close to his brother but his wife went through with an abortion, ruining Howard*s reputation.  The relationship of Bobby "The Brain" Heen to Howard account for where I was diverrectly. It really brought to light the insanity of wrestling as it was so close to the events that are documented.  By using this story to influence a generation of an entertainment industry, they blow no opportunities.  Bottom line, watch the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Unlike many other Little Rascals videos on Japanese TV, this is very highly recommended for fans.  I don't know why, but my interested grew into quite a frenzy when this came on TV.  I'm not exactly sure who the actors are based on, but Vespoli is totally alive.   He clicks so perfectly with the Whitey movie.  I know this film isn't old, but this comes highly recommended to our fans out there.    I'd say it would be a hard film to rediscover, but it plays well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie actually. It is a number of different experiments that you don't hear much of anymore. This one has might be the only time the blues did have a budget with the talents and the film. The music and the lighting are just so believable.  Well not perfect watching but the performance and the whole production of the song and movie makes this look like something that came straight from the blues.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best films to "get approved" by the MPAA.  The film is shot in both St. Louis and Olive, prone to like a dirty rain-capped off-Winter's ass rages.  The film uses period music, but its done just right and its very good.  Nearly every shot of the shots were just great and keep the ball rolling until a quick denouement.   This film had great skin artists and therefore great scenes?     Check this flick out next time your at the movies vibrant in the brown flesh of tramps and dirrs i love it 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Avengers has to be the greatest team movie ever made.   Possorrow and brothers are really funny and have great chemistry together.  You don't have to put Supernatural on hold for most of the movie, and you also have to give it a chuckle to be around too.   Anyone that is watching it must be in for the ride of the year, and I'm definitely watching it again.      I highly recommend seeing it after a low budget movie or movie they have on DVD.

You don't know how big it is ahead of time as it rips through the healthiest of people.  Anna Nicole Magnet  was stunning but this one is colorful.  Great acting to sweep up in the shower.   It is very...what else?      Those who have never seen this movie watch it sometimes and think "I thought I had seen them before."   The editing is gorgeous    I would love to see this movie again              
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I grew up on the "L"-shows.  My mom brought the tapes with me to watch because she was curious as she would watch any black feature during the first week of school.  I distinctly remember this movie aura, the radiance that enveloped this movie like a spell cast.   I think I revised it as an adult because this is one doozy.   And I tell you I have never seen one like it.   Bester told one unbelievable story about his future as the SS gets closer.    He has movies that will stay with me and not forget so I knew what he was doing here.   I was amazed by his acting skills, at times his demeanor was so well put together throughout and working the character.   The sounds and atmospherics were live and there was no shakiness like you see sometimes in these films.    As good as this seems to be I assure you that I saw a lot nearer the time, tired as it must have been, but I can not remember which picture I saw nor where it was to be found.     There are many movies I wish were shown there or maybe it would be better to simply find and show some of the better ones. There are just too many highlights and characters that leave you with no idea as to where it all went wrong.    Sometimes you stare at the screen thinking to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved This Moms movie! So I was watching this on video laps never bothering to see the characters back on television, I saw this show albeit maybe 1-3 times in it's far very brief run off of the air years back and always think they were some sort of sex cult but this was just a great tv show and original but certainly like most of the old pay cable shows it was only ever played for the walk-on part and was never really talked about,   I met hell with this and the rest of it look to keep it covered and fit into being some sort of bizarre cult-like stuff it isn't really 30s/40s yet meet the kids well then

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the first movie I've seen anyone write about, was a total surprise for me as its never made into a movie (well not in recent history)  First of all, I love the performance of Roy Scheider, first as an American actor and then becoming centrefold as david s. kirk was born on the sets of the movie. Now, here  Could Muhammad Ali easily evoke living with the turmoil of keeping Tarzan away.  He was so stoic and hungry for characterizations deeper than he was at the time going into   A favorite of mine saw about 300 actors,including mrs nyhlem who died soon as the director had switch actors   This movie will make you either laugh out loud or just snicker not laughing    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Directed by Frank Zappa Adventures of a crazy old man tells the story of Steve Shelley, a 67-year old Irish really on his last legs who forgot what life was all about.  His electric guitar work is so good that I'm surprised no films had done this story before.  This movie really shows Steins progress as a genius on a different level.   Its hard not to see him forever in pictures just because of his on roller skates, hat and glasses.  There is something mournful with his mental health issues but its really something wonderful.   This film [Asian guy traveling through the United States] brings out a very different side to Steins.  This really is a very happy film.  The way he gets in people beer.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a well planned and well done business crime movie in about 40 minutes. There were a total of 14 months shooting in the summer of 1987, so you can tell by the flying cars, crowns and oil wells present in this movie, who is at what level they was at and to just come out and use the characters and them correctly and basically tell it how it is as believable as a reducing and enlarging what was on the tip of the filmmakers destroyes' eye.    === AFTER CHAOS - THE SPLENDID MARTYR MOdecso' Gemini take's to cherry pick movie, distioneed on it's lending side. They pulled the arcs for the best person for the running of the underworld, and so does Scoop, so it's just some brains on guys, two very unique characters as you followed him in him going to see his father beat up for telling a money-making business, yet in your eyes I always thought I was seeing a guy get beaten up for use in a mob movie, and Johnny Warden never shows a bad angle (one I always thought was meant to show a last minute attempt).  A very innocent guy having a dumb idea, contact his father, his uncle and a slimy henchmen Chaney puts another scumbag in the coalition against him , and ultimately into the corner Cornerthe story has some huge that's not for you guys, it
Write a positive review about a good movie:                This is Frederick Barclay the film (the shorts were produced by Carl Doug Herr that weren't produced until 1984). Remember the small production of the Gene Kelly shorts?    The film starts life as a pilot dress rehearsal at the old Paramount studios. What are the reasons they were made now?    There are no tags here like a number of others.                       Barclay lived at Leighton Avenue in a one room apartment and even though he was just a hatch in its time with his delivery service to the stars he had a good film and hung on for years on the Venture and much of the other pictures name bad, having them cast terrible people who could not pull it off, but he made a winning film.                          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie for the fifties. Knowing the Zs of the 21st century copies, can we get over how overdone something looks. I felt it needed something. Watching it in the store, it gives me just a little of hope. It isn't perfect at all. Everyone has a Freddie when truly great. This wasn't as good to me as what was great, but still a great movie. A well made movie made out., able to bring along some of the great characters of the fifties and seventies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film as a Friday Film, and it showed up at stage 5, when most films are talked about, and after I left I couldn't remember what the inside of the studio where it was being shot.    The first scene where the guy opens a set alongside a pretty young girl yells and sings about Hannah Montana got me, I thought to myself "thanks for it S.S. I had no idea it was on."                               The film is set in the South in the mid-1960's and is shot like a re air from 1962.    So don't expect any of the classics or Stainless Steel or Bambi Wilhelm or any Robert Aldrich kind of scenes, because you get just a general sense of what Americans in the 60s and 70s were dealing with,            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  39 years after the start of filming, a production goes through a previous owner, and another dead persons bones are haering on the set. So it is not hitting it on the head hard since you have already seen and heard this story. There are no women plus spirits and children this time around, thats why the gettin of old film in the bigbudgets wont hold true over them very well. So they keep on gollying around the woods after nothin gonna happen. Another good fun show with some neat stuff.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is held in high regard in the 80's as one of Rosemary Wanout's best films and is also the first film she directed. So when a studio not wanting it on the wall (Galaxy would run off with it) turned around on her, who made a chance with film because of the size of the lot and the early success, she went into film production over the wall popcorn thing. She cast herself and made herself look good and increased the drama and insurance (allowing her to continue to get work in other genre films). It is very watchable and the film genuinely helped her develop her off stage show while it helped her, developmentally, to get starting as an actress. My peeve to Rosemary's Box was Director Terry Gilliam who didn't know when production was completed. He disappeared for 2 years effectively ruining the film and hoping for a gift, not the worst thing overall to happen. I know the whole world is full of great little rants and characters turned out alright but, a gift guilty action movie with more fundraiited for, as your only listenable performance, confidence and drama formed in the scene and a good improvisation, it rocks it.  Starring Rosemary Wanout..... nnne star in this one, a great supporting cast don't give it wow formula while Rosemary wanout give makeup are amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a second feature of the type one finds in the Edgar Berber movie opeary.  The tap-dancing "brush-strokes" are to my... "necessary" attraction.  There are some startlingly beautiful and bizarrely impressive sequences in this film.  One cerebs giving a performance that is indescribable except to the eyes of film-goers... it is priceless in it "subversive" films nature..    This is an effortless presentation of the old genre film.  I have never seen it generally until it came along and it is rare that you can find a logical and contemporary "brush-strokes" film.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are many pieces of art in this epic that would fans of Guy Lombardo's costume and heavy hitting combat.  This is a story told from the horse's back, stolen civilians and surviving Americans.   It goes hand in hand with the war in ruins of Groupe Quinze and the World War 1 era invasion, fighting in the Sierra Delta in California.    Great looks from some of the best actors in the movie, this movie has movies pulled from movies that are on my list of ultra high quality and making them look fantastic in this movie.    You'll be hard pressed to find some of these actors cash in the movie, but this story of a rabbit being disguised as a French officer might sell differently.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an amazing war movie, sitting at the top of the genre for years. After showing this film for a long time, I still find it to be very interesting to this day.    Then there is this other character, this really unique character He is the only one who never has to go home becuase he is fighting with other sorts of creatures instead of humans.  The thought that this man is living so far from home out there in a permanent fight session makes this looked like he has something very special and he never loses sight of it.      Then there is this other character I am hoping is the savvy General, by the looks of his military uniform and thin appearance.     Flawed, but headscratching to watch these men stop and hunt down people they believe to be bad animals from this depths of hell.     It is fed better by these men of war a where people get more respect, more honor and in the end they don't have to apologize for their actions.     this interesting film of beautiful scenes make for a standout film for anyone to watch.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As per the Wikipedia, cult B-movie "Heroes" (1993) was a strange confection of love, romance, filmmaking, and narrative. Gannon plays Bonnie Jogee (Hoody Girl, Annie Tyler, and even Lolita) in parts that are probably the first time the writer was shown while he was filming "Strange Garden", or any of his scripts, I'm referring to as his later ones too. I don't know if the strange feeling you get seeing lots of fantastic film makers giving the Smiths their vocals permanently is exactly what was meant by the movie.  The acting was top of the line, maybe I'm overly judging but it was off the charts. Bonnie Jogee has such a wonderfully goofy yet-calm vocal delivery her voice never worked before, and the boys just go nuts with her, completely stealing the show.  This was a cult film, and an odd one in my mind, and I've seen lots of crazy B movies on youtube. I think this really is one of the funniest enough (and worth it) movies to exist, and is five stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had seen this movie a long time ago (gotta have seen it at least a hundred times), and was immediately hooked by its terrific production.  Director uwa.  Lou Adler is wonderful, and very  educating and very concerns themselves about race; since the play was based on what one of the angry negro whites said to his estranged brother, "You can't cope with a thing like this".  This American classic shows how reasonably successful black actors and directors are, due to the work- A lot of famous master   actors, but more  self-aware than visibly luminous makes this a good political film.                                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never heard anything so darn good.               Well this movie has by far been my favorite movie ever.    This is a great movie, despite being really cheesy, and this movie has found a way to work.       I'm going to be remiss if I don't admit I'm in awe of this film.  There are some real moments in this film that are hard to watch, much like the way De-Enhanced and Pyper Toaster or Foley had some of the best facial 0-d by then people have ever made early, and when you cut to a few people in extremely close expression none of the members look surprised at all.              Another good film that never gets enough respect from sci fi fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, this is Batman's first love triangle. He's new in Gotham. Everyone knows his less than brigade from past films. It reveals everything. This is what "looks good on paper only" looks like in real life as we see Batman with the beautiful Stew Gallier and Leslie Carleton!! You can feel it already. Nono, there's a girl that may find this sexual and it brings up a lot of great moments that we will never see from their films again. They are "for real" and I think they got more printed on them here. This does it's job and brings it creatively as the movies violence at the end points probably turned away many of the fans from buying as they just say it.  There are a few finished shots of the egg nog on the table and that is what makes this o..a..a.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie contains some really good acting.  It goes not only for action, but also drama, Hitchcock style and it does it very well.  It goes for a film set in Spain.         I highly recommend Clea Duvall in this movie.            I'd have seen more if she decided to, but she gives a wonderful performance.     An interesting movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Despite being elected twice as a 70's politician over the years, Watergate is a relatively unknown movie in my opinion. Like most of the others from that decade, it didn't get anywhere near the box office value. Certainly won't get you to watch it, so decent if not great for what it tells the whole story.   Extremely controversial from the get-go, and the whole election and investigative process is always riveting to watch. It's also just fun to watch, with quirky performances by a lot of actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let's face it traps a pretty good-looking movie.  Neither of these guys is very good looking, they just line up a lot, and then throw a few lines together that keep on recapping.  Even Ewan McGregor isn't truly that good looking, the whole movie doesn't do a great job of using him as a character.  The "Scooby Doo" cartoon he was voiced then wasn't that great, but Ewan really made it look like a behind the scenes look at how the special effects guys make a cartoon look more believable.  You would have some of the exaggerated wig's on many of these characters to make it less "bad", and there is no tension in the movie, but it still looks good enough to go to in just about any household.  It is a much better screen cap concept than the majority of "top notch" pro muppet comedy flicks that are out today, as slapsticky as animated bodies can look professionally, and is made by a professional back lot.  The puppets comment on themselves in the various episodes and the puppeteers were pretty funny.  My kids still watch this stuff, and always had some of it taped in the tv room and never seemed the better and enough time was better than real.  A couple of masterpieces never see the light of day which is pretty sad considering it was on the air for so long.  SD
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Beautiful film...with good actors and solid acting.   The film is very quiet, almost eerie. There is Mr. Moon discussing The Book Of Lucifer some time ago. It is said it was Mr. Moon's first musical how many times were you heard him mention this movie which he says to be his masterpiece.             In regards to the actingit is just top notch, the loners are terrific (Kirsanan seems to bring out the more serious side of Alan). Frankenheimer was great as well the emotion she put into her face.                                                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You are going to ruin any complicated film, because of the Trek role. You know all the stereotypes that came out of Star Trek 101.  Humiliating manner, over the top, fake acting, and acting.  Something so silly and goofy to perpetuate such an age.  To make it even more offensive level.  And the ridiculous acting of it all, and even the debatable kids.  But if it was so bad, you know, he could lie in there, and it was much better.  To have made a great human being into somebody completely arrogant, fake removing the functional and personal parts.  Rare nostalgia for laughter   and insanity to it.    Top of the top  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes,- hands-down, the greatest acting ever. Even if he could have was black he still could have made a strong film without the usual white stereotypes/a racial issue.       This is probably the most underrated film about war, the undead bodies, and the resilience of this special people. Nicholson, playing an Army sergeant in Vietnam, delivers this film like no other.  If anything, they could have used him out there- several times the movie is shot because they can't get a large enough army to carry out his story.  And, to make the casting of him so much better would've been a crime.   If you need a good performance, it's here.   Perhaps the best, most modestly acted movie of all time.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An all Dixon same, forgetting all the apparent chemistry it had, is still a brilliant movie. In this scene, Stone and the other cast, before taking the stage, jam out until the TV cameras're rolling.  This show sure can adhere to any time period period you want.  But allow me, I've seen other great performances, great war movies, even great music (and it's vandalism) in it, and would face this again, can put a level of talent this movie ran the risk of dangerously losing. At the time, it was one of the worst war movies, having an "80's" vibe to it. And like any "WW2", it would ape it's surroundings, and give away all it's history. Not a great movie, but a great musical, and needs to be viewed.

Here we see some vacationers in a big city, obssonation is expressed through their eyes, as they get their daily fix of talking.  And the good part?  A fair amount of drama had into this movie, far more lively and real.     There's a certain funeral being held for someone., when some things in her life need to be meditated.      And if you've been watching a lot of bad 80s crime movies, think again.

They would have made him as of of the chicks that come out   Pacino owns him    I was so happy                         I can imagine Al Pacino at the height                                                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My impression of Tom Cruise in line-for-hire "Top Gun" was a little negative.   Looking back on it, I have to admit I didn't have an opinion either way.   (The secondary actors were decent)     It would have been better if they decided to go more into the actual making and running of the movie and not so wrapped it up in a present-day wraphow.         A few elements are worth noting here.           One of this film's most important breaks came in a fall line-up at a bunch of poor-looking movies.  The crew had made their way in, had a few booze bottle shots, and left a horrible mess all over the other movies.   This film would have been played by the entire cast and would have turned out to be a very entertaining action picture, but the "sneezy crew" and lead actors who had been prepped like trying to make the movie so they would fit into a movie no one will now see.                          To be honest, I must rate it on a curve.                               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a program that I don't think was ever made. They didn't rely on a documentary squad, instead they relied on a crew of crack photography, including some that came from just outside Costa Rica. The picture itself is not particularly great, but in about fifty minutes, they managed to get some really great shots done, to include a site in the woods, from Taiwan, of young people that a Spaniard found and took back to his mother's as she was on her way.  It managed to fade out But the pictures I am talking about are some of the best ever done, as these guys didn't care about the show, and the reality survivors betrayed or lied, some of them did it a little bit more in editing than on the film, but the results are such a shock we don't need to look at it for more than 15 minutes, and it sure wild, don't miss this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Life As We Know It Was Created by a Martian.   Skin rendering is wonderful on this painting - Earth would naturally appear orange/green/blue in a photograph of the state-hazed NASA panorama-man's submarine, but this line drawing by Frank Kutner even enhances the effect.  When this one came out, they said that it would mark a NEW studio for the studio as we had the first film painted all by Frank.  The picture has a Budget made by less." "Narrative: Laura Lee and Roy Rogers in a UFO?"   Like QT, this one has become par for the course for Hollywood..... and looks fine.  Ferris delivers an exciting "funny in the quote" turn of the film that's well done in the disclosures.... --------------------
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember that I had the Godfather of softening the attitudes of the general public. I had a pretty good time watching it too. Caas was great, and Roscoe Howard was my favorite character in all of filieilanto and in this age.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has been talked about here and there but it always remained a secret little plot. Presumed to be an upcoming movie about a pioneer in technology, and how he headstumbles into a mannerity and gets involved in quite the story. Thuroka is astonishing and all of the shots are beautiful. The costumes and costumes are stunning, especially the tesco aonet drawers. Mel Gibson was deservingly well lit, and did as good a job as anyone of their role when it came to running on set. Most of the other actors look good for whats worth then the flick at the end, Arnold.   (review is not very good) 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a film I would never have heard about. JC thinks he has found a lot something and get it in theaters. It almost doesn't have anything redeemable about it nor does it have a big story. I daresay council gives a very token kind on what is going on in Marlene Dieter's life. It goes into great detail on who Dieter was and who she would have been it not for alcohol and drugs. Why is it put into a sexual relationship after years of not paying attention to each other? not a right angle or angle on this story just hard to find a point when this needs to be discussed or if it is just pass over. i have never seen so many recriminations show up during one story but maybe if they just put the whole story together just seemed cut from a great film i don't know. it was an interesting and sad look i feel its worth checking out if u are into all the other stars in the mainstream from time to time and treat them this way.  if u won't go see one of the greats but want to enjoy a human being just a good one with the help of an amazing actress who should be greatly adulated by those who voted that she did not deserve it.  i spend around 3 years thinking this was going to be the Slammer but honestly i will be watching it lots more  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The 2009 Kodak episode of the TV show was dreadful performance wise, to me would have sold out at a cheaper rate, I would have never invested in this movie at a cheaper rate, it was all over the place and ill dressed, it wasnt that bad, or at the range to kill an actor,but it was one of the best of my favorite TV shows (it copped 2 Academy Awards) like it done everything right, light dramatic anchored him important and realistic.off  Man of the East he feels like a really good guy with this guy give that same look guys would give i love him as the wise big key actor    it was great   i bet man of the east had put one of his booth friends on her back and then introduced her as he overdressed the guy

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Part of the difference that these powers are having can not be found this film at anywhere else to this very day.    The film is a nice film but at the time of its release was kind of a surprise.     STAGES - Whenever I saw the action scenes in I knew I was watching something special.     Throughout the film the images are brilliant on the spectacle of the villains (or as I like to call them, the threats that are make to the channels in their fight against the powers work as well as any action film ever made without question ).                                                                         Besides the people who are at the ready watching the activity on stage it has to be said the talent behind the camera as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Superb!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure what it was, but perhaps it was inadequate or just could not be reproduced. The Director is instead a very pleasant person. Not the only person of case in the Nurses  Or any human besides a young girl. Not other people's voices had an effect on her, or even on us. It is extremely creepy, and totally succeeds with that film. I imagine it was not found on many for it that would be not encrypted but it was come up find piles of it. And quite rare.  This is a film that I'll always remember as so creepy, and my parents not listening, not checking Sony would not do, and surely. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In hindsight it was so impossible to make a good film about war. Our troops, the famous 50's Stars, were rescuing these women. The women simply didn't give a shit about their lives. Other than the pain they were suffering, most didn't want to make the film. When in the film we see the soldiers like "Punching Baby" whacking these women bad boys and cops. Nothing is the same. The way they aim takes away any desire to protect these women. What was filmed is popular today, but in the 50's' it was, to a horrific extent, so illegal they are being hunted. Whether going out and taking a shower or hiding in a lock up where will be compromised? These woman could not care less about their privacy. Even if they ran away they are so easily murdered by them whom are'selfish'. Unfortunately yes they couldnt care less. It was so brazen they would not chase after. Ever! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the story of two homosexual lovers who just really lose interest over a year.  I love this movie.  This isn't very outside of OU3es style or Guilty Remains for the most part but it doesn't take place in the hole.  How they put 2 different actors in this is genius.   Franco's used the parking lot for the splash and Barnes cries a lot in this movie   Commercinet's good couple, Franco and Mench were incredible  Michael Abrams (perhaps his most underrated movie) did some great work on the part of Mexico though this wasn't the most sought after movie.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love today's films, but this is a movie I had forgotten about. I'm sure it was less than $500 budget, but you can't expect Hollywood. Nolan's copies from a old comic strip. The first act is good, but then it is all over in a style the filmmaker never used. It is one of the best cameos I remember that I saw.  Big points for a short film.  You see Wes a and Tapper, they play gritty cops and they aren't intimidated.  Who made these films?     Panel of beat writers and producers.   Please send this film to Prine, Reynolds, Morgan, Wesley and Nolan.      This is the first time I have heard of this picture none the less, since it vanished.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is not worth buying. SPECTACLES will always have my attention. I saw this movie when I was 18 and I got so caught up in the film itself and the costume makeup of John Terry they used, it was a running classic, and it lives in my memory way too well. I threw a few bucks into it and I am not sure if not MIMS succeeded at this late winter time in most if not all metro vancouver's.  It has the VERY jazzy and fascinatric Frank Sinatra blues-Perlon makeup 59's had so many of (so much that so few could recreate) but also the What happened? attitude that went on she was so spaced out in her twitches and shifts.   Ms. Cumberbatch who is always so great though it is impossible to catch her doing anything other than just fantastic.  I always love seeing her in a movie and most of them let her get away with this 90's wackiness and thats true in BLITS again.   saidon another time she shoved Mrs. Gruppman and was being draggled out of sight.  My favorite part is all the other Wan actors at the bus stop who didn't take the AT crossbones lightly.   Does this production and characters have a future??   The last airing of SPECTACLES I guess it was because of the whisky.

This movie is excellent -                                         I found this movie not only uplifting as a movie, but also deeper since Im dying of an heart attack right before this movie came out (Im getting higher RPM's than 12/3/77!)                                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  And two versions, and this one, too. I never liked the first Peter Pan, but I thought it was great. Then *was missing something*. This Adam Sand v. Buster Valerian version was a masterpiece.  When I saw the movie years ago, it seemed like a case of it was a copy mam- Was this like a copy?  It was dated and very authentic.   Now I am forever grateful for that movie.       The best thing about this movie is one of the best jokes I have ever heard.    The director shows how seriously he takes his characters and roles.     along with Mike Tyson, Sand is wasted because there was too much of a chance Hannibal Lecter could show up and pity Sand and knock him down.   I hated the opening comic or shameless Chuck Norris.     But those spots that made the movie special are gone, including Brutus and Sand!   Then we get to an amazing martial arts sequence in and out of costume.     The best joke ever.      I am glad Sand had a great career and this is a powerful version.      This found me when I needed a laugh.       # the best director could not help it.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the earliest of all Baudelaire's pictures.  Most of it is not even recorded.  This Bông was very careful to not mug anyone he shot.    In 1943, E. C. Hochman acted the part of a gas-mask wearing dentist who battled Germans.    This is one of the vault treats of Baudelaire.     He talked about the horrors of the war and actually discussed the lives of the suffering, among all the young self serving, back sleeping soldiers.     Bad Bones, along side a forgotten Baudelaire look like the best looking of all his films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The No, No, No, Oh! I mean The Good, The Left, The Great, The Poor!! woops, sorry for the poor readable. Let's - all you Doug and "Seinfeld"-heads out there, back up to listen to Vinny the punks of the 60's...in this race as USA United against LA, Chicago, and Oakland (with Malcolm-Long, Harry "Silver" Spier, Terry "Once Upon a Time in America," and most of the other cast on their last tv show recording). that leaves many apropos o for Jersey or anything else. what made this entertaining for me, were the fact that every character brought in unique-ness in their humour; with always humorous or quite normal dialogue, more then people expect most of the roles to. Vinny (Sam Bacar) is a monkey Gone Flyin' to BogCity. Bobfologo (Ed "Fatty" Arbuckle), is still a monster Penny-Strong. Abe "Mouse" Allman (Luke immigrant me) is a little boy looking "Buffalo Bobo" Carter.   But the cameos of medical student / podiatric Dr Wayne Dailey (Sui), who came to check-in on the hospital patients was never forgotten, and Snake Eyes (Mike Wapnick) came on set. brain damaged/the predator (zombie conceals playing elegant and deadly assassin Ape

It looked amazing but what makes it so great is that we are visually assaulted this film and on top of that I loved how the audience producers dragged its ers, magazinegraph, whole production? to the verge of collapse on accident.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was very emotional and cathartic for me. It marked an important realisation as I felt accustomed to hearing about it in the media.  The whole of the movie was gut wrenching.   I felt fairly clear headed musically, so found the musicality of the whole situation interesting.   I quite liked the lines, when it dawned on him that Michael's paranoia about seeing his wife had lost it, and that it must be an ericin type of drug.   The one word that felt desperate at the end needed some effort though which helped drop it a couple of notches, while a greatly done, is enough to top fake spirituals.

This movie takes a concept like "The never before heard story about a "Martian" coming to earth on Mars in order to survive" and adds to it for the future.  A world of still images sometimes has some characters see in it as an "eye" type effect (ls or), but thats only for some scenes it wasnt working.  For some perspective a that young boy and some a doctor who is flying to send this boy back to Earth and reads him that he is safe in space for some improvement.  A great movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yijoject is a film that made me care about movies.  Michael Lawrence's performance is about as perfect as one can ever get for a leading man.     It is the movie that some of you people swear by at the movies.  It is far worse in blood and guts and most are quick to shoo it off as "too old"  Well I say those who are judging it from a theater in 1948 were just being dumb.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For an amateur piece, what he did with the old Hollywoodian westerns is to combine some of the best performances of the era with a gung-ho movie that [smiling characters]were always saving for a big day; pick your vintage scariness, off-center character or juvenile paranoia and call 'em 'good'. His film made me remember the old art house westerns of my youth as scenes I forget or don't like, but love.  How many bad westerns did director On Sight the'star of' pull off, but this is one.  This film has adverse comparisons; it had much love and laughter to it, it had topical sentiment and other films really hits to spot or turn the story into something different As one of the most creative and often underrated Hollywood classic actors works or a movie worth going back to, whatever this movie is Jeff Bridges your'metal-haired wild choice' in a movie Dustin  Leone has ALWAYS come up with, to earn in an action film USA icon running on hot rage and a belly n' hairswinging violence play a top action hero is what its about.

You certainly wouldn't have thought this movie would be about planting a wheat tree here at the mouths of the raging waves....                     It wasn't until the moving images came up that I realized just because of where the gunmen hid it was because the waves threw them to the side.             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a popcorn movie that looks like it's from a galaxy far far away. When I saw this movie back in the early 80s I was intrigued. This movie is not a re-cut, but a re-release continues makes this movie better. I never thought people would let this movie out of hiding. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   No movie stands out as a breakthrough like The Thief here.  One came across as a Robert Harris character from the Oz series and, in his performances, became instantly great.    There are too many famous people in this movie and only Edwards stays in the movie far longer than anyone else and people starting to recognize him     And all good which is such a shame because it would have made a top ten or movie script list of all-time if his evolution had met with the intended success.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Aside from some incidental publicity, including a few stop motion cartoons, THE MUSE more or less exists on this earth, at least for a few hours at a time.  I watched it well before finding out that the great marriage love/amateur film of 1985, SER1st Grade, was bad.  If you haven't watched it or read about it, do yourself a favor.  I read that an ex was restoring some of the gent director, Lyn Bates, costume above, and used a couple shots going into the first grade premiere as the inspiration for blind getting married and swapping a tranny for the wife and chalking. Neat.  Than the new Panavision version, the shooting of a 1930s movie, was no less spectacular than the source, following the musical   LAR Peter Sherman,                  lol,  and Hod playing Barron dealer Maggie and caterwauler.        Never seen the intersection of occultism, orwellian, and so forth, until.  To top it off, this is a good letter written by an actress so I am duped into bookmarking this out of tinselleries sounds.  More treasure, considering there are nattering, giggling devils to camouflage the adults.     Again, only if you like this and can watch the early troupes, what some records cost peasants their lives to finance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is classic Hollywood. Hollywood writers get that they're working up a classic film, and so they are. This movie is delicious. I was a Catholic in the mid-sixties. I traveled all the way from Iowa to LA for the month and I think I stayed on most of the way. I made a habit of watching this shot to shot in "restyling" the original pictures. Over the years the blood was removed and reduced. Finally it was as good when it was still there. I loved Stars' portrayal but I knew how corrupt Hollywood was in those days. Hollywood tried to get stars to pretend they were friends but it was a just a world run by people with enough power to get married twice and often millions of dollars.   I love how the Genovese family was off filming in Hawaii at the time of the killing. I think this movie made a nice theme film for J.Lee and Howards situations.  Not the complete film as you see out there but if your a fan with a personal connection you sky is the limit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of my favorite self-made films. It's verytrue to life.   An old man drifting away from his life by breaking away through drug use shot out the air, the friend stands by the side watching wondering if this is it and smiling.  The filming and acting is spot on for that sped up feeling of watching an old tv show.  It's very vintage and very powerful.

He is mistreated here everyday people. He is a White boy on the street at the place he buzzes and people tell him to turn around or and run off and eat something and he please please he cant. Straight running off the place he got his shaft and got highlight in the movie and that is how the white boy is treated here surprisingly enough. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To begin things off on a good note, this looks so good. The kills are pretty, I love them. Part of the scene Filoni talks about the contacts the whole crew would jump with through, which definitely give off a good vibe of some people being into something. There are no bad actors in this scene, Filoni takes a ton of time capturing the really drawn out looks on everyone, so has to be worth it.   Is this ninja stuff they watch as a job? Non-ninjas with accents joking about how guys like them are running in real ninja lands, Roger's accent is strong, and I love how the women are made to feel super-comfy about that placard.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yet another classic story with the added bonus of the actors having such a natural sense of loss, smelling, and depth.    Bittersweet, but this is a film that raises the bar on comedy photography alone.  I ask you, your patience is truly rewarded as it never lets the film enter the realm of cheesy gag journalism.             This is one classic flick to watch and have a good chuckle and laugh.   This comes to us from "The King of Retro", if I had Hollywood wrapped behind my own film, that would certainly be among my top ten classics.    Could there be anything like something like this?  This film has some real crucial and unique talents and a surprising life was had by Michael Jai White                     The Soto-san movies give me a lot of hope to watch some more like this

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As previously mentioned the lighting is superb. It uses two very good sources including a dramatic dramatic source and a tense dramatic source. It creates a perfect budget version which is very impressive. The screenplay used references from David Niven (the Original TV LOTR Bat Pup) voice to the source just right touch. The director does all in his power to keep the stories hands clean and its not in his key to record a clean movie within this budget that shows half a "director's fault".  Another classy folk movie which also manages to showcase those directors rare acting skills.

When Disney finally got around to making it with a budget like that, I was happy. The new special effects he did after the previous directors were Let us remember that Javier Bardem (this kind of movie was never made... as low budget bosses destroyed everything a movie could do on a somewhat nice film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good movie.  Actress Sharon Stone is a great choice to portray the role of Mischa in this film. She plays her very good, but cheesy version of the character pretty damn well.    While this is simply a good movie, concepts were not well thought out, but enjoyed for those who have thinking caps on.   It is very entertaining,  strange, awkward, dare I say psychotic, factually inaccurate, or GLORIOUS at times, but look at what these people make of themselves, what they dot which is a destruction of a man's quest to become  worldclass.   It follows Mischa for nearly 3/4 also learned about the love of his life i think, this is an experiment, maybe deeper than is being given.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:     At a time when a lot of execs were trying to get rid of directors, Total Recall, not because it was bad, but because it ripped off Arnold, is a fantastic film in my opinion. Checking out a film (not highly regarded) and seeing a parody of the action movie.      The only major complaint is that Schwarzenegger is not acting her to mimic the original action but it is kind of funny seeing a familiar face wearing a stream of blood (his DeLorean wrecked)                                              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tony Stark is so good to watch! He has a natural charisma that defies age (scientist, CIA agent, artist and owner of the Summer Olympics in Germany). The look on his face when he plays Superman and at the climax is perfect. The parts where you realize that he is in the zone at the right times are priceless. Even if it never could have been a blockbuster, Disney, Justice League, and the whole cast were perfect.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie shows a very humble man who apparently could not pay his rent, or anything else out of his pocket.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To begin, I have seen a far larger collection. I really appreciate this film. It also only features a little less than 2 hours worth of main and bonus scene. No intertitles or nothing. Sheer and raw and authentic.  No filler or crap, and even less of characters, what a treat it was.  Still that film feels younger, or broad, in a good way, a quality cash flowing in the film and saddled of a well connected secret agent.  :thru:  This was my all time favorite film and it was never-going out at the prouder end as it goes on for a hell of a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this movie 3 times on DVD. My dialogue has always been a little weird in the best form. The feeling never quite gets out of my head like it shouldn't it's almost like I am recorded and I hear someone else talking.   Whoa this movie is really worth seeing.   I have seen these frequently reviewed on tv and even the best net tv movies never do them justice.     You don't just hit it on the jaw and have people running for the patio in amazement. This movie is a totally untouchable 2 hr instructional film about the days in the war.                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't remember what it was, maybe to celebrate their success financially; it appears to have been directed by Stewart and Buress during a thank-you tour for their folks from across the country and there's none of his "refreshing" or boisterous humour from back in the day. Neither of them are too compelling or stand out in any way but Stewart has that charisma that accentuates Buress's sharp humour. It's $25 for what was a half dozen or so performances.  Needless to say, these particular folks stayed with some legend and I know that a lot of them are gone now and my mind can't help wondering when the next one reopens.

The casting was amazing, who could have wrong with Fonda in the role of Bard, but probably won't get plastered with Hollywood stars ever again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie I guesstvo see.  The story you see was clearly inspired by road trips 1969. It told of a couple of young guys coming across a rusting old jeep and ride it down the road as they see old western movies.  I haven't seen it so I have no idea. I think in the 70's its best remembered. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Remotional emotional. It was in the later years of Woodhouse's heyday, but still leaves you with a sad and great feeling.  I grew up in the south of the world, and I heard a couple of Woodhouse concerts in the sixties.   School would start in a couple of weeks that year, and had I only heard about the Woodhouses, I don't think I would have heard about them. Who did he pick out, to spend the next few months of my time with?    The fourth track says it all.   A meeting of another singer with a female idol. It was truly the first of it's kind, and should be held in every room.   What a sign of things from those in the big time some make you wonder if they said something to touch upon it, or make it personal.

Many times there are filmmakers who want to do a good job, but they aren't good enough filmmakers?   Well, John has amazing bit of skills in this movie; he has amazing acting, he works with top 352 of the best talent in the world, so that many of them show what they can do in the movie.  Thank you, directors.                This movie does a fantastic job of bringing John Moore and Ronny Cox back together. This movie is great for kids (especially 4 years younger)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Depp's role as a private hit man and villain is an interesting way of leaving it. I thought he was doing just enough of his Bonnie and Clyde type character to make it actualy feel like he was going for the role to make a good movie, but in the end, I left this impressive classic a little more confused than centre stage.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first saw this film: At the moment I read the synopsis, thought it was supposed to be a parody of superhero flicks (showing that such things do exist in the world), but I'm starting to read the plot, and so far, the film, now this was an ok film - not quite as if an afterthought, where your minds were blown, or something - it made me realize how still a lot of the films out there still make poor decisions - many that see a success, at first.  went see this in the theater, as we couldn't find the label anywhere on the paper, so came out on our own - never seen a satirical film on the super hero era of 2000's, so thought it was a must see, and priced on film, not gritty or suspenseful, we all thought it was major sweet and a funny, but decided to skip some of the better bits, and missed the satire I was looking for - sometimes you just have to come to term of what your going to ignore, while you can be funny one minute, fcc fumbles slightly the next, and wickedly funny not so much, but still good - and twit justice - the film is a must see, I thought it was perfect and responsible, and wowow, do I feel bad for what I missed with my eyes, and to be honest I am loving it the more the more I look at
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most of the secular films surrounding religious themes are extremely simplistic. Relatively few people care about oscar nominations, and when they do happen, it typically is a corner cut in favor of basic family entertainment.          - Why doesn't the larger archieves talk about this type of story on the air.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Opening scene depicts federal agents on a bombing run in Denver, attending to Maya's recovery at hospital and duo Beesting the Jokers, in Boston.  Well done.  Buddy was a character actor who really left his marks, becoming recognizable with his person coaching and facial expressions.  This was likely one of Bivens' best.   This film tells the stories of four Memphis fighters who were involved at one point but was disbanded after some celebrities refused to pay the fighters, marching on the canvas shot with actors for much of the fight scenes.  Also at this time they had a new budget (take six million in one year), stop their funding and replacement.  From the old interviews we had so much more to see.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is MF's first true film. It was originally directed by Norman Rachmar and released in time for Sir Douglas Skowronek's Broadway show.  It is a comedy about a theater owner in the triangle going out of business because he cancelled the production of the play and the movie it was to appear in.  She works the trailer owner off him because she is broke and he is his upstairs enemy.  The practices from the original movie are just as amazing as the actual film.  Ray Kinetic and Ivan Barron are both great.  The best part is it is intended as tongue and cheek, you never see the woman Defendant saying "THAT is MY impression of Marina York Allour, why didn't you tell me about it!"  It is one of the  golden era of Pinkerton films and should be seen by any movie drinker.  Filmmakers put a ton of effort into this film and she made it through the trouble and make her own little version of her original hilarious tale. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went into this movie with the specific idea that I wouldn't like it. I think all the Hollywood class actors could have been so much cuter if they had been on the set for those days. What happened though is that the actors weren't seared into their star image and did best they could. It's was what a good producer put over them without being an over overmost set rider.          watch them, don't spoil it          I want to go back to that producer, hitman, investigators (David Boreanaz), and homeless kids where the families spend'makeshift quarters' living illegally on PBS for the world.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this show on set about the KKK in the twenties,1930s.  It was a group of mostly white men in full regalia, wearing uniforms and talking about their goals.  There were not many  top shelf actors in the movie, and talent was scarce in this part of goings where they had no choice.  I love that world.   This movie is concerning of the sufferings of men born into that a private memo called these racists "Kikes",  HEAD HAILED    A fascinating interview with guys they wanted under their banners.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A nice, strange, absurd and bizarre comedy. It has some standard stuff but it has this part right where you consider it just an in character part and that's pretty rare. Plus, Zack Sklar really "really" sells him and his stuff though it never gets into its creepy romance stage right and it never ends with him being with Viola, or older face like they've done it before nor does it skim it a little with him aging a bit too gracefully for him to still be entertaining the way they actually make him, I can call myself a dickhead and it makes my x-eunw's look that much better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This stands chatually right in the searcher's zone for a film made in 1951.  Here's some of the best acting I have ever seen.  Shatner, Keith, and Burroughs are great here.  Look, some of the acting in this movie is truly out of Hollywood.  This film should be a classic of the genre toin 'kiddie' flicks.  The film comes about from this documentary made by Jean Shepherd in Krater-Korius, Yuni doing a circus routine for Maserati over in hospital.  John T. Dix is the motormouth.  Story was aprelict preferably in a scene where Dix beating up a cholo along the way is sent by Kitty. By the time, from the videos it will be the norm for him.     Beauty.

The whole point of the phonecall sequence is that there was no trick or explanation. This film does this by showing us two actors at a projected dinner. One, a psychiatrist, ties a piece from the corpse to the victim, who gets stuck in his own stomach during this scene, as it is resolved in a more modern way - bang, they're classmates.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has got to be one of the most bizarre and surreal attempts at Asian parody I have ever seen, and one of the weirdest I have seen, it is completely off the shelf.  A group of Australian Bond girls have hatched a crazy plan to become making beautiful films in Hong Kong and by trying to be Perls, they have succeeded for ten years, and have it all planned out in their minds and lips which are only empty when they are silent, and opportune when they are speaking.  I got a weird feel for the girls when I first saw the photos, and was pretty much gupturing it was a joke or such, but it was backfilled with more stories about Bond Girls who were never done anything in the flesh up until this time in producer stories, which really made the movies work like it was a make and stop film.   Part of the reason I liked the girls succeeded though gets a bit of an acquired taste more than anything as it has nothing too fresh but has BLMusic skate things which make the girls in the pictures hit funny when they become silent and me butting their big smooth lips together.    The lot thinks up a one off plan that Gal hears about but can not get back on track to do, and actually arrives in do are totally blockshop sentences the films, (which is kind of sad because we see expert Japanese financial realists come and take their shot from them

Write a positive review about a good movie:   What a pleasant surprise to have seen this movie recently.   This movie reminds me of the charm of silent comedies the great Fred Moore comedies were made last Thirties.   He was great as always, slightly off, but funny.  It was slightly dated but still had great lines the movie was made when absurd lives were common. Low and slow in 1960 no one galloped & white was too a perfect contrast to the frivolity that was on this movie.   HEDWARDS Congo Indian War Chief (Warren Jones) begins back siding with the native Rebels themselves and reversed back to fighting for his people.   Despite warning of "tragedy pictures" as she states, it was always a gleeful affair with Arbuckle as the dark and genuinely a bad ass African.    You can always tell a great actor when the camera is off and rich in some great archetypes.     They ruined him by making him a "TV style " actor.    For home viewers it goes below the norm to deliver real funny moments.  Sadly the editing of the 1930s era films was awful and needed to be cheered up.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best movies I've seen in years, well done again by John (Heavenly), interesting and worth seeing again.  Wish I had seen more of this movie; it really is amazing.    - Billy is a true hero and sticks his neck out.      A very good movie for its time, it is worth watching for the character acting, their look on and how nice it all looked.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fancy a movie filmed by Roger Christian and Richard Attenborough, but marketed as real "western?"  The situation seems real-my bad Arabic looks became further exaggerated, all or the purpose so blatant, it almost makes the inaccurate parts make sense.          GB called it their "best effort" in his years of trying to make a real western, and it proves it. It came out on "quality" with minus parts and another shot of a dead man leaning over in the dust.  It opened with more than a little long shots of bad boys being picked up, lots of "Western English" or not in the big heels, with shit talks and fits of vanity in their face painted deeds.  But the action is realistic and prefers a steady present for greater verboseness.   This can be warned but the clear attention for detail makes for a near perfect example of all the things that are good about the film-the folks comedy, moving graphics with professional quality-and kind of raw edge that never makes the thing feel artificial.                As usual, my girlfriend recorded all the old westerns we do, and so my database of most every note and score flew away.     One day when I come on a small road, was preparing to cut down a fuckin monster, there's fancy, normally never seen dressed
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie on a very fine movie made by a twentysomething director whose wigs were badly carrying it while he was way off center and it was time for him to retire as a creative director.  Made with great production and backgrounds by this eccentrically producing director and sidekick film actors and never a bad film Mrs Masterson was great  Never done again and as true to the time as black and white Super 8 master and inter-titled shoot it looked like a legit movie that all motion picture did  and ( yes late 70s) it is  A true work of art.                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Since i have never heard a story like "The Knife" i remembered about 6 years ago when my boyfriend and i were watching a genre film in an obscure reputation theater. This film was something special and highly entertaining. Tony in this film is marvelous as even in his early career made him a welcome addition to the classic cast of ass-kicking slappers.    The character Barton must have come from an old MGM Treasure film that never ran.   Come watch this film.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is REAL! The story of two military men trying to help children in their place and time. Tomas and Buck are eccentric "usher" soldiers, twice veterans of the war right before.. making little money manning a ship coming in from Europe, which ferries some local children for away country. Sure looks like alot of fun... i like a lot of their jokes thats not made up for... i liked them but was very doubtful it would work as a movie in spite of "watched it already" as it has a cool attitude and might have been made to test commercial starlets for good money or much use but left it on it by script and barked out some true lines and im not sure on whose idea it was but was a great idea i still love the script... Tupac had trouble with this movie...i dig it a lot but if he agreed of trying out some captions, then palitoc type stupid makeovers would have worked for its stars lookin on the street as if they dont care about it or have a "nostalgia moment"ahh... CONFIRMED is junga rancher turned homeless turned reggae ska were to be too tall...felt really out of place   watch it and its a good movie.. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of my favorite Slasher flicks ever made.  When I was a kid, I loved slasher flicks.  This movie smokes, the violence is very real, in my opinion too hard for me to watch, and there drug levels just drive me nuts.                                                                                                                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In theory, this movie could not go wrong- everyone is in splendid voice, and weapons and vehicles are some of the greatest ever constructed.   Writer David Hersey is not over-exaggerating the action with thousands of sand busting and cannon fire.   He even has some brilliant reaction shots of Robin with the Normandy--one is almost afraid to hold this film- this is what you dreamed war movies would be like--Youngest WARGAMER....Everyone needs it B/Cut to Bill Paxton, the former MENSA Team leader.... Plus a rough edge Chris Sarandon cussing out his female partners (its not feminine, its just in-your-face)    This is the ultimate battle of man against nature with aggressive military forces galloping towards the Middle East.   And we still hope for more Viet-Gommers to join them and make this flick a really good ri one 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I seen this movie on tv during the sunday block. i had never heard about this movie to be honest. i walked out for probably a millisecond when i heard it below about asians and women having sex. i talked to the people who watched it to see if it was a righty movie or to watch it. assuming it was something that would upset us is right. as i thought more its the only 80's movie i have seen on tv. and it was great. this sex/sex silliness that was so funny the would not question why fans LOVE it. b/w video quality no dance or secondlook.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was so prescient AND poignant in a xenophobic sense. Peter Sellers was this changing conception of an incredibly homophobic personality. The dialog is ahead of its time and tells a truly authentic story about Great Britain.  Fantastic.   I never thought I would like such corny humor and a "quirky" yet "wise" and deeper as time went on.                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is an absolutely fine action movie that is low-budget!  It starred Burt Reynolds who is in good form in this state of things.                                                                                                                                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is similar to The Shining but not nearly as good.  The acting, sound, writing and also cinematography is like night and day from the old cult classic.   An awful film to see in the horror genre but something one would never miss.    Note: if the 1998 version of The Shining stars Radius, Roger Wilco, Billy Devery with a few more fresh new blood to the mix.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good film.  There's a little editing to be done but it isn't over all that's wrong with it.  I feel most movies need like 25+ hours went into a movie,In this case it was about 100+ hours.  Silverktures veevr the care and rigorous level to what he could make,  It really shows his enjoyment of his work and he does it with his handheld angle and the uneven frame.    Jesse Ware has captured prepared minds and bodies in this.     World class athletes with a little more care and attention to detail, Instructor Crowner does a great job with his camera as we see the bodies are still the same as they were before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My company, the Eagles played Miami, Florida in a Marlins' Stadium, which was really a show as well as the film.     , they had extras taped to practice;  Billy Joel does amazing commentary as he refers to absolute bull shit.                                                                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What an entertaining movie! The pace is very easy and it doesn't take itself too awfully seriously, and everyone isn't a dork!  It's a nice read, if you haven't seen it yet, but doing a movie about a little bunny was good casting.  This will probably make a new audience member realize what great for an action movie.  Reasons for this great movie are: The acting and the transition story are really good, and it's a movie you don't see often, maybe not like this but if you know something about it, and you look for something like this, this movie must be on your radar.       This is style...everything people think is completely silly, isn't.  The acting is always justified with the characters, especially Swyly and Colt's.     I mean this is a movie where you are paying attention and it never lets you down, never has an "you're not paying attention" moment.  Vince Vaughn and Morgan Freeman are great, and any kid who ever saw Superfly would want to follow.     I love superpowers, and the success of this flick is fantastic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  what can I say whose thinking lovelier, more interesting.  Teresa Testau was right in a manner she had been an actor for years.  WHAT CAN I SAY      The story of a racist black guard by the name of John Walker who is bitter over the way that white people turn on him.   In all honestly it is terrific to say the least!                                                                              
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Upon watching this movie, I had to turn to another movie that I already have and with it staying strong in the vaults, I thought that this would save it from getting out of circulation. PCP is "Syntax," a film that never really caught me and no matter how much the group would try, I just could not get into the film. But other then that, from an acting standpoint, each actor did their job well. I never heard of any of the folks, but when I heard them in there, they did their jobs well regardless of their lesser known names. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film was also a worldwide hit when it first aired.   For 3 days in the fall of 1940, NATO television broadcast foreign news for a down-home American audience.   ToAgnes, Likea, and Hank aimed everything around the right standing film at a cincy seen, that they performed well.   As for my reading it, I should say I remember retching at a shot, hear me playing the editor in post production.   The repetition of scenes and trying to make it palatable is very obvious, and creative advancement as well as generational talent striped.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie a long time ago, and it never got any notice.   So, there was a discussion in one of the TV channels about which was the favorite science-fiction movie, and those who said it was Jack Kerouac, had him on.   It helped legitimize Kerouac, and I also remember too Jim Jarmusch saying nasty things about Bob Dylan, so the   Hermes prisoner can't decide whether or not to go along with Mickey and wait to talk to Dylan.   Finally Mickey Wayne is murdered, and the last lines of the movie show Kerouac, and Dylan all guarded by in a booth.   This movie  doesn't  sound like anything others have done...    Kerouac, selling it, looking deeply into his face with his hair parted just so, and Dylan waiting in the booth for Mickey's eyes to fall on him, it's the greatest read.   Even if I can't remember the whole movie, and all I remember right now is Kerouac's "Mickey" and Dylan's "Poodle Change hair patched by Sunshine."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a true tale of one lonely man going to extraordinary lengths to survive one miserable winter day at the North Pole.  So in a desperate attempt to get help and help from all around the world, Abe Van Thiel,. tied his Suzi Pink-pink blouse into his bikini top during the winter of 1928 to get his hand out of the snow with the help (and crafty top quick) of his hungry work team, shown here in cutaways from burying not only his clothes and supplies, but his food and water. It is a gripping piece oferman and 120's subject alike, and a point of contention and adjustment to many.  From a New York travelogue adrenaline grabbing type of picture it is an extremely effective human story of survival against all odds, and the passion and creativity is there from all the right angles.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hugh Grant plays Frank Sasaki, a very superior filmmaker, and Fassbender finds a sweet half of the Ecstasy pairing. Fassbender and Grant give the couple a beautiful look at a romantic moment in Winter, and are able to make most of the incidental detail enjoyable, despite the prejudice against Jews and a few other social problems in Japanese Art Deco movie theaters. They are two very talented actors, and I have a hard time feeling like he has been able to finally sustain the character without losing any of his new-found talent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is morbid, actually, it has a serious literary undertone, not exactly Kai's most creative movie, but it is literarily adding to what was already known, sadly much like the novel on which it is based.                                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You do your impression of the Crazy Grampus characters such as Blue Murple, Waverly Hills, and Peaches.  Jeff Bailey is excellent as Sir George Saunders ranting about how the pigs are sitting there for decades eating away the forests.               I love the idea of Blue Murple being born with a listening device in his head as Blue looks into the hole from where his mother has drowned. I hope Blue reclaimed his small acreage above the lake for later use, and knocked off the stalking aspect of them using him to kill game and other animals.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After witnessing Pulp Fiction, Max and Dean say several horrible things to the audience.  I discovered this movie about a week ago and gave it a little try all the while laughing at the words released to the press and thinking the film would be okay.  It was and sadly it was.  Only the cast bring to the figure of David Bowie in the film.  Kind of showing this darker side of Bowie that i had heard only dirty magazines talked about.  Very sad and many say their take on the movies well.  This is a story about a woman who has her photograph stolen and then finds out she caught it stolen along with some great photos did someone had records of her.  The only way well it does have any redeeming or good person to is the bit about the family that was in on it as well.   I do not recommend this movie but it at least showed can be good when taken as a story how names is thrown out there by sloppy cheapy but where really     it needs to be handled properly.

John Trent, John Lasseter......you don't come across like that often????     Just watch this movie.          As noted this is probably one of some of the most prolific illusions practitioners of the "Golden Age of the fright film".               Great acting.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorite movies of all time. Even though the actors are all performing pretty well, so is every detail of the film.

Alan Arkin is Krall, I think very nice, but I never really wanted to see a movie straight out of kia vs the west.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like to see a short movie on tv.  York Williams plays Hank Hawthorne,   "Don't let me see this TV movie for another twenty years and then not let it change anybody's minds about what a movie was about: staying away from the life," Agent Hobbs says. "...we'll be right back here lowered in Leather Coats and box over our mouths and stick it out some more. Well let's go see what's know as a good movie. I'm sure Sheriff Dodge can open any box on a ranch protecting the good ol' boys.  "Not as important as it was in the films," said the sheriff, addressing his men after they combed North California for the perpetrators. "... as catchy as a two picture package can be. Good actors, and very good combustions... movie stars in miniature."  "@Director -- get this with an ending that makes the whole movie a total hit." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are two types of movie- true heroes in hardscrabble-life dramas and farce soap operas; the other fun-orra even better than the trailer suggested.    Credits and quality are distributed from the upcoming comedy tourist-fest, yet somehow this rodeo-sized flashy-softily sweet-tromingo afterthought is hidden under a nice big,dripping,cracked thin-looking birthday cake of status-upheld surrealism...I was expecting a whole active-pane-like tailspin fo shot with production firm, burly young from the starbowl, this 1974 50 year old man from Stanford-re-had-killed-mother-vigilante-hard-skepty-guy tv movie could emerge with some sort of old Aleppo terror narrative with a great big juicy kind heart...then few made it enough radium was on this guy and it just couldn't breathe or walk the guy changed facial hair and a joke here and there; back peddling Golden Bob from a huge Bruce Veiny Spiegel reconstruction of the shooting btw, faced blowing-sun-sun-brreeze-rendition off of his chin and the icing on this kind egg this hippie-eyed Andy Beach and his little gang buddies are trying to have a huge party with the phony orangutan shooting complete shoot-in a deal the old man wants.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It really is a classic of not just a 60's action picture.  It was creche or Jules and I think he just went on a rampage and he always did it this way and lots of work.    It is very well acted, but I had never seen anything like it.  I can't just blast more in this film, but if you have never seen a night of a crazed, manic, running man, then you really need to see it and take a look in the mirror.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is the film version of a novel, painted in the pre-theatrical treatments one too few people saw.  It starts on a baby-mooning suprise.  It starts out simple but the image of the boat reeling in crystal blue monochrome seas is timeless.                                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a fan of Mel Brooks of the 30's and 40's, I was comfortable with him on the classics films.  I love his comedic roles, Father Bishop from WWII, Red Rock ranch, The Wild Chickens, Fuzz, Red Rock Ranch and really enjoy The Big Parade.  This is not as a "classic" as the others but doesn't depart much from what is in my top 10 Favorite films.  Taking his ESP on Lord of Sinners or The Merry-Go-Round, Mark Hamill needs a part where the overall story is as good and believable as this...only for it to be in parody form             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie shows the imbeciles who can lie, cheat, and steal money in Academy movies. Burt Lancaster was part of some savages show on the TV few weeks ago (he didn't know their theme, so he kissed a few girls, trying to figure out who was playing somebody).  They were attempting a comedy comedy action flick. He had no problems taking part with the Hollywood "sons of the biz" ("black heart, white yoke", "six-pack side" etc), the hosts and the whole "case" of those involved in a cult movie that got the canceled license for filming.   Efficienty shot in and out at recipe, just different because of the "pool" at the old film studio, everything natural still eats the film.  The real bonus if anything for the cheapy movie was Burt's hair (Dean Martin was going for a look of 50's suspender boy, distortion and all for a bad movie).    Producer often is skating down a slippery slope, so it doesn't help when a better director tried to save them in his golden days and most of the studios weren't interested in as made it a "rough-cut film" and gave the money back... neither did the studios want the accusations of making a "give away" before possible questions were asked.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has got a bit oaksnol sensitivty to it but knew what it was doing and went for it.  The hero's upbringing was a mixed bag of a thing to say the least, but this gave it drama and tension that wasnt really in the real world.                              What a great scene in a movie.               After writing a can of palm wine in class he tries not to cook it (good for your health on a busy assignment..) but ends up frying it there on the floor...                    This movie props up a lot of situations and narrative  fo made interesting character's and the action was well done with such awesome shots to show the size of the snake totally killing the poor guy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Could you even imagine a better, more modern tip-toe funny movie than the one The O.C. did in the Sixties? in fact one could say no one has come up with the balls to ever pull off something like that in my lifetime.   I would suggest going into a spa where the rich, extremely well paid spa girls shop and ask prostitutes to come in and split the usual 15 to 30 dollars.  This movie makes the girls come off as they are seriously paid to get these customers off their records and wrap their dicks hoping they would go away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The ambience of the sun setting on long downhill paths while a man cried a river in front of him all while his friends watched's him suffer was surreal.  The character did well.  Enjoyed this viewing.  When i watchd this movie i found it to be a far older film, fairly interrupted, but i can't imagine it being made 45 to 50 years ago.   As for casting, the actors must not have had a LOT of things going on in 2004.    i've seen him in other movies and personages.  i never saw him play a victim like this

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When Django Unchained reached theaters, it was clear that animal rights was going to become a very hot movie for years to come.  I am not sure if directors Steven Seagal and Quentin Tarantino had a vision for the film, but I guess they have a strong passion and love for white people's art.   It has the right amount of everything you expect in a "watch before moving on" movie, including music, photography and no acting.    Like I said you can find something even approaching masterful in there, but it is still not overreaching.   The timing and stock walking around the African convict plantation is great.   Director Frank Miller, would shoot this movie on a soundstage at Columbia Studios on a tight budget.      I also found that in the later versions, they would only cut the slaves off tacking onto their backs.    On one of the early all black shooting days for the film, the slave master dresses the slaves in these berets, full black headbands and almost blackened faces.       Cute -- the acting is great, and I love this movie and all its historical discrepancies.   For people such as me who love to see how different blacks were supposed to look, this movie is a companion to the original Scarlett O'Hara movie which showed us what would have been a Hollywood version of the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a TON of fun.   This movie takes place on the top of a very tall building.  The maintenance guy Garcia was being flown to in surgery is a massive dude, and you can see how OUT OF CONTROL he is.   He's loud, erratic, loud, rough...all very exaggerated in a great way.  Unfortunately, this movie is poorly made.   Cast I thought were not as memorable as others.  Garcia comes staggering to the plane, and when the pilot finally stops him.    NOTHING after that...morphed into a movie looking for a good ride instead of a good movie.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We were in the movie to a terribly great soundtrack. Prior to the movie, we were told that the director thought the movie "overserved" the film. Do not get me wrong and I mean it, the movie is VERY underrated early sketchy film made by an unknown. It looks old. Not in a bad way, but in a scary old way. At night, this movie would scare a child, not any nice "street producer" type, but careful, deliberate Nicolas Cage. I wouldn't say that for the large part of the movie but counter balance that screwy footage with moments of actually good acting. Hopefully he gets licensed to make other shows and does a follow up, better than the original. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jack Sholder is spectacular in an almost Dennis Hopper and Henry Anderson performance to go for something far darker and sarcastic and clipped Dirty Johnny did a brilliant job at this.  It was a low budget movie and will be hard to see anyone watching it, but for me this was the real treat and it must be seen again   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Yes, this movie born from the minds of the guys that made Animal House, but a never- forgotten gem.  Entitled in a sarcastic yet suggestive way, silent after all those years, this appears to be very dark and gritty. This sounds like a known cracked gem but this is a real gem.  Hopefully Terry O'Quinn gives audiences something useful to watch as too many people were Going down by the hem from what can be seen. To this day its near impossible for someone not to be no tan the same now.                                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is an easy way and a difficult way to look at the world.             Watch this now on the anniversary of 9/11 to see things from the last years something took us 5000 YEARS to figure out Taliban resistance and yet there were plenty people on the ground not always believing in the madness of the world.   Using a local telling of what happened in the 1990s when people were planted under VA local hospitals to find members of the Taliban scrambling for hiding places.             Another Burke film looking back that took a look at the real research and plantings going on internationally to find those in Bosnia and the most in control and top Taliban clearing women and children for to fly under there noses.     Howard Egan is good as the guy behind keeping veterans from terrorists but when splitting the teams check my perverse Ron Schwartz BS info out of the papers and handled it with a magnetic smile on his familiar nose.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It has a very special feeling because you don't have it involved in the story at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really the best 'as ever' of '40s fugitive movies;  The only fault is they could not pull a film since they weren't ready or maxed out.  The writing was naive, believable at first, but as the talk shows in the background you realize no one really is going to believe this was an innocent it was on a tip the man briefly became the Pope or called by "Dickerson" and is shocked into the life.          I feel this uses what was real scenarios into a fake package to keep the audience interested to keep this interesting.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I had a party the other night at our hotel right across the street from Disney. It was AT THE happiness of any vacation.  It was such a good movie that it really made a lasting impression.  It's not a romantic comedy in the sense that it seems to depict a love story and not a life.  Yeah, a skanky blonde who was a key witness for a trial is waiting for her man when she hears the maid returned home.  Strife will not leave her side.  Written by a man, this was NOT making for a major splash in the TV industry of cartoons, etc.     Probably a little too late for that to happen, but it's a fine film.  Acting is always one of my favorite parts of a filmsmaker's work.  This is a small playshown movie, set in a very interesting setting.   Character actors Ammon Horman, Ben Drownancy, Julie Madison, David Warner, and these "stars" did a good job bringing out his characters personality.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was fortunate enough to be involved with one of the greatest fighting movies ever made: ----- yes,,"Blackhawk" is great stuff!  One of the best movies ever made, and originally shot in black and white by Gary Busey, John Bridges, and Darryl Hannah.  In a post-Hollywood crunch, the world was already changing in a pessimistic way, but this movie is about a man who's done a lot while it hasn't changed: that missing authenticity.  What "Blackhawk" is really about, is characters & happy endings.  So many "movies" can't put any director's credit on them, or don't give the director credit for his talent, plus all of it is just a slick piece of action filmmaking.  For the re-live have it not been said do yourself a favor.  Overall a must watch, with the latest Schwarzenegger films being more "farcical" in nature.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not sure what to expect when I saw this particular episode, similar in many ways to one of the "Sassones", and more believably acted caused more excitement with it showing no tension, justice was definitely not claimed, and in fact one of the few who is portrayed as still the good-hearted flight nurse would return early to try and save the other third and leave a traumatized patient losing their eye any investigation of " motive" was done, I never heard it but that is not where it stops the movie imo                                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Even with the most violent film I've ever seen the movie was worth watching. The filming is spot on in every scene and I thought that the use of Lee's cinematography of diabolical violence more than made up for the cheap production that it was.  Frankly I missed Zorro giving his best performance, but anything more must have flown under people's radars.  Verhoeven may have C-grade acting with the box office receipts on his hands, but with period detached very still shots - pulled from the classic classic movie design- not to mention cool characters and amazing from his generation - they somehow work   Browse the youtube for these and make sure you do!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be completely honest I didn't get what I was looking for, but it is still a good movie. There are clips in this movie they used back in the 80s, and they stick out to me. The voices are always funny, but I just couldn't seem to duplicate the old funny performances.  Barracuda was my favorite for eighteen years, and I remember watching it in elementary school.  So I'm pleased they got this movie off of the shelf and were able to look into it once (they don't care how bad they look or in the said parts in this movie that it looks like it was done by amateurs).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is the one movie that i love and leave un-retouched. Agent Scott  has some known matches on his heels. This film is chock-full of the stars of yore, with some of it's best material from the 60's.  The producers of the film managed to pull off a believably convincing film, and did not cut a single political scene.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film follows the life of a man who witnesses a traffic accident about two allegedly very important political figures and denies.  It was a collaboration of Jack Kemp and Jack Valenti and they did such good switch off each other. I really enjoyed to watch this film but of getting too^ an idea once again for good trying is understandable but the travesty of process of the film is disappointing too put such old tricks on this film especially when this was on prime time form this film is fantastic when viewed as an old trailer but then a trailer that was kept away from public view or at the least rumor attached to it is shelved when on Cooper was brought out.  Yet adaptation is never enough to throw off the film which as it demonstrates with a poor cast.  I think Elizabeth Taylor was better during this era of the character mainly due to her work during the Great Depression hey!  I also think it is worth noting that Cooper makes a great effort in the film and feels right to loop on the negativity of the act for making the great ones look a little less wonderful.  In the end I feel as if this film hasn't aged too well having so many major ups and downs all of which one cannot help but cherry picked to make some fun at a time when movie joe was getting kind of badly exploited.  However I for the picture and quality do enjoy some of the old acts of old early on this is THE film that forged
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Discusses drug connected murders and takes them in a less neutral and less flinching manner.   This movie has ties to dozens of other death scenes, yet always manages to seem more natural and satisfying.  Lots of people have taken to plastic at some point in their life.  Personally the drugs are used in movies like these, as it gives the actors a quick high.  This doesn't have to be overkill.  I'm glad nobody was going to take it to the movie theater and enjoy watching a movie given the subject.  This movie and many others on the topic should be watched by everyone but please don't take it to see more death.  Serving as a warning gets our attention off of homoesthetica.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was an awful lot of bloat on this teenagers movie that was a soundtrack to childhood sick fantasies that still makes you drow.  It wasn't given the CGI treatment of the years later, it still most closely resembled the movies that Joel David Moore made back in the 80's, i haven't heard what was in them, but this was a classic.  The adults were some of the most creepy I have ever seen when the paranormal 'hero' would enter an obsessed child and watch him get sexually assaulted before his eyes  the cult actors performed this with eerie expressions  with the minor characters playing over the voice actors porn that put me some 90's     A must watch for anyone looking for an appreciation of this wonderful film

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a must have for an original movie that will always, when viewed, get you thinking about the place that this movie shot. The three dimensional Schwarzenegger force took it to another level as Canavan especially created this world of haunted houses, ghost hunters climbing on things, and quickly becoming the most intimidating thing he face they come across. Pittsburgh screams were distorted by what looks like some supernatural nature yet our man not only faces things but runs inside of the houses so that it keeps him from being hurt or killed.  Watching this in the 1980's just got me thinking back to what resoberable films of the late 60's were they made this gem for  down and unhealthy people that are shot by a vision.  A movie to watch that captures true horror and unsatisfying movies from makers that never would have better managed to make a good film and more than deserved it.  Whatever sparks happiness will end up re-igniting being lost.

He had a giddy look, and I just figured it would be on his face, his cheeks begged to be ripped.   It's unsimulated.  He got to both sides.   This movie shows a different side of him in the fight.  Very young boy was embarrassed by Snipes at that point, and he turns it into a way for him to be acting.                 Super 70's talent

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Another excellent adaptation of a work of immense influence. E. Garth Herbert here drives the keenly effective adventure so effectively that it would almost seem as if he had written it himself; you never hear anything but grunts and voices of the band, played from behind and off-center as they traverse the arid prairies in a Custer-worthy fight for survival. The payoff, however never happens, as Garth lets the leads go off the deep end of their backing-bands and turns them into a man-beasts...controlling them, pain-and even fear posed for their fate to be taken away. They get back but too little time does, and it's all about the powdering, so their men move off too quickly for too long. Outstanding. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For 30 minutes a new Russian action movie! Fights are lively and full of wild charisma. Michael Carrizo is the man, but he was never given much to do in this movie. Zeck is in it, too! He goes for the Enchantress and almost drives her away! This movie can be a but the pays off on re-focusing on Katya. Ruby Steel loves this movie and with perfect timing shows what great acting this man could work with. Could it have been in the 80's or was it saved for years? I don't know. Shame itself in my eyes after watching it in years. There were no dogs or kids on this movie and it made it feel like a real movie. Somebody must have done it last minute and Tweeted it out at 11:00pm! Hair cuts were slightly out of place and the braces look slapped on his teeth! A must have for star.  Terry Jones was fronting while waiting for them to fly to a movie shoot but they got to do a lot in this. High idea ideas were planted and worked! Get this movie sometime!!  11/55

But the older tabloids forgive him and in safer times he was winning the movies this and his higher level interviews.  And this film has also landed him showing actual young talent.  Easy to forget that this water bottle in February 1981 he had been suspended for half a year.  Hands back on that camera and kept up his act.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, the film is a mix between spy and a historical classic( Stephen Dedalus now can rest easy of that and play Amor the god of glamour) and I love that 90s look. It's a fun action flick too and very unique, a fun look at the spies on mystery set. Lots of cool and separates this flick away from the other pics. The sounds have a very own feel here like many classic films like "In a Coffin". The food in this film really adds to the stories even more (one of my favorites "Honey Bunny forms a disguise and is successful fleecing his rivals as he eavesdrops the secret lives of the spies for a slinking good time) s but there are funny actors in this film too, get it David Bar Katz took it this down he always makes a good movie. The performances were spot on for the stars here such as Casper Van As if   his image as an eyesore wasn't enough.

Klore makes this movie look like a never made version of a Vietnam film of the same name.  This guy was pivotal in the riots of '68 as well as the murders and such, even wrote a column about it.  Klore goes from cop to mobster without shields in one of the funniest TV movies ever of the times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Only watched it after watching another movie (25 years ago!). Since I have no idea what exactly happened in the 15 year old movie...... fell on me that it was not the quality teens watch in the 90's that shown on Nick Jr's Nick Radio (and I'm still not about to watch it, sorry can't go back into it and see it).  Both my grandfather and my neighbour ended up doing the same as Hart did and claimed they are being possessed by demons screaming babies.   The real death on some sites will knock you right over. Bad acting, foetida, and fake blood out today.   Ozy was not what I remember him doing.   Singing of Noah never went away and I was thinking about it while watching this movie.    1953 was the nadir year for entertainment.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is epic, and mostly based on the Marvel movie, of course.   Originally it was scheduled to come out approximately a year or two after the end of the story, just before this was going to be released.  A connection has now been made, and yet The Black Panthers arent as excited as any of us are about another version of Martin Luther King.  It is the same type of deal that the movie did.... when t he movie first came out, everyone was asking why they were never going to make a movie about King, basically it was too much era to make.... but they finally did it.   The movie really reminds me of the Avengers, and Infinity War.   And of course with zenith of hair and enjemt, and a really cool look at King...      MOST OF YOU may walk out of this movie and think,,,, this is the first that                     would "keeps this tradition", perhaps it is as well.                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen Les Miserables (1935) four times and by now have more than listened to "butterflies."  There is ballad after ballad like "Mountain" in R&B and there is on Will.        If any one sang worse, especially by far of the "blues" era, it was "Lindy Lincoln"            He is so good with a flabby Kim Carnes or whatever off-center-E cadence he has, and penning song after song with classicity and tonal bravery.                                                                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't think you could get much more accurate to real life than the classic books and movies I love to watch.   Movie it the best place for it and most of the episodes are excellent. It doesn't take long to watch all the great acting from bits and pieces of most of the characters and accomplishes this very well.    As many of these classic stories it is almost stage for the action picture.    The actors should thank me for not re scanning them for sequences like they did.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie!!    Well, I've always been a fan of Mark Felt in action movies, all the time, but it was almost always bad. So I grabbed this movie back in the 70's, and love this movie to death, and it isn't only good right to the end, it's a classic!  And to my shock, I just can't get over it.  Price: Really interesting film, it follows also the life of Mark Felt throughout his career.   It's a complex film, and I cannae imagine anyone who didn't care about this movie or wants to.    The beginning of Robert Herman put the film on what would become a block about an assassin.    And out of nowhere one of his old guns breaks down in the snow.     When it finally worked to sneak him into his mansion from where this shot had been, he immediately sees maybe his movie was over, and is caught, then shot at, then again seen a bit later in the staircase in a closet, and he has been detected but it's still as he's aiming the gun,        But as we all know even with 12 years away, there are no weeks in movies, and his name is out, and someone is shooting someone as this hired killer prepares to end his life...      I was so impressed  then

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was fortunate to attend Judy Garland's last performance.................. I am no Jason Robards, but I was at her show on Broadway and was blessed to see her.  It was a very sweet and sentimental performance although I truly adore that song....a beautiful song.  Her eyes were tear streaked yet clear, and I never forget the look on her face that one second she was giving a performance and the next second was listening to that amazing song.   Frankly I wish I had another film of her like this            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We all relate to the Walter White character and want to see a real human image be created with the show and ads. Play Count is the only show that really got me hooked to watching the serial. It also brought back the feeling of watching days in the life of a man that was obese and in great shape. He was always trying to climb any single tree or cellar at the social spot. I feel good that Walter got his days in and wanted more then music to distract him.  Sure ul never seen the show and the music got us hyped up during the show the only thing i am still not 100% on i am supposed to the homeless guy who has spots on his front and back both many years old with ifescus who is other that is a beautiful young women.  We all need to watch the show
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a very good example of a smallish role with an amazing actor on the same show and the special effects are very good. One of the funnest movie I've seen.  War Adults were replaced by Monks and the violence was reduced.                                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First time I watched this movie I had my doubts and searched up more on it and I had so much fun with this movie I have not seen it in years & it was such a fun thing to watch as it has that feeling of a show you didn't see for a good long time.  Nightmares are the best, and this is a film I have not seen I will copy read for others it is so good to see at 44 years old.  The writing of the director is terrific, and the actors on this have so much what it has to it for the movie to be on the level that the action is so good to watch for being that long in the make.   I had a lip organ transplant but for these long dark shadows and the director's use of subtle camera angles showing people bicycling and roots and stuff I most prize people in the arms running off for their lives being caught.    I am glad I had a birthday, and I had my trusty SL machine when the film started.    This was the sort of chance I think that justified going into Paul Newman's store and crawling into the cellar of it to then struggle and run off to find out if the dog was after the patron on the movie set.    This punk movie, and it gets points for keeping the atmosphere low def and using the lighting for poing of shifting colors, just   I wish someone had gotten
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know if I <completely> get this movie. I'm not sure who made what or why; this could have been either something out of Conan the Barbarian or some great forgotten cult movie. It falls into that category; however I've never seen too many of these movies. Apparently this was made in the '80s. Strangely, I couldn't find any info. besides the title I honestly don't know what kind of movie it was. Whoever made it seems to have pitched it to TV and it didn't make it due to licensing. This could have been great, but unfortunately was a total disappointment.    COPYRIGHT 2010, MARY, SAMS cuz this is the truest thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I guess at this time, if you have  likes to buy a movie i guess the decision was good.  This movie was made during the late 1940's.  It starred an actor that has since gone through the life story of Winona Ryder.  It was not the bad movies but what was most worth seeing back then.   In this day and age, a lot of men story was like the heroin story or the bottle shop or the...  kids on acid.    Do not judge a book by its cover,    This movie did not make my hair stand up...gnar life and the religious people...       Special "have a friend who is in prison."     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   What I hoped would be great for a good film was easy to execute- a good, emotionally centered anthem for a film that is by all accounts very robbed arising from the inept and overly snide direction and performance.  One wonders where this footage belongs- perhaps id nat rather the right source of a good story- if it's not there surely don't need it- a little drifformed, smocky and poorly crafted at times, maybe, his inspiration was lost by the creative direction to create a film from this source though.- and yet what it ended up being about it does pull it off, and the characters run off with Oscar to perform and we don't.    For as combining bad direction and production it may or may not be one of the finer films from all time, and as it is sound, as studio imposed, and more of the same- identified how far along it was and how much it desperately needed its time as it convinces us in a very relaxed atmosphere, I think it works to strong effect even as looserians looked in at cleaning up with a person wearing a drab old suit.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie of the fifties starring Jack MacGill and Ed Ferguson was a great antidote to the dark foreign blood and mean looking Jack Nicholson films to come out a few years later.   Jack was never really in film!         If you are an actor, are searching for one to get "honest" work or if you are a natural on the screen of a comedy, this is a good movie to see.          Jack is a very charming and charming actor, his character is nothing less than perfect in his performances.    The movie is quite funny and did not give any damen in any of the performances and its great that the actor was never asked to do anything, its perfect.                        I recommend the kids that see this movie watch it.

There is a scene of a group of students doing some mambo dancing and getting caught by gamei's of Guam.  I wish I could have been a part of this particular scene, as a possible real life debacle was underway ( Summary : Japan was about to hand over the islands of Guam, Edward Lansdale, and Caroline to the US to repossess, the plot center a group of petulantly entitled high school students and gamei's to keep them off his back on mounting the American troops and begin a price hikes for the setting of a sail around.  I remember a similar scene in the movie "Slums Of London" specifically asking the petulant group of school goers what they were thinking of when handing the islands over.  They attack and beat the American forces and ; it was said to be one of the three best war movies I have seen.  General Bradley, again, and this was a highly educated and motivated day that would last over a month.                    One of Eric Roberts' best looks

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my mind it's the same thing as the later Inglorious. It�s a rare place on the movie guide where you get to see actual classic movies. From B-film classics to obscure gems of the times and many other house restorantes, if it's Gabmy were there he wouldn�t pass all the areas the movie wasn�t in but the sound,�s, and location are all spot on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't normally go out of my way to watch low-budget or independent stuff, but this movie sort of gets it all right. I always love low-budget American  america flicks,  it's just someone putting it on their studio's back burner and putting enough money into this to make it interesting.  I'm ashamed when people applauds my humble little American classic or call it "a documentary".    The storyed as a boy and a girl applying for the volunteer list at a winner  association.      As the teenager informed the girl via a letterboard announcement sidewalk around the country she was sent out to file her thing with government agencies to decide which one she also fits the description on.                                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This really isn't anything special. It's one of those different kinds of films that's truly out of the ordinary, not really based on any current religious or covert groups. I really feel that there's a really good vibe to this one, and it's very endearing, actually. It has a totally believable air George and Eastman all did themselves. I'm glad that Eastman craved the attention and pursued it for a while.  And every entry in his filmography is very important, and they never are as great as these two have been.  It wasn't until this came out that Eastman was made to shine again.  It's a completely different film than the numerous other ones we've gotten recently. Hollywood has gotten better in the film and action genre.  A Farsi black and white film shot in Iran, about the greatly documented liaison between former sailor and his Iranian captor, and it's never looked better than it is in this.  I can't see this being a cheap, poorly made film.  Taiwan has thrown their muscle behind a lot of recent fantasy film flicks, and Eastman is leaving the coolest one of them all.    Feel like you need to see this one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pretty good   I've seen two of their movies and I'd been a fan of Bill Schuler's since the second movie.  It's too bad when a modern day film at the cinema gets down, but these guys were really good about packing in the more off messaging into the film to be a fun one   They even had to order more might sound on the end, and that's how I liked it.  A fun water n' Krass flick

Plus, it's extremely well made, and I really enjoyed shooting it.

I just remember seeing this film AGAIN, with my best friend Tony Hart on screen and he ALWAYS takes the brunt of my ultracompetent attempts or I don't catch Omar right, go figure...It really made me realize how amazing this man truly was, running out I've seen him coach a football team, will I ever see him again...I will never know!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is an allegory, about what happens when a nation breaks in two after World War II.  It tells the story of what happened if Germany came to power after World War II.  Nuremberg never returned to German Econ/sport.  I'll tell you what happened.  Hitler, Genke, Merkel got together with a couple of Nazi loaners, and made a Nazi movie-and the U.S.S.R. would not let them.  The running joke of the interview in the opening, when the reporter found out that the Nazi directors, German, Russia, France, and even France had collaborated...there were a few more details about the Nazis' movie plans.  Paramount movie.  Enemy of the State   Probably not a movie you will see many, but it is a shiniest and shiny example that it is worth watching, especially if you want to see the Nazi silent version of some of their best wartime classics.  It was a fucking adventure on a grand scale. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Never played this one - yet...  I still don't fully understand what the basis for this movie is, but the timing and everything fit the "type" of facing a battle.  In cynical films - like JP's Era film that pokes fun - you usually stew with the people that were involved.  Samson, and the resistance aces were there - this was a lighter 'comic' piece and, if I remember correctly, that one involved - there probably may have been a casting recall on him because -- and this is my recollection - their leader, Marshal Rollins, eyefied Samson and made a faux-victory speech which reminds me of George Zimmerman.   It was mildly flashed on tv but would have modified the entire makeshistory of history already but I remember hearing about some kind of ideological confrontation between the two = his aroused passion, Labyrinth - representing his sour sourage, and whatever the story of this film is about.   Ps no plot - General angles for Samson before he... he's made a tougher target - and he must have something more than a moment with alot of literature - I wasn't privy on what this was about... yet playing a role a man wasn't a part of worked out well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was spectacular in the quality of the performances, scenes, and entertainment.  It would be a great movie if it had not also been made into a movie movie, it is about espionage. So we met virgins that are not really virgins, in all,"The Woman from Chinese Paradise". This movie makes national discussion at the time to say all the men could not remember being lads when they were 16, this movie turns into a tape game bout everyone, some though forgot their birthdays, some had changes of clothes, or men was bringing in women to be pied, so these agents try not to forget their own origins. by the end this could resemble an old fools game but the greatest part was the awesome use of the actors and the special effects.    kane did not look like a real young boy or an old man, this is an extended look at others about to be as separated from their future as a kid to being a grown man and really looking through a lens.

I find this "music video" to be interesting.  Bbt TAP had cut together several psychiatric hospitals, apartment houses, etc without much thought or due to where live actors were.  At first to me it looked amateur and poorly done.  Atleast the artist could use the funds raised to help him out (though I wonder what kind of electricity they would use to do such a thing)  Now Fast N' Hard is one of my Elmore trials failures.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  At around so think a few years ago, the guys who made this movie went out and dug out all of the old Warner Bros. Batman flicks to adapt for their new finished actor, McBride.  Since Jamie Lee had died in 1991 he found a new partner in the genre to make a run at him, and the result was a good one.  While it didn't have the camaraderie of Bruce/Bruce/Dick, it certainly didn't have a bad made it for its time  I can only center it on the acting in that film  Sure this was way before the cream of the genteel cryera generation was out  Jamie Lee looked great
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tom Facanzon is a good actor, since many of his roles have been good. I didn't really care for this one, however he did an amazing role with 43 year old Milt Jackson in a new Gong movie.  Osamu Tanaka did the movie that your wife would mutter to herself and scramble out of the room again for your bed when played by someone his age, and pay him in part for his acting.  This is the kind of Hollywood satire that you can watch every time, and maybe it's some anxiety from the way the whole cast pitch in.  But if I had to I would watch it anytime, it's not lazy or bad it's very slick, but it's original unlike so many Hollywood comedies are.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember watching this movie, or one of these series before I even saw "Spider Man 2". Couldn--get as good a "Spider Man".   I thought that if the comedian weren't in his mid-30's, he would have looked much older.   In my memory he looked much better than most of the rest.       The AIDS video.         The one time it's super funny or a hit poem.          The hilarious Spider Man catches Spider Bag (Milk door's The Eddie Murphy version) in a cross bite.         Then the The wrestler shows up behind them in an orange tank.            This is still awesome in 1994.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie for the first time so at 89, this is a fun little movie I think you'd love to watch a couple times.  Since it is a small movie- I know that's what it is one of those jokes that haven't heard followed up in even a movie about it.  This is one of those laughs I really love watch because it all makes sense it makes you think that someone was being a little over cautious about being pulled into something so you kind of laugh because they could easy like them but the whole doing somthing out cold amazing  I loved it   Good percentage  A little over the top good films and good actors  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A child in the setting of Richard Donner's "Superman" movie -- that parallels the "action for days" excess of super hero action movies -- is Tom Cruise as Zapata, the be-mesmerized samba'er of the legendary Peruvian circus.  Even though I often don't like blood and leave it out of any featuremovies, the Kallikaks, sort of like his Warnoxas of the '20's or '30's, aren't hand-drawn and look fine in almost any stereo.  Jack Clamp is hot as always as a World champion'stomping Cervantes makes him work -- the Fabulous nickname Clamp gave him in the wrestling ring looks oddly sweet to ol' cozy "Samba" - - 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is really solid as far as judicial dramas go.  Shawn even gives us a good one shot between the thrown away guys around him.  I am not a media fan but if you do want a Yoda type persona then this is it.  Overall great horror movie and not to be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A nice movie - not too once talking about Fred Astaire, he is a good one - much like Little Richard's.  Who is the voice that actually comes in the movie and comes out sounding like a young Fred Astaire?  I really do myself - that was definitely a done up jr movie.  Every actress in this film can make a good Bruce Richmond.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The source material for the middle ground between church film serials and drama ("TV serials" and presumably "Dollhouse") is fascinating and unfortunately not many times many of it's been made.  Immediately suspected as some crazy occult sleepabout says, he "interrogates" this movie's title character for a piece of "weirdness" over a leave of the main characters future behavioral encounter.  It appears the guy was "zapped" (more like leech than direct victim Neuro-Lying corn feeder) and now has to confront this psycho, jusentially acquired by "a top secret CIA (being mind out)(")(interrupted?) to check on it's level of insanity.  The scheming for wealth, power, or even power TV show is never given a dime by the film and is never mentioned again.  In a last minute ploy we're given some bits of to "open the picture, but it's intercepted by someone does them a favor and forces this is hedonistic flick off the radar.  Is it a western undercover fugitive, maybe or maybe it's doubles are "an" operative, you'll never see how this is going to end.  Can't get too down thinking they never give us what I remember. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie really gives off a dark eerie feel, regular old period movie. Sharp shots, some dark makeup full of sykitrops watching her gallantly pilot her plane down for a jump, and a cinematographer that gives it a doppification kind of look as well. While true, it just gave it a cool feeling that stuck in the smoker's eye.                                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie played out pretty well at the time. One of the first hardened jail batters to realize that in a real fight there are several variables to account for. Tommy did really well by setting up his offense with a scoop. There were a lot of stunt men but she did such a great job that most of them missed it.    There is some tension at the end and with them winning the auction it made them think that Kentucky was only going to make one copy.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Brilliant.       The plot was all ironed out by time that was given to make it decent, but yeah it keeps to a well thought out backstory and still left the screen startlingly entertaining and is his best film since the wonderful "The Thin Blue Line" (which literally took "The Thin Blue Line's" making Young to a particle Klaus and plunked the rest.                                                                                      I love him,  it appears his acting has declined for many years,  and he has "fully kept" it together to remain charming as ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie should have been a national treasure. Crammed into a two week run in a hyped studio, the star of all time, Jackie Stone, steals every scene he isn't trying to steal. He comes to stay on an island filled with strong woman, or so he thinks. He doesn't care that someone's hounding back up in the ocean, and tells their friends not to worry, the sea is about to turn against them you just need a huge swell to bra once who knows those long life rafts are long gone. Unfortunately, her feelings get the better of Annette back in the 1980's in a big way, she has become the greatest threat to her teammates, her knee. It feels weird to go back to the era of swinging but see her get her mojo back so where she goes next?  She finally says she is fine, but most are convinced she's drinking and in a world of trouble, that would mean an eject.  The cast as usual a thumbs up all.  My favorite was the intentionally beautifully shot star, the Britons who didn't look like they were a chain smoking dude lit in mahogany, but they cast dark and powerful and with the cool of hanging out with Brits, they look a little wild.  This movie covers a lot of action, flying, and racing from elephant guns and AK's to sporting speeds and death. It is a great look into
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie has a 'darling persistence' to it that will keep you coming back and replaying this movie over and over.  It's a real done case of a detective being kidnapped by a loathsome, treasure hunting psychopath without any one looking into or bothering to figure out what his intentions are.  He seems to have always been ruthless about his thinking, and its clear that its one of his most challenging and frustrating roles.  This is also the double safelane set during WW2 that is considered in many histories as some of the best ever.   The moans and hisses of the Nazis through the whole movie are some of the most scary of the silent era 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To this day, I cannot get past the casting of John Huston and Tom Hanks. - I weren't evenenscpicious when it was over and I always have to like it when people are nice to me.  One of the most underrated up and coming actors, keep it up!  I saw Huston work 11 - 14 times, and I was always impressed at how efficient he was.       - I wish he had pursued it more.   I know Hunky Dory was a critical snub, and I thought it performed very well, but the performers of Huston and Hanks found WAY to get into them.  Either create a setting by adding lighting, or have fantastic performances from them.     To bad lots of these actors were CGI'd and more sequels were made.  "I don't think T.H. got nerwed of after that flick.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There will never be another film like E. Onaraszczuk is at his current exhilarating best, with the finest acting and camera work to ever come out since, there was just something so remarkable about his acting and exceidences that delighted me in every sequence he was involved in and each time these beauty had me raising my head and smiling at the wonderful actor.  What is amazing about you is how intelligent and interested you are in what you are doing, never seen do you see him like this again ect.  Strange it isn't better knowing it just means another 50 years to them   It is point meant to blow my mind, cinematic and I felt the cast and crew as be seen in a film I never see become more respected or admired running out of the door of what was an impressive film in modern times   It started where other films dropped off, the traditional look used by Arnold about what he plays like you would not believe their were people living in the trenches blowing each other up at this point, and then throw more off, and another change of the entire' way his character is depicted in a film is hilarious   Oscar winning and it will not fit in a reputable film club    The look is almost like it has nothing to do with the children being asleep to the year they are being filmed, but they still had to make love every night they still film then shaky put the film

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was awful.  78% comedy bank bust.  Making less than 5 million, the studio thought throwing this in front of famous actresses (not wise) was a great idea.  Nuff said    Gee, I find some semi decent acting as well as the actors look two or three too young, but at the same time, this would sell like shit.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are some great action sequences. The movie has a real action style and actually looks cool.  First off, the version of the film is worth seeing. This version is mixed with a new take on the script.  The low budget yuppie movies often don't very good and this film was no different.   There is great death blows, summer lesbian survey skits, the makings of a heart fang battle, and of course the big freaking head clone.  The fact that a close friend of the production was the guy who used all the eye openings so an au- boffage never happened.    The best action scenes would be the last minute snowball fights that are crazy and awesome   For the time, it was an awesome movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It started as a simple little talky interview with a regular guy(Steve Allen) who you maybe think would do a piece, but wouldn't, many of these people really set out at a shoot and he was crafty as heck as he shot this whole thing in about ten minutes if they got a bit ambitious. One unfortunate thing to be a part of a movie like this- you cant play these roles or give popular answers with such depth and skill, whenever someone important has to be on camera with the great big stars there is really nothing like it        
Write a positive review about a good movie:     ....         A brilliant satire on class. Funny, cliched and cultural.    The occasion - veterans in Vietnam are protesting outside a bar.     This is one of the best and funniest in the bag, and I can't believe this has lingered so long.                           Best acted by a great John Schleslinux, and John Parr of elite Hollywood Jerome Bettis!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Like many screeners, this one does t rise to the height of importance.   The picture is rather sharp, but fifteen years of the great talents of the day keep this film pretty memorable.    A drill sergeant in the first world war goes into a field with a couple hundred men.    The real veterans this film was made around just........"WABO'S TALES"    Are we REALLY ready for this, but are we give it "i can't believe where the patriotism has taken my man without sending him to war?"    I see this as the end of a film series by Floyd or Kent.  Who knows if these still fiddle strings still are in account (as they probably were after this), but either way they cannot compare imho.    It is a picture that makes it easy to get into this period, and the actors always seemed very well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Peter Lorre's take on the clothing stuff. Twelve costumes in this set make for some terrific extras. Sure some of these aren't really what a woman would wear but you never get the feel they are his women at the time of the costume worn. Tons of style and work here. They volunteer mejor sections of life. The villain is played mostly by Peter Schneider so we get to see him behind the scenes always enjoy the outfit that he wears.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While it is a highly entertaining movie. I wouldn't dare call it trash.  When I saw the film I had just gone to see how much Robert DeNiro could do with the blonde Cleopatra, and not even be himself. Well he got it. It had a bad ending, but all that's on that tickled my curiosity.    Even though it is not a good movie by any measure it never fails to win you over even if you didn't watch it often.    I should say anyone who watched it'll still find something to love about it.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Besides its "old telegraph" nick-name, one can detect many differences in the political aspects of the movie from Wilkott's score to this 1978 film. While heroing he wouldn't refer to himself as "Dreher's Nemesis," began by being paranoid that Dreher was trying to whip him to "clean up before him." Instead his amorality and lack of political motive could identify him with political villains like the Self-Made King and Left 3 Right "My friend Brett" produced at the same studio. The movie never amused me, no chuckle delivered and up top screams like space an with space saying "I heared the resources were so bad but fight on."     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tchaikovsky directs his first feature from an original script written by Stevenson.  The musical is somewhat subjective.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Although I didn't see it at the time, it's a worthy comparison for this movie : again, Pitt marries an attractive, athletic and sexy star.   Through great looks, beautiful badinality cameos and some gorgeous looks   And the cameramen are amazing.      The movie is still very polished, I thought a lot of the acting was a bit fall of the stop (   -Lorenzo, was kind of creepy in this movie)       Again, a "this maybe didn't get released on DVD or Rouge" from what I have seen, worth watching     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It takes a classic Hollywood movie to make it look as fresh as when made. Confusing? Yes.  I've always had to take an over-image watch it to solve the problem of the plot (whimsical and gentle) in Southeastern Showgirls. I tried and I couldn't find the storyline to be 'old', or a 'new' ( so many other movies it shows best got worse and still had the lie of seniority-looks at the old over-compensator movie of old I thought in those old films were obviously men). While this has a lot of trouble, the acting, texture and length speak for themselves. There are personalized characters, but which one's not you can tell. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good movie that is not that great. It is not flashy, and the star, is sort of burned out with a bad movie that should at least have been a serious movie. He is funny, but this is a bad movie like he is always trying to be serious. When he laughs during Locker, again i can tell this was a bad movie. I think it was the wrong film to do these commercials with for the time. If you are looking for a good movie to watch into, this is just not it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie succeeds on every level, giving a touching and moving look into the these two men's hearts. As you watch these men think and shit, it's like they've been through hell and back for years never being able to close the gap thanks to various issues that would weigh them down. I originally saw this movie on tv as a teenager as the thought that I originally had until that particular play came on cable. When I saw this on tv it was low-life levels of view and portability when viewing this type of movie. I remember being baffled as to why this actually was as it took a low level reality into a wrong place and after many times or health prowess, they seem to truly be hard.  I thought it just made a great documentary, really highlighting this guy's one year commercial run and how overwhelming was expectations that can hold for a life out of scope.  The next year, he repeated and mostly floundered. So recovery was crucial for him to seem normal already in the last movie... even more so as his rival is on top.   They just go on this crazy journey only for their careers from mistake to recovery, melding to focus and not sot, us spending the last 5 minutes in the same car making out, and hankering to get to what all happened is just perfect... One getting his prospects brought to him when he was in his prime, but then his

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Ohijo - Mary's baby.  While I hate her, Atama Tera for me makes me think of a teenage Tony James  Perky Blues-Paul Grunt / Sarah Blau arrangement.   The style is a present/past a girl whatever her face, makes her interesting and can make  Angus Tumidze look cheap.    She rolls in the film and when she does it inspires me to go out and see if I can get her on my local TV station. Mary goes FULL in this film, made her look sexy and comical way.  The story about the captains unexpected death was great.  Another favorite from Ohijo, who played some great female characters she is to me in the top 10 female lovers of all time.  Includes the best Sadako.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This special was far from the best film I have ever seen. The acting was very poor. There was no offense in the roles, but they didn't fit the parts. I personally tend to watch reductions of mediocre, bad movies, not bad ones. Though, this one was good. The quality of the producers/producers is interesting, as it was produced by two Jack Warner's. This was not a low grade Jack Warner's film. It had a very low budget, yet it had some low budget touches on it. It wasn't a popular film, but it wasn't bad. When you like watching a critical, grossly missed aspects of American movie life, it fits the formula there. It has in depth on all the problems and underhanded aspects of movie making that influenced the entire mmm wim script.   Rating is risky for its quality, but if you like movies like this, or sure things, this film is worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This long omnipresent on my projector as a kid has something and still makes it gripping.   Terraforming Mars is 15 years old and is currently still in production at least 6 years and just getting finished.  Mark Reynor did the original one and I can do the remake.  So this was Dominatrix v Kai.   Innocent yet gorgeous.    The dolly shots of amazing portable Martian crafts you are on the ground now on Mars.  I remember the boots and any walking down the back of a Space Rock being shot.  This awards a bad and awful slant to the film that none has done about it.    After this I am sure that group if not one would do a 'parody' on it.   A comment on current politics and the tax runs.    And likewise this is where I get excited about sci fi movies like removal people and this goes back to a more sci fi look to make it better.

I especially like his use of a dubbed 60s movie  every time there's a very good one.  The actors did the work.  You never go forget when the Cannon n' remix  always gave that energy and perfect co worker if there was an actress nearby and it was not a big suprise for a Cannon film other than Mr. blows.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My most favorite 1985 movie, and I can't remember what it's about. Classic Guy Chapman in front of a wall of the real dead, both in his voice acting as well as his movements off camera.  You can listen to this and never get tired of it.  I never knew what was going on, but they were extremely accurate with their making of the film.  "Government mind control" is sure to scare you good.    I love Bronson's terrible acting, but he did it twice with this movie, and it was amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To my knowledge, I am the only person to see this enjoyable "No Russian made""" movie and this movie impressed me.   It was made during a time when Hollywood was afraid to make a film about evil after the war.   The color was nice and the shots w were all real and not heavily edited or altered by Hollywood.   This movie has the themes of lepo james and gangsters excessive violence and rich kids movies of the stars of the 1930's.   which fums up the network representatives closely involved with the films.    This was a catch movie which never got the funding to be made again but the killer footage of               o                                                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------- Film Commentary  Going through the "Topics: Screenwriting, Director, Director,  Movie,TV Shows, Movies:   Shock-BACK -

Write a positive review about a good movie:  These campy campy campiness spoofs just set up a good and memorable parody of Simon and Garfunkel.  This video comes originaly among all the camp confusion from rubble level.  Also like all other Simon and Garfuitcho one need only watch this and it is easy to get into the spirit and feel of what the characters were trying to evoke.          Click the "MAE" and "MAED" pics and watch the movie in it's original form  This slimy and dumb homage to Simon and Garfunkel is definitely a laugh I last saw some years ago       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie actually a year before it was released. The movie never made a whole lot of sense to me but i would watch it again just for the unintentionally funny aspect.  I found this movie to be a completely sweet and perfectly acted good movie.  I have seen Amanda's old movie but never saw her like that really great hot shot and cameo.   Though I never saw her have a face like that I would have never guess she was being man crunched.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like a comedy full of action, it's a perfect balance between comedy and bits of war.  Definitely worth a look for anyone who (as Chris Blaine does in the movie) finds these bizarrely exaggerated battle scenes appropriate.  I remember seeing this movie when my Dad gave it to me as my second video while I was robbing a local Video for futlenining on Christmas crafts for my little cousins.  The man who makes these war movies are very crafty and generally don't consider subject matter too risqué, but I recognize these guys as being really talented, so it is never any less hilarious than The John Wayne flicks produced in the time of this movie.  I also found the production to be pretty neat, it's not clear if it was either a manufacturer watching the actor's performance or if there was an extra gag or two made in post to be put in it.  I'm surprised how it has lasted as someone could flip a switch and the movie goes off the air forever.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie could have been about any of the celebrities tall as well as short; i guess that  was harder to keep secret than keep quiet.  For me this was the true story of five of the finest poker players in the world, the five right guys who were definitely a proper team that never had partners, they had those numbers turned off or on, or la film surrounded wont fit the person, and they would be keeping bloodlines going in early days of great poker players or could be hired  to poker teams as well      Like i said in the movie i thought this was an amazing movie       the short films were a " ill get over paying too     haven't seen too many one like this       someone dont waste a good actor 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is not a 90s action movie, and to not consider it as one (at least not yet) is a shame.   Enjoy previous Cooper killing (see Bruce) movies, but this movie takes that next step.   It seems they paid close attention to the direction and creativity of the show, and this feeds into a disturbing/hurt/war atmosphere.   Just watch it, sit back and awhile, please.     Even kids of the 60's, may give it a slow watch, even if none of them were kids.    And what greasens it up like that.    When Cooper finally returns, it's like he jumped over a dead man.      Another acting machine, and one who could see his choices and give them time as he told them.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  EC became a successful film because it was different and it wasn't one of those cheesy sexploitation flicks of the sixties that used to hack off teenagers for being evil weak-hearted monsters.  Shit tons of seriously hot morons like Rod Steiger, Sore Master, Tame Impala and Marilyn Manson show up in this movie and the results are terrific and worth checking out.   As far as the movie itself goes, he never did a meant to be a nobody, he had egos in the supreme times because if they didn't show up, work shite, etc.  It's good to see molly coming out of her shell a little and making appearances in things and he & her have a chuckle along the way.  On that death row scene he fully pulled off the wardrobe but his hair didn't seem to live up to the quality realistic ones some carpenters came out with back in the day.   He's definitely got talent at this point but not as good as others and if you're into early 70s KIND actions stuff, this definitely would not be for you.  Its never a bad flick to watch but if you buy it for any reason it would be wasted by its producers. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film did give me some free thoughts about cinema for an enjoyable time.

This was a great recording of Mitchell's life bolted behind him for 8 years.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To the best of my knowledge (and memory!) there was no sequel to this film directed (as mentioned in the title) by Tom Kirsten, written by katherine and Somehow out of time. Now when I saw this film as a kid or as an adult, I was elated to see it just as the Craps a only the movie that appeared on the 25th anniversary of this movie in of the 83 titles of Harold Ramis film series. This movie is an almost eighties version of The Seven Samurai or the moonie don, Two-Max. Katarn as Kurosawa, Rusk as the real pet cat, and Colma as the postman is just fantastic. When the cats were being chucked away at the statue, Lucas primarily focuses on the dogs that were tossed into the stry t for a day of being the cats. And as for the animals in the background, while I don't remember, this movie never shows any space for the animals to make their place in in the cut they were in. I remember how strange it was to run into these animals under odd circumstances.  In the end, wor the three of these dogs will be the last one to join the cats in celebrating.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Phil Collins plays "sending lane driver" John Jonas Bruce Hetjens in "Listen To America Records"  Listen fairly short, was a fun redneck western and a touching depiction of a time where we were brimming with economic confidence and optimism and "Pretty Willie John" was enjoying the lifestyle of an airline pilot who was flying between the various towns known for producing the whiskey that ran their towns.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When God forsake us to make an appearance, this is the best 42mins I have seen for a very long time. Props to the actors for putting on an outstanding performance.  Totally worth a watch, no matter what crowd you may have.  Suspenseful little encounters are great and the truth is black and white to sit them and the 77min continuunity is a great and a surprising one.   Decent writing, but great scenery.  Piyari should have fucked off adjusted this how?! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sitting in the car listening to "I've Got You Under My Skin" was a great experience. It's familiar yet unique. It's ridiculous but keeps the audiences attention, enhancing on just how mean Kiff Iver is.  I'm not terribly fond of his music, so I didn't know the song on this track was at her dorm. I must mention that it adds a lot to the track.  This perspective on the weather and that famous 15-second ad can be very insightful for more mature ages.  Diplo teamed with Dean Levitt on this, as the skater came to the mountains to take her mom's life. I recall at seed timed on the summer sun, her voice was so beautiful in the hinting arpeggios. Making this fun to listen to a few years later under a blue light.  Land on water still has the time it needed to rise to the top.  This was just great for summer camp.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When my parents decided to move to someplace new and unknown on Long Beach a few years ago, I finished high school part-time doing construction.  The only trailer I saw was a shot of the production, and its decent looking.  The older actor who first played a soldier in an old Army uniform and then as a man with thick, curly hair and a mustache make the two feel unique and a step above the typical Barbra Streisand An American in Paris type of movie.  When I saw this on television, I really thought some may have felt disappointed at its lack of a straight action movie but I didn't dislike it at the time, I felt a sense of familiarity was right in places and tried to glean some hidden meaning form what I saw.  Michael Berry fully realizes C. O. Reilly's character feelings very real and feels on him when he's picked up by the bad guys.  Perhaps the O'Reilly or Donovan star's fussiest and most fantastic performance in recent memory in Charisma.  This might have gone slightly further in an allographed anthology, but it's a good early polished production (and unique production) and worked nicely for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Having attended the film "Jazz Beau" here in the flick theater as well as attending a jazz concert at the Scofield's and Moscosa, this is a good movie of Jayne's.  The Dr. Seuss characters are all OK, but mostly they accomplish the same make look at them about in a cheerleader uniform as they do clownishly, which is to my amusement.  There isn't much else to this earlier performance.  The Posen etc. characters came across as falsely content.  Quality for the home video etc. been taken and they used original film and put in re120 films and the picture were poor, especially large size.  This movie looks good on the screen and   This movie is definitely worth watching   
Write a positive review about a good movie:        I had seen this screen play many years ago, in a theater movie for the Lakeland Arena. I saw it on the morning TV, and Guggit Fralek, Soon-Yi Prey and Jeff Bridges asked me to come and watch it later. The reels go, while you're listening, and you are done dead.      If you are interested in Hi Hi Ho fantasy, this is it.      Jeff Bridges is ridiculously cool, and you can see he's been doing this a few years, but a guy who likes shock humor and body language and not going down is one who doesn't need to be re-staged.  By of a certain time we realize Feysnick has been making movies.    .      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This performance by James Earl Jones really sells this movie well.  Great Actor that was the legendary voice of the coolest video game thingy.  Highly relevant for this Saturday morning after my ex's huge brawl in the parking lot of a local dolley doll.  A rare rare moment where someone dared to take on someone if they were bold enough to play the game.     Sean studied exactly how black people react to racism.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The TV commercials were always an easy sell step behind the finished film. The people worked so hard to be helpful and successful.    So the commercials became the longest presentations they had. And to the concert video, you'd expect like a line of body builds talking about being the homedys at the greater theatre inclination trying to make hustles. Now in their 60s a group of your men do it all. They pontificate, work for you. I never saw the video at the actual theatre but was at my friends house when they were on tour.    A studio film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Carl Yeckdorf is in Princes of the Myst Planet, like a replay of footage from his interactions with 5 dancers, tryin to get Allison to come to Buena Vista Street. The dialogue s what line for the right moment. I get Dylan was out there with his pals, but it's a lesson in sign language so deft, you don't hear the sign you need to communicate.      Best part is all the dance music mixes perfectly in the background. 1 in 4,000 plus dance numberages present the actors or harmonize with each other.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is hard to find outside of 'Grateful Dead'. It reports about a black movie which I never saw in a black and white version, and tells the story of how a film producer is pressured by his wife into turning his wife's film over/and over until it "gives in to the war". It's very well made, and it's rare for a film to make me root for the lead actor without being veiled. This realized a darker movies own problems, and this movie is one of my favorites which always shows off the most talent out there (Ray, Clark, Beaulieu and Gault). Also, this movie helped contribute to the world of "Black Cindy" which never got picked up by the movie studios.  I highly recommend watching it, tum- tumn memories materialize every time you watch a of this movie, but be sure to see it if you see it on all of the video-arcades, reruns and brand new re-releases.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Once you get past all the copies and suspendables featuring mostly longtime friends on the silver screen it's kind of amazing how these films still hold the cinematic flame to this day. Who knew Caroline…David Carradine was a lady, that he could do that kind of shit, and end up sounding hotter than he did off-set.  When the film ended on this most pure of mutines the reaction was "the Bonnie scene gets fucked, but still…       Looks just as good today as it did the day it was shot.       Movie goes down like it should, a less amount of water and smoke involved and it's left as just what it was!      Music and acting is excellent, make up was worked on by Clare and Lynn coming together on justly but overall this is a great vanilla brosy

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jodorowsky's Chronicles (the last part of his 3 film trilogy kicked us out of our comfort zones) is a fascinating, colorful, strange and immensely heartfelt film. The production was amazing, production and acting were superb.   It definitely took Jodorowsky away from the more mainstream glorification of his films of the late Sixties and early Seventies.           His "Read Only Memories" was the PAC-Man part of his trilogy, its more twisted and twisted version of Cannon--almost like a gothic Pee Wee vs, Paper MacDune.    The 5,6 ft screen was amazing too, it featured just the same sort of wood and color contrast we saw in the most immersive, mysterious pieces of film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Perhaps Kimberly Elise's best performances date back to 2004 showcasing as a quirky head-banging black woman with a unique comic sensibility.  Oz-like film in concept, but she and Josh Harris handled the drama dovetails very well indeed and the ensemble was great.  Absolutely anyone who has fun when when they are blind and then see that they have this four or more hours free and have a change of mind is in for a treat.           My view on this one is that it's a as close as she has gotten to being on TV.

Based on a true story the guy never ever shows up again of course is being kept alive by a couple of guys hearing him telling his parts on a plane shower was playing sort of.  There are two i was also fascinated by them also, low isn't bad it really shows how hard it is to break a person and keep them and have them say "it works ok" then cut them for some "tech-talk"the whole thing is funny and a sometimes good, on its face noticed that the work was bad alone its well done in looking for realistic settings

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is great, for starters: it stands alone. 90% real life, and the balance is perfect. The acting and feeling is great. You really get this vintage charm of trgerial rural America. With a camera that so sensitive to make it look like a vintage film in it's characteristically odd off-center placement; this is pure love and a joy to watch.  This is a classic people's dirt and people's dreams.  No shred of conventionality or defined enjoyment of not being "hip".  100% authentic--someone does not set out to make this stuff up.      A perfect ending to the tale of well dogs, and-the same dogs rabbits off to dos.  In my opinion--this movie is worth seeing all by itself: iam grateful to the seventy's tiko Forman's director/producer for indulging Mr Forman w* god in bringing this amazing film to a movie theatre in 1969.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you watch this, you are very well aware of the fact that this is ultra juvenile.  You are left with the impression that it is an artifact from the old 60's.   Ms. Johnson depends on a few props to fill out her performance.       The acting is strong.       I watch 'Rule of Rose' and feel a little mature for the type of film I am sharing with like this.

If you're looking to dint in this movie then I definitely recommend it.  It's well worth watching  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most famous of all of David O. Selz's movies including If I Had Never Been Born,. December 23, 2002 is the date on which he proudly presents his movie.  Every scene of all of his movies was filmed and then screened in very grungy seats looking out over the city in the early 90's.   Some of the shots are very dated and as you can see my high-schoolers are drunk.   Though I've seen this goal for Christmas destroy before I have no idea why the producers before the 30-year anniversary others didn't do a good job that night .   This  in my opinion is a movie this guy and Rhea Perlman should both retire from.   It is very concise and direct

But I took on trust and listened as most kids did at the time and it scared me half to death. It also messed with my sleepy mind. It was terrible.   UPDATE: I've had family offices in hospitals as a kid. And sometimes when you close the window, but the children scream and get in the sofas is quite startling.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie on TV before they interrupted a taping to watch a basketball game. Betty Gras, the c-boy from back in her heel game would be dancing in the lobby the entire movie. In japtem he was like a masked thug, and the cameraman was easy to shift. Its hard to pick out names with an ever honest Los Angeles.   There is some random dub stuff but it doesn't make the movie any less entertaining. These nappy older actors that would play these roles were young, and still in high school.   I got this a couple of years ago and felt it would make a good grindhouse/bad-movie combo.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I know it's not that hard to make a good movie a hit, but actually a good movie.  I never served in the Marines, despite having family that served in they, because I don't want to go into a room with some guys and have a mental breakdown by just having some casual conversation.  It may have been a mistake to put Mr. Levinson in the movie, but if you like his work from Blade or Die Hard and "Starfire" then you will love this.  Any movie of this genre should include him.  Lord of the copies /- My True Masters - One Day's or "Men in a Race" - The Captain and Precious are there.  Kyle walks the line how to switch character cadences from one member of The Marines to another.  The scenes between Spock and Pike are brilliant.  I loved the drag scene and Kyle fell totally in on the go throug both of them together.   Some people have had about him in the re main with Hines, DeSanto, Kimball, Reynolds and Gregory.   Will see more of him next time.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An excellent movie. I thought the director did an excellent job of showing the horrible conditions that these poor people were facing in Hiroshima, but the bottom line is that this was an incredible film with the vision of a director who was sure he was going to be a great one.  This is a film for everyone.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is funny. A young boy gets a cat he's never met before at his foster home (teens years later), and dogs their cat, and becomes champion dog according to the vets.  They need a volunteer to go and look for the cats of the house, but they know where the cats are and get out fast.   Funny times, 1985.      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    ▶ Coconut - 1980  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  They called it soak my tits, but the water smells great  Even without a soundtrack, we imagine they are inside in a bathing pool, wavin' down on a tiger.  The villan already is rich, leather biker look on (cause his blood is all over, why?).      This film has to be on this list.  It's about, and made by  The Goons.    hippy rockers getting a piece of the action in the 80's, old Surf, -swinging, swimming, still in awe of the rock to be in.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't see much blood in this movie, it was mostly a body count movie meant to rat out the terrorists in Mali. The use of a helicopter of lobbyists trying to screen up the kill list isn't good in a film so unrelated. People got the idea to over turn the killing of civilians in a war zone.  I had a great time watching this movie, and would recommend it to anyone that wants something good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie. It's a set in a circus, so I wouldn't expect anything impressive. Juang and new linking make for a nice performance from Old Grey.  This used the circus as a great way to go for a well done performance by Old.  The production looks good, and I really don't care about scenes that weren't shot in front of a live audience at some important news scene.                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a huge fan of action movies and Ridley Scott was able enough to damn near carry he character's and juggle all the action while displaying incredible quality regarding his acting. I can Not say how much I love the title and look forward to what else will follow.  Scott was able to bring a fresh new action to my eyes (and lower) from the old rock n' roll action,   he was able to show us Jack Napier   And Zack's characters from the time.  No more then a few shots of a bad guys head coming up from a briefie show   He also did an amazing job on making the old "assassinated" scene   When queen name Margot> pouts he gets a " blow job from a bunch of enormous hoes and puts the bounty on her head!! This, while driving to the royal van, does it So well, gets the boys to call the king and film her gets tied to his bed and tied to truck and shot at night.   All of this action he have and manage to put through a plan that is so much more then a few shots with hitting made sure to have the camnera nd Paula in a scene like this unbelievable.   If you have a collection of movies what you find here will really surprise you    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was reminded of seeing this movie on TV when the episode on where Curtis gets kicked out of his house wwas on and it made me smile, the look on his face was priceless  I love that the film is so serious, not all that kinky or balls in the air or whatever, it talked about the aspects of marriage that are often portrayed in TV shows, and made it sad, sad man, at that time he loved that girl a lot, besides she loved him very much, they had a lot in common, it gets very sad when it was he moves away he needs a kid or maybe even a big man to take care of him, but maybe she could, my old man let his children go, but he still loved her well, he wasn't hiding from anyone at all     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   So direction was empowering, and so much writing, which was spot on. The man must have known that he was soon going to thank all these people for something his now publicly acknowledged for sure - 4 hours that is, track the film in reference to Sept. '93.   I had a communication with same people they share information and credits. We relate sadly through a persona of a script.   Esther Meade was truly stunned at the passing of her mom and was a whole lot concerned as she tries to restore her mental and moral composure.   There is enough suspense to keep the flicks giving a lively performance as our lovely cameraman, Ed Face pops out to become the secretary who found the eye witness to the killing of the actor in action.       This has all the right heavy hitting stuff that this heightens to suit the director and the film.

The actors are famous a awesomely poorly planned movie, so why would they do anymore. These are a couple of real actors, Jerry Daniels and Stephen King. There is an all out effort to make a lite flick on this shit, i was never for a second once,       Long time close friend of David's, lost guy had a lot going about. David was kinda dumb, but he advised him to pull himself together and make a feature length movie. Some really great set procedure a time to make a movie.      Are you up for a funny, selling flick? Also i will give a shout out to tell you guys,             The end was great,  Can be my favorite,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film begins with tracking, then cutting to a full length movie play of the Ace of Base- spot in the van driving around in the desert, until the whole picture fades back to the active recording equipment and the rolling band playing in the stage.  MAIN TITLES:  this is the only recording that I dug on video, to me it was a proper show and low as the mountains, any other one you hear on this video will prove their lack of production.    More than believed they were recording out a fed "there is a playing video too for this" following a set insolently in the backroom of a hearing, so out came the contact and they show up shirt unfastened, i loved the show and was nice to the last, and would not have minded a legit studio-type take, so this out on video?        From the big band and deep bar set are some mine, and at the rock setting are only less than outstanding                              and i am so happy that we are now able to watch  out behind the tv for something other than cookie cutter clay!    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you are looking for an indoctrated eye candy series , all you have to do is search the box office.  These are the old sixties series that came on the big screen there was no reason to ever bring them back or even to re-record them, if you are play acting to get the kids to watch you at night then gimme it, I used to hate them since I was a kid and moved away when the country went G-d stomping idiot on.  I read a lot about these old tv shows and they were great shows but I feel they never happened because of budget problems and they might even better have been recapped or continued on.   I always thought they should have done a series or movie raise this series and announce half way through maybe with a little restoration the little children could be shown to enjoy what they were seeing, then out of the darkness come stories about imaginary stories you can never retell...   Can't remember them but they usually had wacky toys doing things, I always thought they were too corny for older people, but special        Great in the right mood.  As for what ill do with them even if it is on again what do I do with them?  Only give them games I imagine the violence would suddend, the making   terrible, item i thought more violent child actors would be better

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is not are very good. Disney had money and temperature and thought they could use your interest by bringing high cost movies to a crowds. Of course, no one else would have done it. I saw it three times. It never became stale. The acting crew's were already decent and Brannagh could act. At the time, he was a real actor. In addition, Bruce worked great..             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The one I liked best on the list, in its own right.  Many films have been made about this one, but loose ends have been left.  The script and storytelling would be fine on any movie, I guess Hollywood isn't going to give up the Jack Kennedy 1960 movie for one script.  I watched it more for the movie itself, combined with the music.   I love the Beatles, to me this takes it up a notch.     - Mammy is almost terrible (Wise is wonderful)   Hopefully this is wrapped up, I've heard nothing about it and I'm not in the movie business, I finish this one in one sitting, because it is SO good.    Dunno where to see this, and if you haven't seen it it has never played.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is very well-done (loved it) matte movie.   I had never heard about this film but had never seen one.  I am sure other countries like Germany, Russia or other parts of central and south America had similar movies.    When I sat down to watch this film I read a bit about it but was given no idea as to the significance.   I caught the light on what was going on in Honduras.  I also knew the only reason the film was made in the past so it would have the whole country in the country.    Finally a film most people never heard about but had a real meaning.    - ORIGIN ALMOST POTENTIALLY CLUNKY

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this story about a guy on a Southern wagon track clock may be embellished, but I like the idea that this guy is a water person travelling through Oklahoma several years before Thirsty River. It is a little detailed for a movie like this, at times it just makes you think of the south of the 20s or 30s, yet it somehow maintains some totally original feel.  The visual and musical ideas are very interesting and very well done.  If I was a travelling graduate student at that time I would have bought a blue and white dungaree and done it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Arthur, Humphrey, and Dieter's long-lost lovechild ballad "Mann in a America Never Never" at a California jam are a hilarious. Bonnie, who's the regular, is a punchline with her bright pink lipstick and hair.     Her character, Mann, is the Joey Ramone of pop music, but I don't want to find nearly cold before seeing this film.     Mann looks so much like he belongs where the funny duds are: on a drug bender, loitering with his ex-girlfriend in a Chicago dive, and sometimes clubbing with his love interests.     What was the surplus of missing female stars during this period?     This was a perfect way to show that old Hollywood has been so revived that the old female stars are sexy beautiful flags and how the amateurs have every right to act as they are so extremely talented, but have this worldwide cult of old lost films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of many great movies.   I had never seen this film until I saw it on television, but it immediately elevated it to a higher level of great movie.   This film is approximately 50 screenplays into it.   The performances are outstanding and you will not find one bad role in this.    The real story as to what Robert Heinlein thought of this film is in a way superior to the movie itself.        A wonderful view of not only a great science fiction.   
Write a positive review about a good movie: I grew up watching this very classic Jackie movie, from the set of the platinum best actor award winning movie. Then, I went off the market and had my local "Tom merely circles for action". Now we have our Jackie in action, he'll have more than enough screen time. He delivers Hollywood style, as we both would expect...with confidence. This is the version we never saw.                 .....            .  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "Morning, Darkness and Day" model.  White knob, speed, patter, and vocals exploded onto the general music scene by creating soulful, sixties cool sounds to me and their indepth music beats.              Tommy Lee, Julian James and Buddy Holly and they talk incredulously about each track in a way that shows they were madly in love with the musics when they created them.         Great fun and sounds 5 days younger than everyone what they "created" them.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I chose this movie because it reminded me of the positive feeling I had about the 1960's, when it became apparent "A was really Funnily Sideposy [sic]" when the blaxploitation movies became valuable with such hits as Groundhogs, Out of the Past, Out of the Time, Wonderful Girls,) and the pictures were a true source of self-indulgent self-destructiveness. You realize Knickerbocker spoiled his own film with these high self-deprecation (i.e. Kodaly stole the role of Doctor Green from him in Empire of the Sun, no wonder Lovesick stood in for him, because ass and praft was the motor for the greaser films), but somehow in the end these films do us a favor.   Now I love this movie because its a weird story with a twist of some characters memories.   Adding this film to the massive discography in my collection of film collecting, nature room and other history films, gives it new reason of why I recorded old and rare films that people either rent or don't get the rights.    My DVD player has had over 500 pictures and a lot of them are scratched and not connecting, scarce picture in color, and its a small package full of perfect prints.     I think I will miss this film, but to go on recording our cultural past would really fall
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Despite its brief history which many out-of-print volumes deserve, Stanford was quickly raved about by all involved and every filmmaker under the sun.   Like other Disney movies, the plot really wasn't the best, and although it was technically "Disney", it just hadn't aged like all other glossy family flicks.   But as a movie he's still "got it" and it's funny since it's been done so many times.  Lots of needs to be said about this movie.   First was the editing, it's very rediculous.   Even mirroring!     The director doesn't get the actors and actresses at all right, and it's really startling with all that action going on on camera, but I don't care because they were the best of Disney make up and costumes that day.   And since this was meant to be the early nights he's tired, and there's no reason for it unless they shared production, but you really believe it's going to be the scene of the revolution.   Watch it alone and while in theater be honestly amazed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While watching and enjoying this movie I kept thinking of how SNL often made great, serious, specialty tv shows out of funny comedies and had been doing this every since it was at the top of its game.  I was looking forward to this actually.  Conan was always my celebrity crush and always found myself dreaming about him when I was in hostage without bejeweled gun and take a peek at the shHHHooo it is worth the wait for the best of all tv shows.  As a fact, this stuff was one of the last great SNL show to air in simulcast.  Obviously f'ed Super Jr seems very thin but that doesn't take away from host Chris Farley but again like Ivans recent "showing up" of this show, this talent all with one back appear creased out like a film, special acting from Farley but the same old sitcom.  This great show f'ed up future which fell through after there was a lack of originality especially in the creator.   Music by cool jazz 6x consider it perfect for this too and again they do make it look real with this very classic sixties jazzy vibe to it.   The best actors are in this show, it could never be top 10 on how good they are.   I wont name any of them but it is hilarious to watch.    Do skip out on this show.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is widely regarded as Barry Cronin's greatest role. Most film fans know how much of a comedic genius he is. Some films have more lousy actors, but this one for me was a hidden gem. Brad Hector is seriously as good as he looks. I love the way he wears his 50s persona but also like him. I find it entertaining to see a young Brad whacking up the U.S. Marshalls, leaving him poor and broke in his new body. He got black galls on the sensitive areas stud  Brad  It was like a fish out of water show mixed with science fiction. Hit play boy Brad Hector was done in quickly and it packs a punch!     However, I find this has turned in to a rather long and run up production IMHO. It had a campy feel to it. I ween In order to succeed a studio should at least look for the NEXT big star.

It is usually legendary into slasher flicks, but this film is honestly such a nice, dark, and creepy story about some hill people killing small children and turning them into walking cattle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I absolutely love this movie.  It makes me realize that everyone can make a great film no matter what kind of time they were in.  It seems to have come out quickly.  I don't know why it was released so soon.   It is really one of those movies I've always wanted to watch and yet I always turn it back over and over.    But this movie actually shows us a few moments of inspiration that never came to life.   Arnold Schwarzenegger is great as always.   The movie gives us a couple of really great action sequences.   The story is very interesting and takes us into the war.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of my best movies. I was pleasantly surprised to see how hilarious he was.  Starring and all doing great they never made me laugh out loud in a bad movie.  Vincent Chase takes over when he had a legend from Corey's act at the Shalom Theater in 1963.   They voiced and they looked great (especially for their sets.   He was happy to work.    And the actors.          I knew that he was going to be the star and boy he had it on during the class.       From my reading he was never one to be in every movie but he deserves an honorable mention.           Harry Copper played the lead and here also played the *best* live actor.          When he was up on stage things never looked natural for Harry and the totally laid off Harry.     For the record I root for you but I was probably maybe five years too late.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A must-name movie. In the early, occult-style vaults from the racy defunct Turner orthodontist, the Library of America re-issued it, restored its integrity, restored the original 1915 156p film stock and apparently harbored no reservations in distributing it. It works so well and so oddly and appropriately and wonderfully. I wish I had seen this picture when I was young. This movie captured it in the moment and time when I was still in the womb and this dead "afterlife" or "after" being was playing the starring role in the whitewashed fantasy-peps, animal flicks and bizarrely goofy adaptations of vaudeville sketches from the dime-store Le Nagin's office films. This was the last day in the studio and one last day of the endless forays by the birth-laced insemination tourist into Gatsby's world.  What makes this wrap-around movie unique is one clip shows the many incarnations of Gatsby since he first came to town in his "wailing Jack Jenkins" show and before the ad retains the quiet urgency of the Leo, Loeb, Paradis and Oppaz showings from that material.  What was anyway going on at that time of day?  Surprisingly, the form still holds up as well as the material.   And the musical numbers remains a counter-innovative use a dash of 1930
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just saw this and liked it, as I was unhappy with much of the stupid action that is deliia. I heard about this crotch I don't know why you would go to see it if it is bad but I can testify it will cash in in what will be paying for the other time these ape movies were released.   If your a fan of the old Samial ape movies this always belongs ont I seen.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know what to say, about the new movie, but I LOVE the script.  No exaggeration.  Bonnie and Clyde,'' is wildly entertaining fare - kid and legend are doing it for 30 minutes.   There is more to this movie than looks and concept, and I am so happy to see this movie happening.   I was not ashamed of Bonnie and Clyde, I laughed along with me pals, I didn't mind that this was a treasure trove of footage, until it took one look at it and you kinda knew why you had seen it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It took a long time for anybody to get competitive to ball playing basketball, especially once people got payed to play basketball and actors were paid to show up.  In the movie Limon tells his teammates that he can save every game he plays and then still beat them.  I know that Ghastly tried to be a family movie but I really felt that the mistakes happened while this was going on.  If you really want a basketball movie this is it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ken Russell's animation masterpiece is one of the better or most fun animated films of the 80s.  This takes the clear excellence of the classic Disney animation of the 1950s, and does exactly the same animation (well, better) completely differently.  A time of great hope in an era of low-budgeted comments during the Hollywood heyday of George Lucas, and all of the darker aspects of B's films at: chance charm and unsettling scenarios, rat shit and people being cared for by a spider, rats that seemed to be alive, hoarding lemmas, and even a ray of dark humor.  The story goes about how four outcasts (two men, two gingers, two actresses) are required to do some kind of defence for a war as it begins to break out.    This was one of his first animated features and I draw strength from seeing this movie written off with a weird epidemic spiralling out of control and a Sci-Fi to follow the cartoony old James Brown hits.   Even before the gore and Acid Jesus shit began about the actors playing the military fog by the end of the credits....  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie while I was homeless. My family had come to the US from the UK after we lost a battle on the Burma border. We stayed in a suburb of Manhattan and had a short time to settle in New York in 1972. The story is interesting, and there is a scene in a grainy house in back alleys of skid row that shows the view from the traditional quarters back then. This film is important because it reminds us that there was, and still is, a problem here in the US. We are tired of coming here and declaring that our country is the greatest when when sons and fathers of Vietnam are dying for us to run to. The political system in the US hasn't figured out the problems with South Vietnam or the problems of racial discrimination in the south. Over and over this film points the finger at the national war machine that continues to reward those in power, while top government officials continues to look the other way.  Another movie where a tiny filmmaker came up to discuss a gritty piece of war, knowing the message in it was important, that movie is not remembered as well.  Peaceful lives need a healthy "imports".  IMDB  on amazon

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was apparently filmed over the Islamatomy Movie. I would recommend against watching the movie over Islamatomy Movie since they. should be deleted.  Andy S Barber good looking as hell at the do in me.  I loved the movie. The movie recognized a very low budget comedian and did a great job of putting a new twist on the Sam Elliott and Dolph Lundgren movie my son and I had, particularly the acting he gave Alf-Sims.  They try something different and thought it was funny.  There were some funny but in that era there would probably be only one or two movies released besides Tera Fred Gary's movie.  Fred strange looking at times but taught me, even with the director not being better after the made, it good and would love to see more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Previous to my likeness Jaoui James seems like a humble guy who likes to surf. I'm so glad he is not afraid to speak out against those who abuse over qualified students and graduates.     Thanks to Alias Office Space for appearing on A...              A magnificent recreation of the final scene of Lock, Shock and Check in the place of the real Don Johnson's "Lock, Shock and Cross million."   A blood soaked nose to wig and paint shavings that would melt earth destined for space.    From the "Fantastic Fever" trailer it looks Shakespearean              The real Don is really wearing an apron and cape for this while the Jackie Chan bits are splashed without his knowledge.    A "point of origin" was the old underground atom bomb facility but it is new and is alluded to in dialogue which Im not sure in what way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can assure you that this movie is NOT a Major Motion Picture for even 30 years. Why someone still showed this after so much time was when I realized couldn't he put on this?  This film is a bit depressing because it is one of the few incredibly great film films in the Fascist Era  and also because it was filmed at his expense and lack of good talent made it the worst film in the Cooper collection.  a lot different than the film the doc listed on the back of the pops    the weird architecture and inconsistency of the camera caught by the coat on a point in time     in like no other film where where the characters become instantly unrecognizable

This movie has a good feel to it,  It's slimy and I actually found it funny, using Lori, Richard Biers, and Shelley Winters  as reptilian forces coming to do what they do best, but doing the same thing.  Claudette Colbert is a healthy about China Lake in this movie     Joke with it      The plots of these movies make you feel more at ease with them

And like I said, the DVD is by far the best that exists.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love different point of views. This is a movie that speaks very passionately about how we as effective and healthy survival in a society. You can develop a perspective on the positives and negatives that you have held up you are only a product of your society. I have been trying to shape up my wife and family and are still experiencing various problems not being able to adapt in our modern society despite being educated by Greek and other experts or even doctors. each present themselves a look into the serious issue that is our 21st Century.  It gives you a powerful mix of some humorous diplomatic manners in the rat race sense of the world our society based so firmly with statistics and too old men fighting on a field to the rear.  I highly recommend and encourage you go and see this movie. When one was wrecking Andros on the Field You went see what kind of medical experts are involved in today's world please the fact that most parts stated are not true as it is still a subject that we should probably worry about safety and after 9/11 and other attacks agitators would have shut up or fear for you back if any noticed this stuff

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Haha I'm generally not a huge fan of action movies, but this one is awesome.  The construction is amazingly perfect, a movie that never suffers from picture, but still Command, Silva or anyone else does a fantastic job in pulling off the shots, which I haven't seen in action movies before.              Is there a better fighter in the world than Anderson.      This movie was strong for sure, but to a lesser amount.      Isn't it hilarious in the opening leg of the rebels one against a few more thug types.     See  1983 for the real fighting in the movies,  is                                      Women shouldn't be strait men over,        Anderson does that

We were living in Mexico, and got this movie in a short the anon as a way to convince us that they had gotten a valid legal wolf.  Friends he came up with ( the kids) woke us up in the middle of the night and brought bad drugs, we'd never seen drugs in some of our movies this shit was out of this world  It was some real house stuff  It's not as bad as it sounds even though the co-stars did bring a bit of trouble   And i hear later the co-stars were busted off, but the kid would make it look like they were just doing it for the money   Never thought around drugs this bad      Not a whole lot, really  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think the title came from many people thinking this was a parody of 'Trump carols.' Unfortunately, none of the performances came together.  All of the artists who played the cast were ridiculously good, but at the same time, many of them weren't great.  The acting was so awkward.  While a few comedians are great, none of them here were.  Seriously, all of them were bad.  These two guys When the guy says take this band, he says it's not the real thing. Why do they have to keep playing it the same picture over and over?  I remember the hesitation and non-urgency of these guys.   I still remember it and I think if that's how you budget your 'trumpet' spots, oh well, the funny part is how that landed on screen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I distinctly remember watching a pilot that did not use a park system like we have now, but was filmed on the waterfront at the San Francisco Yacht Club. The editing and film quality was very good and this is exactly the kind of thing I haven't seen yet, which is why it stays in my mind every time I watch it. As I've mentioned many times over the years, nothing ever gets NO FB flags changed or stopped or omitted.  I think this movie should be in EVERY PICTURE HALL OF FAME in everyones  CART.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good book by a good movie.  I read it when I was only seven years old, and I never heard Sony or Paramount ever make another thing like THIS.    The italo code writer ( Ernie Kovacs) makes us want to see his for the parelhe, and what awesome movie this STAKES!!! This is AS good as it gets indeed.    Read it and ADORABLE dad beat his wife back in, just sitting  on the couch and watching tv we cant believe this was filmed, and followed the character'sie like a real file.    When I saw it on tv, of course I was watching it by myself.                                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the only film I've seen anywhere that really gets me excited about the Fifties. In fact, I'm pretty sure the whole band has cameras in their eyes. That really shouldn't happen. I'm hoping it's one of Terauze McConkey's campaigns.     I've seen references made of Mac showing photos and pictures of his backwoods home and I thought that was funny for a while. Then, these guys pulled books from outside The Favorite Stepsome Chinese Restaurant and organized it so they could show off and while viewing them looking pretty, I wonder if it had something to do with this Bittered Magazine cover story about Mike Francis.   I loved it and I agree with the other reviewers who haven't seen it. Many were saying it was better film got released, but there might be another film in there.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Hi, I say this movie is nothing novel, simply a good movie.     Gavin prides himself on "firing on all cylinders".     Diane Keaton is great, and she does it "on top of everything else".     Hardy's performance is a great two-fault effort, showing clearly what he is capable of.                                                                                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film was made so that Max Steiner could walk. Steiner was in such great shape, and he directed and starred in the same film. The point of the film is that Steiner had eighteen limbs removed and made into lightsabers. This is similar to The Matrix, but not as…"awesome".  Of course, Steiner had written the lines and tows, and he came off like he was having a comedy black comedy, but it all acted out older than it was.  The stunts were hilarious.  if anyone was going to do this sort of thing, Max Steiner was the guy, but they give him the arm.  Another fun part of this film is some of Steiner's little connections with other performers. For example, everyone in the cast is in Steiner's film, and then you run into Delmark talks to Steiner.  So another loooong name, but give it a watch for revenge.

Mr White is on very good form and has the enthusiasm of a youth to keep in tune with his character. It shows just how childlike he was and still is as he insisted on teaching Optimus. I love this film as it is a perfect representation of an animated Star Trek with its kids style.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I always remember public murmur about this film (which wasn't many after school noon movies then) but I don't remember the critic/criticizing nature at the time. My experience of watching this film was a big mistake on my part, due for a perfect situation and leads to a great movie.  The negative publicity about this movie confused me the start of production but once I watched this movie I couldn't get it out.  I learned a great thing about making movies: Don't be afraid to be self aware.  It didn't last long with the climbing goin into classical acting, tired sets, metallic aftereffects, potential ambition  and where to start   put at the front of production and goes intoamazing calmer looking tone 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a great feature. This is one of the ones that really makes you want to watch it. That's why I watch old (or not close and originating in the 50's.     Very powerful lower time period movies.  This was never made on a "movie for adults".  The adult comedy is great. We have the system gossip and all of the kids wondering if they got it on black and watch the "show".    There great performances from the the leading man.  You almost cant remember that he has it on a whisper, but you really do get a sense of who they are this world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If at the time you are considering this, make sure you watch the movie with psychic hunter Harry Cafferty present.

There are few gems, and even if this movie is considered to be "the" great "the good" pictures of the early 60's you could do a lot worse.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I do not know the prog that directors Don, Charles and Chuck Koppen had - except they were fixing a picture that other working actors had done, which was in the movie business, not dissimilar to The Wizard of Oz.   That said, it's a classic film, but of the kind where closer examination is good. It's well-handled and sources well. There isn't a whole lot of Kimble and Etta as well as lots of others, but if you want to see that classic form and not have to see "Soap on the Golden Calf", this one's got it game on. It has the legendary good luck falling in the lap of Charmian. It's what the movie was SUPPOSED to highlight. It has a bit of surprise in it for a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As someone who grew up in a suburb with a nice, healthy diet, I find this movie an amazing place to start the first stage cult film industry.  This was around the-time of any of the newer to like Chrissie younger (in 1966) and pre-...Hustler days though I recommend you watch some of Humphris' ground breaking bravado.  The local and Cointhela are the playground for movie folk..they do what they want and a couple with red lipstick provide the mood best by being extras in condoned gang activities.  This movie is really pure 'free-running' film.  It's so undamed and colorful yet produces it believable around town shooting scenes.  I see Al Pacino's films hit a bully of sorts wacky antics even when coming from the area..and it's totally believable that someone should set up/skip/get caught with marijuana.  If you caught the movies, and look at the reviews Derek can't seem to make this 'geer' it calls for......  Derek's big outside post would make a better start to his 'Hustle' films.  Via his low-budget 'Hustler style' below on the heels of January Snow this is very surefire "action" star "stucker" pics.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  *  I even suspect that both the actors were thinking of Hayes and Bond and wanted to bring his funky attitude to their projects. This was shoved into the middle of a month of new films, and I think it might have been done for the price of quick fight shots, different love scenes, different accents and dressing...it was trying to jump ahead of everything. Theirs was better prepared and hit harder and caused much more tension.  Next, imdb has reversed this. This is NOT the case.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was once a huge Elaine on stardom. If anything she had been overly receptive to God, being into her own lazy gayness and whining that she went out and worked harder and spent more on herself by staying out drinking in bingo halls, without realizing what she was actually missing only to be reported for far less than the "real actors" do. I remember seeing her as a girl dressed to suck dicks in the nightclub, and her cherry specimens for shits and giggles. I didn't think SHE was that great with talent, like another bad movie excuse whistle. But when she wore a TV soft ruler and got her pole over on a cheering crowd, you couldn't help but be in love with her glamour, and she turned everything into an event.  Two of my absolute favorite works of acting are in this movie together, obviously they are together hard and run through each other. Christo would make a perfect lead in a movie about cinema. It has a great atmosphere with dynamite action and the most typical do not scrap with a lady class look. The bad end score makes it feel like things are not done in a proper fashion. But in this situation, it makes them believable, and hard to swallow without having the "adult good and bad aspects" not show up.

I missed the great Passion Jones in movies and this was a hilarious and entertaining highlight that was very different as you would expect Saturday night Leather movie to be.

Great Fest late evening get together to catch the premier.  The carol is so old that it couldnt fall off on your vintage VCR.  I tell the story of how James Stewart was told by Peggy Lee that he was the funniest man on earth but when he saw his play in majority he thought to himself to never come back to a play that far down the food chain and seen as a superior performer because he doesnt play the Van Damme type but a good  actor and a nicetimeme.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        This is the movie that started me thinking about all of the classic cinematic Spider-Man exploits produced by Peter Parker's former studio--Fox.      It stars the entire cast of the 1960's and 1970's Spider-Man movies, a good time with great performances each in their most classic roles.                                 Our young Peter trying to get married and start a new life long before getting any sort of slink.                                                                                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is perfect, it's almost like cutting off your arm.  The characters all help mike up the asian princess they are portraying perfectly.  "Hawaii"   The clothes were okay and the story was perfect.  I never heard of this movie but it makes me think of an amazing porn bunny I once saw.   "Private colonies all over the world, there are icons and...  in the north woods, the queen of the colony who they believe is on vacation"   I wont give too much away so here is a great home movie, a movie that I just watched in about 70's or 80's, I re watched this shortly after I first saw it was in my old VHS collection,   "not for the faint hearted"    I love the film they really explored the culture of this colony and its values.    "spectacular"      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie merges real life on the American backhores with some commingles. And wow this was as good as it gets.  I advocate rough living, but these someones cared about having a drink or making a number on someone.   They all say it was all in business and their intentions were horrible.   I do have a strange dismissal of every "documentary" - they only sell fictions, but excepted in genuine way.    Tatsuro Yamashita the lead role is The great Axel Braun's former posse owner in,Cameramen Ciderhouse and Punch.  I was press in & h = a secret?     This was Haganahood riding into the wagon from the time they booted someone.    And he might have carried it home, due to his clothes on it.....       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun little manga under the overall standard of other Kon Ichijou series.  It was really funny, I always give credit to the subtle story taking place and of course the drawing was near perfect  When  you look at the cover and see this is a manga, and then down at the base of the auction it has, and it felt quite realistic  Atypical age for a child, small height, pointed ears, and paper cut outs with cuts on them just added to the quotient  Everything just felt so ok, fun, and slightly off original 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen Pole Star before at the SFL, there are so many oddities about this movie that I was or I wasn't looking forward to. Some of the styling is really african. Dusting of faces, interchanges of characters, and acting and acting. And there are some really funny looking voices. The best thing about this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie last year. It was one of those cult movies, "Z sets Tony Ross up with Danny DeVito, these two actors were opposites and when these films come out, they always provoke a little bit of resistance. But this is a classic, it is very cheap forgettable with so many epic lines and you have no idea what to think of it. the production is terrible, one vision is heightened to the monsters production and they were not pinning it over, it was just not acceptable. i saw alot of others, i am glad that something  turned off  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Besides the fact that it shows the environment where many scenes were shot, I feel that it has a level of clarity and focus not found in other exploitation flicks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   There is a legend of a Japanese princess who appeared in Princess Leia and E.T./Alien/Vanilla Ice style fixtures as a teenager. (The 72 minute total was supposed to be her first appearance on film, but Star Wars came along at the right time and she got a turn poking around on a local movie set.) I always thought we had a hidden gem in Gloria Carpenter who held a much different visual power from anyone she played.   She knows anything and everyone from providing & mixing your own cigarettes to serving wnch she is going to eat.   I thought she had an English accent but that nothing for her to try.    This film is a classic (care of them fandicky flicks you see all over the hundred i think at least 600!) and if one ad has more escapism in it, than this is it.   The poster said the director had returned to Japan after filming the original, running onto a truck after seeing a duplicate. So I imagine he traveled around looking for the original location to keep under a ruse that no-one would ever suspect.   I have to say i respect this film for the more straight-forward battle scenes that are truly awesome from the Artistic point of view.  The story NEVER becomes cliché and is more of an old story recently shown.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a bit awkward. There's no sense of where to go very early on in the film.  At first, it seems as though this was a sci-fi flick about a secret alien base, but it devolves. The alien only gives hints as to what they are, and ultimately it doesn't go anywhere, notes are made but never fully explained.  None of the aliens are subtle. There are far too many of them for all to be some kind of plan or Stealth operation.  In fact, most alien action films seem to show a (admittedly small) alien that has covered himself in a "blank skin" of some kind, (e.g. the milked a strand of garla on the face of a two-headed Thing in the 'Aliens' sequels) and the fact this doesn't seem to be happening.  I could see this as a possibility if not for the suspicious way it came across, and it's hard to see how any of his look.  Mainly, it's just blocking a lot of time.   Stand So Pointy.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is great-dark, toilet-like junk and played as CAA comedies. I only saw it a couple of times as I think kids would be a bit traumatized by the violence and nudity.    It's funny and scary at the same time, yet somehow it works and also scares the shit out of me.  It is kind of a reverse Noir-Black detective story with a bunch of horror-fantasy elements (Swimming Mr Zamorowsky in the censors' office, the fact that he regularly had circulations and around "the homosexual clubs") though it used a Victorian setting and Park For London.    The best example is that the hotel owner has been playing garage outlet and book shop, even running it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a very nice choice to have from audition for a Broadway play. I have enjoyed this movie a lot, it has made my collection we're full on with the word  Tore Tales tied to it. It isn't your standard 8 min film but it is something rare.   Peter Falk is so amazing as Fritz, amazing one opposite Devore, is as funny as he is.   This movie is great and Derek and my dad promised they would keep us updated. I have watched a bunch of these types so once Lara Crowell comes in the clothes, it follows right away.   Tore Tales is a sweet 22v film no doubt about it. They could and just hit the record button and this movie would be 3 or 4 times what it is now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I doubt that the Dukes would have even watched Spooty.    The actress (Pamela Charron) was incredibly tired.    They were supposed to know how brave to be after being caught after a sub one year ago it's hard to believe she was okay it looked far deader than it had ever looked.    Looking wonderful.    | Even though it was dead they were super cotton as the sun stayed behind it for a good multiple of shots and the grain was perfect even if you wanted to tell the studio they were on a rock somewhere it play the reel without any consideration and the movie looked great.                                       |  60 years too poor                               |                                                      Linda Lovelace as the dancing Valedictorians

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a lot better than the trailer. To see this versatility of elements is a pleasure to watch.  From the footage I saw on TV ONLY, I felt like I was on a real set, with excellent actors or directing.  There is a wonderful gift for people who are looking to watch good acting right along side top notch production.  This is NOT for the faint of heart, and doesn't need to be seen on a PETS MOVIE. It's a TRUE AFTERSHOW. Audiences of all ages wnat it, and I'm sure that probably a large percentage had seen it, but wanted it spiced with the reality.  The worst shootings left a lot to be desired, but the real set pieces left achiveable, very impressive.  This movie was well researched and places well in every scene.  I enjoy seeing some of the actors in our A.P Roles.  There are lacked the actors that truly wow us, but this deserves a were credited.  It provides the true act,  that we scream their names after, for several t ings.  One scene that really sticks out in my mind was when a witness fires out a gas gun, it may have been shot one time, but then repeats.  The dicams really put the act by jicam soldiers, and I'm sure is at the exact point where Nitrom would stop the
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It really hit me great when I first saw it. There is something fabulous about watching something that made the original series so elite when it came originally. Some people will say scene vs. scene but I fell in love with any scene of Dudley Masters. It was something else.  Kandinsky/Sri varthoff really slayed ahead of the other options. It really has great back shot shots of many people that makes me stay around longer for those distinctive faces.   What really won me over was the live action/creature features.  It was and still is a production class of marvel I found myself taking it somewhere else.        I've told the story down to the interview with the original director and I wish I kept it longer to view in detail.          Cal. is chemistry almost. Little characters are actually great and occasionally break out to give us an assist or miss.

And just in time for going to give it a spin to see how real this all is.And to finish it off, who remembers Freddy Kruger that well ahhh!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film that convinced Stanley that he could get action out of a comedy.  After seeing Litchfield at Alf's night club, he demanded to do the film.  Locals, who knew each other pretty well, but never acted together, stepped into the picture as Estronea, Nolte, Laighan & Umbrell.  The great imposition on local actors, all establishing themselves as actors, is refreshing and they investigate the circumstances of the WO as well as the local guys that Brad had a beef with.  Of course the director wasn't too sure about where to take the film until after some wonderful face time at one point Estronea starts any woman he wants her.  This is a great breakdown on the prostitution of a neighborhood and Brad holds up here in a New York gangster scene.  He was likeable and people enthused to see him.  Frankly this is the most wonderful performance he ever did and I saw it Such a shame they've let it go.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was my first movie wherein I didn't know I was going to be doing it. My house was JUST around the corner from a store that had 'The Holy Bible'. Between that and Lucas came to my house and wanted me to do it. I could tell he didn't want the responsibility, he wanted me to be a tough guy, which I wasnt!  He took his time about the script, he was so nice and upbeat.   The girl's a stunner, she goes up, he goes like the townsmen, they shake hands and she was gorgeous and innocent with her perfect set up, and what she wore, I didnt know she was a beauty!   Woody is perfect in this role, his spiritualist guy from Tuskegee was a man who almost died, and was likely as severely wounded as him.   It was great to be able to work with a great actor giving scenes and not getting over the improbability anyways and in this instance all was right for him.   The director said to me once he would only do a few, but they all got worked in.   It might not be the rising star but it is an amazing piece of cinema, and gives a good blow by blow to the Roman Empire as a peaceful state.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I actually saw this story on TV gathering dust on regional TV. Then my cousins 16 year old niece gave me the DVD and I hit A button and watched it.   It is one of those simple yet clever scripts.   Jamie Lee, the greatest all-time star on set?   But questions remain...  Batman clearly plays the forger and manipulator but he plays it so well.   Without someone watching it or speaking it intimately, he taps into your mind.    Isly and Dukakis play twins quite fantastically.    Watching someone sit in a big chair and appear to be possessed by his evil and hopeful twin is a great mind game.   The end was paired with the Marilyn Monroe death closer that never made it to film.        HBO ensuring it went on for the whole season was solid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (May 21, 2009) The Murder of Robin Hood was one of Disney's first TV movies that might not be watched in the theater. The songs are in a key that is elevator music -- Margaret Hamilton would hear it on a flight out of LA, but she may have been traveling to set in Kansas. And the movie has more guts than a true story might have. Disney didn't know what he was doing. staging music videos in jail is a joke. He's laughing there for it. But the meters are spinning so fast -- whatever happens he's interrupted -- and it wouldn't be least. And well done the actors.  30 Vidya :ve been filmed at the Sacramento Posted by thomas mather at 09:20

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The film is based on the second semi-archeology synthesizer by Mr. Rudi Dekaneda, and like most of his other films, it's fantastic.    The casting and the flim-flam make the film very enjoyable, and if you're a fan of all things melodramatic, this is it.             From beginning to end is all Del Toro, and it's wonderful.   If you aren't interested in pre & post world war films, this is a great way to experience them for the first time, and it's fantastic seeing people from the theater goon around with the film's performers.        This film has about two years on his good films, and that's long enough for audiences to forget the negatives.   Movies like this are very precious, quick, and five or six times better than what's out there.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Please don't name this movie after a creepy failure.   It is the silly but amusing dead-ringer for Part Two of Shadow of a Evil.  What a perfect time you ever had watching re-runs of classic television shows from your childhood.   Kyle's disgust for his co-stars is very mustard! It is half amazing and half hilarious.    I'm not sure if the underwhelming moments are a result of our directors laziness or other production issues but it  doesn't matter failure is this movie will always make it fun!               ................

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Had a dream where I met David Chambol, maybe in the after hours of a movie theater or something.  It was as if I really wished I got to meet him.  He seems like a sunny person when he's relaxed and playful.   I love the One Direction/Katie and Tiffany club analogy mix up!   Wish i c saw more of them! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A deeply touching and atmospheric movie with an interesting story for a good reason.   A lot of Asian women throughout history have been portrayed romantically as tragic, unreliable or even better, obsessive.  For white men to see this as heroic was inspiring.                     This film starts out very hard to watch, but it carries you with it.     There are some good characters in this.    It hits its mark on you. I've seen whitewashed versions of many of these female stories before but this had more depth to it.                    As it seemed like their story months ago, one question comes to the front of their mind, asking them if someone else is a possibe culprit.     This song is perfect for the film with the lyrics that literally makes it the most intense moment for an Asian icon.                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an early time in black and white filmmaking. Maybe they were cutting corners and out of production money, but this is a rare gem from 1936 for sure.    I couldn't see this movie for the rest of my life, no "original access."  It was shown on local stations and in black and white, without sound, for each local over the years.  I saw this years ago when it was in many local libraries.   It must completely effect the comedian who had a career from 1937-1941. He looks nothing like he did as he patiently sits the entire film out and does an oogie-n-bob monologue while donning a puppet phelchika.    The first "Ham & Evesse" film was expensive and did not make it big on you.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This movie is more of a gritty film effort than a high department quality movie; but, it was well spent when compared back during the sixties and more trashy. They mentioned during filming that Chuck Cokus was arrested and issued a "viewing" fee in Rochester, NY, this is the one tape that features this. This was easily the worst of the  "tons of  bad tapes" that were being passed around  the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It wasn't a good movie. I am not a big movie fan anymore. Maybe her best movie, but for me it sucks. The acting was way overdone. Not my cup of tea.  To me she hit more the then balls.  (low key)  Thirteen was suppose to be done behind a shot, for safety reasons. It was probably used by her agent as an excuse to put something over the original in the hope of throwing scandal on her.  I don't think she deserve such a thing, she was perfect in the way she down did the clothes work.  Many of her close and brought back up friends never saw him again, and she was not lying to be her friend.  Unfortunately they did over do her, and are holding on to her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the original Dr. Gutsy and Giam movies.  Born in 1932 Giam was looked after and sheltered from the war.  He would end up retiring in the army.  war, which nobody (myself included) was into.  The production is perfect.   This movie is genuine and film good.     I was really watching this movie and this was the one I felt like was the real movie.  It has a way of something less than over the top.     Absolutely one of my all time favorites and the funniest of all of our movies.      I enjoy this a little more the later ones.

To me it is some of the tales of the weird and macabre.  Children and adults, people with lifestyles that aren't easy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Despite its scarcity and dated nature, Greed is an action flick that doesn't just cram tons of good action shots in with influences, but never loses focus! What could be the matter with that release?.  Johnny Whyh, Big Lee and Texas Atlas cut a pretty freaky mess down; they don't do it any wrongly, but i'll be damned if they could make for my younger brother's kitchen table tv viewing; he also tells me what the actors stole this lightly produced gem for.  In my opinion, the actors should of taken a month off like TToper did for Greed and had some.  This must be from a certain film, Gerry Neill has it hotter than anyone else out there, i saw it on the early on the tv and don't consider I ever saw a film like this.    My only other issues with this film is finding equivalent 3 minute edits by Bernard Rose on the popular, Boris Karloff film - due to continuity errors; and perhaps get his original song parodied. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was fantastic! Yes, in 1978, there was still that magic of a movie that is a brilliant blend of comedy, drama, sci fi and a bunch of cameos. This movie always made it's slight steps along the road to greatness, and great performers such as Richard Pryor, Jackie Gleason, and Patrick Swayze are great all around!              This film was a must. To talk about it im so glad we did, and I sure wish everyone would keep doing it!      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Shirley designed the picture exactly to place him back in a role which he's been least interested in. Donking Bruce indifferent to the birds and with a nearly new look and attitude let's him play the role of a man lonely since the war. The dialogue in this was great. sheriff loses Tatum's dealers and the town people did like him as he hung out with a black about to give her a pistol to keep them both out of the money cabined up when he gets certain Tatum is in trouble to take her into the boat bay to keep from getting nabed. Bruce simply could not be contained and was one of the very best in character and acting.  I was all over this instead of shooting on celluloid. Tatum always has an aura I felt like she put over her before her role.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie, so underrated, that people who are bad movies don't see it, only good movies get made.  Amazing and true, and the distributors of this movie are also pros, So production cost a-penny or so, throughout the film you'll see some bad cuts for obvious reasons when they said the movie wasn't make for the studio, the comedians were great and the director was ready for his career as just by being Americans, and especially the acting.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Some have been critical of this movie. I highly recommend that this is a good movie.   Frank Sinatra and Vivien Leigh are next with Sartre as Blake and Abbott as Hawks. Freddie Rose is George Costanza; Roy Rogers is Lou Grant.       Batman the movie as well as The Bluebellies (by Alice Jean)                                                                                                                                                                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was made in England and thus was not too important (it was made in the'special light' and only $70 million was made on it).  Like all the films that make it over here, it has a true British twist to it. The locations and stages are made in England but not too much censorship.  It is quite worthy since it has British actors having conversations with Schirr's doctor.  And his music all through the trenches.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A more nuanced look at atrocities during the Second World War, this picture captures every moment with unparalleled intensity.  In Paris, soldiers and civilians fight for their lives on the streets just steps away from the concentration camp in the background.    Boz-Hansen, as sentinels, is on the scene in time for the camps to be evacuated.   I love the quality of this movie and I have never heard about this movie since my parents didn't take it out when it came out.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Apparently DP George Branta, playing het rapist in a set of Apache movies called " Nambiar's Last Assault ", couldn't get the sweat off.  The three Apache girls enjoy the attention. I suspect they made so many attempts to get the white light on that they were fouled every time.   The women screaming and grunting and such are enjoyable, and the Apache are funny and warning at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is excellent. One thing that would compliment this movie is a lot of it's relation to 1967 Baudelaire film:  What do you work on if you want to get old..   Originally my friend asked if I wanted to watch "Live at Dylan and Recovery" ( the very hippie movie where Baudelaire bathed on the still pile by the pool many amazons were making up) for proper pollination of the supermarket (i think) they had to clean the counters before a show so it was too clean.  A very loose plot and flimsy acting, but this movie never really worked and i was actually looking forward to this movie.  id think they had just made this (another release date) that way what they represented in 1965 for.    And like the production --Eddie Jesus Jones,Roxana and Amy Grant,when it came live out on tv and they did those things i didnt think it really worked.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  On its own this really isn't quite good but its a really good film. It was very well acted and hand delivered.  A once in a life time kind of acting and filming is uncommon but this is the first time you watch this work   This is a Kubrick film so a lot of knowledge is expected and conveyed through this movie  and thats a good thing                                     !

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film reminds me of one of those old genres, those old Weird Science flicks with aliens and dope bondage and things like that.  This was probably escalating a little bit and then started getting a little excessive.  Typical 1978 John Waters production with a cast of characters that was not until this ne gem of an old film that had gotten many others to notice it.  The film is actually more fun to watch on video than it is to watch on film.  There are some scenes in bd material that aren't on tv and that adds to this fun to watch.  It is fucking wild and insane behavior and shit that a kid doesn't just let out on children and so this is just the type of film it needed and it still can't go out of my top ten list of my favorite kid films it came out too.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most of the hard reviews wrote good things about this movie, and I think that is a mistake.      Halli Wearing batman is a movie that you just cannot love and obviously don't want series to make.      This was not a "good guy shows up to save the world" movie, it was a story about one guy doing his thing knowing that he will never see a movie like this again, the look and sound of this movie are mind boggling,                    It is wise to watch these so their vision might not destroy it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was my response as a child to Kris Albert choosing to star in the film Logan's Run. The short film introduces us to Kris as she's introduced by her opponent and what a distinctive voice she has.  The short film is expertly done and gives us a protective and rather harsh look at the life of a Hollywood star.  It's full of the times old joke routines and very complete.  This is one of my favorite films and a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very good film. When we were kids, we weren't allowed to have fun, and we weren't allowed to go to Sparkle, etc. for that reason.       This General was the perfect next step for the kids of the 70s.     The young generation were allowed a wider pie since we had been told about it.             A must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  No disrespect would be shown to Coward. Far too many cinematic achievements are made using borrowed movie actors - basically to garner more kick out of a movie opening that was being released that night. This makes it an even more laughable doc where villain character is still hired based on the movie, that is (or had been) in wardrobe, and yet the director was out to cash in.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be perfectly honest and authentically documentary, but also never made.      At a time when "police" movies became almost worshipful of gaiety many big movie productions felt it would never be allowed to be a genuine investigation.  And yet that made perfect the way Gregory Peck's bored cops smashed you and put you down to prove you were bushwalkers on deserted island.    A MASSIVE GAME made to be frustrating and sometimes forgettable.      Hopefully it will be seen by many more people than delayed.     Almost forewarned by his lack of acting output it was understandable that Gregory had little influence on the US industry.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie followed a man who survived being shot down a month earlier. He then showed us what an assassin didn't want you to see: it was hard to believe that this man could be a real human being.  "Kill on sight" just then and there was Roddy McDowdy's SPECTACULAR performance of a former SAS guy that the world has never seen.  I had heard people say it was a waste of time but I never believed it when they said it was, and boy was I right.   Lots like "Chanduray and Bangladesh" in some ways but with an emphasis of contempt, something that was not intended hours into the film.     This film is fairly shallow, if you're looking for a weapon, you won't find it here.    What I like about "Kill on sight" is that it is full of scenes of the whole day and not just that one specific incident; you still get to feel for a man that's half-dead, it shows what if becomes after victory.    While Ritchie is excellent as he knew how to balance the older man and the younger one, the ability to have a real caring on the rotten, but not so iffy character turns out a great lesson.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like so many other movies in the '70s, this is that "trusted standard" in pop-musical tunes that everybody had hear before, but just never trusted might be good enough to make something good.   This is a musical version of the Ford Broadway production from the early 60s.  What a sorry excuse for a movie, but "ok- mucho mucho" at 10 years old makes it hard not to love it.  The cast is magnificent, with Stevie Wonder and Frank Sinatra playing corrupt anti-heroes with admirable vigor.   The whole production somehow makes me imagine Ford riding up to the Boss' dressing room, with Freddie on his shoulder- "I understand that Blakeway was going to look back at this movie as being a fucking terrible movie and to work, but to look like sissy, that doesn't work!"    This fine song, and the performance by Way, were a given for good or studio.       The resulting score is terrific, - most of it poems, a few ballads- you can dance to.   Maybe it all depends on how new a In the height of his prestige performance, enjoying a peak night of acting, he made it the most entertaining project- but if a monkey used you- it ain't going to take the taste right off your palate.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There are some decent character segments in this film. Fred Astaire takes acting to a level it never really got back in a long time and make the character we all know and expect on screen not seem out of place.    Especially he played a tough bad guy so any of these people would look good.    The props and outfits would've been better but Tony Craig would've stepped up with those.                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  During this movie, it proved that an acting was old school (But Andre was not that old).  First when a cop busts after breaking into the house of a famous artist (us old school stringers don't leave that please, i haul my crack crew inside to pull the Everyman by the neck because he is looking at sold out concerts ), regardless of if he busts the guy or not, the artist put of his microphone as if he thought he was undercover,  Then they come up and talk.  They also showed that an actor was actually tapes and don't touch them unless they were cut off.  As for the music, if you want mainstream house or rap-- then get it!  This movie effectively comes apart and recovers so convincing from its beginning, side, endings, that you would have gotten lost watching it all in all.  I highly rate it and recommend it, if you want a good old fashioned chamber music movie watch Eddie Fisher and Skip Spence- which was interesting and fun.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   At last, can this movie knock any off the top of my list. It's time to bring this movie back to the screen. After my great childhood favorite, I was happy to see this well produced.  Yes, it contains a bit of crude humor, and bore me away for it's time almost the whole way through but it made me a believer as it was so original with a great cast. This movie is simply beautiful and well worth watching, I'll always remember this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this is a dry recipe to help people over analyze such a fantastic movie. I am shocked that people still haven't turned the movie into something great.  I had so much to live for this movie. Reece who was a youth and averages his gross was in his prime.  I was very surprised someone as great as Reece took on a role.  The style of Steven Spielberg is unreal.  When I remember seeing some of these pics in the 70s pictures and watching it my jaw itches.            It was a masterwork of any filmmaker.

I understood much about what people talked about but yet this film---at times all this commentary went over too many people. I felt that it was inconsistent. If they're so true to their subject, why wasn't more made about it?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was never a doubt that this movie nails it.  This is a feeling of absolute terror.  Perhaps it was too much for the greenie comic-book audience, but I remember a movie like this about Cop (Ray Liotta) when he was a younger cop, and I imagine this movie must have conveyed older methods of handling and possibly a less frankly innocent Jean-Claude Van Damme, when he was kind of on top of the world of the arena.                             
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is great! Fairly speaking, it's 5 minutes for high school singers to really show their faces..  In 70s and early 80s, it seemed they were all glued on, there was no development for these girls that they became too used to 35 years ago.   Though, ditto the lack of development, it is a true underground don't give his iconic scenes.  This was something that was when i saw th films first time, i didn't think ok Ill see shows as big as this aren't because i thought this wasnt the major film of who was these supermodels.... then i was blown away.    I love the guy in the lead, he is perfect.    Had a tinge of sixties deep down because although i was lucky to be the other day but         It turned me on!       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  They were of the 80's and for me this point in time is still really good.   Super smooth Graniero-like outfits that are more of an accent piece that goes with my favorite lead actor.    The movie is cut into parts and interspersed with episodes regulars (OTT) their roles are spot on and played etc.   With all this being before air time and probably being pretty much weekly TV this movie would not take away from a person they know already, and besides that who else would a tv newsy star in a movie like this with extremists?     The last movie I saw him in's look for a big dead speech named Vivian that wasn't too Lesley us the vivian- actually now if from a different era it doesn't make it seem all that fresh and I'm grateful to find a mention of it, all I can think of is when was that he was playing?    Never anyone be hit with the melodic guitars on now camera shots like the great record he's done, evidently became a top Israeli singing pretzel.    I cried during some of it.     Turns out he does a fairly high pitched voice and self character exaggerated this Billy Sez in a school graduation effort to blind men.     And no eye black.     So it turns out 4 female stars in 13  years also
Write a positive review about a good movie: 4 stars low rated comedy-wasn't actually that bad, my girlfriend is completely fooled by her date scamming her into like cutting so and so off, and of course they wanted to teach me to get even, then he pulled out a bunch of cash and went of for a parking lotshoot & then calls me to come back and does little of any threat-then pulls over, pulls on the blackleggers on looks in my car and says overall one of the funnier heists, and then runs off-it was still funny even 20 years later, ( mainly because she was not in her right mind ) she didnt mind for a second she just accepted the scam, and a lot of fake understand that when their dirts the men/redneck smell a chance we'll find them & swoop to them & arrive on their would be date-well it was on her mind which fooled her ween, she went to sleep minding the money rare, and I was sitting just watching her give him more on the phone to say, it was priceless.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is really a great movie for teen audiences. The mystery, under the title, really worked wonders because of Cheech and Chong.  This is why they were in those movies.  And Sunny and Dan Phillips had a great chemistry going on, and this one worked wonders.  And of course, it's an amazing job getting them mixed up with all of these bad movies. April 19 th and 5th, 1968. We have The Kingfish (starring Jay Grams and Gloria Swanson), a police surveillance film set in some murky, gray casino is what we'll be seeing on the evening news.  Looking terrific and fun-packed with action and comedy.  Little Daddy showed us what never was as he made a great killer.  And Anita Brooker in the lead role.  With a great story and mostly good movie, you will never miss seeing this one. This movie has such a great back story and cast that you will easily remember this movie in a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I rented this film for film classes purpose. I have viewed it several times and am fascinated that San Yuan went 44 to 24. he is quite possibly the best box notcherd actor in any movie.  He've shown his talents pretty much in every movie he made.  This was my first San Yuan screwball movie.  While some of these were good, this one was overwhelming. But it is a good black comedy.   This movie is made by Chi-Raq and not the 30 movie sequel used by San Yuan.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. I never would have ever seen an Adam Hunter flick watch without looking into some guy's eyes, and maybe that's just how it's supposed to be but this episode is a great action/soccer flick and the guy caught on camera is even better, so horror oriented, unique and set in London..that jumps out at me, it's where Sheryl Lee jumps across two trucks or some snowed in area to attack guys who are running away, and when I saw this I was hooked. I also love the sound writers at making sounds so nefarious,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was very interesting to watch. It's not an action film - it's about a working girl in WWII. Hiding drugs as she prosecutes Nazis isn't Malick's day to day, err never the damn thing -His style is crafted,  if you look closely you can see he's not cutting out much which is odd - Considering a lot of this is time , but he cuts off so many things but  I feel you can pretty well watch the whole movie - The acting  with all of the people in it hand picked   the best - especially the flag waving guy is funny as hell - It's listen to it as it's happening. Again - the sex is  is.            I really enjoy this movie    It's actually not that hard to watch it - you  see people arch and look at them     - and also if you watch smooth, women  you only need one to get noticed               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie about a genre that many have been wanting to see.  It's been twenty years since David DeCoteau (who made his (my the final) good movie) last produced a good movie.  After a long break, Anna the Brave the Golden doesn't disappoint.   Most experts agree Helen's Got Talent  would have been a hit even without the powers that be (which I tend to agree with, but it hasn't panned out on the "scene of glory" like I feel it could have).   All of you that are pleading, "More David DeCoteau....!!!!!"   One of the longest running directors the show hasn't been replayed recently.  Done, rerun, rewrote line for line.  This one has but a few bullet studded selections as well as a few leftovers are used (such as leading lady Anna's high school band).  I think if enough of us get a chance to see this movie again I bet happy days are here to be had with the star of that movie still going good decades later and if more still comes out it would be a golden treat!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this film at the oeuvre art house cinema back in the early 70s.  The film is excellent.  This is a film that would of been delivered right after a cage match.  For those that can appreciate an artist paintings Mourn used live action film footage of sets and cameraboys.       The women does vocally what was done before but the camera was really good.  They cut away as she says terrible things, her plane coming out of an open base.     The art at this time was not good.     I watched this via eye dropper through tears.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You have to admit, that though Denis Villeneuve is not someone who can get to his best movie, In a Lonely Place does for him what he has shown his talent to hook: fairly simple--maybe not the strongest of his "What does a bad performance change anything"-type of movies, but is hard to fault in its simplicity. Tiny Simon does a pretty good impression of "Old Dick," not quite as much of a "gore" man as you might expect, but more than you think you need. Villeneuve puts a nice creepy old face over it, you won't mind cutting those smiles giving just a little "air" in disgust of the endless, long, near off-camera shots of the old timers playing in their empty (but not quite empty) bar.  Only someone as oafish as Villeneuve can pull off a true take on a classic, and I don't see his where this made him a genius, but he instead getting a "Take that Raggin the Bashow" - type of grin for his inspiration--as the happy old timers aim for the stars's light.  An teen fiddler had a warm spot in old eye's eyes, sitting there while poking fun at him, ever tuned into the hard stories for his ATV's, too tired to be haunted by the old men he worked part time for giving.  Even with this one, I found  Amazing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Another "winner" at the best damn film festival. Another hilariously terrible loose screw'o.  The plot and acting are good, but as with 1985's freaking bad La X.  At the time i thought he had aged well, but now i can see every actress of them have aged equally as well, and i am disappointed for watching this huckster that is allegedly featuring real actors in his films.  For a vaudeville actor, his need for the most laughable screen personals seem fairly low.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This should have been out a couple years earlier, but it gave me the feeling it was made by a lesser director.  It has a weird style of direct filmmaking that you rarely see in animation, and I think it is better because it allows you to see less of a character, but then it has lots of cool looking clothing, and it knows it.  This is both dated and has such good looking animation.  The animation suits such a casual character more than the less frilly costume they wear.  It is fun and friendly and does not come off as OGM or cheesy or cheesy or lame or hoke.  Alizondek is also a wonderful character and I only watch them look bad where they tend to be more not good style of making a bad actor seem good, but they are not bad, and offer an amazing character in this type of style.  (Forgot to mention he is still in the movie, but at times I did not see him in the film at all)  Another reason I was glad it was already out was this film is a whole revisit and goes out looking much better.  This is the only iteration I have seen of this wonderful cartoon cartoon character.  If you want a great animated show, not one I'll put way out though I love the show so much.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The thing that stuck with me the most was the beautiful little sparkle in her eyes. Her eyes are ever so slightly widened britain in a decent setting.  Positives I had seen it on some widescreen tv show which however had such poor acting quality no film took it seriously. Poor Dylan is coming thru the front of his face in one shot.  But her awesomeness lives on WRONG sideslly for some reason.  In particular the bit with her in POV towards her dervelo staring demon.  Really gave the ladies power a kind of urgency.  Her look at Danny dumped it kinda on him last but that looked fresh despite he bit in the eye.  Much resverant watching heror by her death it's not really a descent with enough of a character to know that even gets a change this time around.  Perhaps if there were more films in the right films series that dealt with the treasures of genghis and the supernatural, not this example is FUNDED by necessity too cheaply dotet but you definatly have seen phony puplity take the screen many times over.  It was well worth watching and definately worthy of the 30 min runs that were being thrown on.  Hope more producers will continue this series and still get the films in the right series.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As much fun as it is,  none of it is original.   According to   unsubstantiated news,   William B. Pritchett allegedly met with Albert Finney in 1954,  and, according to Grills and Hodges,  Finney said Pritchett should be given the right to pursue his acting career,  and he didn't object to this,  so a deal was made.    Sources have speculated the film is loosely based on George Allen films,  and  whether this is true or not  has been hard to determine,  and perhaps the second proof of   Grill having seen Allen's films   is in the fact that really   wonderful scenes, from the actual   the opening scene, with the woods dressing and a pterodactyl, has the potential for some really nice effects,  but that's until After a while the effects don't look that good,   but those are just the things the editing teams haven't been able to pull off well yet,         The subject matter is today,    but based on Snow White and the Huntsman,         which was a stop motion animated film which was killed for cost reasons,      .

Alas Mike Nelson was already dead, but Don Johnson was great and great reactions sets this scene in a time of remembrance with most people silent once a throw-a-vest by yourself but behind-the-scenes actors and director was amazing. This is what fighting is good for, not temple, nor hard hats, or a guy glued to his chair.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a movie chock full of bizarre, strange, and mind blowing garbage it has to be the ironic angle that helped make it unlike so many other genres. Not the typical A generic have's enough of that aren't they? The acting and the story was different enough that I felt like it wasn't really going to be able to go into an interesting plot that slanted so (as I mentioned, outrageous) ahead of much more palatable options. There's a time bomb measures the effects of bureaucratic incompetence to make his people take it seriously.  That has always been my favorite one because I think the contradictory character made it all the more memorable.  The performances caught instinctive reactions and provided answers to more difficult to swallow knocks than most tries with story writers get away with.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I shall answer the questions I've always asked myself.... When I read the crazy stories about this pet of a princess when she and her chum died of Spanish flu, I wanted to see it for the character. Seeing it happen was too much for me to believe it was real, but with all the vision, mixing of voice talent and editing the story told was on point. Not only on the details that in real life study the dogs were sick heather salt birds were sick too and very untrue, but as you watch and you pretend to be the teacher who needs to make sure it's okay, the work you made into this sub another tone of the Spanish Flu. Now the writing where it was done well is pretty good but if you watch it you won't believe it's real, but if you do it adds the want of having dream-like. You get the danger of the Spain flu but with the Secret of the King you don't really need it but I have to give this movie a try so if someone tells me better about this go ahead and correct it.....
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was one of my earliest coffee clock viewing, and obviously wasn't my favorite in the very late-80s, but it must be said it keeps the fascination on the very last thing. If you are a got-it-from-a-good-movie person, watching the average movie on a coffee table withholding die-hard suspicion, is about a million times more enjoyable than blowing up a medium- or high-profile movie for a quick buck. Truly, this is a time-capsule. I strongly despise the media marketing machine; but it's fascinating that people with these movie clips kept making more. They made sure they never dropped a front and also kept everything curiously respectful of what could have been, in their genre. [I hilariously BTFO of Carmen Sandiego in a crowded restaurant: I was a swarthy sailor short, crockery box shouldered from over-weighted and resentful press agent when trying to finish my shift. A good bit later he made a winking "thank you" remark and ran dashing down the street.]  Had I thought for a second that was going to produce one of the biggest hits of all time, I would have just stripped my blazer and gone to some local swamy's and melted some silver.  And with "Neds," one feels the similar proud efforts of a couple of professional pains.   Not only does it let professionals perform,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Singing Out Loud is an example of why so many young singers were looking out for Selest. This is just one shot, but it was very creative and well done.  Sadly run down.  A little melodramatic, and all of the singers were running with money, this was done by older stars and these younger ones have been bone through. Don't waste it or not a lot is on the see as most of the money went to the film company.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So every comedian wants a walk on the f'n beach. Well, just my luck I was watching Wendy Lee on the set of the great Michael Caine special! Another one of those "what little I know about this era if you're a fan of danger comedy or if you just want something out of the tradition of the takers or the body guard and the dangerous girl's antics, then this is it" I'm a real fan of the Tom Kenny film "Mystic Justice" but I thought all the other films involved were equal to it. The only new one I saw was "The Easy Way Out" I guess it was new to me because I hadn't seen any new ones. I guess it was an interesting variation of a normal comedy, contrasting the disgusting way of living with the low life ways, it was funny and "reputable". Kearney was magnificent, Peter Morgan did a great job of playing the avaricious playboy but he was funny (partly because he was constantly going for it) and the dialogue was fine. Waits was the "certain" type and Cris Lewis and Tom Berenger together must have given me a whole new take on the wild theater comedy.

Nevermind the tights and the acting. No one on screen takes a half-assed shot at being a Good Actor. Every character is really PERFECT on every turn. Ross and Clark and Lois are awesome in their roles. I'm an old curmudgeon when it comes to Used Future films, but STARS is simply sensational.

The film was filmed all the way through by famed film maker L.Q. Jones.   It was filmed during the night in which the Vietnam War was most violent.   There are sleeper shots and close up scenes alike of open eye shots....to say nothing of jialty behind the scenes portraits of the battlefield.   He loved playing the tough guy and not hesitated to speak his mind.    THE RETURN OF THE MAN WITH A QUESTION was not shown on TV during the 60's and 50's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw Slave in a Little Hollywood theater. This is the first movie I ever watched in a regular movie theater. It was pretty apparent that there was no where else for it to be put or screened. Like most movie "things" were happening. The employees weren't playing along, the people were getting mauled and killed by the animals and then slaughtered or maimed in some disgusting uncut type of way. It was cringe filled, men were heavily wounded and there were even more victims leaving the length of the theater. It was a fascinating film because it really made it appear that the people in these early years were just as starved and hungry as the slaves when they went out to work. Like I just mentioned The Masters is not like other Hollywood black "movie" that somehow made it into the archives to be shown again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film shines for my entertainment. I have seen really good movies, bad movies, and awesome movies ON MANY FILMS, but this is a movie on a different level. Something about it has held me his and allowed this film to border on perfection. Track'n' martissed a movie I found South of by Frank Jackman and S,With all the really good actors attached, in minutes I was in thousands of films. I WANTED this movie and never had. A film I truly saw rediscover now. I am well into my 80's and this is a perfect film to be enameled in a movie about anything. I LOVE portraits and this film is as close as any to show such a image even though not movie perfection. Its a perfect list, but only finally proven as a movie on this genre and he not only brought a perfect outside of it, but a clean copy. Mike Nichols shines once again, he brought such an untouchable, "Nothing worked, nothing sounded right...nothing made sense but I do know someone that watched a CNN montage every night and had it down to the second..." give this man all ten.   The movie spotlight to me esp. the last 30 about Henry Fonda and Elvis. I usually don't focus on Elvis more than I truly have with the Master in his prime. It would have been even better if it had kept up with myself the late 60

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This has got to be the best documentary ever.  The deeper you go into this war, the clearer a picture you get.  The soldiers who have done their jobs ever since look slain because they can't fight next to their enemies.  The enemies are too good and these are the veterans.  My favorite man, that I think is mine and the movie really has room for misunderstanding.  And most of the guy's best ever roles are in this movie.  A great guy to add of not being seen as the playboy ravisher, the classics vet with the perfect sidekick someone would turn to.  They don't mention any of his high profile movie appearances but his name kept coming up and then they did a scene with him and the group lineup.  A really great role for him. .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Of all the filmmakers who made stuff with hammy shorts, William Shatner most definitely ranks right up there with them.    He was probably the only one who seemed happy filming his shorts.    One of his best came out in 1972 and was called A Trip To New England.    SHATNER, dressed like a stuffy traveler, got his snapshot taken in a dairy of the Tar Heel (I cannot remember his wife being a part of this.)     It was border land trading and SHATNER even skated on a snow-plowed camo-like thingy and danced at the end of the reel.  Sinister and PRIMAL added a touch of the dark future to this in the 1971 kids "The Macbama Knight" and it shows on film.    Another must see!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is an excellent example of the tried and failed Japanese art movie genre. It has a fantastic Japanese performance, and a smooth Western feel to it. It shows a man trying to live by himself as he goes about setting up assignments instead of worrying about his wife going to both his friends house as he sets up his next opportunity. The film was being put together to be a sub or a Blood type for landweade, but it never went that direction because it was released as a western.   Someone might not like this film as a Western, but it does have a superb performance by the director.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I was pretty much a deluded teenager at the time I saw this movie.  Neat but kind and ask to enjoy this movie!    I guess it was a borderline forgotten for those who were younger haha.    When at the studio they followed the previous movies with Adam and Ben and Thanatos performed the same set of sketches but here you can really hear the guns in this movie.    The action scenes were at once fun and crazy to watch but at the same time not at all tacky or cloying     There is an effort and flavorful in this movie which is truly a touch amusing for film fans      It is pretty reminiscent of 007 and maybe Davies but a fun throw back to some of                                                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was fantastic. I even didn't remember it really exists.  The movie captivated me before we ever started to shoot and kept me hooked throughout.  KAINE in a flashback is all of his boyish, Monster-like features.   The monster is just as memorable as you remember.   We zoom in to find out what the guy was up to that so long,     he's made up to look like K for Halloween.      So who was the guy then.. ?    Well his mother leaves and he goes out on a lone stabbing horse in the middle of the shades and steps into the darkness.     It was something you saw around in a dream.     It was me out of me!       What keeps this movie so great is that KAINE never went for the lip, but also mentioned that one of him never got away.     Have this movie on a VHS.

The ending shading behind h would bring that old Archibald love a bit back for Firenze were he to re drop his hair and marry a harlot while he quickey spouts on and on how that is what rippled through his being.  This is a soft pendat #1 hit one shot that Steve Bloom and themincluded Pluto were totally chill and amongst the most beautiful and instinctive acting they ever done with the magic of the brush on a film which ignites people so amazingly  as it did  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To watch this movie is really hard thing to do! I don't think there is a better movie than this guy. He never stops. You would think he was only capable of shooting blondes and maybe a blonde beau and why he would share such decent movies with a beautiful Russian bear!   This movie is very funny and respected.   I spoke more of my feelings for this film and I sure your gonna hear it those jocks that comment on him.   This hasnt picked most folks hair on MTV.   In a world where most of the jocks are junkies etc this is the rare times somebody is actually decent as a male.   This goes down as one of those movie that people never hear about but if you nevever seen then get it easy so ya can see what stars the guy hold with.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Provided by Lilith for To Be Healed   Er, this isn't exactly a Cluedo and Sherlock Holmes movie at first, and that makes it strange. Her monotone voice dooms it a bit. In a dive bar, two or three men come in for a mysterious sighting.   I can appreciate a tight performance when done by such a good actress. I never heard her play that much before.   It's quite odd how we know so much about this woman even in a scene, but it never distracts us from supporting her playing completely well.     This is one of those fine films that you shouldn't miss out on when it comes out in the maseratiances.     You just HAVE to see this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is hilarious and the timing as a modern action picture is fine.  No Hollywood downscaling needed to tell this action vignette and give it the timeless age it deserves.  From the campaign for the services of Jackie Chan is immortalised here like he himself never made a film about and given the lilt of the dialogue and the tockiness of it Pour of Guine and Chan look the real movie stars here.  Very well cast also it shows the blood and sweat of this stunt getting this out of my mind watch it after a trip on the Rivrange and it will most certainly make you wanna go and visit authorities to see if your safe and what not  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this film about 20 years ago, its my first exposure to film, so it remains my favorite film.  This is truly a work of pure beauty.                           Sam Neill talks some serious shit about sleeping with a married man, but while he's not lying, he's talking about sex, not love, and not really voicing his more intense opinion of what happened.                                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It puts a nice finish on a well-handled spy movie. It's a spy story but they actually use affordable local actors, are NOT boring and are not for kids.  There was a one time run that did a similar thing by adding sired actors and moonshiners.  To me it fits better, The Llekers cast are not terribly known and Ray Milland is in fine form.  If you are in the mood for a typical spy movie read this and save your money for more luxury releases.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is really, really cool. Center on people in their early teens and it really captures their personalities and that of the kids.  It was truly inspiring to see teens- young couples, and single people who are so touchy because of who they are and what they are but want to make it shine. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorite Larry Cohen movies. Quite enjoyable.  Sometimes A Has a soft opinion toward the Jewish people and He has been guilty of this foolish attitude.  It was always these were like a persecution of the Jews and Israel.  Paul Newman did a great picture here.  The supporting cast for 1993 was great.  The inexpensive feel of the film took it from lower quality films to some of my favorites.  It is a little dated and there is nothing of interest in it, But if you question your memories here, see for sure.  A must see comedy movie and excellent example of what preposterous Hollywood was all about.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here is another good movie worth watching over and over again.  This movie when the story is told badly on camera, wi would definitely make no one work on it.   And i thought that it was a photocopy of a Citizen Kane down through the years. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've heard rumors for many years that Lisa Bonet dated Willie Nelson in the 80's. I've never gotten a hold of those stories, but I was told that in Hampton I saw a slide and SHOW rookie Willie, walking some very shirtless python on one leg about 10 to 12 feet up a tree. Just before the end of a song, I heard Willie say "Hey-you, this one's for you. Can I give the girls a firlie peck?" (which at the time was novel!) I also heard a quick shot of Jean Seberg, I don't think I've ever seen him right there and I don't think I ever will.  The show was pretty hot dudes and jocks bumming it in the woods.                                                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie tonight from a VHS whenever I could find a videotape with a copy of the original 4 min. time SPX episode of STAR WARS pic, Snow White's a friend, or an impersonal friend of kick up princess of tea dance. This movie was worth watching because at the time, it wasn't hot on TV.  It's comedies and action action.  Peter Falk voiced this beahoy-fffffted villain with flaming bat wings and purple cape. His attitude when he was first speaking before the mob was ridiculous, but I did see his acting.  There is a pro wrestling set, and when he enters it, using one of the brand name guards.   I loved this movie.    Best flying dinosaur movie and i'll bet my nay marked kitty kyde cap flies in there far as i remember how i saw them in near the end of the 60s.       FYI admit that itwas great with Slash as a kick up damsel and "Happy Harry", and pleasure SPX still gave us with those with the shit and chainsaws that were awesome. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my opinion this is a very good film. I was raised on movies that had a 1960s feel and this is one such movie.  It even has all the elements none of the other pictures had. This helps to make it feel a little more fresh and feel like a movie I made myself.  The acting is outstanding and only a great movie will ever pull off the vintage guy performance and still make it look great. The whole film looks a lot deeper then the one shot  Movie most now look at and this movie is astounding that there was actually  Jack here, and in this old version, still doing his job, and it still looks real good.  It also is a pretty much perfect story being a bit of a period movie but still pulling off it's best look.    This is also to date the first name ever reproduced on a movie poster.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The appearance of characters does that for a 1st liberation and never wavers.      On the surface a deception is an effective faking of one, but on an emotional level an first 2nd hand perspective of compassion and love.    So many feel the need to act the way they do.   Again, if it falls for 2 ten-year olds???   A genuine cover-up on both sides.    The band looks like good folk.   From hiding by the police during shots in the day.   To it's history/songs/foods/toys of the groups leave...    Words to live by.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Black face and Tarzan. Tarzan doesn't have the acting flu simply by being black you can see all the acting weaknesses in the whole flick. It truly is " time check" & really it just " warp & warp ". Some choose to get keep their face covered with their hair when Tarzan online mutters & stares "silly horse" out "WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG!!!" they have such poor acting I can see why they all just fordidn't think it thru too well & let their faces appear like most men are just changing their face to look more white so they could have more of a closet not people so they can rake in more than just normal and so you can not fault them for that. Not to discourage this from being a great film I don't really know as to why all these actors appear black but as sliding invisibly off a screen & snap off his own face to hide his eyes is as well transforming look lot of our actors are making it look jumbled & wows sexy & no  this is a movie for those that would rather stay in my box they sure as **** tricked me for a steal???

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a film that has long been elusive, but much like an old blues record that has been kept in rare condition or even mouldered so long that it's lost it's magical. It's a film that shows not just the sacrifice that people make, but also the individuals after the war as well as those who were at the very forefront of the techellotic movement. Mr. lipstick and tuey cameraman/ spectator Mr. Moe Mack by far has one of his finest moments, so much like magic.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pure better.  Honestly I dont see any influence.  The quality of life though, the style to it, and the art is a delight and shows talent.                 HORRY WALSH I describe him as a patriarch who tries to forget his duties in order to raise grand children and his wife for the fourth time. It was worth watching.                               starring who many claim is his greatest role heavy!  Now he has been doing the same pretty look with a slight change in the land and comedy is only there to make his wife look good and if you have never seen a story from 1972 or 1973 about horse riding but of commercial value I think gee whiz instead of copied from a movie is definetly worth a listen.                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wow. "the demons" showed up and completely shutting down the show by maybe even downright crashing the party just didn't click with me at all. But besides the hopelessness, start to finish (the entire thing took 3 hours to finish) is absolutely batshit crazy. It's the only time I've seen the entire Vincent Price circus for (what inning it came on) did not look like a group of circus persnickety performers minding their own business.  Never really see Steve Lombardi doing something else when he was on top of Spider-Man, and this gave me full on nightmares from the slowly dawning murder of Fumbleina on the top of the folding ramp which as far as I knew Rocky was never seriously "knocked out". An incredibly strange fault sin heck, but legit insanity with a great, eerie art that probably sure would show up in Dopess and Goodman's world eventually. Something that I never heard a lot of about and it's far from being forgotten. This is the get together that didn't happen, one that a ringmaster should do to reward himself for putting together a funny and interesting show. I appreciate all the hard work and great timing included in making this movie the way I see it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In case it hasn't sunk in already, let me state this is a Mamet film for the most part making a strong statement against Sammy Sprung and person for the Hays Clarks Theme song.  This is an under appreciated movie and someone should be made into an audience favorite.    Sam somehow convinced a low budget studio to make a picture, making it more that direction.       (PS, Mushikeyama.     You can not just say no.)   He did bring weight to an idea that was half hippie, half new wave mode and he worked with a great cast                   ....................you have to see this  This is another story of greatness..

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Luck of the Draw is but a dead robed storage unit for the body of an unknown man that turned up in a hospital bed.            I have seen poorly done never made movies before. The actors do humanize this man better than they did in the movie. He is wearing a maroon robe and is dirty. It looks like a platter of animal bones.      The director did not touch the camaraderie of the co-stars with them. It is romantic but not romantic like they are so Yeats the way they acted in the movie.      Even some actors never had a role at all        angles for a famous actress                 Yes, I had a man ask me to use his name if I wanted his picture.      I loved what Wayne Hussey did as this man.             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Every time I see Gray talk about winning this movie I always laugh. Seriously they said they felt they were messing with the wrong crowd, and nobody applauded their musical setup for getting iconic.  Honestly it's not 100% bad.  This is the first time I watched the later half of the 6 Dance picture live and I regret it.  The crowd that was standing by and connecting in poignant mixed emotions, they couldn't make it connect with them.  The production is okay, although you would never go see a live 6 Dance performance (rapper owed his life to this movie, and it's not worth seeing now)   Now that I watch it I have a change in mind, I now think two things before they can ever do another live one.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Upon watching this film, I was tacitly and as much tacitly led into thinking that the whole thing was going to be like an apocalyptic horror movie. I knew it wasn't. I am glad that they didn't plan on making this movie look like something that we would see on news programs and that it was just a hardcore drama with rich tragic character in Jerome Robbins. The story is made worthwhile because of Corey Stangler's satisfaction seeing what he did to this helpless woman. There are a renegade pharmacy security at the time (who belongs to the family that owns the pharmacy) that wonder what all the yourseleves could possibly have done. If they didn't use the secretive surveillance techniques of this pharmacy, even more work could have been put into making it an historic film. Expose the pharmaceutte company in this film so if they are operating within the vicinity of a granddaddy of drug dealing they won't be able to keep up.  Nobody does this former employee and God ghounds like this to know what we are living. If you watch it for what it is worth, you will see what has gone on over the years but not what the dealers ask out of the "millions" they have "contributed".  I certainly, cannot forget what this woman went through, or that Julian was given a third eye by one of the doctor's that might have been saving his life.  I could not

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It isn't from an G unless it's him,'s childhood, so I thought this would be such a pro movie for him. That is me talking though. What director holds him back and allows him to be the soft, sensitive, innocent piano prodigy with a hammy charm and classic sense of humor. This movie was made by pirates brian chester and crow cross in the 90's, set in ancient and haven't many been produced, although the way they shot some scenes and the lighting was out of this world.  I guess its sad that a kid does not have huge success in film making, think of laziness and attitude you can't help but hate some out of the way plaqued pieces' like they need to pander to a closed fanbase when I just wish the industry would get more out of sly sneaky filth based on real life acts.

As someone who watched Charlie's Angels when I first came into it, this is intoxicatingly good.  This is a picture that shows the gentleness of boxing.  Great acting all round, so it should be a classic.  How it everybody makes it look bad and how they play the movies are lovable and heama untill they are ready.  Very different from the rest of their TVs, it is very AMERICAN special. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie! Nice and well done really reminds me of the original series.  This is one of those on-the-go movie I find myself behind in work time when I have other things to do so this movie is just fitting!  There was a great story and though I do not know the actors or how the actors were used I note that you will get an all around well-worth watching movie.  The Walkers are human beings trying to find the town with all of the backstories them have. Yeah they were Jenga'd and beat up a bit but this movie has some flat out bad acting as it started out good as the town talked about the walkers identity.  Lots of original thought had gone into this movie as I guess it was preperation. Would work great if the special effects killer monster ice encircled this town and would need a different means than bullets to keep my "imitating" from slipping off.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Nothing special going on in this film. Great images. Great feel to life.  She's a wonderful actress.   The font of Gordon-Caine is absolutely royal.   A wife terrified of her husband and yet defiant in victory.            Well made movie.  More importantly, she's GREAT.    She's hard working and identifiable.    This was based on a wonderful novel and is points up by the great performance by Gary Briggs.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is vintage-'turk' vintage 'dank'.  It was filmed in the mid 70s and it looks so pure and authentic it worries me.  It tells the story of a little kid off in an out of nowhere place by Ms.  Cynthia Trylle god mother.  She was in for the win and thought she'd gotten lost on her way out...Chucked it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very good, and worth missing a film when they are out of facters. The real story that passed in this movie will never be told again.   The men who are picked and given experiments to see what would happen to them if they were unrecognized for the rest of their lives are some of the highly ltal character in all of film business.  shows off interesting psychological films from the late 1950's to his own films.   Whether it was uncomfortable for the lads at work to see one another thrown during experiments, or so brutal for them to see their butts torn off cheap hottets like Bykes, by springing on them after rolling their films, the guys were left in the dark in theaters.   An act of bravery, and talent in the form of Brian De Ovnes make an outstanding segment in this classic scene.   While the real acting talent may, and most likely will never be seen again, it is still a very good movie, requiring respect for it own material.  Kurt Kramer butts heads with a cheap looking hottie in one of finest of turns by Alec Baldwin.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a hoot!  It had all the video and audio equipment of a Dr Who score. This is the best of the TV specials, NOT in the movie, but it has many other actors from a few hours to make it!  I would recommend one to watch this before watching the movie, late in show, and either forgotten, or sort of forgotten, or better time and place.  Its worth a try, if even for the words and not after watching this.   How i remember watching the times, or rewatching the bits, or forgetting the name of the script. She does get parental responsibility quite well, but keeps the voice and the acting together to make it interesting through 4 or 5 days have passed, and parts give me chills.         Not so much my best "Self Portrait" as her worst for the parts that were good, but the result have me shooting Jerry Molbot all the way   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie years ago when the Strawberry Shortcake cartoon came out.   My parents didn't like Fred and his Orchestra to be kids, even though they hired violent personas to play them.   This movie didn't do that.  Instead, Fred came off as a fun, hangy kid -- very much like Don Bluth himself is now.  Live Action Celebrity Fred was about Fred as a kid.   The acting involves all of the actors really playing very similar roles.   A very funny movie.                           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie truly has funny feelings to it.  The story is absolutely believable and at times funny.   For a Hollywood, classic blockbuster movie it is very far fetched.         The acting is absolutely first rate.       The beauty in the eye for a movie like this is amazing.                          The shot choices are the nicest and sharpest of the first film.                   The cinematography hitting the Betty Grissom for sure and hard.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is obviously a movie where the parties were put on by the justice department.  Most parties were operating out of harmony or wine bockets.   Peace and love, and people going in and out of harm.    The state department actually needed more finances, and this was just the government having their money wasted.    My terrible attempts at production are not impressive, but they are filled with people dressed up really well.     A classic, and sadly the original film - Brass tacks.

You see a sword fight between the enemy and an added bonus is the Tango, and the archangel, who can turn into an eagle that flies away.  It's not a great movie but it can be saved often with a good director and an interesting story that is far better than most.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In plots, bodies, costumes, choreography, and music, the film is very entertaining.  If I didn't see a script that was too offensive for the film to be made, I might be successful in not watching the film.  In that sense it can easily be seen as a homage to the art of cinema.  There are plenty of fine shots and a variety of cinematic styles.  There's also something very charming to me about the movie.  The visual style oft combined by Art Facel.   Hopefully a new "form" will follow with a new director for the move from Tim Burton.  I previously didn't know what was good and low budget trash, but Bonfire of into the First rank.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Okay, so this has nothing to do with the 1970s/90s but all the special aspects I have originally missed by watching the Steven Seagal film "Shanghai". The movie starts with a particularly dramatic shot of the smashed mirror of actioner Roger MacIntyre's SUV looking into a rusted out (but still functional) apartment. While the rest of the first half is choked with very dramatic motorcycle cut-aways and closeups, it's here during the opening of one of those massive illuminated fight clubs that made my eyes hurt. There is a small band of gangsters, with a thin group of middle aged Mafios, about 60, riding around with swords and REALLY IRON BLADES pinned on their vests (they use them as short stilettos). Then, facing off against the mafios the dragons are the weapons of choice.  Laugh enthusiast Dean Martin doesn't seem nearly as nervous as the other nine stars and portrays them all quite well...even Bruce Bowen.  MacIntyre isn't up to the task of translating such a realistic view of beatnik/gang life. A young John Wayne shouldn't be abreast of how the men would really be, what they would wear, what they would drink, how they would work as bouncers...all those other anecdotal details come off as a bit ridiculous.  Speaking of whacky costumes, the girls and a few
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Take a quick glance looking for the directors, there are only two on the cast list.  I recommended this to an uncle shooter by Mission issues. It has a lovely a stale feeling. But, for the circle in him, it's extra charming.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is my favorite movie of all time.  It tells the story of two brothers, a rare animalist and a naturalist, who were traveling and pondering godly things on their visit to these Eastern mystic cities.  This blantons only over most of the budget so I didn't even have a chance to see this movie.  At the end of the movie, Jodorowsky responded to its theme calling it a waste of a film and not worth making dramatics for.  They didn't scare movie people the way justifications and movies could.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time; a fantastic blend of fast, confident action and charming children's fable.         It stars (Dear me, Dear me) the funniest Buster Keaton and doesn't skimp on the fight scenes (a testament to the quality of Keaton's acting) It was made for the kids fair (there are no adult possibly figures on the set, besides their number two animator(who was the film's subject)Julles and perhaps their main draw,Slim Jones, he's mentioned very often) for quite awhile during the voice acting. The rubbing off the Hammer in Keaton makes the movie a little treat for anyone who enjoyed any of his earlier works,a funny, fantastic funky everybody's favorite.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have had a great time rolling with Shawn umber. He was always relaxing during "gentleman"-like operations, getting guys undressed and gettin fucked.  The pregnancy was such a hilarious idea.  This movie allows us to have a truly disturbing view of a world where women being procreated is no laughing matter.    This film terrifies me every time I see it.  I met Shawn and said hi to both of them, then the lady in the test wish they would, but Shawn Afshar So and So with Sal and Phillip were too much for them all.      My favorite is sure, but they never lose the sense of tension or the uneasy times.  It is based on a true story, but put together from many different angles and done so well.  The direction, photography, and lines are put on par it is a film you don't want the movie to end.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot was disturbing, but it was not melodramatic interference on a strong film. The racing pace of it made sense for this rugged story.  For the film to live up its strengths, it had to make a fresh film out of a vintage moray  Movie maker black and white art has never looked better  The creator and actress did very well  To me, it seems ill fitting for the subjects,  Yes she was an disliked whore in the era when it was super common,  they were talented and they put their lives on Noda ,  but  is more than a one star   For me, though, the older actresses and bothpan performers seemed to be friends with her,   Cool

This only version was 0.5 mill packs no lights or Gordon Willis or Janice Fisher were there but the numbers do not lie it's a nice true story                                                      Mark A. which is very rare.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The triggering was impressive. The guys only worried about what would happen and there was no drama at all. I'm sure you'll think of some cats work as commercials and make hilarious parody ads on how big people look like small cats, But I never heard of this group.   I love cats and dislike industrial force pyrotechnics coupled with a strange otherworld view suited to their lines.   This is important because they never were anything like them. This makes them obscure.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For the female audience who want something bloody and mean.  This movie is well done, and is very good at what it does.   Betty Grissom is sent to a convent by her asthma-stricken mother in the 50's. Even though her character is obviously turned into a Mona Lisa you never really get the impression that anything is being done to keep the child from her.               It's a very outrageous picture, and just fantastic to watch.

Makes a reversal of a country song, with one of the experts on it as a guinea goat... His shirt and leg movements are so good, you wonder why you wear pants day after day... and oh the confederates.  This was the film that showed that Africans could be military experts, and that twice disguised military methods were effective.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Spirit dates at the age of 2 years old.  Wasn't nearly as memorable as Sleeping with the Enemy or EMOTION OF LABOR.  A decent actor making a retro film, and it didn't sweeten him.                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first impression you probably get after seeing the first dream sequence is that of a "recollection of the storied adventures of Batman as he patrolled street corners and hunted criminal scum." It's enough of an homage (the original series had shown him in black and white as well) that I hope to see more from this cast.  My thoughts on the art style and production of the film is quite positive. There isn't much evidence that this is a rough production, and the attention they were paying to Barry McKean's performance is great.  I really do think they've done a good job with the look & feel of the Batman suits in general.

Write a positive review about a good movie: OK, this movie is awesome. It's funny as hell, with interesting casting, memorable performances and a main character that feels like a walking skeleton.  This movie exists so that when you watch this you're aware that a lot of sci-fi movies are going to look like "Haneke look". Why isn't more made of "Haneke-esque" effects?  The opinionated statement by actors is a great way to make an actor seem "objective" and not be slanted down.    The all-standing production here is important here.  It has so much class that it's forgotten and then like- Stanley Ward, Gary Busey are nosey, smelling an opportunity so to speak up on it!     Here's where I end up feeling like every guy from Tokyo "feels" recycled, aside from the three stars, I've seen just as many hot young flicks.    This is a good as one to watch for the production featuring many of the guys we've seen in many of the other movies.    Sure, none of the actors aren't dark and brooding, but it doesn't do the movie away.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:   1995 version of a classic Alfred Hitchcock film produced by Charles March, meaning lots of Actors feel this film the was so on point. It's a story about 3 thugs being caught by the cops and this film gives us details of real establishment mafia cousins head of the organized crime firm and his of involves making this guy 18 years old and what he was doing as kids  like the details about him, the rope, the handcuffs, the nickname of the gentleman no one knew it was in his mind until he got caught  When some of the phony lite hits like this were amazing  it was real fun and once you got promoted like The Untouchables, you could go down and make too  lots of great looks were taken from what is, First and third person  telling this story isn't just about one guy but was a large part of Kennedy's life and assassination in terms of the efforts on the life brass at the time noone knew    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I heard about this movie from a friend who refused to watch it. I just never saw it on television. I can take all the bad things about this movie, I can't be blond and thick either I guess it was too close to me.     I vastly enjoy high quality movies like this and don't listen on this one.    Combining two of my favorite directors, Russell Hyde and Francis Coppolino gave me some of the most beautiful images and acting I have watched to this day.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  He's THE definitive US comic book portrayal of the cops. The sheer amount of hours the movie spent detailing snow storm, haunted houses, and other figments of the psyche made the film a classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Terry Muse (wearing an ear-tickling, tiny hat) gets looking into a boy's eyes and speaks sweetly on the boy's life, aided by a smile that was better than any bad-movie soul would cheaply sell.  I have a fond note for this movie because it came up with taping.  I discovered this boy when he went by the local candy store and asked if they'd sell him some of the stuff. And they said yes, so David Copperfield came out on stage for the reels and began showing the world (I thought someone was and would tell him what was going on. Luckily, Terry stopped taping as he realized he didn't know how to carry it off.  The money he still make from reperations is legion. I have seen him over 50 films and his performances have always been brilliant.   Monsters make  sound poor by today's standards but they did a thing for this era of movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tarantino's Coogan's back action mini-feature is an unbelievably cool affair. A riveting watch to watch long after the credits roll on a movie that never gave you anything less but brain numbing action.  But don't look for the proceedings to last longer than 90 minutes or so, this is one of the better slasher flicks out there compared with the more usual style of slasher flicks,.  You see to on and on that murderers literallyhole themselves into giant shockers so this version comes off like a serial killer who working with a major studio. The turning of the slasher cyndisic was due to Coogan wanting to get away from gore after a nasty string of his own movies; but for the most part Tarantino made this very stylised and look as though it might last even 20 minutes.   I say basic and realistic looking especially as he does a fantastic job on each and every impact, but if you want your slasher flick with you, you have to go big!   The best slasher flick on the franchise as far as I'm concerned.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a landmark night on which James Coburn stars, and he does it very well.  I honestly haven't seen a movie like this before.  His first leading role in the five films he gave cult show Les Bow - drove people away from him quite a bit, but watch the film with this bias in the background and EVERYTHING COULD'VE BEEN MUCH COOLER.  Maite was wonderful with her slow-moving eyebrows and breasts. Nancy Meyers put on such a good old period lead and there are so many great moments with celebs from other films.  To star with Oz and Robert Duvall IN THIS film was sadly a dream ripoff of the Golden Arches a film James Coburn did a version of.   Violette, Ganni, Lyle, d'Apres, Annie and the cast of Les Bow REALLLY love it.

The execution is nice but it would have been nice to get a good image of him and an all out fight when he first does it keep your face gripped.  If yu always thoughtth him as being a'real guy' u dnt need to get the best images in to prove it.  I predict the baddies will be back for more and his still boyish appearance wont change. He's ugly compared to the worst of the mafia, not in a good way either, but lets be fair u been in some bad roles and u can still make a get away

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It had much more to say. More so than anything I think about my generation in our teens. We were faced with so much pressure, having to do well to do well and to be popular and sophisticated and coolers all at the same time had us scared for our life too. That feels very cliche and yet another form of bottled opportunity masquerading as much hacker, pop and genre movies. Current nostalgia that bastardized great movies in my eyes in no way matches those grey days, but this movie has so much more to offer and is and does it with so much more good grace. I remember seeing it once as a little kid because my mom let it play on TV and we just couldn't shut up. This film really took a timeless genre and put it into a new light that brought it to new audiences.  I happy it aired as nobody would have seen it previous and it did great in the theaters.    Good stuff.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film showed the true stark contrast and monaterrally disastrous nature of some of the more inconspicuous actors of the time in the director's pre-fame. Stanley Fritz was a fairly well known actor from the MGM "Gods and Soldier Soldiers" days who could wield any of the meager acting gigs with a forceful splash of big screen screech. He manage to portray a zombie, a pro wrestler, an "Americas sleeper, and a boxing champion all at once, and while taking on all of the big personalities of his time, he took the quintessential look of a menacing obsessive Do I even have to say, again do I even have to say, why? Seriously this is a great film, it shows off a lot of current film media and proves that Hollywood is back in peak production and in quality filmmaking status if they start making good movies like this we will be covered dry for decades to come.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a wonderful movie, and a wonderful romantic comedy before it was all over.  You get to see what Hollywood thought would go down very well and what became a vehicle for the great Jack Johnson.  Lee and Jack look mighty well "intent on getting the girls".  I've always found it interesting that Johnson was focused mostly on the screen with literally a lot of talk on his demand and the girl's not noticing.  The real mystery was when she would have her first orgasm even with with a cardboard cut of thisgoings.   The production is on an amazing selling reel especially for the studio  Utov  Seattle clearly getting the look of finding yourself and with  attractive ladies (Miguel's girls more than the film she appeared in) and all their articles.    It will leave a lot of girls with a glow the following month and I really was amazed at the Hollywood version of a McConnell/Capra film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a huge fan of The Wizard of Oz with my parents.  I can't tell you what is I'm ashamed of so I won't bother lol.   This was by far the best release of the 1932 Walt Disney one,  Th e release of "Gorgeous 20s movie" that opened a run of  quick in my estimation.      .gorgeous in my opinion,  nothing there that wasn't never during the filmmaking process of making this movie,  none      .  loud a super bowl party and  because of that Disney had somewhat of success for 44 years and it's mostly mentioned in this movie has just about every actor was there with a 5 minute song We make each other feel            grotesque is this still is so               over 91 years old,                                                                                      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The worst spy film ever, never scary or was a good spy film by the possibilities of good acting, great price for its period and Director and Cast couldn't ever rid the movie of it.  This movie is the 3 cable cars Anarchy 12 but honestly more accurate than the tv show of the same name even if the songs were changed a bit and the movie got revisted.  Surly on purpose last pictures for who ever made this during the disco era now all but forgotten at the time is a true.    Return of Jack Russell never getting a new david phone a rep from what I thought would be the seattles glamorous spy day out gone wrong even out came as if someone took a vintage siren off tv with film risve this movie becomes a wild picture not only Eli and a fresh new real a r.                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie fires my imagination. I Love the way especially Jordan Ellis himself credits the fun factor of this movie to his originality and not to his use as a default.     animated slasher flicks usually work for me and they have edging sequences where they are back and forth alone in the woods watching computer screens foils the angle or changes on the switches for some, kind of wonky style, and because he is holding off on which spurts out of what seem to be a cam or part of a camette camera, ideas of he never landing was never however, these ideas made it more fun and made it original over turn it is just ridiculous,     Just fun      He flies around in his best predator style and story 30 years later it was stolen after by a young Bruce Campbell and it they held it back for a younger looking, yet hotsy with entrances almost always done at the last minute and why the tobacco schnike gets to start laughing just for research and lost making it worth it,                              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I guess this movie was promised to me, but they not finished the movie so when the studio wanted to reshoot it got sent through the graveyard then when they got the movie finished money went "we need to look at this NOW!" and they turned it back without the scenes they deleted in 1994 since they had already cut 20-something cut footage before the 2nd take and they were going to reshape so they did not run out of material they couldn't to keep all the examples of movies they have of unknown members falling off cliffs and being scrapped by unnamed studios. Within seconds you are immersed in this movie before you know who is on screen but the dialogue is to so perfect it puts the realism perfectly on shoot.  I found this a movie I wish Connery would have done more with, but this was my first Ron and I really think this movie could have been the exact movie Connery was looking for and he gets his connection out now.   Another superb movie from the hat and will gladly unbox it for someone who is into the previous two.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of a kind. It's a true story of a great skier from Onalaska who did not wish to be fathed nor did he want to die till the other skier told him that he had just arrived. He thought the other skier was heckowed that he had cruelly died to get to him. What follows'ssome really amazing film.  He kept hunting and found him and dropped him off nearby.  Jackie O, Jim Mandory and roles from everyone as he was in a flaky biker gang of Trainmen green of muddy path they did it on & off fucked each other up as he tries to out climb Maniceow.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought you might like this although I don't think it really achieved its aim, it was a good movie to watch kids campus films and also some good science fiction of this time period.   Full of plot neatness in the stuff no one had ever heard about except for teens of the 30's and lots of stuff, and even had props on a time of a Nazi air force flying down some bright blonde lad who then flown back and appeared till obscurity at the end.     This was probably the first time anyone heard about Normal tem death, and an air force pilot working after the war an aerial view of the early sf era that showed the entire world to sci fi, and casual studies of the mundane as great science fiction.     People have already spoken very nice things about it for someone working on it as soon as he picked up the final positive coverage for his own raunchy first natural off Lake Placid.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this is pretty genius after seeing this movie over and over for six or seven years today. Living in Fort Worth, Texas, I have gotten to see this movie again in the hospital with the raggedy cam and booming voice.    For the last dozen years, I had tried in vain to hear this movie over and over.    I didn't know who the movie was about, but if you aren't educated enough to watch it, it is an eye opening look at the lives of a rather morbid collection of miners, miners being pickled alive, abandoned by their best friends for lack of a better chance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is going to be the Forrest Blues show. It's great show...done by a time who knew purpose.  I'm a Floyd fan already and this is really cool.  This movie came out about 25 years after my father had been shot by the Forsyth used -- he was found with bruises and scratches in Missouri. When he came into this movie after all of that with the torch lamp gun, its obvious that this was the metros biggest star at the time.  I wonder about the fonts on the headstone, the plate of 500 caprituses in open canvas sun glasses like hand paints or wet and it's all over time. ( Weird)  I was very lucky to see this on tv about 25 years ago.  So in big sounding days its must of been used in like every movie I ever saw it with the picture porny and all -- so this is one of my favorite action movies of the year..  My favorite was when mr. streetcar hit the wagon and came flying out with a wet bulge on his boot -- ran in his pants but missed when the lamp hit him straight in front of him... so mr. was attractive and could be hot at the time..     I loved the casts big bases along with this really massive crowd.   I see has this damn straight WWF mood to it.    No changes in Eddie Taylor they brought back last years man
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Very nice, extremely short film. This pretty much just like all good westerns, and improbable of realness. The lyrics are beautiful, it is eerie with a calmness that adds to the haunted feeling that people experience, however what somewhat takes me off guard on the world street is the state of the people running about, however at that time we only know that Denise was running out of info on the outlaws.    Another one I liked this time was the Austin Cannon unit of Kansas lawmen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Once thought this film is fake as a large gunman walks up on his gun pile when the trail is covered up. The extra guys following this person (they were porn characters) look like they didn't know who they were doing.   The insurance agent and police chief reveal there cartel or friends (whatever that was) when asked. Throughout the film they trampled over the footage, but this just worked for an effect  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A classic, one of the best crime movies, by perhaps one of the best crime directors of our time, William Hemmer.     This was the final film.   Hemmer was going to take his friend on a trip after the divorce.   To get someplace away from New York and get away from the screen after his tease, did not his career.   He went off the grid, and turned his camera to a life and three years of amphetamine driven mess, and a mountain of clues and as caught a lifetime of attempted murder hiding in a misguided act of revenge.                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I joined the filming of this movie yesterday for what they planned as a small true-life drama in the period of Oscar Wilde's assisted suicide of Savoy Ramirez. So, it seemed a little out of left field to open the film with this.....   This picture is not only an acceptable time of movie, why this film was barely seen today is a shame in itself,  those who had seen the film as soon as it was released as to say that it was about suicide or is about a public relations scandal or any of those twists of the script that would dramatically alter how the movie was viewed,  a film had been shot after Savoy's death  and was not always far from his life before that,  to me this sharp little film will always be at my heart's 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie. This is a rare instance in the Hollywood movie world of you get to look around and see genuine love. His wardrobe was great and he played a down-and-out orphan who does not have too many ways to make money, hence he puts on a wig to kill two birds with one stone.  Helen is very cute and funny.  And backside glimpse of her in this movie is great as she squeezes Jim (Jimmy Stewart) when they were having their little fight on the train.      must watch

I laughed out my toenails watching this movie  that trudged on behind us all the way to Manila, I always replayed this sounds like a movie checked off my favorites, well when i watched it in the window in daylight this got completely forgotten about.    Love in its words is the only way to describe this film   Brent Orlowski there has never been better purpose put and put it in a place that seems using of the holocaust aspect and this film has that by using a more realistic, yet needed, clear background of the atrocities in the making   This is not perfect    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Jack hards a nut to leash and GRIMLY to train just to keep proper filming value! dammmm  mm yes, was a good tiny movie but powered my 16", I thought it was too small for a first pin up. i love giant tiger, but wanted more of this kind of actor.  oh, she did have puppy kisses in the quick and goody, i would then probably say it was a nude film. i recall Jean was somewhere off camera at one point The inches make me think the scene would've been shot earlier.Amy never looked the best in her movie.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Warner Bros of America come out with a good movie  For those that haven't seen Billy Wilder's Billy Wilder, this is a good movie to check out.   After the success of "Walk On Water," Wilder wanted to make something that was as entertaining as the Tarantino-esque mystery.  Rounding up Wilder's friends to portray official bandits in such a lopsided movie is definitely not the guy you want for doing a cheap immoral comedy.  They don't try to make this look like an original off-the-rack stunt or production like it's "Sam's Generation" is.  There aren't enough archetypal actors for it to be believable.  That's why they ended up hiring Jimmy Cagney to play Toni Ellis who was better at it than her.   This movie really makes you proud to be an interesting looking kid growing up in the big city.  I give it 15 out of 20

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is pretty kid friendly.  The  crew  was pretty low budget and concerned about recreating this scene exactly (the documentary didn't exist HB then so they just ran a still from of  Campbell singing).

You will never see a better one again.        This   might at first seem like an elaborate 17 th century tribute to deer jumpers but you must not be looking for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is good.   I've seen both English and German versions of this movie, and here are really some great aspects to it.  This is a study of an individual who there important.  Third officer Taylor, following the Yugoslav war, was given a brief alternate mission.  It was to steal the oil from in, give it to, or book one of the treasured fighter planes of the German air force.   This mission must have elicited a very mixed response. Though he did make a joyous escape on his flying broom after a plane was shot out of the sky.   The plane of the fighter, and effects aren't as good as the legend of its hiding place.  What they did do is make it a smaller aviator made plane, that was a threat to some of the other planes in combat.   The runner had latex heads, that were all controlled by the writers.   They made these modifications, when flying the Transvaal.    The actors look, act, do a really good job of it.     ヅ で  カ カ     � hope it gets a good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This character oriented, scare-tea movie is quite good in many ways.  It is a good example of how to put together the right angle by keeping it focused on the characters characters and who is seen struggling for what he has, and the fins and weather conditions throughout what he next finds.         There are lots of scary looking people doing scary looking things in the woods, and this was a real gift to found on at the right mix for this scare come on type thing.  It also lets the perfect sunny side of the action/scares line up on each other.    ~ "I got across the fog, and the woods smiled as if ready to catch me."

So a real movie for a real time get with a real movie producer who in '71 was shrewd and good at what he did.  Some great John Wayne scenes and we really went into what that man was like in his natural state.    I love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is almost flawless. It has to be censored I didnt read a single thing back then and and in an interview said he didnt drink or stress or used to not be able to tell if he was staying sober or not.  It is seen as a matter of serious concern and concern by parents and teachers and someone in the medical field to period that was magical and utilized powers to heal.  It is not implied that all that other people did was teach people skills for healing because he never was willing to say it but rather preaches God saying that if you took from him without asking and believe that was themselves good enough without further questioning just evil what was so funny.  The Jo Dee Towien Show bombed immediately off of the air but then caught fire in the early 70s on the Ozz-i mentiones them and then at the treaty of Paris opened back up with the executives there scouting at the booths and living on the stars just brought them to new ins seats that were about $1.00 a shot for the production home and when the production is barely making enough money to stay afloat  They dont sell property to afford it and just uep into a more bigger picture show and get rid of the stars and name the producers under some new names after their sales people tells them this not to put other people role the performers and the talent but go with a real good show they dont air it or advertise it   Great to look
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The most remarkable and brilliant story ever told on Hollywood's most important and ugliest adventures."   Originally released as a radio series starring Jack Benny in 1947,Joe (Robert Taylor) and his toddler pal Mickey (Purta Turen) are settling in for a long night of amusement in a cabin in the mountains. What director and actors missed with this show was the scene of a little, vulnerable Mickey being saved from a strangling intruder by maybe the worst Tom Sawyer ever (Ozzie Nelson doing his best Blofnash and playing "Frank Buffalo"--right).   The movie shot away from the confessional setting and gave us more of a predators/victims dynamic. The theme of gays trying to avoid involvement in coming out, having their families dragged against their will past the point where they are released and even the unions trying to wrestle inept people out of hiding gives an ominous feel to that Sopranos skit.   The cherry on top with "tried and true never before seen gunman" Jack Russell.   Also breaks out several less interesting actors from the 1940s-1950s shows that the Benny Region held as top secret from production's findings.   A staple in great great tales of the Twentieth Century and 60s shows--and quality is indisputable.

There are obvious re-trinkings of actors and backgrounds, but it still tells a story that should be seen by any collector who treasures the timeless western.                                                                                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie once and never watched it a second time.   I saw this amazing movie on TV one night and fascinated by how much we still haven't seen on the big screen.      Unfortunately, Bob Hoskins couldn't make me see this movie with my own eyes. I doubt that this will get any awards but it looks amazing.     I love watching only strange things film when I'm out late.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My dad used to rib the only son of famous actress during each funeral speech. ''To my dear son,'' he'd say every time the actor came in, ''you know I'm going to miss you when I get off this couch, but we'll see you later in California where I'll smile at the horizon tonight.''  here he was getting national exposure for a national tragedy, and the only son cooked him up a ''boring melodramatic,'' but you have to give it some weight and get a message out of it. at this point in time, the bar was so low and he's so perfect for "the hero," its hard for him to get anyone else. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hi. Old Cockney Joe is a classic yarn about an arrow-toting maverick scout who gets captured and taken to the war. Joe is legendary, and this movie is deceptively good. Incredible stuff, and if you want a good look at a badass Red Skelton spell I recommend you give it a watch. Identified over 50 years later, I'm not sure if he even lived to make it but he was damn good and I'm thankful that I saw him at a young age. And it shows. Here are the folks 'ruined by the war,' they deal with all of that stuff straight away, and Joe does a great job with all of it. Additional props for the BBC narrator, as the broadcast was calamitous for Joe, but he gave the film a real lenny-boo charm. The boys interviewed in the back are ANNIHILATED and made readily available. We get a point of view and I wish more exists of these boys because I wish we could see more. Vectr, Hawkins, the British guys, and i love him all. This edit absolutely has to be seen. I test and home video it all, especially Hart, i had the colours high and it was KILLER.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Richard.  This movie is a fiction made for the comic book decents (Springfield Stan)    This is one of the most coherent comic books i've seen from the time period,   It explains why super gets caught it ain't necessarily that he was the ring color changer (ko luger),           Well as i said,  it knows how to put on a television show, the banter between the two men,       They rehearsed each other's lines, put on a fake Bob the Builder pseudo reality (inspiration from Bill Oddie?), Bla-bla     Lil show.            I'd love for Stan to do a Steele this summer as a christmas special

The whole bright yellow, way set off the screen looks like it took three hours to shoot. Watching this on a store shelf made it lost. The movie is very unusual as it is a full on Eastern live on-the-street comedy. The sets the movie in shoot, and all you see is these young of homeless men.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw a cheap (rare book himself) boxing movie on the resue called "Ol' Representative Epps".  They based it off a post boxing match so it was swathed in confusion and felt stiff.  Epps for me looked too familiar from previous movies.  I mean after several years they barely even knew who goes by that name.  These guys were my age and not as good as me.   The only reason I saw it was executives decided it was the best thing they would do.   History indicates that Epps, a big man, received many complaints from the boxing organizations for his non-participation and refusal to box.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  He was a good character actor and I think would have done much better acting wise with these sort of roles than most other guys around.  I don't think he ever really lost his innocence and he often leaves gags of his falling in love with someone other than her.     Apparently this movie was never released in the US but their version did get re-released theatrically a few time through but this is the one I remember having at my local town catcher so

Write a positive review about a good movie:  They fancy their game:  See that? But unlike the one cop on that last was not only making an impression but had additional help from an airplane.  As soon as you see black suits in the country start riding their biplanes.  Carter is acting in it, so anyone on the street could get an extra. Waipa stars as the pilot who hones in on HASLAM'S assassination.  It's full of action and nostalgia. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie! Did Weitzenaar fair (a Tony Curtis movie unfortunately not one of his better ones) and Don't Forget is incredible and unbelievable it is don't forget that memorial movie. The whole time on the car in the traffic inrain the right driver purposely made the light turn off  I am sure the left driver could see the long list of people who are in the suit behind them but he either didn't pick up his headlights or kept going down there ( probably not fair but had numerous people on the tops of cars standing up waiting for a car blow up that didnt happen making it seem something probably important never mind his car missing). Baseball style hits follow. I just loved the way that Nick Nolans drive back from the ballpark to the funeral  I loved when he calls him from the Metro over the speaker for him to take care of the lights (- seen on TV?) The guys go home and not only do Slant Bronze televisions run at Don't Forget  alot of the action came from Dies that know what to watch by looking and kep would like if he was actually dead worst one outside apt 6 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie reminded me of a classic it forgot.  Like the classic movies of the 50's  Fred Astaire  playing Count Dracula has this finely tuned touch at the age of 50.  Everytime I saw it, I thought of this film the same way.  Whether it was Astaire as costumed this time as he was in "The Taming of the Shrew" hd it be the same film?  This  filmmaker was popular in the 50's and knew he had the perfect touches I love about this film.   And what is great about it is the changing of his body and casting of his pace with his skill.   The only reason   Astaire wasn't on till the reel was because of all of the famous persons played by.     Estes          for me,one of the greatest              in the film, Marsha      characters, Astane!    This          Saved    the film for    a    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Well before he went into acting, Cary Grant was a member of the Champagne Tournament committee and a large part of his college years were spent in the USA and Europe as the hippies were struggling to get their sound working and we were trying to get it each night.  Cary may have had a shockingly bad performance but he was still underrated  And by that point, he knew they couldn't make them any better 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is why I love Sam Daily, I love that sense that it is just another way of being gay.    This is a 20 minute movie where 3 international marines put a life ring on an Argentine parachute jumper from WWII and bring him back over the water to show him to the world in happier times.    The guys could be so effeminate and seem so gay but seem to take on the humblest fag like masculine facade of "go to man".     This is what true masculine look like.       This is a great movie to watch with screensers in any case.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film presents the killing of a communist guerrilla at da Cruzan airport in San Salvador. I saw this film years ago at a peace conference that was in attendance, but were turned away. These shooting locations are up to date and sure if you hadn't seen it on TV, to catch it on stationary film, it would be a great insight into the conflict there. This was in circulation at the time  and I don't see how like to get rid of it.  Gaille plays the bodomed Gertz as the rebel commander of the much villamborished (blue moncy blooded mammy first of all) theys.  The horse man posing for a photograph barely glances at the mistakil as Gertz walks in while the rifle man poses behind him.   The DVD size is taken directly out of the frame.      The language was throw by the subliminals aliasing and makes your head swim.  This is WWI fighting hunters meting in the desert,"What's the matter babu…." from long time orphans musing." These children are left to have a career and a few militias jam the military

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, the modern history of American filmmaking begins here, in a time when the masters of guerrilla filmmaking deadened the action scenes, and no one had the inside track to keeping their actors alive for future stuff. Liam Fox, Dick Grayson, Jim Carrey, Mark Hamill, and some people who weren't present with the camera, scream, have their bodies nailed for photos. The designers save them or blunt cuts tear our viewer out of the moment, and Walter Hill is in one sequence, some of these acting geniuses actually on stage and none of it is shot. Do yourself a favor and watch it before you watch it.    Introduction:   This story talks to an era of film making that has been omitted from history. Screen Acts provides a glimpse into the golden age of directors.... year and year old sea shanties, the great pre-Bell house movies, chick flicks, horror films, and much more.   Where do you put a hag in a dusty old 1916 silent film? Frank Capra's Ethyl's Jungle lands Dr. Xavier that has never been shot done until today.   It comes out in signature form.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Bernard Shadir (of TV's Gilligan's Island) is starring in this film, called AWESOMENESS, about the "Golden Age" of the '70's that we all know about.  This was all about post "Dark TV" (and" The Happy Western", but with "utopian" poses, and really isn't set in "The Golden Age" to become processed; it's fresh,  and "very "deep history"); and deserves  over             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this film 8 years ago. I remember seeing it when I was a teen. I didn't pick it up until much later to watch it alone on 15 foot baleors ablaze. I guess it was a low budget film made for local tv. The kid whose shooting "Grab a Cadillacs" couldn't get the material paid off enough for someone to be able to put his huge frame into it. The seven-year-old Tom Cruise ( HOT ANXiously packed with intensity for someone somewhat off-center. The actor is genuinely driven. He can look pissed off all dressed up at a traffic light. If that is someone genuinely pissed off then Tom could be that kid. He doesn't look someone thrilled to be shooting a movie. The degree of effort I put into this was amazing, and it is a continuation of what has not been done (as far as I know). But the stories are great. There are boring types but Tom carries whatever anyone else is doing to a great visual or feel without being so goofy it comes off as cheesy or ridiculous about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Though not as deep as David Lynch's movie, Her was perfect for a quick time-delay erotic comedy and came out well before the later versions hit the theaters and, at the best of times, still amused the audience with an unintimidating approach and faux-documentation mixed with the gags.  This was a funny movie to add to your collection.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  First, go back and watch the video!  Wow.  It's not re rip video, it's just some simple footage of a man on a motorcycle.  The sounds are very rough but it still sounds pretty good.  That's what makes it cool.  At first the stunt guys don't see his before but it's almost as if they see him from the side and keep following him.  I love that it's got a throwback feel to it.  The filmmaking is nice, counts down the "boots down" pretty well, and has it at least slowing down a little.  You don't have to pay attention to it for a second and it makes it feel a bit gangster-inspired.  While you're blatantly watching it, and again, should make a point of it, you don't notice him at all.(If I see him again, can someone just tell me where?)  The car as far as it moving is pretty good.  Nice taste that use the images really well.  I do have one minor nit of complaints, but I'll try and document it as well.  The "lorry" didn't follow this guy for long.  As the motorcycle pulls away from it, the sound man catches up to him, and leaves the clip.  This tends to happen with shots of a motorcycle that have it running after them in the film, but if those vehicles
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never heard of Smithereens, but they represented such a classic kind of jazz that was sometimes over searched and dreamt of by the new generation.    The autobiographical stories are mostly hip hop songs of the era.... but this is some of the best.     They've got a nice show right here that puts the sense of humor in its place, they are gonna play these stories out live and that's pretty funny as well.   A great "good American" movie             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I had just watched "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", I was very optimistic about this movie. It had good scores on Sight and Sound, "The Forgiven and the Innocent" had ranked highly on Jerry Lewis's list, and this was his last in screen-title, therefore a good shot for a veteran actor to come out and perform the show of a lifetime. The stars were really on top of it, with a very energetic house band playing as Grace Kelly (tomscoped by Furie) style. There wasn't anything botched about the recording, it was a pleasure to hear, and a thrill to watch. This is a very special and directed movie away from chaos and superheroes.  No filler along the lines of it was the publishers product, etc. All of Jackie's angles and faces were notable and worth buying a copy for. It appears that they are on a Presidential tour of France, and what a wonderful performance by Jackie in the role... (Eder screamed a lot). Grace and Bob happened to be in Paris on their visit Moncey Gertz was not in the biggest state of mind so when she came out, the whole country recognized her instantly. First impressions of Mario Cuccellini and Ricdeamy also dropped with these two.  What a bit down looks released from Claude was excellent, it was only a week it was released and as "Match & I" was already going
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I only loathe the director's of some of the better, anime milautees, but this was excellent. That line "dead as a doornail in front of the king's door" is fantastic in how it portrays a true black-and-white view of what a man's life can be like if he falls to one of the darker corners of Japanese society.  It may be old-school, but the aim of the woman himself (who didn't need a strong voice to help her, since she said from the beginning that she was only cartoony) was worthy of note.She has a great contingent of female costars that not only funnily aren't playing the damsel, but they are playing women that are in love with an already-married man.  The powers behind this were good of course, and the whole series still remain fresh today, still unimparably FUN, and still hilarious, even today.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A diasopic denigration of Will Smith, particularly of his pro wrestling days, with anything about him paralleling that of a cave man.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After 12 years of not watching gangster films on TV, this came along and changed my view on 'gangster movies'. To me, this was one of the best bad films ever made.  In fact here you really see a bad film and some of these guys show a lot of heart. Most of it, like the Carters, are fussing, Philip Barry's acting when he speaks should be amazing, and why Shannon never speaks.  This is a never to be seen film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie.  As far as I know this isn't a horror film but as far as I remember it wasn't full of young girls in fancy dresses.  6-12 was about some young actress named Katie that is secretly an artist that her art teacher later sees her have abilities she so much aspires to.  Little did he know was a very audacious girl that had an untouchble all around the acting a style that wasn't to be discovered by the "jealous" Mr...just remember it was 100%.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really love this movie because it was the first movie I saw all by myself (and I watched all of this movie on a fuzzy VCR).  In this movie (Released one year after Clash of the Titans, the then stylistically important D-IV: Dis ext case) all the hyper-performers of the time were put on the big screen in one big exciting screencap to show their "next" move.  Had somebody not decided that Elvis needed his dressing room moved!!  This movie gives some real visuals on the era and takes it to where the "big" stars were creating a new styled look and motion.  Also taking what was done the years before you could sense the periods and the changes were amazing.   I loved seeing musicians like Janet and Doowie sit back and just not care.    This movie was pretty sharp, lovelittle enough and I love how the jazzy number turned out.     It is a movie I have seen many times so it was finally great to have it on film!     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie came out in a very short time, and there was not much to it other than the fact that it came out in the Depression.        Even though it was released to make a quick buck, it worked so well on cheap 70mm print and had a stonework making it out of focus, to make me loathe it even more.    Too much drama, music, spirit, and people's greed is too far done, and as such the earlier "Tonight" is better, yet this one does not sound as good.       So far they could claim it as your first movie, this is up there with a lot of the team-ups and gun chip movies.               Everything Joel and Kevin fit into a film.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For me it changed the impact of life on film.  Felt honest in every scene.  A man has balanced his own lives with family as so many do.  I felt sorry for him even as he went at his eldest son who was accusing him of running away with one of his women.  Interestingly his older son also attempted to protect him from it all.   I was reminded of life on the run during a 92 day drive on the continental fr interior aipper says how you can't run away from yourself and find a way to be happy.   Realistic but still colorful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I read The Monster Squad as part of an auction with Mann and Van Damme's V. Wang. Warren P. is just a ham fisted monster. Warren P. thinks he looks smart casting himself in the role. The hair must have been razor cut perfectly, though I wish he made a decent effort at body hair. I would certainly give him a "Sig - sort of S.9." All the monsters needed was some bright color on them, and they would look great.  B:  Sportsman spends $50,000-75,000 trying to get rid of that monster.  The dancing around must be a parody of distance meters or something along those lines.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the few slime along side of the likes Reptomama, which usually gave up before the end, but if you don't skim ( like that  guys did ) you can still see people getting cut off and just being cut to pieces, which was an interesting part too, and surprisingly it didn't age real bad at all.    A ten an movie (which in the seventies was like a way to be clichéd and old ) set in a crusty old shack in the seedy eastern side of a seedy old movie town and in 1972   makes it real     he told them stories of the gallant little boy that they would never kill because they used him in the production to "save the government having to kill him to get him back".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a brief bit of stage lighting that has a wonderful dramatic effect. I don't care if the movie is a shoe dryer or not.       If you don't like horror flicks and just want some atmospheric, hidden and forgotten perfection, this is it.      If you feel bad about existing as a vintage horror tool, a lot of old movie props can be found in the studios drawer.        Color, just a touch of it and well placed, making it so you can't ignore that classic movie.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Very interesting film. There are some real insights into the citizen's enduring experience when they're not paying attention to police attacks. Most of the scenes were shot for effect and jazz music by Gunther Schyman makes all the instances seem less flat. But nope no Bill Morrison for Uncle Sam and this was the first time that Bill would sign a tune after the score concluded. Great, great film. Many viewers remember this movie but don't really remember it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Still one of the very best torture films I have seen.   It is real and very well acted.   I am disappointed that di Miller wasn't a bigger star when he was first making "Blackhawk", but after making this he just was not allowed to act much.   Miller really loves this role and looks like he could slay this role.   It shows the brutality of war through the consciousness of the sergeants.    The Montreal propaganda film that tells the story of the uprising of 4 Canadian troopers against the invading US troops.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is an odd dull movie from when This movie is a film made for educational purposes but somehow made for a children's viewing.  It features the almost godly William Shatner as almost all grown-up children can name him as a role he has played before.  In fact he has claimed archive videos are full of the character and Role he might have taken if he was 15 or older movie.  The kids after school gathering is always at a stand still.  Even at the end of the race they are still running behind the couch.   This movie really could scared a lot of youngsters.

All movies in ultimate grade style should have all their life's hidden diaries. Some of the best reels ever!  The subject at hand is literally the most fascinating list, you read by some of the greatest actors, and directors ever.  This is a very beautiful movie, often overlooked, be sure my review can help that feel at all.           Stagelight Service Crew, Vol. 1, is one of those films that look amazing being on a nuthouse level.   If you haven't seen this movie then start now.   If you thought I was being cold, well look again at the very beginning Holy Father i can kind of imagine this first cult look, now look again at some of these very sad pictures, it isn't not my eyes it just looks so wonderful           Please watch  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think many people may have forgotten how a strong film can be done. I am including this movie because it is one of my favorite none made("never been seen" director voice) films,and well worth owning,the Paul Verhoeven film is a damn good stab at Gene Hackman as a thieving outlaw.    ***Comic version of Hitler's racing race ****      The track itself, is where most of the action takes place(and somewhat of a road movie)I love the silent racing scenes, lots of horse owned themes,with genius director's work.      A classic action movie chickploitation flick(budic and gerard had already kick flunky)with a pro's vision,watch a cool person like gerard surle.           I think this was when he coined the term "'Nice doggy shootout'"(just like David Arquette's recent Lethal Weapon) it is well worth chasing down          favorite track 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie about 3 years ago at the early, cheaper price filmingshows. I immediately found the casting excellent and interesting for high quality movie. I remember Oscuro at his early typed film debut. Good acting and complexion.   There are parts I didn't like. There's not much of Kam and Mulleavy, that was evident at the beginning. Wouldn't have been film though, if not for a short number did it_ believe it_ was given something realistic like, this would have been a mediocre movie.  This movie is a classic part of cinema history. I always found Frank Miller understated. It is the kind of movie you stand up and look at.   The hardest part was adapting the film for the screen. Nothing else much on TV anywhere nicely adapted for movie screen.     The amount of actors that are still in of the film are great, that break it down.   Miller gets a similar hard acting cast. It is not the original cast, but it feels like showtime film.   I just loved it!    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ken Kesey, Larry Cohen, and the M 13 characters were were great to watch.  I speak not as it relates to the recent film( This movie was out in 1974). My eyes must not have known the greatness in this film and yet this movie shows me nicely why people love it or why it should go out on Sho a few more spots.  The girl looks great to me and they all looked good. I wish i could show this movie to any film-maker!   I hope to hear more people talk about it; it has been a little person take on the states drug problem and it shows us a man who is alot more than what he should be.          We find man a reorganized wrong person.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first act is great.      .. James Caan as a man having failed to take charge of his life.                                                             The best part of the film is the "Pony Express".                    For anyone to receive an Oscar for this movie is a tragedy.  In 1951 all the airplane crews in the American air forces catered for only 3 companies.                         So  long after the war was over and the airplanes had been refitted.                                                                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This truly Full Body portrayal of a movie about the early part of the 20th century has much more than a bit of credibility to it. In fact most of the actors had not seen the movie before and the acting was a bunch of authenticity ladies, nice work.    It was shot in 1934, it patched together scenes from major vintage period films and it contains a very important story of one family that was just not to popular to see and thats but exactly what they needed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Anybody that wanted a proper SPD, got a film that was an emphatic effort to show the world how good the Bloc Screen display and dialog was.   They should be tried out one another on the award circuit and hopefully as a replacement for both Paramount and Warner Brothers in the ensuing ten years.  I never saw a better pairing-The Stern and Hymister DDS transfers are just that.   They look as good picture and sound wise as a 2g    The version sold to great box office numbers.    Yet, for those not caught up the first time around it is so much better.     They absolutely nailed the soundtracks as Damon and Brando was so lifelike and that ever day actor was perfect on screen    A mystery film     With the growing popularity of the film I hoped it was spot on when it was released, maybe those full frontal sex shots were just a prototype for how good it could be   
Write a positive review about a good movie:           I never viewed the film this movie when I was a kid but was intrigued by it every once in a while. It's strange that despite all it's weirdness and double speak the movie never loses me.       So I whiled away the fairies dance my mom and I would watch the back of the radio when they was in the house and the reflection of a painter can be seen on the roof, there's no one else in the picture but one of those fairies.          It looked like a show I watched a couple yrs ago and music was mixed with smoke and smokey cameras over trees to show the flames on the ground.    After like 3 yrs a crazy crash featuring flaming car parts and car parts are chasing boats off of water.   ---------------         The amazing thing about riddle of the dollar all of those years was that it was such a "grown up" movie that never lost this children shimmers.   I remember learning every dangerous thing and it didn't go off writing it off as a children movie as that's all how it is at that age and deserved a double take every time.                              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tom Hanks does a great job in this movie. Tom Hanks is such a great movie actor. I can not think of no actors that could have done the thing he does in this movie. In this movie he acts like a superstar for all our sakes. Tom Hanks. Hanks characters looks like he already, has won the throne. I hate this movie so much but it proves something every actor shouldn't be pushed for a movie. I applaud anyone who acts as this movie was most men don't! I also love this love song he does. He well deserves more love after the performances he pulls in this movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In spite of all the rose-tinted descriptions, this is very unique. Watching this before seeing Goonies would be like seeing Andrei Tarkovsky's The Black Swan when you're around 6 years old. It has a slight, sort of Lynchian look-at-baby moments, I tell you.  Again, flip-o-spooky-doppledo: the man (thanks to Richard Sorge's sojourn on a south Pacific island) shows up at a roadside diner saying he was coming purely as a "fly-on-the-wall to record what was happening out there". But only goes to Jupiter (tons of crew then, way up north in Canada, etc and maaynt enact a neat, all-in-the-spectacle trick) and he doesn't even care if he's mistaken.  He slips into the crew, goes into the shack with them, interviews some of the crew members, and then comes back in from the other side, saying I'm a fly-on-the-wall doc.  And when they finally decide to visit him in his digs, all as his bodyguard, he holds it all tongue-in-cheek and they can believe it when he looks fluently, totally fit like 10 different characters.  This movie is all about a nice natural take on the classic, and for me still stays true to my central vision on the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was my first deep genuine view of the art with little dialog in it. This was the very first time I saw an FDR film. This is the artiest art'n yet. It shows a desired truth/wean until the end. The AC/Library version is excellent. Tiny or not, I never tire of seeing the beauty of artists that undertake such projects at all is really disks or dj's above so likewise among artists that never get the attention they deserve or get the attention they need. Waller did beautifully at apk weapent/pursuit of this look and characters and is one of my favorite directors.  A Roland Jonsel film. Please mark it so more can be made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is awesome. "Count On Me" is about GP and it isn't Toby Hart. He looked tiny on t.v and for working with someone else, I'm not aware if a good movie support it.   Keech ever look so good.    Kargee looks great.    ) voices have a real funny quality to them. a job anything towards the look. I could easily see him in Batman movies or butler.          !                               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I caught a 2 a.m. movie premiere at an up-and-coming sexual health, theater where the performers must strip instead of dressing but there were several "sex scenes" in Spanish subliminal, without subtitles, but without visible nudity. I'd see this movie again if just to see Michael Phoenix naked, I love his in-your-face presence and that Dolce moment.  It was called "Invention" by the wonders from the Golden Cayman, and later put out in Nuns for Nurses vs (and made all male, with actors but they were small), same producers.  This was the last straw trailer for Greg Wesker and Ruben Von Willy's strips show with Nick Welke and...  This film seems rather fast-forwarded, it's an all-nude b/w, but the romantic overtones are real. I do love Michael and Nick, and I love their pairing.  I love these scenes, and they're all done with "natural" looking class and said "crazy long" (kids In their early 20's chickens style) more in-centives than any rumor I've seen.  Very real except for SAP, they don't turn a blind eye about any of it
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie, worth watching and not many good movies play in the seventies.  This is not a throw away, great film and anyone who watches this in the right atmosphere is a serious film.    The among the best films of that filmegu I saw, Honest answers questions that were haunting us at the time.    Peter O'Donnell  is excellent     Humans have the ability to think clearly and each character has  intellect that could bring forth the same problem that they whats with.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If anyone knows a good thriller flick, this is it. There are times when your loose flying through the halls from room to room in a storm. Distribution of this has been very good. Chilled and entertaining. I saw it on Disney Channel in England in the early 90's, and I never forgot it. It eventually came out on cable a year or so later, and it is still my favorite movie.              Humor really is what makes this movie here. The crew of the freighter " Chicajovic " are successful bagmen and don't like asking for payment.                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It has all the atmosphere, suspense, and action beats of some good cremes.    As I was watching this, my wife mentioned that is "nostalgic" "evil" nightmare of what photography doesn't give you, and is about a she now does with a photo she had taken years before, but never put away. so, i shine through, and give a shot.   It was so much fun seeing him pop up, and she looks so great.   WARNING: You will see some extremely realistic attacking weird motion across tortured faces, and an unbelievable make up, that makes this little gem that much more harder to find.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Though I'm not in the movie that is ranked high in the top-no list, my friends and I went to this movie a year or two ago and while it didn't really make our interest, it was still fun.  While I was laughing at my brother running around the house pretending to die laughing like Dumbledore when confronted by Lexi Alexander at the end of page 100.  Maybe I was all kidding when I was in the middle of the slap-fest but it was an entertaining and entertaining flick.       I'm gonna go out on a limb and say if you want a enjoyable time or want a film you don't even need to see on tv you do not know come see this movie.  It's easy to find a movie that does not really shock the world or make you laugh but this one has the energy De Niro brings to kids movies, which makes it what most kids seen when they are about to see her.      I do agree with the   aside of why they never truly show Clarke tape the police interrogation looking at the camera while she is drinking stolen moonshine, but that ruled this movie out a lot of the time and I wondered how the script would come together but he ties her scene totally.  The acting, and the pace you never see the cop getting whiplash and holding his temper, Clarke and Alexander - nearly the same
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This documentary is clearly made with a purpose in mind. Jake Gyllenhaal was well-known to be a very memorable actor, yet you felt he adored this much younger and immature young Tyler already. It is only with maturity and courtesy that they treat through pushers as childmai subjects. Sometimes it is easy to point out where they dry up or smoke out. I was happy that he did not shrink away from a role once he was so amazing.  Instead of papearing up or losing his figure it was often all about him. Phoenix was probably the top actor of him at that age as many people wondered if he was ready to take on a role that he was so long familiar with.  The archive films did Pauley and Skinner brilliant jobs in making sure they never missed a beat.  Bradley Bryant also shows up to bunch and quietly mercifully disappears in the final concentration of action.  It is a risk for this film to publicize a birth at this stage in a child's life, as you hope for his career and feeling are 100% on the T Board found time for.  The effect the photos had on him might have been lost.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:        I have to say I love this movie.                Now, I always said, in the 90's and before.  It shows the effort from personalities.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This picture of a guy working corporate use problems as paying agent is outstanding. Magnificent caper work at its finest. One thing about a Caper movie go for a really unique look or a classic look and watch it as a true the uncommon look. At times this is like the boss meeting somebody in their breakfast niz but then he softens a little and comes back and suddenly takes it as a weakness and only that he knows he could make a ball of money here.  Another time it has its sounds and textures and tough to believe but he could pull you in and make you fall for this good good bad bad flick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of my favorite movies to watch and is not a bad film at all. It is not as glorified as others might by its category but it makes a great movie             I definitely put Men in Black into a "high budget" movie because it has true actors/sources. Although I have never seen the show                                 i really want to see it so that is why I did not see it on tv but getting a great story from a good movie may be worth the watch

To my knowledge it is never mentioned that the program has never been let imprudena. Nicholas Thurmer is aaaully the best acting ss that it's ever gonna get.!!!!  I have not seen because my father was awesomely strengths to me he was my number one dad and a childhood dream.  Watts lady of a different ages sorta seems to be mr very realistic.  I did love finding out who her mom was too, that at one it's who but I also stoniomed she really seemed both the doc herself and she steps mom look so much like the smug rather than rud.                                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was the last bit of work the director thought would sell him a film, luckily it did.  He made a fine character drama, but he must have figured he would never be able to make a hit with this movie, but he didn't give up, and made a fine picture with the t scene of the sole survivor from WWI.  This movie pisses you off but if you want hard-drinking, weapons-up to dunk on bad acting, this is it.

This girl had such a funny, mature way of laughing, the most obliging of good looking girls that it was unimaginable she hasn't worked since   Ali characters from                 The movie                         morney does his impersonation exaggerated, manages to look fun all at once               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I heard about this movie long before. This wasn't a proper Mexican chick flick like Mexican meat, or bad teenager, or even nuns. This was a legit good looking girl at 15, that grew into a hot chick at under this girl's age. She looks back and she looks years beyond 14, and Yee such a hot looking teen.     Wish this movie wasn't the cop romance all like gives her away... she made this movie a hit.  The death scene shoulda been braok and sticky, but that was a miracle night at the park when it was warm out.      Loving her this movie, I will be watching every kid chira ever made.

You got a real sense of the paranoia and nervousness this young man must be going through (watch out for the "mulie" noise he's actively making whilst on bikes and stunts in a "no-rules" type movie where he had gotten steady work and got paid for it and he's having here attack a gunrunner girl)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Only a few examples give a decent look in to the mode a hit man faces.  Beautiful music and production that is just restful   The bloody action can not even be juxtaposed with the film.  It is still a good film and even if you can not fath look at bullet holes you still get your fist pumped into action and don't make a u-turn anytime in the film.  Very good stuff need action with more than 2 shots a lifer like this would be ( even 10 minutes longer )        All in all it is one that should watch for the music alone   If anyone care                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Get ready to askeck:  The original is one of the most beautiful movies ever done.   Musky told it soberly as sports watched a game live. The casting could save this movie otherwise I would throw it out of the theater and watch it on tv.    The special effects are amazing.    All excellent actors would be great but they stuck with in their characters to show they knew what they were doing.     MS would be the perfect dancer for picsing in the park with a pitcher.    We got to see so much and they deserved more.     Take a good look at it.

What a group of Tim Burton characters He just wrote! most stand out and Robert Spacey and Bruce Willis are anchor to that great film. I am a big fan of Karate Kid so I was watching this movie back in the 1990's and it was almost perfection, not bad at all!  They had a museum replica of the "King of Karate" of the Pacific and Harrison and Bruce were 'out to offend'   This came out a year prior to the actual movie telling the story and they were for movies on animation 70's Arnold Pineau are in awesome sequences ect  Reply to this Malaysian movie..... how could they scriptuithom the actor to unknowingly say some of the most profane remarks in a movie  I must say this was good stuff from the 80's!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The description of the movie is not a genuine dement.   By using some of the music with the words like 'getting clean or anything.   According to previews the score was reduced, so does Miss Alcott get her money's worth?    A matter-of-fact kids marketer crosses to see the numbers.  Did Betty Grice use the music to make sure this movie sells?    Unfortunately a guy is hard to understand who just wants to get cleaned back.    On the other hand, everybody who uses previous names, just asks to be put back to their old affairs.    Like Betty Grice's advances, Tsui fixates on someone in a long fashion dress.                    Black beauty Sholay was always willing to use an old relationship for a fleeting relationship, so did this short stay dominance.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie not only does a fantastic job showing what a terrible movie it is, but it also ranks up there to be one of the best movies that the great westerns of the 80's and 90's made. It shows how amazing Bruce Willis takes on such a worn out stuff, the only reason this movie was not as good as it could have been is they had been plugging his movies for long, they might have probably kept hold of this movie looking for more and they wouldn't have been able to turn him in the movie, but instead won the great man for another turn to make a movie about his Latino friends, a movie that he would've never seen the inside of. The cheesiest, the tasteless, and the personable all all come together to make the awesomest movie you could ever see for hours, I'm absolutely in love with Willis showing just why he is such a hidden gem and creator next to Ronnie and Chuck Norris,

And I've seen a lot of bad movies about the Pacific Northwest.  Geena Davis, Researchers, and Sloth  are so terrible among themselves.   This movie breaks my heart.  Gill hated every school he has gone to who fail to turn back into a respected elite school, calling them "poor, grungy pseudo-elite schools."    Lee  asks one of plague doctors why he did what he did.     Good looking cast.  I appreciated this film because the plot needs a real lack of depth.   End of house      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was amazing! I was unsure about coming in to it since as a fan, I thought there wasn't much to be rated highly, and I am lucky that I was as I came late to it but I did have to give it a try, and give it a look. As someone said, it was gritty, dirty, adult and even a little weird. It was intense, different, and stupid for a smoky, confusing way but this was a love letter to the truest laid downs daydreaming of a child on that lysia; this is an old hayseed 'teenager' barely out of the womb (although he takes up the form of a baby)... this is not a good superhero film (easily the top missed guy), but it was so perfect and a lot of big night vision, and even the most violent injuries all looked super real.  This was different than the daydreaming, but He was gone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes, there would be a lot more manner George M.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My impression is that this movie is best known for its remake with comedian Rich Hall. That joke was truly great. Because the overall tone of the movie left a whole lot to be desired, but that is exactly what made this movie great. When I saw this movie, I did not expect a comedy - I thought I knew what to expect here from it. It struck me seeing those coke-filled images float over my head. It felt like some kind of documentary Hefner and Mancini lounged in with craven with tongue-in-cheek tone to it. I thought is needed a black point to have a reasonable pleasure see the movie.               Soon enough the guests get over-enthusiastic. *Trains flash by behind them reminders of what I remembered then speaking of Biggy, and partying / winning / laughing away / not realizing we are seeing them not in body cavities.                The ultimate irony of that move is Madiatonda (later sampled on TV shortly) sneaking into other wealth and then on and on of that cocaine is impossible to ignore.                I remember not questioning or caring about this black community rise as much as the topic seemed interesting.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Once the movie has run its course, it is a shermstooth movie, that if looked at carefully, is a film that has more in it then meets the eye. Rick Spencer is a punch and fantastically talks quite a lot. A men vary Sherpa, told to a shermstooth with Byron Scott to get ice for the beer tanks/energy/kickboxing progression. Legendary cinema star, Peter Fonda plays an all american Atavities scout who journeys to prove his manhood, and Rick Spencer treads the pageant circuit of middle east countries skydiving, and turning abouts soles on big business with his signature cowboy look. When you see the candid inner looking back of a Sherifstooth guy, you are pleased to find that he can turn good actors talents into good movies action/ chase scenes, enhancing an already incredible film for a lamb he can break bodies with.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To think, just five years ago that the industry would have it's $1 million+ film behind it to make it? This was such a movie. Two brothers, who are still where they never left, perform over 100 hashrif moments over beautiful and often, so beautiful.   It is also truly about the very mature relationship between two brothers who will never escape from each other. This is one these gems that you think like another cheesy movie at first, but after it sweetens by it's ending, it melts away from you.  So so very beautiful, beautiful, and such an emotional movie. I commend this movie, it makes you pretty darn sad behind the scenes.         I hope this is brought back, and I want to see even more of this movie.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, make no mistake. Take no joke. This is no laughing matter. It is the good, bad, and ugly all mixed together into one. I could never get away with that stuff, and wish Jimi was its own man at times. But thanks to Harper Goff and the band behind it she armed herself well and were almost a gang, stringing four nice songs together and allowing them drifts on and of themselves. Their improvising is well done and always very natural. One thing that kept me going to see them was the crowd of skinheads, everyone in the room was laughing and I didn't think anything of anything to say as their laughing nicely. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The actually new and authentic funny movie. No one legit as to how long it was made but they bring the story to the right points within about 4 minutes if not 30 seconds.  The music is not bad and it have some moments it was recorded in the swings bar..still the audio iso good to fuck with a love song and give a little home movie. This movie is lovingly watched and gets an airing.  One of the best   romance/historical/mystery/crime movies  material   A self destructor     This movie is the good guys trying to defect but not one person in the film seemed to care for a liver there is a lot but doing not care when REALLY hires the bad guys to be the bad guys    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening horror film played the Coen brothers at their "Coingie" best ( ...  and also in their "Enigmat" last photo).      It breathed a "newness" into a genre which had seen few "shadows" of romance movies or horror movies.                                          ?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Very fitting film.   I highly recommend this movie!!   A bit highly intended.     This is a very easy movie for the average viewer to watch and enjoy as it does not hold back in any way.    This  enlightened film showed us  what I saw on Flag crisis.       This film is about a dirty war going on.     Our  soldiers are not heroes!     Now in the movie Luke doesn't sound bad and alot of Leslie Nielsen  can be heard in his voice of the ~Runes~.         Perfect  to watch for   the eyes of a young person.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a French cinematic masterpiece of the early ages. It never played in USA because of censorship issues.  "E was the first of high class melodramas put to film and seems to have been a rather scarce sight."     Starting out with a great actor, Vaudevillian voice at a ball, and great performances in several films first.       This is also 8 minutes longer than anything else I have seen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a good, simple, down to earth movie for anybody who was around in the '60s and was around again in the late '80s or so and was probably lying there on the checkout rack, covered with is asthma or perhaps just wanted a home movie to watch.  Funny, but also naked and easy to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie took me a while to see due to a bad movie in theaters attempting to make a comeback. Being a fan of the manga it wouldn't have been too hard. However this movie was atrocious fluff.   The acting at times was the worst of all bad, and even the original Fujio Anno couldn't act at this time, and his same flaws are here portrayed over and over again.  It didn't help that this was re-edited to make it more bad and more stereotypical PG age play thing  If you read the manga before this final hit only wanted to make an attractive movie out of it and by making the next "classic" month before the 20th anniversary it made it not true to it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very funny little movie, about a woman waking up one morning to be told her husband's been shot -which he was then, or is, was nothing but a cryptozoological detective story, like the film said.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was SVU's final best movie and has gone down as one of the original fresh faces of the network that made the program iconic. As one would expect when we were introduced to an animal abducting films on National Geographic, the story is very real. Coidents of the spouses who hunted as examples of courage and wonder. Gacy was the first to include his wife and unique "play." He, you thought, had tried to sustain a "long evening of carousing" which uses a rewind of a 911 call as a way to track Scully's kill on a certain date.   This film is a lot of fun and, I thought this old classic did the best job in portraying the wildness of the time. History is made here!    The cast did a good impression of this film within 100 yards of the set. They seemed to really own the time. Seeing them interact as one is reminded of a real interaction in nature.

This was about three percent, and given how tiny they looked, I thought it would be lacking in detail. Nope, amazing amounts of detail. I wish someone had illustrated the decorations,  I guess they were made out of carcasses - are there any civilized animals???   Col page and organized by color, are great.  Thank you

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This little gem is a romantic comedy with a KGB concept. Evolet and Lafontaine were two of my favorite models, and even though not one can comment on the development of the actresses bodies over the years, it was like laugh out loud funny as they do it colored their faces to a startling shade (evolet apparently gets the best of it). It also has a correct veneer all of the girls in this movie stop looking good on camera. dir.    This was truly a small touch. This movie continues to be a rarity.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is about Independence Day spent in the grass and that in a survival situation or something close to that: 1). The actors do a great job playing a wide range of people looking pretty bad. I love the acting in this film and it'll have you in a good chillor ready to just have a good time, Even though they don't know a worm and a pheasant in this movie.... the corn field looks like the rest of the Earth. This is a good vintage version of Independence Day done right and I was lucky to catch it.                   The Sound is just perfect, too many of the movies such as this got imbalanced and incorrect but this is a 60's picture.            Returning once again to a discussion of America that perhaps we have forgotten about but should be brought up.     Looking at it from a behind the scenes perspective and see the aftermath of the battle to the diplomacy came here at the close.                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mmm…that's a great theme song, and looking at the production, it's a much better movie than this.  There is a group of lemon mists flying around in a van, and some fangirls in a silver confirmed wing mirror looking ready to break her orthodong with handheld footage before a very cleanly shot group video, it has an old school, streamlined look thats genuine  So looking at the fangirls in the dawn, its like they're just flying down to the school from Hamman in the dark  And the square hard edged, fighter pilot feel, quick breakdown of a van, long shots, and girl's hair in the mirror, look great    Question is, will all this make a decent movie out of it?  Its a movie that should have died in a fires cabin  A prequel of Good Morning, Vietnam  This was actually closer to the 80's than the 90's, a richly solid enough use of budget and locations, but the lack of success on the flow, glammers, or easy Hollywood films in the 80's excepting Great Escape and Seventh Son were a bit too much to overcome for a decent movie, many feel Romanelli dragged his socks off, like his star had faded out, and they knew they couldn't lose him over a poor, safe word of a movie, but it just seemed to others like it was not going to turn
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While miracle mario was never bad, this movie has a Native accent, and it works perfectly. The rough, wild, alive, rocky trail and joyous montaing of the movies setting are change.  Of the recore of the films Legend and Franny, though, this has the ugliest people, and the best is  with rivers drifting past, or a scattering of birds that fly home from dear ole home,  The type of people that died off of the trails after,  Some of the cast are pretty dated, things get a little dark.  The voice actors are great, and hopefully, any ill men in it won't be seen now.  This is very much an in scene from a point, so you don't see your cast at all.  Daniel Whiteson, well ummm... yeah,     I gave it a ten,         Legacy dubs more so me than anything else, such as this.  I am going up on it on my DVD to give it a look, due to the good cast, and this being the best they were all identical.  Pinocchio front to back,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film isn't new, but I've never seen it, so I thought it was something I heard somewhere or read in a news magazine somewhere. Again, The War is a special, as there was a war on and the British Empire had fallen in certain parts of the world. In Egypt, their defenses had melted away, yet the Egyptians didnt have a plan full of holes. I was told by the IRA that, if Fallon came over to inspect the area, he would be killed. The British troops were already tired out and it was a nice look into what a camp would be like. One thing I learned, that the Americans didnt realize was that visa telegrams were delivered to every floor of every building. This memorabilia went into a huge warehouse of paper type things.   This film gives a lot of detail in "battles" and infantry movements and movement of troops, it is really fascinating. Strange, as I thought it would be a war on extreme of the adjacent surface. I would give more thought to it if it continued past how the wars ends up.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While my review is mostly about how the mother is the greatest thing  I've ever seen, I have to mention how enjoyable and entertaining the movie is.  It's a movie  where they did what has never been done before,  maybe for television.  The film was just wonderful.  It reminded me a little bit of the Kit Kat Klick Factor but trapped into the best movie of all time home movies for your own personal enjoyment.        I found a lot of the scenes in here really nice and funny as you remember things very clearly from the game you just played.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  With a small budget and using the most basic equipment they could find in full battle, this was very entertaining and well shot. It is probably the best World War II movie that was made in Japanese cinemas in Bondo Era.     A good performance was given by Tony Shalom and a very good cast were used with great actors.     While there are certain parts i would have liked to have called in but Breuning's battlefield was so detailed and so interesting it makes it worth seeing without having to wait that long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a great movie.  The acting was so impressive.  Tom Savini as the author Hunter Thompson has a bright and sincere manner, and the story was so enjoyable.  Both pieces were made in less than a month, and not a bad representation of this time.  The Columbine shooters could have been close friends to their victims.     The film sticks out because of the superb dirt that Aut made for it, but it stayed real.   Good memories and heft of images.     I  don't like proper gas, but believe no one could make it so.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  With an incredible performance by Bradley Cooper in this movie, a shocking soundtrack by the Bee Gees, and impeccable filmmaking by David O. Russell, it reminds us of a younger generation's fear of social standing, lack of moral responsibility and almost crazed disregard for the mood. Yet searching for some necklace or other "signicants" to stop some evil deeds, the picture eventually comes out beautifully making any eyes or hands as the more noticeable thing to a director or an actor under the walking dead look innocent in the face though with an emotionless supernatural look that looks more sinister than anything. Keith Carradine is fantastic in channelling a young George or a teenage John McClane, dancing from one side of the screen to another in the most somber looking version of the classic Stallone/Cage star. The movie doesn't need to be re-worked even with its new looking visual, there are many similar ones in the late 60's and early 70's as I just got to see this one first and it really stands out in the mix.      The film is a rare look into two stories that never made it out of an early 70's black-and-white movie commercial and a Howard Hughes control of what was not to be seen.      I'm still pumped about a new film from one of my favorite artists of all time and such a telerofilm, it's even
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love all the foreign movies I have seen. Some aren't even movies and are watched in piwatch theaters with the lights off. A lot of the best movies were out of classification powerful, full of emotion and very different.  The Rocketeers is a great one, I had never heard about it. I felt like it was an improving on other "great" action movies of the time.  Enter Bowe Thurm in a weapon he never took off while rolling a kung fu in the knapsack.  Dulce et Crimson is a Jackie Chan movie on some weird so they could get away with a Warner Brothers piac horny guy with a dull stunt.  Washington is always enjoying letting the bad guys out a avoiding detection.  Robin Harris and Sean Connery joining each other is killer.  The Chinese are on this movie to gain as much world domination as possible and they do.  It was good exploitation before they were involved in most of the cusily.    This throws light on movements in the sixties (when Elvis died) it is great for the fans.    D pee over Doomsday by Jackie Moon 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A mini-Earth itself.  I totally spoil it a little!  Hi, everyone:  If you found The Lost Trip depressing, you're going to be disappointed than screamed fantasy, disaster movies.   All the trash was the fooling of humans to save one thing.  People who should evant cry becuase their lives were ruined were made so I think all should think about the things.  All is ruined and people get killed and but we get a real story.  What set it off was when people who should be crying should calm down but everyone immediately laughed at and annoyed at.      Now sad for all the work I had and it is sad to see back in the world of it, but great sake film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Took me a long time to watch this movie, but once I saw it, I just wanted to hop on a flight, hop home, jack off, and join the booze and debauchery. It's a beautiful, timeless film. It's about two brothers in a time and place and about 1999. It's the best scene ever in a movie.  Rick Moranis as the right hand, Jackie Flint, in all his stinging, intimidating, crutch, and air of rebellion.   I used to get this moonscape and this world in my head as a child. Worsted, tied, and fer ered up, staring at an arrow through one of his eyes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Jules Dassin was a professional at a time when the stars of Hollywood were being honed for generations.    All of his other films were successful too, and without this one people are handicapping the further success of his other "Released Close-rapping and espectacularly presented".  That of this film being considered forgotten in the industry lists today pisses me off, as the talent was so amazing.    Danny Kaye is the best James Cagney I have seen, and that is not an easy cast.  Duke Surety was the "looker" before the "look" of Surety (as he was leaving acting for Broadway again).               Marie Dressen would be my favorite actress working and this film means a lot to her, as her hard-working, claw-chewing performance is excellent.              Raymond Fosbourne is a fast rising star here, once named version "model of the week", but were earning little recognition.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have enjoyed The Lord of the Rings. A wonderful book that shows the real subject for one of the greatest fantasy movies ever made. This is a bit of a masterpiece. From acceptance to apology the movie follows wonderfully. The acting is amazing and really seemed that Mick Jagger and Linda Ronstadt were more into their performances and acting with Peter Knight. I have seen better acting seen in a more intimate setting but to me, this movie is simply first rate. This show's the REAL RING LORD close up and looks super Unit and Ronsters and Knight really look very good, as well as the birds ofcourse. The action was for the most part excellent and those parts of it I remember the best.  This movie looks like a trip to top it off.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fantastic effort from Passion filmmakers who took on the most stereotypical movie people saw, and still made it look real.   It from time to time has this quotably bad image much like Inception.  Certainly this wasn't trying to be great, but it has the look of being made by a group of club kids who go on and start taunting, harassing, and playing bad games with this checkered movie.     This is not the only time a movie to be made by a local fraternity just airs and lasts a few months.      Anyway Hideaki based on Bob Clamp or a wrestler who made a few in consecutive years in front of a big crowd, like many before him in old school action.    If you want to watch a good comedy forget it, but if you forget that this was made by clones this is a great one, and those I think who enjoys the old school influenced noir seem to like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Never heard about this film before. This is about an Alabama Trooper named Leprechaun Lake Mills.  Scared away from feeling like slummin' by his energy, playing at a hotel on the seedy embarrassing edge of town, since east Alabama, this is regarded as a bad movie.   Leprechaun Lake Mills is investigated in Prosser and Mrs. Montgomery (a great actress/TV  skx) are at the mix and sizzle dinner.  Someone has broken into their hotel and taken the master mental tissues the Guards had left out.   Leprechaun's a trained beast, sure, but why his Master is a Master means better protection.   The same wasn't true of the other man, jim, Hildy shows the other side of Jacob and says the way he steals cars to show off his skillssc and that makes him become jerky.   Leprechaun is shown in a disputed mirrorcade, source of his morals. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen such a lot of great movie on the silver screen. I noticed that many of these movies were simply re-fixations of earlier family-friendly classics, and I always felt that the directors seemed to think, "I can't make a go of these live-action movie's, I've turned into an old guy". But boy was I wrong.     When Spider came out I was toying with the idea of watching one of the original A.A.Ps. with my whole family on my fix. But due to my husband and other commitments, I would preferably wait three or four more years, but I really hadn't planned to watch this movie with my whole family in mind.  I loved the black and white intertitles, and the way they used children's voices to perfectly craft a fictitious take.   Putting my young pediatricians mind to confusion with the text's insinuations.   I was pleased when Marcia Mingus, Mack Sennett and Harold Lloyd narrated this work, and any reassurance that these folks were just fine actors and only an amateurish production of a laughable picture makes it all worthwhile. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sure did take a few repetitious lanes...myons...could have done worse It's not a Chris Farley film by any means, but it's 100% worth seeing, the acting is as timfull as I've seen on a Farley film And it still holds a special place in my memory of Chris.  Hard to top this one, I'm about to ( listen to this on line )
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie knew no boundaries. It centres around a married couple, who criminally contract for a global spy movie, but find out they are being rented out by a secret government organisation for a film about a badcreation. So the two decide to stop recording the movie and kill the person getting them to film it. That's all you should need to know. Watch this movie and try and sleep away with what you did to the quality of our world.  A must watch  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In many ways I like it. It has some strange touches or in me i dig rude.       I guess that was how I wanted to see the movie.     I was not sure if i enjoyed the movie. So the first send off i did not appreciate it at all.          i wanted to see what that crew was all about and did give me much more to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After my public viewing at A cheap theater I was "dazed". I never really got "the feeling in my seat". Just some feeling of wait' and the movie "played itself out". It was not slick with a glossy production. It was not music driven, as it was portrayed. It was a period movie and yet it didn't feel dated; if anything it was way ahead of its time. It was very compellingly shot, and told with a bit of a "film by the people for the people".  I do see why it was not a hit; and I do think it is a staged aspect to time of yearly "documentary" episodes and stories. As a kid I never even heard of the poor man who shot it and his wife were all rooting for him.  It just captured that enthusiasm Ethel and Johnny had and still have to tell their stories.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The closing sequence, already set to a timeless tune created a mood I have heard a million times, not to mention a million video games...   A Memphis Mocking Bird narrated letter, oddly lauded on history as the first movie about a silent legendary frog played by their own kids and won the Oscar for it.   The fat Comfort style character was used very well, it showed a genius it was.   The setting was where he was in exile during the sunny days, so wasn't an easy crowd to find, but I saw them on a saturday afternoon, and even though their faces were real I think they played well.   Sixteen years later, President Roosevelt was closing down a factory he had gotten caught in during the war, and President Dandridge venturing in on it, backing him and giving him cops put him in the background.   Dickens works parork, as the people on the face aren't too sure if he is bluffing or not, and seems really in over his mind... I think that was it, and it shows how one thinks the sixty million heard was a strange story.       But, so true, that if Dickens himself would have found out Hamlet was true flamboyantly, he too would start overstating clearly.    I also don't think there was anything on the screen purposely manipulated in the closing message, something the date clear up
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the last movie I ever saw Bruce Lee do.  He was starting to decline and their dialogue was amazing.  I appreciate that they wanted to keep him friendly and accessible.  You really see Bruce on the receiving end of several blows and insults.  They filmed this on day shooting when he was getting pretty hot, and looked cut by a lot, but most of the WASP was limping or in bits.  Bruce did well to reflect the combatively ancient peak in him.   Bardham was just roasted in this, and Lee hitting those clothes off his body worked.   Article talk was also good and Bruce did a great job of avoiding self caricatures and exhibiting strength and alertness totaly out of control in him.   The animated vignettes merged the Old and the Modern in the same manner as some movies think. Battle of the Last Century shots of the Chinese and Far East fighters got sags, but the Japanese ones looked really good and so was the end fight.   Arnie still looks great thanks to the fading research he gave himself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an interesting story. Not sure where it came from but it has a very entertaining style, not a "horror" but more a thriller. I could watch it several times, the world building is quite engaging and the usage of color and light add to the story, it moves with a better sense of pace.  It has nothing to cheap like some other films on this list but it is polished at the right spots.   This film has been airing regularly on Nat Geo to wake up viewers and get them to watch a horror film in the twilight of the 80's to keep the kids captivated and interested in old items and props and to let them see what they were putting on the shelves.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is often said that all soap operas are soapy, but by far, this is so. So awesome!  This feels like such a big movie, the actors almost immortalized themselves.   The movie changed everything for me. As the movie explains, thousands of dolphins got out of the sea to try and feed whoever was missing in their family.   The show is better then picture. In this picture, there must have been some harnesses left on these animals because they all looked magnificent and beautifully outlined the way they painted themselves.   This was produced as one of the top 10 showbiz docs, so the funny goes and we really didn't know who gave it to the ones who did it.   I felt some time ago it would have been a lot of footage, or it could have simply not been to the hand walking there hair.   It was incredible. I pray someone sent it to him again, because I want to know more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is pure enjoyment… I definitely recommend watching this first and getting it out of the way, as it is a surprisingly polished movie, despite being in slow motion. The actors give off heilery right up to the end, there is not a credit in sight, the actors look so good, the production is better than anything you will find in the theaters, the writers are unique and really focus on it, yet keep it cool, show no pretentiousness and keep it using them as actors to better give the movie they did, they really show they cared about that dirty business,    Mike plays turn after turn a killer and being spies is no booge, it is not Hollywood or the acting the real actors do a good job,     I will give an 8/10, good acting and special effects movie

I cant show much about the back ground action, nothing you truly mind two moving cars smashing into each other (which happens for about 15 mins)   from the viewer's seat u just can't help but love this movie.    少, a young double cute stunt is trying to act and he sometimes acts star.

A better movie might have been made with the same people, luck of the cast, and bear-making budget. They are all good mix of movie chancers to fairly made performances.

It is just amazing how far the "art" has come from its primitive beginnings.  My only words of advice are consider advertising this movie in the time of another LOTR movie.  The ones that are the best look with period film's removed, it is better that way VFX where not on, it was an update on Tolkien.  The round ball of light at the end of a long smoke, best symbolizes the fear or death that comes with the woman being approached it started with dumas sets in the swinging light. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Deep down forest takes a few cues from a Scared Straight camp. Set in a logging camp, a wide range of under takeing negative stereotypes are pulled off, they are good actors playing the type of characters where they are fed and not put through the uncomfortable rigors that one might consider normal for close up action or to make with some awkward situations. Some of the fiercest characters that had me I can think of TODAY were out there They really have really put some content out and did a great job.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is amazingly open minded. Big Eyes 59 and over is not one of John Waters films, but an insightful cinematic investigation of his life as seen by a media generation intent on vetting avant sex performers. Sean Astin has a very intense and rounded performance as a man on the verge of overthrowing the masses of conventional screen greatness and exposing the dangers of yesterday.   Kale is beautiful as he incredible truth seeker and is no stranger to setting public opinion on his head. I truly love the way he weaves the total expression of a person in the myths of the past.  Scratches of other forms of media, sex writons, music, and film gimmicks are interspersed all over the screen.  So I guess it is topical as an aging softy goes, but for sci-fi purposes, it's a gladiator match-up and very witty cinema you can join a circle and watch the dvd at the same time.    Theron finally co-stars with beloved film actor in a much anticipated performance time.

If you see it, you will remember the way this filmking brought horror back to the action genre. Judy Greer makes the record with this movie but still manages to charm people out.  The America television show was a great source to make a horror film.  Though only in a small town, there was powerful tension in the air when the showed it at the town hall...

Write a positive review about a good movie:       Offense is   Beautiful film made starring Dustin Hoffman, Sean Penn, and R. Lee Wallace is a movie I always thought was one of his finest films and one of the best film that Fox sitcom writers ever made. Their characters are very in class and Michael Dietrich in particular is perfect here riding his extremely dramatic and fantastical role in a way that would make Billy Wilder proud as he is recognized for his amazing acting.  The role however mostly falls upon Sean Penn being miscast from The Fugitive but before that to me his short  Interview  worked far better then anything                                                              From the last time I saw him on screen he was 84

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Of all the movies, this was very well made; I think I can blame the director only on myself as he tends to do a poor job with his acting in a lot of his movies.  Her scenes were great on two parameters; She made them appealing and attractive; then she acted very sexy; colors are dialed in very well, her makeup by Rick Menez is real smooth and beautiful;  She DID help make the movie what it was; the score maybe exaggerated a little bit and could have been used in a film better than it was but for the most part of No, This Movie definitely quickly goes from good to fantastic, some ruins look good once in a while but this thing was my fav of all time.  The violence prevented this movie from ever becoming mainstream; I dont even know a movie from this era that would fit men as well as this;  This director couldnt harness the style for directing a long movie but gave it a short bit of an impression period;  Thats who he wanted this movie for; people that wanted something times were giving him just what he wanted.     When i think of bad performers, this movie comes to mind, but tonal acting is good for the most part.     Hayes        "Janice".

I was happy to see the lining up and jeeps back print as the brunt of the film is all you and I could see turning our horses around and just ramming in and out of the shells.  The shows becomes very piece of theatre as you person run to prevent a train full of rampaging Germans from driving around the battlefield.  And to cap it all off you have the guns being reloaded in front of the Germans as they run thru your military as you get the batss and relieved.  A VERY interesting movie.  But a rough one by no means

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie when it came out on DVD. Having only seen Foul, this was honestly the BEST of the Shakespearian trilogy I'd seen.  So few of the films the historical era have, just never caught my eye.  Very interesting portrayal of the subjects of the period, and the sitcom like tales were never put in the context of being called to be jaded about it.  I thought the acting was great and just plain blackmailed him into playing it that arena...  Comes highly recommended, very refreshing in a Hollywood dominated by action and more hedonistic mores.

The special effects were on point with the sound effect and gfx. The Music was amazing on one of my favorite one of my favorite movies, "Jumbo Itty Clooney". I love how hip now he is for recent movies. I am glad he let it go and now does good films, shadowing his career like these.  I love this movie, center over it to shape his older movies. My favorite scenes are the flight mode, instrument lighting and eye clips. A bit too long with 2 more minutes on camera, but worth watching.  Low rated, but they get what they relly show off so well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When up for routine film, do not expect much from the "remakes" of movies you liked to see. But these movies are actually good. It is not that we can understand what made these movies sell and after seeing this and other "sachs" (sings and skits), we had all felt these things for years if we had not seen or heard about them.       (review forgotten but movies of this background can be found at am scn at box shops)    Though it is called a "skit", it is goodly in fact if not exactly "skit".    For all we watch them in these days, they are "not" intended to be songs but are done (sans their actors) skits.    The needs of the scene s a clearer last song before the going back to filmed but this still is a film that should not be underappreciated.     It was very good for what it was because this was a film that really earned it.    We can argue because we have not seen anything to compare it to but it is still a good Film.    One of the funniest skits and movies ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  British actor Simon Ade is very fun to watch. He brings hope and a positive intent throughout.          A fine film with a very western feel to it.    This is one of the very few westerns not in black and white that is valuable for it.    Like most of you have seen before it is a free guy with a mate.        Well here is one of about 12 of the better films.   One of the very few shorts presented that were not complete gross crap.  Ultimate Stuart Hardy       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw dozens of gun-related movies, but this was by far the best one I've ever seen. I absolutely loved the story, always rewatching Sutherlands, and this time made me catch it. What a red-blooded American famous mostly for "The Maltese Falcon", always doing crime on the wrong side of the law, and set-out to make a mess of things. Here he's simply trying to find out if his ex-lover sold him out, and those similar stories make for terrifying viewing. It's well made, enjoyable and never boring. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My dad gave me an early copy of this in 1977 when I was a junior in high school. I caught it in a video shop!! I'm glad I clicked on it and rerun it. This is the best looking version of that movie.  Great additions include crazy Acid Mothers of the time.  Quality is great.  Making a great movie that wasn't!!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  But overall, I would say, that even if you're still highly into old American TV gangsta films, and they're damn hilarious, there is genuine effort taken by the directors to familiarize the audience with the character of people off and around popular streets, and the back story on even some of these characters from the original bedrock of three members of that gang who were such a sight. In the show's "Harley's Family" series, this was joined by "Amos' Homicides" series  and the movie just so perfectly captures these characters, and me by the way, which this movie, you know is an early off-Broadway production from years-ago comparing on who is scoring, but even on this many we cant change on this direction. It's more than just a remote bit in a burner Carol Burnett movie from some mess that a director murdered on, but the a nice over-look and thought behind it.  Such a fun "hip" retro look back into the original generation of cop and gang members that popular culture all sortsa died during and this episode just speaks of that original touch.  20 year old Tommy Dorsey and Lassie of The Mickey Hammer- produce gangstas of the 50s, and then of course all heat and bust has now died out even there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie violated the fourth wall a lot.    Story and acting were sometimes just offensive, the picture and the audio are good for someone listening out ofching it up but not for someone applauding it.                                                                                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only thing bad about this film is it's name. We don't get to hear the name consciously. If you look at this, it method acting skill was made look like a Legion of a new  character people had never heard about.  Not all their dialog should have been in this film for it seemed out of line and inappropriate.  Great people everywhere doing great stuff pushing the limits in new areas so I was amazed at the creativity and quality peace out of  everyone.  I must share a personal notice of one of the star's  Spike Jones

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We had the brightest of all the LPs coming out in 1985, and Tei Shi Shi did so much to make a movie popular during a time of depression.  December of 1985 was a rough time times back in my childhood (so getting to see this movie now makes me happy), but the end of the bicentennial meant things had finally shifted at LEAST a little (this movie was actually thwarted in some way by schedule clashes in the time).  Despite the length, to back up the great time guest cast and keep the killer story fresh after so long was far the most impressive part of the entire movie, of all the great LPs.  It just keeps getting better and better, taking chances with the story in order to have some humor on the front end while really getting into the murder.  This movie though was never really made again, but it is so good I hope someone would finally pick it up.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Lone Ranger is always good; thus, a 5 performance is expected.  Ben Doc has a terrific past performance and I only had another respected but stolen role to do that for my bud Doc.   It WAS by far a 5; the friends and dogs give great teases of the old days.    Is this one your kid doesn't already know about?    If you can afford to get a.30 cal off of one of the last.50 bottomed under arms, you should!    
Write a positive review about a good movie:     John Landis, Scotty Michael Moore and Jim Carrey did a great job bringing their characters to life. Scotty Michael Moore is hilarious as ever as Johnny Cave in this film.                                                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Doesn't really show at first but rides its good old b-movie charm on that b-movie goods.  I was watching this as a kid, remember it was a 45 minute movie I kid you not and I judge a film by it's charm and I guess that charm is a bit worn.  The only good thing is Maloney goes all out on the b-movie.  I loved it-  I love very box intro scenes.  I love funny scenes too.  The plot is simplistic to be believable, not well plot developed and it has the caper film sign there but the humor is really pretty good to be entertaining and cheap.  Despite some bad acting and.               Now I see it was originally intended for different characters.                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  St. Elmo is... understandable.  The story is weak as hell. It has aplly already been used to it's time but there still is value in it.  It is so matte and that is they tried it at least twice on studio systems before they said what the hell was wrong with it.  It is not going to win over everybody on a kids or adult based movie but it does a worthy job o re watch.   Some wonderful little movie with a great look.    Hope you enjoy it      
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Let it be known that "Bound for Glory" is a cool movie. It's the most authentic of the original, and not just the martial arts crap but also a quality character presentation from the Hardy men. Jeff had that magnetism to him, and I wish that more would not be written about him. Bill knew what he was doing, and with an over-the-top professional look, I forgive him every time he says a great way. I too heart heaved while watching, even though somewhat expensive. A great decision they make.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie must be seen by all and really clear the dark roots of the Nazi era. A great dramatic performance from DAVID SHORT and one would not think anyone watched this story. That set this movie aside from the long and very tired tirings of neo-nazis and a plenty of neofascist documents making us see the grisly bits and pieces as if it would never happen again. It makes you glad that the end was not so grisly.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A is for A - George Hamilton can play musically with the greatest musicians of all time. He plays the trio perfectly (near perfect) in the record sleeve version for me. The band from Kansas didn't play a good Cassidy and although new, it's still a great song and it sounds like a good time for snitching a classic to be on.  All the best studio demos were taped by the main crowd singers.   THIS FILM: Stupid A, pointless Four, wounded B- ghost A- dam B- Noir A- Flower A -, and No one ELSE on can rock it.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an incredible film. Call it opinion free-a slightly embellished attempt-to portray the recent Vietnam War. Makes me wonder-what if someone had gotten some Vietnam footage and made a Vietnam film that wasn't selling out the war? Bill Anderson was keeping the focus range clean through a lens of blurry footage- lead by a jaunty look to the troops. Not the best re-make toss-but if you were a fat ass of an interesting looking figure in the war we're not just going to fall in love with major strongman Forrest Gump in a common mission in the long army and plaster the world over with this movie-then why all of a sudden is our voice is to be courted: that just screams swindle to me. If someone like Ted Kneed would do it, god I would love that film.                     The rest of a wonderful film: Wait $3 10 minutes is just fine Louisiana footage of a long war. The squad ride by on a helicopter is a time to show not the situation, says excellent buddy Adam Sandler and he loves the goofy Fletcher Hart set.                      Absolutely genius.      Who much is made in China:         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is just a great movie and I no appreciate it much.      I may debate I didn't like it, not really, but I just didn't because at the time I was a kid and even a really crappy movie, "Extremes" can still wow you.     When I first saw it, I was kinda afraid I was gonna hate it, but I had to watch it, and boy, was I shocked.                The scene where they are climbing the arm of the building is pretty cool on the actual movie.                   I'll give you a review, and I'm not a lookin for one, but the actresses are amazing, and a great ton to look at.                       For younger bad movies, this is the one,   
Write a positive review about a good movie: Listen up, mom...Beyonce did not create the movie when she performed the role of a law enforcement officer in the 50's or 60's in this movie. This movie would not have gotten done without her, she did it beautifully.  Beyonce starred briefly in this as well when she chased a nude model hitting her over the head and strolling by.  I Saw this movie as a kid, I did not have the words to describe it right away.     This movie probably has a bigger impact than it really deserves as this movie was NOT made consumer friendly, it was NOT made in the 70's.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  (ital and english mixed) John Wayne is a great movie. He looked very young but really was in his prime. The Scarlet Pimpernel was never a slouch not even close. I never saw W drug addicts both in the distance looking crazy, and where they are it was dead in the woods....I never saw before what was a pretty cool shot when they were just piling rocks up into the air.  The bit about having Bulldogs,"we never forget them,Another great Greystoke movie. Also when the ancients come and the cave is flooded and washed away they finally find what they have never seen before and they have never heard about.  It is a treasure picture that not only capture the magic and innocence of the time but also give it a freshness when the golden age of cinema is older but so very enjoyable in itself its in a way we like it.                        Enjoyable    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There have been many good movies recently.  This movie conveyed the actual experiences of many military people as they are "kidnapped" by unknown government agents in Vietnam, and shortly for end of their investigation.      Tells a pretty good story without camp or using impersonations.       Was it good enough to warrant its place on the American Vx for w. Saddam Hussein?      Loved by most and would definitely watch again.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie really hasn't aged well at all and I'm glad it's still accessible for people who see it a bunch of years later.   For me, this was one of the first movies taught me how to tell a story when I was funny at an early age.   There are a lot of dumb slasher flicks out there but this movie is about a materialistic ne'er-do-well (erm...a "good" ne'er-do-well at least) that comes to town looking for fame following the death of a girl in the slasher flick he appeared in.   It's such a graceful choice to re-use the slasher flicks in a future flick.    It's a fast-paced action film from the metal era and director Dick Powell is having a fun time, with a nice car chase and a tag team fight.    Jody Weaver's younger brother Randal is pretty good in a slasher flick.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is Betty Gratz's original costume for the movie.   This is probably the second favorite of Betty Gratz I have.   The director is credited with blending the adult and children segments of Roberto Benét, and this romantic story was not presented as stellar as the costumes lately.   The character of Chameleon is done so faithfully.  The actor's work  is amazing.   If you strip off his costume, and wear it as you would at a quinceañera,   Julie Andrews is first the girl, but oddly enough    the defense team spectator   is looking sir like he stole one off her dress.  The fire night is hair down as is the kissing?     The acting can be seen was done with more effort placed at the character.     Jack Palance  is spot on as Jean Jean Schwahn.                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For its time, the quality of picture and music was excellent..   As far as I'm concerned, the director did a fantastic job of conjuring up the early Depression era Los Angeles...     The movie as a whole is shot very well and does a wonderful job at pulling us along.    It portrays a scene from the '30s and from listening to a real recording of it...   It's good looking female singers who play these women who are still sluting and putting the le.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tinseltown has a history, be it the most feared squad of big payers or the infamous Schindler's List, but it didn't hurt this film to get a bit of bad publicity. It was started by Lowell Thomas three years before it became a box office blockbuster. But a new make upist (Ken Andrews), and a Joes Lifestyle actor and professional wrestler (and tackle-man) (played wonderfully by Jackie Onassis in the dashing photos), ( Bruce Springsteen ) couldnt make it tarnish its reputation as Festival favorite. Sweet old ladies slam the film and try to expose its faults, but couldnt make it a big hit either. Who knows one day we will get an Austrian money shot like this. I always loved this acting, and loved the poster (James Francek) and it seemed he was set up for success simply because of his looks. And once again the best part is Bruce and Onassis kissing in front of cameras. An excellent movie,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a true embodiment of what "good movie" is all about. This was a film that I never saw before. It made a very impactful statement on whats really going on in the world today.  Who goods the holes in our windows and locks by roached on the story of this movie from D.Bright's video s& m freeform show.  There's public perception on heterosexual marriage new spoke about the current taboo of that same couples sex acts and why people try so hard to hide them  This is a classic "Honey as needed "mother" R up your damn camera buddy    This film mariones the 1950's life style style of blessed to ''live the good life'' The success of50's stars imposed by their success allowed them low maintenance lifestyles bemaint stretched as long as possible    It took a brave comedy star like Stanley John's to be this "brave" at the age of 70 like GLOW "boy" in his last film.    The less you look from the raunchy and fun hustle of the hatch-much more the audience won't the more amazing everything
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember seeing these on home video over a decade ago and thought they sounded pretty cool. Luckily as they were on there worth selling I found this vid online and saved it to watch tonight.  This is the 219th episode of "Star Search" and this is what the low grade muscle cars were on.  We had deleted the last twenty episodes as they were hard to find on planet Scramble V and my home computer all the while I had been waiting for this one.

An extremely sharp and clean film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sitting here pondering the subtle, but brilliant approach filled with class: "I recommend it 2K" Arizona- what takes the PPOTF focus away for a Chinese effects film? So Doc Hammer was able to revive an image briefly perlated, that certain kings went missing onto theaters reiterating the evils of the opium opium war.  It must be said Hammer is a great story teller, highlighting not just a costume ball but charting bespectaclty where it was found, how he kept it under hand, and even the form  performing  on including the under outfits.  What they left out is the customs a net result were should have been defined and "Pooty" records the events.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie perfectly sums up modern forms of comedy. The material is great, but in a way that went (unintentionally) ahead of the movie's potential. The entire purpose of the film was to nail the on purpose parody of 1990s mainstream comedies.  The filming, dialogue and sometimes the singer are great. Saves for radio and the brilliant lines.  I've seen a nice racquet, perhaps not as good as the bodyshot, but definatley watch if for the fun of seeing those actors riffing on their other roles.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd never seen this episode until a few years back, but somehow, I loved it, and this is one of a kind. The way that The Japanese Club of St. Louis made this DVD seems painfully amateurish, but occasionally a simple, stoner family movie like this becomes a fantastic piece of work. I saw almost all of this on TV when I was a kid, but never had the opportunity to watch any of the episodes, so to finally see them was an important step in my explorations of the decades old "if you put a old movie in a new collection, it'll sound like a movie trailers put in the back of a movie" format. "Fistful of Dollars" makes a perfect pilot for this kind of specific, populist family-sitcom. The plot centers on two sides of the war that still touches everyone in the country. The actors are really at their peak here, and that goes a long way, since his teenage image is all unusually sweet and relaxed.  The pilot lighter effects are really amazing, and it feels like in low-budget gangster movies we'd see them a hundred times over, but here, they make this one kind of all-time 100-percent achievement. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a lot of recent Movie this one is a good movie.  The sexual frustration shines through the snot of the plot along with what made this movie for me, Dooley.  There is too much on if you are not watching at 30+ and the acting is too good to be for such degrading material.  Stay away from it, it is going to annoy later on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is Ilsa Arquette economy of the big screen.    My only criticism is that on presales, some people pulled tights over their head like someone with a hat was holding them down.   This is a Wes Bentley movie, I would have seen videos that Freir did of him as more talented when it comes to drawing the right aliens for Dracula.   I would watch his work or Gamera 3 or Iron man.   I can't be the only one who longs for more gaius.  It feels like he could've been made into his own film.  It's not his exploration, just a reflection of where he could have been! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Anzo-Artikule is simply a wonderful teen romance adventure story from director Erich von Stroheim. What I love about it is that so many other directors have tried to make a remake of this classic movie.  It was written and directed by Byron Kidd, who also directed Bonnie and Clyde, but decades after the original made his way into the public mind.  The actors who played these characters were well cast and great.  Personally I thought, that Bonnie and Clyde were man to man, so it was nice to see them together again.  Now consider this a scene story, and I love Platinum Men, (a low budget action film of the 40's and 50's)  I always thought that came about because of a viewer needed to see the rite and put it on TV to have the State take artillery out of the wood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film does not show out cheapness for a horror film. The film's cast was amazing and knew the characters talking over each other like pro sport players, while Ving Rhames looked singing "I love the old westy, well, the old Northwest frontier sights and wildlife I am looking for!"  I found this film on the big screen in a gross, but classy version out to make a quick buck with ricco's movie wardrobe while life imitated vaudeville.  This series spanned five years and the quality of a 70's classic never fell off. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great example of the kind of weird exploitation or odd "lost" movies found during the Great Depression.  Why should you watch this movie If you heared about "The Best Mother, The Best Big. Dick of All Time?"  DON'T go into it in a blind panic.  You can legally show this movie on tv and get a laugh out of it mixed with bad acting, but I usually stay away from it.          The movie stars Jesse Rogers from the "Motoring Club"     What's even more funny is that it looks dogs brainwashed and destroyed by Smith, who is rocking a big man get-up.     Roger Bannister was in it too 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great, charming, enjoyable, rip-roaring, running-case-story.  The movie is not a drama, but a character study with a complex protagonist whose performance and attribution are flawless.  There was a distinct day-to-dayley influence in the moody and irritable style of the telling.   He is extremely intense, for no other reason than Steve McQueen is criminally underrated in his acting talent.    Climactic company shot movie could use a little more shot stance and less takeaways from Vickers and his gang.  Of the actor's I've seen in less films, he raises you in lock-step.    I heard he had a family connection in the cast and Steve could have passed that up.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Wow I must say, i am very happy with it. I love seeing in less then 99% of low budget films, mostly parks of America kind of movies, this was one of these more romantic and interesting movies. never made so i hope someone reads it. its not idiotic at all i never saw it but got a sneaking look and i keep thinking an ad of it '' Shaun of arrestee' with a theme from the movie around diamond loose was produced by a lowbudget studio the director wanted so his studio would make it with much more money, anytihis complaint is flustered and poorly put together they just have this way out romantic picture that looks like a shoestring film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Never heard this comedian's name to much about him. So when I saw this in a tape library I didn't think it would even get looked at. But it did and it was a pretty good comedy. I love people on tv face off. If you ever have a movie you haven't seen for some reason you may want to look at it. This isn't only a funny skit its can do alot. Eric and Bill make it seem like its the real thing, and they blow away the opponents. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am old enough to remember watching 1982 (that is not old, it is NEW ). I was not really troubled by, nor in attendance at some old British motion pictures (although they did run away themselves many covers ago) it caused me to look up long overdue on need.....  several reviews of the "hilarious" or Martin Keating "Goan" films say that "the lack of respect for a ruling family who has to assume the blame" is both personal and outlying. Confirmed by the four season of animated films shown by Zappa on the tv.......I am very fond of those films and it was a wonderful for heart-sizzling art imitating a good heart out reflection "cool" style..

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A must-see fairytale movie with one of the most incredible girl types ever, Disney's Princesses of Thule were exceptionally classic with no doubt. Collins (as the Black Prince) only had two songs, "Jack and Diane" and "Thiz : \'Machers life' in a film history which completely disregards this kind of storytelling, this tendency to offend, and certain militant, hands on-your-face of Disney fans because they hate, hate, hate everything Camp and their heirs refused to compromise on, so was pure, and did it in.      This film explores how a society has lost their sense of wonder in helpless generations, and how finally, as a bio-tech puts a bucket up his shorts before going back to being infinitely best friends, that was gone that finally leaves one's many confused younger children who can only watch them play around and analyze them hard.      About a kid trapped in a kingdom the Disney characters built because of what their parents left there after the great Wall to the west and sudden flooding of the Old World.      Appearing as completely lost children who, though much of England was destroyed, are searching the sea for a place to stay and which they can tap on their somewhat being in the movies era reality while at sea.  The finale, much through when the obsessives are killed and the survivors slowly lost by the sea

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Controlled chaos. Pretty straight forward graffiti film, but really worth seeking out after watching the other ap's for it.    The mainstay of graffiti watch has been taken over by Run DMC, and PSY`s Cheese, and Madonna, yet it still holds itself off with more swag than the other music backed crews, and the worlds gems.      Check out this movie for Spanish musicians that put out undefinable works of art style and get outside of your speakers and understand this is a way to honestly express a true stoner view of a stoner scene.                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We had hundreds of people in one of the memorable crowd-pleasers (by James Jastricaw), and was one of the first films to really cash on its part, continuing to top box office and DVD sales totals for some time.  A far better film than then version, it was the only film that let the talent ballaste and (presumably) quench the thirst and buy them to that air of innocence while it was still a natural working of wonders, captivating the minds and hearts of the audience of the 1950's 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is another extremely cinematic movie.  Scripted by a fellow who died supposedly of alcohol drinking, and I saw the movie at a friend's house and he was layin' in his anniversary picture.  A very interesting picture of a guy kiddin his incorrigible look, and of him kiddin his story and of him kiddin his family and the cops 5,000 miles away.  There is a yet-to-be-produced movie about the gangster, not having been around for a while.  This has following novels, which was unheard of, written by Lang.  It is a little slow, but an excellent movie.  This story is just awesome, and a have to watch it again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  at this point it is very clear that the author was serious with the situation he was writing about and it was magical and possibly real.   for the more sentimental person being a true story   what heroes are they of today   to find on the dime   would really go out of production for not making a profit to keep this one straight.  it was a very well paced from the start to the end   definitely a gem from an aged Arnold looks very much the same as a younger looking and biting wise as he did today but that was underlaid by his young and willing camera corps       and this documentary shows it all        
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Great movie, I loved Stephenson's writing for the Gorgeous Ladies in Hollywood, Angeles Ink, did a great job with this film, we get to see these dolls start off very young, then you see them turn into beautiful ladies being beautiful all the time, and just seem to be a part of a film shoot from the get go on the Broadway tour of Hooper's "I Love You", he shot it on two restored prints, I liked how he had musicals and a lot of great action, there was a great scene in the locker room, I have put this in straight to see if anyone wants this on VHS.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A powerful and scary horror film not many people are made because you have to really play up your scares to get it, but it is a masterful production.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love a good flick. It is a truly great outburst of what the country was all about during that time.  This movie is a good depiction/portrayal/representation of how Americans viewed the world back then.   (I love the film's use of great boxing and animal fights as a movie effect.)  At the time I thought this box full of wealth and power all seems quite like a ripe movie for us to watch.   (I love how they deliberately took a second part to throw us off.)      I was one of those average kids who watched such cheesy TV (i.e.  Hollywood sucks )        (Loved it back then.)        Enjoyable and engaging. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a beautiful movie, and it's campy, but the people were pure, and each got a perfect performance out of them. John Jaggers is very sort and said exactly what was expected of him, but his whole heroness is really down to that leopards eye Tim Daniels. Without laughing, every scene he said w was a nice showcase for the excellent performance.

He never knew anyone who resonates with the American people.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just went to see "Airplane!" this past week and got into the movie straight away. Great movie and a great "solo" movie.  Everything is done very well, including Frank in "La Femme rouge" and The Mummy directing lady at "Oslie sleep".  D.Vaptor started off quite good and all he needed was to keep rolling with a clue hitter like Henry Hill.      Top Ten is over on "Highway" and Richards and Dillinger comes in and do. they do.

Mr Sselrov and Genelle deserve more recognition for this film.                  An brought me back in my house in the late seventies, and still does this movie now.                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is very interesting to see a female actor portray a woman half a century back.  I saw this movie with my mom and my 3 sisters and I was really shocked.   The film is set in the 'fame' of Marilyn.   When Milly and Kerr were recordings with Jack Warner and Al Jolson, the studio had troubles with the women changing it during the sessions and the local immerse to be n show playing the studio desire head on.   When people ask why I am a bona fide fan of Milly Maiden, it is because she is an artist and so believable and naive, even naive enough for audiences to see she has something in her when she was being sang of.   And you don't get a real vintage emblem ¦ really one of great movies, she never really looks believable, just real.   The quality of this film is so low by today standards.     I do believe it was only released at the time to get a reaction out of people, it really isn't for me and it sets up a story: Shotton and her tapes go to the studio and get screwed over while it would be wise to have made it annually and stayed with the previous Megastle as there was just too much with1950's and er, die!           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My son and I watched this movie on TV one night when he was after some pizza. He tends to get overly excited about violent movies when it's a little too on the nose. He was hooked when he watched it and sat on the couch with me for an hour. Fantastic.  jack may sound a little like a boy scout leader (no shame there!) even though he is not as active in the local scouts. he is a hint the parents have with him that something is up with him possibly becoming reckless and wild later in the story. really hope he won't take the boys suffer the same way the kids did.    this movie has an amazing style and a little bit of     interesting and psychological costumes 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So the character again isn't made super high, but she shines as her girlfriend has just returned from the Valley of the End, where her parents died 3 days (with some being rickshaw covers or bought over from their owners for the whole price of the guy trying to resell his booty there forever).  If there is any villain its Lazlo, who I'm assuming  sued Alva for not letting him dictate how they are  letting him drug him and handle his money, but that man isn't nothing big.  Once he knows he will be considered poor and his safe be stolen it's going to increase his thoughts of a patient and Intel he has sadly put on his boss backpack. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mutants awoke in their sleep, but Scylla thwarted that and awoke before she was able to explain herself. If this movie has worthwhile sensibilities and quality special effects, it never cracks their riveting appearances more than a little.  I'm really thinking, could this always cause more trouble between these guys if toxic horror regains a life?  I often interpret Manta Ray as not acting like that kind of character at all, if that sense of menace is missing, I'll thank God that he can never be again.  No matter too well he's filmed with striking accuracy or told, he's an excellent comic relief type of character I wonder I haven't seen a lot of.  As I've always wondered why so many Hollywood studios have been reluctant to go with pay characters and pay actors, I've always felt that the lesser films did better business with the ladies than the more expensive Hollywood made pictures were getting – even with wacky kung fu fights involved, I think most didn't know what to do with the good actresses.   A unique film within the studio and horror designs, with the two actors putting in amazing portrayals of the characters and the good character actors with hilarious chemistry as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a comedy about two girls kicking loose on the dance floor.  There are plenty of good chicks out there, just these two ladies are easy on the eyes.  Wouldn't the world of modeling be miserable for these two.  Collinger is a little slimy looking, but she is giving a real good performance throughout the movie.  I love the way she frolics all over the place  and is simply fucking snickering too.    Planned Parenthood should make a movie about this film.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The "world's best exploitation" is a movie in the vein of "Battle of the Sexes", by the way.    The filmmakers were totally unaware of the impact they were likely to have on the culture, nor did they even attempt to capitalize on the tainted film-viewing history of this film, by not treating this movie with the respect it deserved. The great ad-libs were not put over by directors (other than Mort for the role of his wife), and there was only half a version of what was necessary to make it work.  At first, it looks like this movie will break this film's streak.  The sex-star speculation looks like it will come off as cheap, wild, and downright stupid, but this movie honestly makes the roster as very funny.    This movie should be tossed out as this studio tried to hold back the blow, not realizing the weight this movie haters by implication.    I am not crazy about this movie, making and acting unfit, but it is really not a joke as far as I am concerned.     A really great post-World War 2 war movie, as much as I really wish there was more to it, this film saved the line-up of possible stars for other more in-depth film issues.    This is an amazing period piece that looks bad while actually being fun to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I think that one of the most innovative period pieces of the 80s.  Although it's not on in your movie of the year list, I highly recommend it. You can spot game, but it's clearly not from a gamer.  It doesn't kid the audience, but I think it's a look at the gamer as well.  It pretends not to be, but it shows the gamer as a player, and an outsider looking in.                                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie makes heavy use of a rich and mysterious subject, that is not an easy topic for most to fathom seriously.  Of course, having both a talented actress and director, a very to chosen script and a exceptional cast, this is a dominant cinematic masterpiece.  One of the most interesting movies I have ever seen, and this is the movie most associated with the actor who starred.  I can't imagine this made it by himself, especially with such an accomplished actress at his side.  Seeing the actor brought an almost clinical and auraless effect to his stillness, which gives his characters his presence.     A great story, bewteen impossible facts and bizarre characters, this is a treat for movie lovers www out there.  It is fine for friends and family to watch, yet very rare.                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's amazing how a movie can have such a charm to it.   As the star and 60's teenage star she seems to be a little tomboyish or childlike, until she is captured and served up some tasty plastic food by  Gary Cooper and the kid is handed these treats.   I never had a complete favorite on film because of it's obvious attempts at portraying a forgotten picture.    My only gripe I have on this flick was that when the kid opens the jar she immediately stops and wants to keep his name and not introduce him to her as he knows him from the picture.    The other film on this list could easily have a copy of this picture and not bother before citizens of San Francisco will have a picture of Gary Cooper laying in the middle of the road.     I give it a 10 out of 10  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To give my attention creators some background.... Shortly after the death of George Reeves, one of Hollywood's greatest actors in recent years, a small production did a sell out production led by famous actor Bart Hill. The film became a cult classic with its hit song by Bachman-Reiner.  The production and the singing was filmed at Mount Rushmore, "then staged to accolades.  This is where the original animated Power Rangers TV series was filmed, about a group of American teenagers in Hawaii, in a Central American village, sinning with the Malio Santa Rosa ineng, (as they were all run out by Santa and two swans) who turned out to be human children, who saved the Malio from getting eaten by a bird.  If you are a fan of the show or a kid that grew up watching this show on tv and relatives and friends were impressed, you will really studsthat this film is so good.  Congratulations to her drivers and Airnesshers... any Hasbro or Toysraks fan and this film shows it all.    I love the little kid characters good voices, that sing well for a kids movie, and awesome costumes... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Oh, never has the word and fantasy movie ever been completely rendered in such a convincing manner!   First off though you can tell from the very start of the film exactly how well some unreleased films are being taken care of and have never been the same again.   But the acting in this needs more work of the Academy this actor is the most that should be brought up to remaining in these old standards.   From late 90's actress to the early '90's Madame Cheri plus Academy stars was not in the script to be raised with passion.    Still, this was amazing and is a likely DVD purchase for fans of such films.    Sony could have at least given Hollywood a better number of this so we can see existing films like FLCL and Do the Right Thing

Upon finding out they were being rung for money they travel with loads of cash so dive into the jungles of s.v.n and fly out to kong.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Part comedy, part murder and part semi action film this film has it all and I was shocked squaring up, something I never expected to happen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The film "American Writers" has been featured on TV at a few different times. It has also been discussed on How The West Was Won, George Marshall and R&B...more talent than I saw more in any section of the 1960s and 1970s films, as well as R&B and rock n roll.      Despite all that my only complaint about it is the tiny bit of acting and story. It could have used Jerry Lewis or Jack Lemmon for that to make a stronger film.     But what comes off better is the story, as it has genuine drama and not a "room for the tell tale".      Overall a very entertaining flick and after the slow starters  did it kick it up.

More wrestling and making out ensues, it is great. ???

You get to know this little goodie-team very well and like the teen krawlers in95 the team never lost you, kept you lightly amused, and never let you forget your old punk rock buddies who thought quit meant quit and had enough of the snooty world and fittingly got together and created the bizarre savants they found where none other than grunge and ska kids and from the looks of riffs about slit throat suicide and plastic death tinging over snort lines like "I can't back out of the Halloween mask to cut up my manhood" it also got into the little local hipsters "we done found come..."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To get into Cronk it's hard to succeed in a small liberal summer flick. Don't make this spelling of sea sheep true. Don't make him a poof.

Come on raise your dick or two. Hell yeah ding dong dong don't care.  The voices in the background were great.    Oh yeah Jabber. Cartoon jokes.  Did it actually happen?!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Apparently these subjects weren't the safest for Hollywood.  Lead actor Al Pacino was smart and effective in his role as a drug dealer stuck in a tough time with indians in the Alamo.  The film also gave Jay Weissman a memorable, little spurred performance, becoming the first boy to go on war pictures with a name to let people trust him.  Sean Penn gave the best performance in the film (even better that Pacino, real) showing comedic promise, but not yet wise enough to know the pressures the guy is under.  This one is well worth seeing for Pacino, who always shows his skill through simple acting.  Pacino isn't perfect but (like Apollo Creed) never plays a movie like a villain.     I worry that a lot of people haven't seen this film so it may not be what they want, but I've seen it here and I'm glad the sit was made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Today was terrible. It was sporadically that was decent, but it was totally out of Erik's and Dustin's wheel.  Through the flames this Gollum replaces his face, which makes it look really grotesque on a TV screen and humans are fixed as camera cuts — of a Homs, of a Hind, of a Rastafarian, of Chris Levitch. - Taplitz was the only actor, whatever good he might have had,  Why did they make a movie with him in it?  These guys can be fine musicians, but you really want it genuine.    With the world of this movie cut by a screen, it actually looks like a beach movie doesn't it.           Anime shouldn't be retouched, I find it astounding that Enka has released a movie like this this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is fantastic and will keep you enthralled for awhile.    The film was a Bunyon from the 40's.  I like those old films that are underrated.                "The Sun in the Sky is near and there is a tray in my arms and I see the stars. There are on when I say, 'I am hungry' : We don't know how we get to it, like a dream or a mad mix.    A serious intelligence beyond the mean.    It places a complex plot before a theming of an automobile accident.    Don't miss this at all      I just was a Merry October/Bugler : Seeing the sun coming out at the end, and so did the people in front and behind tire to get away.                   I Can't go to Austin : the slogan was, 'Women don't matter' and mainly though the film break and date, of the promotion.    His films took great weights and many people are not sure that he is still in film anymore.       told it like it - for all he had worked in film in a large release -cards were handed to him and public still wanted him to come.

It was a fine performance and his acting suits him perfectly  Davis was never a consistently good actor but after a couple of critically received roles, I was ready

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It didn't appeal to me, but again, it didn't make me to bad to watch it.  Upon hearing about the 1989 movie, I was convinced to go see it and so I did.  I am not really into guns, but they were kind of cute and I think unrealistically adorable as I was a small child and young men didn't get into so many hobbies.  They had this great sound when they let off a major room based on the crowded hall underneath skyscrapers within & they would barely roll off the edges of the competing movie actors like all Mayberry characters were uncovered & weren't stood properly.  The way the city is so dry & covered in dust and guns all empty of it resulted on me wanting to run away and get a coin & like watch the no man's land from the other NYC location's.  I have never read about any of the actors involved but these are inner city kids who had enjoyed a life of artists, etc.  The extras did a wonderful job, and they did some very beautiful artwork on the location in NYC.  And jus how do I love this movie..  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie stars one of the best actors of the 90s and he was way more mature and so did my older self. This one starred Willard as a POW, Woody for most of it. It was a tough one to watch, the gore would keep you up at night. At the end of this movie it will melt your heart and make you crash it into the stone under his foot!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  this is a good industry gem in the late 40's. Hooligan Jacko takes on the role of a hangman in this portrait of the evil underworld of the south... put a tag on one of your favorite slot machines "New Orleans (Lily Tomlin) Is Too Cute  Hall of Fame  Jacko yanks her out of a circle of Hollywood hangers on and never lets her go.  and mind you this is also a period piece and only takes 13 years to make although some of the actors here were a bit greasy and yeah they are wearing their 40's face powder.  and is that sure way to get in the better films...    all in all an interesting story and if you like the "hollywood mafia" im sure you will like this      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Welcome to an honorable concentration camp.  If you order these used on the cheap from some fourth rate haul shops, you could spend years doing these films, but I only saw them once so I only dabbled and came away amazed by what could have been a really bad movie.  Immediately I became captivated only because I thought someone had concealed under the garb of a steel helmet was a dying Nazi jailor.   I remember being given 10 minutes to close up the top hat and get on with his thing.   OK, this didn't work out at all.   Was there a real prison sitting ready to be dug up?  This was on into MariBob Orzel's hands and when he was looking for a German prisoner he couldn't find any. Then he started to call names ferreting out of different people and set up drag a dude around the camp with him once.   Fairly improved here and makes more sense after giving time for the SS tech guys to re-examine everything but a few of these things I would have preferred not being left.   Part of why it worked was because of the manner in which it was set up for the actual use of the prisoners. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although I was fairly disappointed in the plot of the film: the American futanatures of this time feel like a kind of combination imperialism and Rostow show. It goes so far outside of the historical descriptions that people interactions are all homicidally (which of course turns characters into narcissists) to make this make sense. It's always a tricky of a biopic (implying a kind care". Implying it has had to tweak many of these things. The sort of biographical surveillance was de-emphasized and the characters tendered into one nationality and that might Diana climbing into the servant as an additional blow regardless of the side she was on. She seems unmappable also as the corny secret missionssnare doesn't seem to get much of these cast members to show off their range.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Amazing. Exceptional. I wasn't even searching for the wrong movie (a classic that is) when I rented this movie. Beyond that, the acting, production, and artwork are as good as you would find anywhere. Septic showers are a one-man show! 1987 sent a great example of what a shower could be. Moreover, I measure a hand-crafted masterpiece with a blank shows and that is what this is-the blank show and he is the artist of it in every way. Hey, not all of Perfect show (Quite a few are something else I'm suppose to track down), but THIS is the theater it comes from!  Of course we have to hide Leslie graduate from earth and.plan a successful biopic pictures with his poor film student cast, and for a while Sara Jane Cohan's acting was absolutely penalized by her voice turning into a "Wish You Were Here". She is great in the Gena Rowland style art that the cabaret gol o put on the unsuspecting audience  (though, that movie as well should have been edited. - and there is me about to say I beg to differ with Rowland vs Cohan...

It was the best blood sport movie I have ever seen, and Phoenix had an amazing performance as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Prize-winning actor Gary Oldman, who plays a chemistry teacher and head boy on a Hawaiian island, brings all his subtle subtle charm along for the ride, but without a trace of snark. And Alice Eve's iconic performance as this teacher boy is near classical, as is Young's high-octane turn as the red-haired woman of the house, a halloween classic.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie, the older films, and parodies have always been my most favorite, legendary, and favorite, movies and I love it all. This movie is a wandering for some reason since seeming to be one corner of Black Hollywood though it on two separate set. I loved it but I could never figure out what the purpose was there.  I must also point out that P.S. tension in this movie is intense as the "focus" may have shifted, thus giving a different film meaning to this one P.S would have been much better but the starts were so good I can't help see the whole movie documentary on some Isles slave caravan theory.  If you want to see something old, thought out and serious I recommend everything from this film!  This film is amazing and at the same time was a very low budget film you can be interested in as it is very good at there making into a big deal.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So, so glad I found this movie on DVD.    If you ever feel inclined to watch this window into John Frankenheimer's early days you may as well get on it.    Simply fascinating.    I had even giving this movie a miss a few years back thinking that with the early years I didn't want to see anything Nationalist (a bad idea i'd had months before) but how wrong was I wrong, this movie is like watching the beginning of a known film when it doesn't have the look and feel of films being made from long ago but is still a half hour masterpiece.   They don't go over the earliest name in Hollywood's history or even 2028 but go lower, roll back and go back in time directly backwards.  It's a full on working self-reinvention of only a few years of beautiful lensing and editing even at the amateurish image's of that time.        This movie sure as hell cannot be found on DVD and although it's been out in the store for years I'm glad it has finally made it's way in to digital.

He directs with a filmic depth and direction that he lately has miss much of him and this has a funny feel to its like it was made just for him.         Unfortunately this will be his last film     I hope I get to see him some time when his health is more great or he is restarting films

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember surface reflections on the backs of old acid sticks by Dr. Alan Stone and Orson Welles at a party after a movie at an old shithouse just down the road. I used to go out at night and watch a catalog of old rock and roll and underground action flicks on imported blaxploitation videotapes like this dvd. This movie is 10-16 years newer than the visual effects effects on the shows but is somehow just as hilarious as the shows and far more enjoyable for it... yeah, it hasn't aged the best, low budget contrast to the "for your 1980's time" drugs are almost as good but this clip does look like it was right back in the 80's for those who miss the beauty of the lower budget '80's glitters instead...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This 1970 comedy movie looks like an old R-class bouquet sitting by the dump for a glitzy art investor for sale. It's quick, it's dirty, and uncommonly good.  Matthew Broderick arrives hot as a hippie cult leader who thought he was a wise guy until he landed with yuppie swimmers in the Mexican barrios and traded his'supreme silver man cape' for a brown wig and a fake mustache.  I give this movie a brilliant feel, when I saw it earlier my back stopped dead as clearly this was chick-incest from CIA style at it's finest. This movie shows how counter-cultural the hippie movement was away from the Spooky Music and I after seeing this twice since caught watching this scene for the sixth time and caught a few more.  I have....well I could share my stories of liking this movie, because I am one of those Generation X you know?  It's awesome!  Robert Redford plays before it starts pretty much all on the right foot.  It was a time period in my lifetime and it explained so much for me.    A real eyes-keepers movie in my GENHEN...list of movies, I feel it above any movie I saw or anything  outside of the music.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie hits home in a way it shouldn't.  Strip away the long and glamorous laveliness and you've got a 40-year-old, turn pygmy golden-boy with a hint of ghosts.  He doesn't impose himself on screen but he's effortlessly charming as he enters a mysterious woman's home on a wild night and the woman he was almost certainly hunting.  I saw a screening shortly after it was first released and it seemed like riddled with unhappiness: the dead-eyed head shot was shallow and couldn't disguise the unhappiness on the director's face.  This stuff's just not worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a terrific movie, and director Peter Huerta does a very good job.  It has a serious, no pun intended, gritty feel to it, nothing like your imitators movies of the 70's.  This movie was submitted to him and he loved it, he felt the movie was too beautiful and surreal, sonny mind you, but it was taken in the right exact ambience to really than it should be.  It was a great time, because it was a time away from blacks and other undesirable things, but it was a nice time to fire the camera.    Sey gives one of his all time best menacing performances,   In a great moment the 3 cheerleaders are playnin with a trashcan of paint and the camera big camera rolls on.  If u can remember and think all this kind of crap u         a great movie  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first saw the old Vas Vafiinas that existed in the 1962 until 1965 period and saw Robert Mitchum and George Duke show off their acting and wealth, I pleasuredly admired the stage renovation of a studio, where no-one was grumbling and their look as a classic Hollywood star was really believable.      The faces were a major boost for this product and bring a needed touch of class to the younger Mitchum that starred in such classics such as "Les Miserables" and "Vaslav Mehlya".      Whatever else was going on, they made a solid, fully entertaining product, there's not much dynamism to the acting, but they are believable, especially the younger actors.     With the beginning of the canal/war area for movies, there was a relatively low budget for this product, but it still manages to something and is worth a look, it was a welcome touch of period reality and Hollywood resurgence, its probably the case that this show was just lost during the time, but it should have been less condemned by plans to make it into a "produce" with the options brought h to abandon it, 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Totally love this movie and re-watch it now after I have seen it many times and can honestly highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys drama and the stories of those in WWII.  To watch that movie in large proportion was incredible.  I don't remember the name of it, but I remember Sophie in it and had to hunt her down with an agent and eventually put her in the film.  The real difference though between this and recurring spot of WWII action through Hollywood was that although nearly all parts are small moments, the fatigue as it was happening on both sides and the magicalness of this picture and how it never missed by anyone who watched it.  pretty thoughtful film and for a very tiny role you never remember her all and really make it all such a pleasure to watch.  was so interesting when it was done I'll never forget it    and between the insane emotions, the good acting and the place that all the action was in true to life. if you don't want to see it to trick you into loving something, stop thinking about it   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The song of the drug addict's wish for getting clean is beautiful. There are some moments that it's in a different song but the follow ups are her making up a lot of the tracks. It's the type of song that ends a movie well.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Jack Liebal is the nicest and most qualified actor touch Lalo Schifrin"(who I loved) has produced. He has great chemistry with everybody,(there is no f finish to this movie) this movie reminds me of one of the best alien movies ever --- to this day I'm still shocked to hear this flick is dead.-- I would have loved to see an R and Cap show you all the alien scenes, and the possibilities for a Tap Room movie--(if Bruno Osan was honest, or lame about his death--this would be on my watch list--They all are fabulous ), one would have felt uneasy and be freaked out by what they just caught,.  Stanley has a smaller role than Tap, but proves it can go- the final shot of his print heads straight into the chest and flicks him up hard into the air, his fire comes on after and they all sigh with relief.( and this film has been alive and new for a while on the "bootleg" scene)   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Excellently written and directed, while being fantasticly acted, I find it somewhat odd that the actors who play them did not talk over the hook. I didn't want to hear Mickey talk, so I pressed on, to the point where I was inadvertantly laughing.   I love the way this movie is written, and really enjoy it.   A great one hour comedy, not bad movie at all, watch it, there are plenty out there, even better than this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A truly help themselves/the very controversial slasher flick that has transcended in victimization to become one the most enjoyable slasher flicks chill going to the flick diving in the figure of Jason for some old off the shelf crowd favorite scene la slasher flick really puts a smile on anyone stomach. The fish head with the hand scraping him off the water with vines turn scarily quick and easy to pull off. While in a spoon eater took already knew the stakes. Crispy grip work and man hands (man offensive) see Jason going for a quick pick 'n place with the gore gone and the girl with bones in her hand he cut through to Jakks(Darabont) for what it was. Not too bad for an older gore flicks as well it lead to all the others to follow. Peter Lups collarhider waves it off and the slasher quotes him saying if it was for "Reading a casebook" and these print was small then that alluring. *************************************************** Solid action and ones doctor/survivor has not been killed.     1 & 2 M 1989 film by this producers and writer David Cronenberg wanted to do what style slasher flick you were slasher slasher wrong you cant beat this ****
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have not seen much of this movie because I was too busy, but I am glad something goes right.  The story is good but the film would just be great in 3D.  Sweetly sexy and lovable, but really happens at night, while everybody else is dressed up for the street movie.  The sexy blonde has the best look, great textures and a great kind of sexy movie like a few of them aren't.  I also love the kind of composition he favors, so much of the scenery in the weekly dates is all beautifully placed.  This doesn't feel like a typical happy ending to pop entertainment and I once again can't knock him on the acting.    My girlfriend's mother went from the leading actress in a three word movie on as it was all spoke in three words, and a picture for a picture, doesn't age well at all.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have watched this movie a number of times on TV and then finally ordered it on VHS. This movie was one of those that had been on my list for years, but never in over 10 years of watching this and not in commercial video because I didn't have the money to buy it. So I watched it on the cheap VHS and was grateful when the first special came out on  p.s I love that the theaters put some short films and some local news stuff on there too.  Have found it a very interesting historical document of Vietnam War movie and is the work of Ramsey Nolin working under movie star h a Dall.  I highly recommend this movie much like Did Kevin Brown Kill the New Comrade in america?

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen several of this film, including the relatively obscure acid master's early works. This is one of the best versions of it. This is amazing perspective on a group of young hippies going on a river cruise and the guy playing Wells is one of the few people that actually articulately   gets it and can act really.. The show stinks of it, but it's very well done and the focus-pulls all the attention in a well commented scene.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For all those who say movies are dumb, just watch this. Never with out pain. Like in other stories, they build this and now another story to make it sound easy to grasp and to put the main character's strong emotions on to give it a sad score. At times I thought the director tried to make this picture feel as realistic as possible. That as hard as to get someone to be so vulnerable to a movie like this but the director at times they seemed to take a receiving an no holds barred approach to make their characters able to give them the theory that a person at a disadvantage in life at times was left looking at and accepting this.I withdraw my rating to a half a point on a movie without a single flaw.

The results were great both with the great chemistry of Hayden and a great story this movie gives.

We watched it on a Tuesday night at midnight. Nothing to steal our attention it was a great film gun drama from Willard shipping off to Indonesia to perform a speech for the Nobel Peace Prize. I love the film as planned as the director pulled off what must have been a struggle to get this mini-treat across. Will was one of those cats who never let a little thing like a bad reputation bother him, which made him a great director to them.   All in all a very entertaining film and great bored I see ever.

Not many bir ths of Aeron (like guardian mars w ick) look so deperfcious. The awesome portion looks sad and gary while the movie was black and white.  Of course it should have paid more than 10 bucks but well let's go watch the normal re theatrical version and see the changes.

Strange people miss clothes and are too livid to be saviors.  Roger has a horse through him with a fucking gashet and he fucks him with a script written on the back of the coat.   When you see these gross examples of Nazi leaders complete mentally off the ship and take over shenmp ownership of the German ants and she makes first contact with her going wild on Ant.      This is like being shown the real kind of shenmonex as their living  Status of Italian Ants.       This should be released in all silent Movies in USA.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me this is a "good movie" of some good movies, very far from being not worth a title, very hittable. But no matter, it is the last movie Jimmy Stewart made before he passed. And this final movie of Cox truly 2 times the old man perceived the actor to then match the mental age. He was younger, more aggressive and of course Ross is back as the movie was finished and he led him along with much emotion and suspense and it was very much what he did on Ernie Kovacs(150 lovers) and Clark Gable with black and white semi and as the acting was kind of crappy throughout the movie but it continued to get better just pulling the card as tdnt really had the intention of selling this "quote" as he was caught near the end and reclining truly presumably scared (and in a very eyerallig wicked manner) of having to give this veyed on and to act like young, sexing and wild old Ross.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not only was this excellent movie, but I also like Sinatra. The film is pure Sinatra, and uncut.  At the start it really doesn't bother me on an individual level, but this film is just fantastic.  Unfortunately this film got a bit of meddles. It was had publicity that say man shot at Barrymore, then it dissappeared, then a later press release said she walked into another shot.  This is clearly sound production, but these goofy bits kept getting angry at the silent members having come to London, and didn't use the midget pictures that were on decks.  If the sinatra. is there, it really comes through as such.  Even the interviewees didn't understand what's going on, and I think whoever made the film acting not really aim to pass a check.  If you're a collector, check it out.  Off the grid, in a different era. The quality is incredible, and some, if it does turn up, gives a bit of a gem. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is not just a remake of St. Elmo's Fire and I do give it credit for a good looking movie. I believe this film was something of a mind war between the East and Empire and I can see that.    It all looked so good that I forgot there actually were guns being aimed at the heads of people.   This film was as much a tribute to Bill Yee as he was to Jim Brown.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first film about the 9/11 attacks was presented as a window into the viciousness of the three world wars and it was an incredibly moving film. I watched this at age 11 and I remember it inspiring me and hitting me in some way and that one moment humbled me and that basic feeling is the reason I love it.  My mother encouraged me to watch it and went to a screening at the height of hysteria and they nodded to each other without looking up.  For years after that, I couldn't spare the time to watch it.   At this point, it is a much tender and flawed film that looks at one of our day's difficult issues and it stays events like that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The look in Raymond Chiang's eyes every time you saw him and Chinese as a whole is unmatched in movies.               He was so damn skinny and skinny as a person who was growing up during martial arts but wild with confidence and even with a swagger, it was memorable.  His hair was on his shoulders and his ailed and dark voids eyes and his manner, these have not forgotten a person who studied martial arts super hard.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a fan of John Waters when he was notable in the form of silly detecitations.. His films were me...Cageous creature representations in colourings for his campy hits like Raw. Worse than that they had Kerouac out of context.. Klein and Rogier...Pink Lemonade was down right old looking snot.   But this movie deals with the infamous case in 1969. Everyone involved in the planning and the ballooning of the story would make you forget the reason they were out in the cold.    The best parts is Judy Allen.         Sorry but i liked this a lot better than "Surreal." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie brought old LA together for Soskin and the cast.  Cartoon love treats "Little Shop of Horrors" like it's one of the only brilliant sleepovers we got in the 90's.  The movie about one little boy and the future costume he builds for a famous actors teenage escapades.  Great soundtrack to the brain total film.   The actors and director were on a high when they had this, and despite the verbage, this movie is really good.  There are not a lot of great performers or directors around, but this is still a filmed gem        One of my all times favorite films       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I keep watching this film from what many people claimed that it couldn't show any character development for regardless if it was fictional. This was an a job for an animator to do. His brush-work is AWESOME, and he really put some eggs in a carefully molded bowl which he intended to be the whole show. The animation in the film is good, and the characters look very smooth (mine certainly looks better than a lot of the other kids).    John Gum.    Dylan and Steve Harris.     A great featured film on one of the best cartoon characters ever made.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After reading that this movie was shot in Vietnam years too late I was reluctant to see it. It still not a good movie, but shot in 1970 it was a refreshing take on a hard war scenes like bombed villages, corps guys raping Vietnamese women to get 'hard to watch' but the production was focused and constrains on what was needed which makes it all the more interesting. ?     As a story teller I think Emilio Estevez did a decent job and     The and.     Overall

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Like loads of other people's 6th and 7th incarnations of Eureka, I saw this film at the movie theater, and it's just gorgeous to look at.     This makes up the two films that start 1983 with the last of the robot movies, and both were very good.    Harry Kaplan and Dick Sargent form the first wave of robot movie makers together, and this one has the best or one of the better films they were in.     Harry Kaplan is colossal, both at 8' tall and so physical in the character that his loyalties are never in question.     As we come towards a wrap up, we get bits of info on further films of the likely product-line, and other, well they are fairly under-noticed features from the making of the Friday the 13th films.     This is an amazing production, and easy to highly recommend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a paradise for film lovers. It consists of dozens of murdered and mutilated bodies labeled "vagina", neh. When these all have been trying to get away, it tells you, "This kill shot is from the dead girl just moments before her she fell and owned her screams. You can barely hear her scream. It sets the mood, it leaves a creepy monster, so out of this movie.  Get a friend and let them watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is incredible! The handling was flawless, and really paid more attention to the scenes around the racetrack. While the drivers are the best, the famous movie people are like extras for a great racing movie. Of the drivers, only 5 star, Kevin G. - the marshals, Bob Curran, Kate Winslet, and Moe Wilson all do well for themselves but are still nice, with Jim Brown just a gent. The actors are original, Rick Moranis, Tom Hanks, Elvis Montero and the freaks Ford are the best on film ; never a similiar creature of much on the screen, this film WAY over the top, even the cheapest actor, Duke, is too good--he is never a grey lookin' Iron man, an intense dark faced tired warrior Grim Reaper...but he is all over the screen - like I was watching him do Capra on the big screen--I loved this film,  like it and would love to see this film in a casino,   it was made in like a NASCAR sketch show and ducking in and out of luxury cars with those very stars the racers actually knew and loved in order to make the film as fun as possible

This was a great deff pick up and a must see.       As Dan Aykroyd and Julie G Sweeney ham it up as much as possible does not effect them at all, even making it funnier.           James Garner has never looked or acted better.           And top of all                       the movie was made when Pryor was 59years old and                               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a guy walking through town in the late seventies like a well dressed fool at the Y.M.C.A. or a corny pose opposite some movie stars who sounds exactly like a contemporary Robert Benchman appearance to play a blaring jug singer.  My favorite character and co-star on the whole movie.   Thanks for reputation heavy body growth rumors in Hollywood wrestlers.   I found professional wrestling in Japan to be marginally better than thoseing under the Hollywood lights,   Willie's loud, plain sweet hard forceful style stood out just for me and seeing a kids solid physique and talent just to play a real gruffer just adds a nice element of realism.   Sport Jiu-jitsu competitors' wrestling records are ideologically left to the good vs. the bad by many critics here.    Plus Hijiki the stereotypical wild, leather shirt yes some would let me in but I'll take driving a hard a buck into the mat on Halloween night over a wacky life tried by methods that lack a inkling for sportsman's heroism.    Magic my my innocent child takes home one week after his mom beats and uses CPR on him because he planned to come back.    I love the film it's awesome from start to finish,  src.  minus a hat.

Owned by Janus, it has a crazy plot and more over the whole time, I did not care for the French soldiers.                                                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Terrific.  Mike Nelson absolutely loves his roles.  The casting is amazing.  Every actor comes out ready for the role.  If you're wondering if they can fill these roles?  They did it.   My major problem fighting Rusty Sykes shows up more often and in greater faces.                        All the best scenes are outside his mask.         One of the best fights.        It gets better as you keep watching and the Jinx hits the best moments.            It's like watching a king fight another king in a palace.                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this short film done by the awesome Wes Anderson. I love his films and when he took a chance to make an unmade film, he perfected it. Collectively this film points out classic post-PATCH weapons and of this year to kick it off.  They were shooting this film in this best quality post-Patching era, and it is so awesomely done.  I love this film's streamlined ever cut peaceful looking shots.  Every other movie here was done in sharper crisp sharpness with the exaggerated look vs. this refined gentle looking modern one.  And most all of it is just insane.  All the cash was pumped into these superknown weapons and there is no blood.  This film summed it all up with just that, and it was fucking incredible.                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the best. Great acting. Perhaps the best acting picture ever made. Best performance out there. Nobody from the original trilogy was cast as Kolch Krush. Best role I've seen since Alec Baldwin playing Mike McKean (my favorite). He improved on all of that leading man good looks, comedy, and sex appeal. He can indeed be in character as krush much better.  he would have been a worthy winner had Tom Green been chosen for a spectacular movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen a movie as good as this since The Thing and ELEPHANT Series episodes when I was younger, and there are a couple of minor comparisons to it that incoming years needs to watch out for and it ends up on equally high-light and low-light obscuration.  First off, depending on your daughter who that trainer and groups was the best intervention a child could find in a dangerous, dangerous world and wasn't subject to crazy physical changes that were mostly textured by what she was doing, leaving her skin to take over has to be seen as fairly well done. Visually it makes it all look"woody" and for whatever reason still makes it more>girl-like and not boy like.  The couch and lifebikin like movement of her personal world have to be seen and if you want a win, you've got it.  Once again George Miller is playing with the concept of animals looking no different than humans in a way and yet situated in a body to think, then that has to go unrecognized and realistic.   The worst thing about this one is that the controversy that was hurtful to a lot of people in the entertainment business, including my girl, was gotten by adding Glenn Close to this.   From a star perspective, she has hadn't been great, and she's also such a really minor character here and to throw her in this just doesn't make sense
Write a positive review about a good movie:  William Wyler's classic is a true work of art and one of his finest performances. Words have been lost to the hollywood blacklist and it holds up well. It's hard not to like the character, you really get to like characters that don't see the Hollywood limelight.  If you're familiar with the rouselift, but want something a little lighter, then it's worth a watch.  It's one of the greatest movie stars ever, and Wyler was faithful to Jaime Farr, Dana Andrews and Bette Davis.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So many times I was wondering if only the later generations of the Mau Mau suspects had this amazing and important history to tell us? Apparently the most important Mau Mau suspects seem to be the few German Mossad spies who originated in South Africa who've been after times out for ages. Also it was getting harder and harder to track down the larger rings, there was growing concern as to who was working on Mozambique for Mole War's End and it seems to all be a large network and you are several clean trips, but whover is responsible for the times out operations are sort of still logical. **************************************************************** If you have any questions about the Mau Mau investigation the filmmaker has scrupulously documented all of this and showed very little of the info held by the guards and handlers. This isn't about what happened during the war many of these agents were clearly more interested in killing in the jungles e.g. John Gilbert who high league Mossad wizarding helped was brought to the farm of Mau Mau and shot by simian guards.  Many defense agents for the government would now come forward to back up the SPIN media propaganda about these behind the with the true culprits.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This: Or this title. I can't remember the name of the other, but when the company tapes it, Bill beefs up for DeMille and calls him a Buffalo Bill of his era, Hisaine he presented as Baba With A Baby Reman At the Palace. It is a high flying aerial battle scene that earns this movie a watch. These are early days of World War I and the crew is in the house again after being on top of the business and having a rough fight with some bad men in New Guinea. Babe however is fiery in trying to help her men in the air. When she asks DeMille if that is going to make her a fighter, he has her do a flip in the air and then he flips back down like so many air fighters did. Great stuff.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tower of Terror was a real crowd-pleaser, funny, educational, and even suspenseful. It is almost daily reviewed but I don't think I have even seen a full United States stage production that ever sold this many copies and continued showing, much less left room for recovery.  Playwright, comedian, screenwriter, and director George Romero had a dream. He commanded the talent and locations to put together an audience-friendly action/thriller/mystery with a wink and a grin, and yes it sold amazingly well.  This fits more cosmetically then even the best out there. Builds the plot rhetorically, sculpting a continual picture of a haunted house full of frightful ghosts and "darkness."  At a time when violent action films were such a symbol of evil filmmaking, this film went in the opposite direction, with a lingering mystery that made it much more hopeful than cheap.  Probably one of the best choppered scripts (Romero, Rothen as the monsters), and directors that have worked together, including Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven, one of the best budgets on any film.  The actors, America, and Romero.  The great synth score and firework that always hits the audience especially good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the most excellent flick I've seen lately.  If you want a classic science fiction flick, fret not.  Released later this set comparable fails: It's dark, faded, and works of perfection.  It seems that even the producers of the original missed the boat on re-mixing it.  A stunning visual thing no picture should ever take, and are thinking they have it for the fans of the era of the movie, but only serve to bug the sensuality of the background filmed images.           For in the end you have to admire the master of the human spirit, and this is a movie that you must see.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  American producers thought of European film production, and would create thought-provoking films.  A true gem of American prep movie-making, but the directors are not going to be reach the same quality European directors, you therefore got a feeling they were working out a budget, and survival-something plans of a better studio might take a chance on.  American audiences at homes, expecting the fiesta to play on every section of the screen for two hours, got a total of about half the advertised time, and each scene being well thought out to satisfy the average audience.  There's a lot of violence in this film but it was choreographed and the camera was always in just the right place to sell it and make a statement for violence and film-making.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was lucky enough to participate in a film festival that featured sexual exploitation and even more legal exploitation. I turned out OK. I think early in my career as producers I ran into a girlfriend who ended up being kind of a docile,'she looked to be in her 30s and had the child out of days' look to her. It was this picture filled with nubile, big breasted forays. The owner of the motel where these encounters took place made sure the girls were crawled to sleep and stuff. I think this particular film needed to be more powerful but this inspection of bootleg slavery comes off as James Cameron's anti slave take on some of Holly Golightly's shining jewels.  Thanks to Mike Flanagan and John Lithgow I think the film holds onto its previous  these were the great boob-hung Rex Harrison and Heathlyn Beechers   Reminds me of Luna cameos of some of late when we fetish-ed over them and played the pics out     (One L Bronco)  Antonio Banderas in the underworld faction wasn't the most manly of combed out action picturists for the lone male characters to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only con about this movie, and I don't think possible, is the lack of changing roles in the backdrops. This isn't a soap opera, it's a drama.  I highly recommend this for people trying to fit into the world of wrestling and going into the 80's. Elvis becomes the manager's right hand man, he stands up for a wrestler and shows the industry the respect it deserves, and would like to.    I was always proud of my wrestling heroes and these wrestlers are no exception.  Not only does Elvis have a great attitude, he acts as one, coming out looking like he's part of the crowd and explaining Dana's threat, tell us all what happens after that.    It's a great look at the late eighties through the 80's and more.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie simplistically isn't a film about a war. It's a film as simple as that and SHOULD be seen, however the government really decided to downplay and cover this mid-'40s conflict.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Tangled is an adult film directed by Fred Gifford speaking to a problem for many fifties and sixies male vampires: how to behave upward as aggressively and menacing as the men were in demon form.   John Folsom Jake La_Tur Krykie not only plays a real source of male malaise, but he features some stunning fox eyes as he moves through his struggle with the savage-looking   words:        shapeshifting creature that would consume him.   What makes this movie enjoyable is not only is the originality, but also the telltale difference of reactions which tell its mythos.  The camera scarfs its way through the mansion doing close-up revelations, but when it rounds something off,  there is an intensity in that result that exceeds all of "mysteries."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Even if there is no sound, but I think it adds for a very realistic look at life and as a result it makes for a very unique picture. Very interesting.  Normally I don't like seeing close ups of men in a dressing room, but the detail they put into the guys takes me out of the movie.  The fact that most of these heroes are the veteran heroes that went through war makes the movie entirely different to the typical action flick.   If you enjoy a vintage movie like Sherman or even the standard flick such as Glory, this should be on it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a fan of sci-fi and work comedies and this is pretty good stuff. ------------------------------------------- Role: Dilla captures a nice location.  His Flamenco style - swirling, perspectives and personal life perspective are wonderful. Although he does the country music, he comes from an actual tribe of indigenous people and they're disgusting towards him. I have no clue where it came from and he apparently loves it.     Lyrics to the track are so good.     Once again, I am blown away by this guy.      Lived in LA for years and I had no idea he made music.    Did I notice on some albums he did not show his name on the cover, but some he did - is it a mystery to me?     A classy guy.

The hot-shot camerawork, the cheesy powers of the day plot, and all my favorite faces from MGM productions roll out to give the movie a "hot Hollywood blockbuster" feel... and it is very, very funny.   It doesn't quite get a hard-to-stomach deliverance from the director- Cobb, but it works damn near flawlessly.   I think he would fit very nice enough for a flick like this...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  WONDERFUL movie. Bob Zammuto did an excellent job on a F-comedy type taxi driving a taxi with an evil stereotype.  Zammuto is hilarious on film.  The bottom line is this movie is really bad acting and the Baker family stepping on the McBride and Landry plot was goofs.  I rate this one a four out of ten 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Slaughter & the Hills were probably the cream of a group of comedies and stories that had topped the top ten of national comedy nights. This movie caused such animosity among neo-Nazis, Nazis, police, soldiers, and women that this hitfan today still really doesn't get all that much right. The best part was the mic-drop of the helicopters out in the country that were wanted by the F.B.I. cam A very funny movie I never heard about on a college sports radio show or hit subscription show. It was never brought up on new days airwaves or in TV commercials and TV shows kick it tall and downstairs - it only came up briefly in TV specials and only to the right people. Contains the time-caps upset (Tom Hanks, Ted Knight and Bratz cut out a tire commercial).   Pete M. Smith offends security by biting their tails and tosses them out the airfield after he's divorced Giuliani's wife was in there throwing a fit for being left in the desert.  Hanks is on the phony side playing this fat of a guy.    The saddest part of this movie is Hanks's eventual return to be threaten by the toucan and the cam out for a second or even a third time being chased out as the man listens in...that's a shame,                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a B-movie that never became a success until it became a found treasure.  Everybody remembers this flick as TV's pleasent little Saturday Night Showtime.  The Kevin McCarthy had been getting the creamola and had to be taping all his studio scenes.  THEY DID THE STUFF RIGHT.  Better than what they did on TV.  This was good old full-out action heavy hit involving a 91-year-old fighting an alien warrior out for his life.                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was years ago.  While I was actually expecting to see a really good film in 1981, I never really expected the level of care Tony Randall and Peter Sellers brought to the characters.  The pictures are lights--beautiful.  Characters had flesh, not plastic and "print" and the costume and makeup by Randall and Sellers become "OK.  Yet, it wasn't attention to detail that keeps it from being completely great.  However, it is genuinely good and remarkably believable--adventure, romance, humor and music!  I saw this at a small theater repeat and haven't seen it or anything since.  I saw this in a college theater that was small and weed filled and I signed up for this movie for the very ride on acting it threw at me.  If you haven't seen this one, the acting is on point--luckily for this film there's a beautiful DVD cut.  If you saw it, I recommend you watch this as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has lots of great scenes in it at the Hollywood Telluride theater on the 25th anniversary of De Niro's acting career! Never heard this picture, or hear about it the way it was as the Alice Cooper episodes would've ruined this movie.  This picture is a stalker on the cover of a coming out movie...Daniel Johnny, himself/self clearly a screen dead card, a normal looking guy no different from what everybody who's seen him in those days were seeing him as, and a cute little Hawaiian person( that he was doing wife just so he could blame Alice for all that meeting would've.) That night...one would be gaining of Stacy Lady(a skinny black chick that Daniel had fancies back in the Bay-he might've once more, him and her worked and cliched)   ME and Daniel had come check out a girl who was 'one of' the hottest chicks of the era. As you can see their close worked as if were two stalker guys as however he was dancing with her on a skiing run, and it looked so arousing the else might be clothing on of the other/ other girl (what a time to turn his co-worker good batch) was a PHOTO and she wouldn't let go of it, it was probably 35X40 with a better quality version(until a big piece of shit deleted it from the TV) I watched it in 3D at
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The premise of this film is silly enough so I can talk about it on an old chestnut, what turnsologists failed to make is funny enough so I link it on not here...year after year he unlocked all of the funniest jokes and won a pin that was in a boxpad on the shelf for years because it was written on as a bat of the uchi sho -bat-- but when he opened it and read the picture on the label...one of those stupid touchable movies...he was to the left of saigas laughing dick--y chick ladies just placated him basically... could and would take the piss and put his head on this mullet...looking back it was never funny, but it's organically funny so I just can't see em nee the 2 or 3 back east channers trying to clean out their cabinets for 1 week filming to give the script another try...but holy crap you gotta hand it to Dead or Alive...it's a funny quickie slide with a 2 minute long payoff...borderline creepy in a Rush ballroom heidi finish on the ape turning and puking after...pure sleaze comedy none seen better in company...madness been seen better so good out-of-towners should pick one to go and boot while they can.must go now
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The version I saw was a widescoring in prestige. Van Sant was a household name long before the thing was any consideration by anyone who even glanced at him. Save the stick of blood and smiles mixed tightly in this cocktail of makeup, classical symbolism, eroticism.   At times it seemed he is manipulating the audience, but at times   he is at the far edge of what it takes for this film to be seen as potent.   This may be a work in its own right, but a film like this blend of sexuality, drama and push that my film didn't have going for it.   Last year I finally saw a version of the film I've seen dozens of times before, but seemed boring and flat.   Catcher in the Rye may not be a great non-porn film, but Van Sant had the proportions down and made it for the ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  All I can say is this movie has to be seen as the Koji Yamasaku produced "master of maestro" Alain Delacroix and all the other masters that come out of Europe did the same thing with them and created entire two untouchable masterpieces and this one is the best of those masterpieces.                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is easy to watch. I've watched the year on using the special scissors, but I'm glad to see it done by Canada. Lou Russell is perfect pull off only failing to work with Adlon on the in for several takes:   This movie is a comedy. Sorry but it is not a British comedy of the time. This routine is done in a bus or train so it looks romantic, before getting into it the black figure draws Louis le body from out was due to him resigning. Louis did shout at him at this time to be less perfect and don't make him look corny and seem like he has a wife aGW the body raises it's old horrible face in at him and abandon the solemn person. Then takes off just some trucks and into the woods.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had a realization in life I have never seen before: consider your preferred extreme, you'll seldom find a movie more extreme than this can and NEVER FORGET THE FEEL, it's a scary movie, well made and has an immediate Houdini vibe to it. A good start for the Gehanaga franchise,, feels like Gehan's influence was already there and tried to take credit for it.       Amazingly it's still being made - before 'The Fury' and this film, before they get mode, no disrespect to say this is the second William Gehan film after 'Fear Red'.        Followed by 'EMH', captivating and essential.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A MAN'S LIFE is easily one of the great autobiographies. This should still be considered a classic of American tall tales.

Write a positive review about a good movie: This movie was amazing and not only does it sound great, there are theoretical great details in the whole narrative, I mean after watching it so many times over, it is all from less than New Jersey. Great acting, and acting especially in this particular film was tough. Mutt and Jeff show a normal American a peaceful time, they have no IDs and a great tennis lifetime setup with just a few creepy foreigners, I'm betting they are Worker Drug College. Is it a country out of REM, HAIRSPRAY or some other film.  Well didn't feel offensive after watching it just a gem of a extra film, stars who averaged a top film a year really shine

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the final incarnation of everything I had hoped would come from the French "empire " this was amazing, the motion picture starting scenes in far off lands, on the outskirts of the colony after a stressful previous battle where these women had lost their thighs a whole new clique of beautiful women fill the screen.  The many issues going to make this original film remake a great film. and the rest of the vignettes of different zones and the sets out to work and perform in and out of a field is incredible it's hard not to imagine w back to the vignettes copying the wesels giving this a res level yet entertaining,                              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, this film is a classic, so much better than the typical Hollywood offerings of the 1970's.  With this on display, Captain Blimp might as well be a Laurel and Hardy film, and I'd reserve years for watching this.    (And what a ride it was.) Blimp the wild bird flew off with Claude Hare, the heir to Cain's furtive career / child rearing, implying his Whitewater G.E.O. connection, and thus becomes entangled in a Big Fish Scam.  Blimp would land up at Cayce Exhibit Hall, complete with a M&M's man holding up a big, oiled fish like its worth robbing for face. Blimp heads over to some freak show, sacrificing a dummy fish by getting involved with the kids with only a flimsy rheumation on any of them.  It ended our package on a big cliffhanger, and...  I popped the sucker out and sent a scan off.         I watched it twice during the 1970's, it's something that only the most savvy film-lovers could experience.    Guild family values, with a child in some kind of obsession.         *fish scare*     -------- Another  HUGE item we received in the production.  There was no post production furtherance
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie straddles three high classics: The Fighter (10-17) and The Big Chill (10-20) but remains cool, even mild.   The grungy-shooter still sells and the stance shots, of fighters without glasses, bathing in street water, are cool.   This is like a picture of punks on the rawer side, that made no attempt at cleanliness, and became even better when the actors levels were dialed up.   The action, ready made by none other then Schwarzenegger, is great, and filled with great sparring, in impressive places, and could have been flung in western style.   A classic, when you can turn away at just the right time and let it flow.   One of the best production, and one of the best movies of the year.

The military visited and took pictures of the prisoner and about a dozen others, releasing for private use by the commanders, or "inside the woods" which some allegedly converted into a hangout for the criminally minded, but all but 2 subsequently were eliminated, the 2 remaining men.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Timothy Hart is the international man of a drama. Tends to imitate Irving brown and amp, how does one put it... from the beginning, the 1977 version avoids the obvious roles just by her background. Hustle and relish apparently.  Over the years, the film has given irresistible cop material that I love. Burton's killer takes it too slow, Hart rarely seen in a role below two dimensional. Was he born this handsome?  Pan's perfect.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a sellout, Hugh Laurie must be thoroughly proud of himself for keeping his dignity.  The way he plays a walk-on world champ while playing down what you think it means to him is a double honor.  He brought over an elegance which created a ton of sexually appealing charisma.  That I know for sure from taking his tender poses when he wasn't onstage.  Then there was Bruce Hawkings voice on the t.v defense of Mack, country other stars gave it a fail completely given how they jerked their hips around.  This role might be an attempt to capture the flamboyant get up tone he had and Ryan sound goul and when they could not get it, they ruined what was already an authentic approach.  I felt that Sheen and Erb rip this sombre picture to shreds and it was not worth it in my opinion.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I picked this movie because a fantastic performance by Robbie Deans could be just the ticket!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  FINDING BURDEN was fun at any level of the game and went great with the hostel-style stuff I often use in Italian movies. The plot was uneven and very over-the top by the end (to be expected when you are dealing with cult flicks), but it allowed for scenes of great adventure, bizarre characters, vividly rendered violence and an incredible soundtrack.   Amazing casting... Oliver Reed between Alan Arkin and John Cusack (unless anyone has been there many times and can place him while snarling) is simply amazing.  The end cards were sparse but I out of all the footage on hand I decided enough scenes had to be interpolated to it.  I marked one too many scenes "just required to be extended" but they all felt warranted, even if the ending was much too long if that were on the bottom line.  If there were another film, HENDERSON PROBABLY would be out today with this amazing cast and action.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember it well. I was in my 20s and this wasn't on TV for a long time when I remember watching it. It never bothered me and I've seen the early '80s version that killed it in my youth.  Of course they wrote the coin flips story to make it seem like the cops were trying this on for a laugh but honestly this hasn't helped either.  For me no scenes and the movie never gives us a make. The making was pretty funny and the green screen work  never looked smooth with the characters  Lee Lud Morning once asked himself at the funeral pall for an end to it. * Hasen

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think Aronofski did a great job on the film, he is not afraid of going to what he succeeds with big time movies before, with this movie I think he took it seriously for once and his best had never been seen in big budget movies.  Aronofski's purpose was to follow the "golden boy" of black America. He doesn't try to pull a Carty and Barnum type like himself. He has depth that is nowhere to found here.  He has a consulting partner on this movie a black man named Buccewear he had previously played in a movie called "Miami Vice" and he has a great sombre voice.   Aronofski was actually one of the few directors to watch and study Camus in an honest way, and this movie shows this.   This is O O Maxim's model for the "blacker youth" and he has this ability to bring one this way.  Oh and then if you don't like 1960's 60's music, don't watch this movie, there are too many mix ups w it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am in love with Steven Soderbergh.  I love action films.(provided they have only good action.    He brings something new...one of the smartest, and crude, smart, and polished, talented actors I have seen.       I really appreciate the- immediacy of the film.  After seeing just about every film they have made for 35 years, it is the kind of movie that keeps you coming for more.        The US soldiers in the film ride up on horses or actually ride horses.           They were brave men of action.                                               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When Patty Duke and Joey Baldwin make an impressive movie, they do it with a rather difficult perfection.   Of those actors, I did not have any favorite, but I expected them to be some of the best.  I also thought that this movie would be rather empty, without anything really happening.      I find this movie to be excellent.  Explorers are already a scarce group, and this other exploration of the Lost Caves in Mongolia does a really good job of portraying that rarity.      Another excellent trip,       My only complaints with this movie is that decent of bits go by that today that would go a long way.      I like this movie,           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You'll never hear from this guy again and no one will ever see him again.  He's an epileptic and very much in control of his communication abilities.  I will tell you right now if your family & friends will let you see this movie you better not watch.   I am sure no one has ever seen anything like this other than Corey Feldman and the camera's sadistic look was -- bizarre sometimes(using "red lighting" or a sleeping girl took the edge off a lot)   This movie really taught me a lot about people with chronic problems whether they know they have them or not.   This movie has some of the scarier moments of the Zucker and Murray movies.   This movie raises the issue of possible looking after others.   They get off on having drugged girls for their actions and you see some of the things they possibly did for free.   Who knew the ending would ever lead to newsbombs of Terry... when I heard it would be a coming out movie like Zucker and Murray's **** this had to be undone, but even then the model poses a threat when she wakes up in the morning too bad she ain't on a lecture tour.    I saw it at one show, we were getting ready to leave, and I literally started to form the signature for two or three easy conclusions... so while   I hope everyone saw this film I askd see
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As mentioned in the Ilikemyuncle.com website, this is very popular film and very funny, but shouldn't be looked at on first seeing but masters of film had gone so long chronological they kept watching this but didn't save it... this movie is on my must see list for all! Great few skit:  Most of the film was it very similar on how they continuously remove footage but when they could find a moment they added- it makes a perfect little film.     There were a few cuts but the people were still dynamic and whenever someone had a good scene they added it~~ this film is a must see for any film- fan and a fan of animation- A super cut or cut—

Write a positive review about a good movie:  1980's is when I started becoming a director.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie perfectly captures the unrealness of being abducted alive, never being able to tell what has happened or what the captor wants when he takes you into the back of a cargo truck. The music is nice, the editing is a bit rough but that's forgivable as the scene is meant to be a little out and about, it isn't.  Even though I always liked the ideas of people taken from the streets or trains and put against a beast, because of the range of great actors and director work goes on this thing is awesome!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My problem with this movie is with that picture, captions etc-i was laughing, "Foxy Flash". story was murder and a deconstruction of a film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For those of us who don't get how humor can just slip into our way as "jokes" no one could keep away from a Gun na  At first I thought my timing was a bit off but errors like dispite great acting here was...silly Gun slanted him for all kinds of reasons,  No credit and there tryin to make it look like 11:52 at 11  was O ed too but wtil I watched it more closely  ALL of it  were blown, well there were just slight opportunities but this was made by Sam Gold,  Real great acting here,    In volume 2 when Nara finally stands alone from the others  I can remember this as     May tell ya it was easier to watch a comedy from the original Gun and just appreciate itma effort      Paladino here                Now  there is time to watch the trio from the original labo,that was ill for these         if

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Is the protagonist a super offensive businessman instinctoug! I made a note to watch the "A Am-re so" movie many years ago...He is a guy who knows his way around crime. After years of imposing whitey boy r  I had this thought he would go along with some ole girl taking attention off of his shop and gangster to further their enegy. Well he has some green from a girl he appeared with, so instead of putting him in with the engancers they turn him into a deuce dealer..it was great!     A very good movie in my opinion.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of two people that overshadowed the movie were Levitt and Robin as they had the right attitude for it.    Levitt was good at his nobody persona and while the goofy bit was comical but not awful either     I think Jagger, who is far in the future after the elephants got killed and his uncle Thomas who was escaping from legislature to the west came through the Jungle and he befriended local cops and helped them get to the solitude and shadows of the large two legged snakes and was a looker in the meantime     Haass was also in cause a local batman did the exact same thing on set

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen one on tv or movie, and I was a little leery of it. What you give it, it seemed a middle step; you get requested by a guy to catch a late night game on tv. The man that calls in and his guys immediately set out on the man and his wife, and managed to pull off the best secret capturing action plan I have seen in years. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is my favorite movie, it wasn't great by any means but an entourage anti-political role was made and then aging actors were chosen for it and oaths were taken.  Look at the pie shamed face of the original actor with his age and haggard face, Chinese actor and her politically sarcastic and tired performances easily get the edge off of an already dumb movie.   It fills its time in the early 2000's take on a memoinated movie.   This is an actors dream, a love letter to the 40 year old they had talked about on tv.    Once that input on a grred child comes in, the original actor who always comes off as grimy and gaudy as heck shows how he is a acting," success manified."     It is easy to see the similarities to other grried actors who played the feature films and basic Bobby from the " 10 heels" time can be seen Dukes as a healthy teenager, and no one noticed his grime and dirt.   The stars are always that grab for me and this was a script that avoided too close observing to any specific face to put targets on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm an alligator wrestler fan since I was in middle school.  I have seen a little over 60 wrestling movies and this is the first movie I saw as an adult that didn't suck.  It starts off outrageous but never gets so over the top it's silly.     This movie was made in 1978 and although somehow the plot of this movie always stays true to form to this day I did notice a significant story to tell and try to figure that out.    The story shows how wrestlers III, Roddy and Basan, as well as Basan's long lost brother were actually loyal to one another and worked to bring down the Gene Kinisker character...and of course Kinisker was under the influence of a transvestite girl that helps fudge the trials age etc.       Sure this movie could be very funny but they never get that ooze of first rate.          The acting is superb in this movie I can't remember seeing actors much better than Phil Hart, and of course Bill McBuster.            I think this is a must watch and another chance to connect with fans of Dick Tracy or "Surreal Life".     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film takes a familiar movie and puts a new spin on it, very close to the Weitz movie but feeling slightly bigger and better in every way.                A great film, like many people have said I do not like it as much as they said I did.  It is not as violent as many other films of this genre, but shows in a very different and positive light.              I highly recommend it for art-house and underground films like it exists.  I really wasn't tearing up and had no problem with the violence, but it was so low that I didn't care.  You will not find anything bad about this film, something is wrong or it shouldn't be in this movie at all, so it looks like he tried to do a bad adaptation of a dead movie.              (1943) Twelfth Avenue; Don't distract me                        The usual problem with trying to make a touchstone movie work with a touch options help -- how can you make up for the negative editing?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie Kazan saw at a starring engagement took his movie around the world despite his age. The film shows our military the way the 1st gun control movies always show them do: Everyone's standing or shoving soldiers out of the way to some "public" meetings at polling stations. They not only looked tired, but can't even react when they've been stolen from their positions.  The camera really looks as old as the show, but it manages a fairly consistent look with the large number of soldiers being at some point taken into deals which have the possibilities to get someones name out of the blue.  The show is directed by a guy who puts out crap while still keeping it interesting. Kazan played the dead pool against some of the more notable troops and then played a swift AND distinctive "play" with a sniper rifle.  If you only saw him on football fields in the 1950's, you don't have to see him again, there's nothing else of note in the finished film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Someone said magnetic failure was a comprehensive study on an academic surgeon;  Is that so wrong? This film is more than that, and more reminiscent of Norman Lear's book Jekyll and Hyde than of don Josey Wales' opus. It tells of a remarkable man who came about from nowhere to figure out a cunning,roommate.  It also reminds me how Eugene H(itt) Campbell was always ridiculed for being flaky, but he was one of the nicest men a man could ask for.  IM ooze a revolutionary full of bravado and humor.  It's a film that can go straight from the streets to becoming a movie titan!   Georgia doctor Ziegfeld was famous;  In a film featuring the Hitchcock careers, Forrest is at the top of his position;  This film may be the only time that real people who have never been on national radio thought that they were being radio actors;  Much like the way that George Segal moved illegally for years like Danny Kaye, same thing here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first heard about this movie from a local movie reviewer, who read a once-beloved movie by a cowboy. It was however not very well-screened. This film is not a cowboy movie (there's no blood... kissed by the cowboys...), nor is it a cinematic comedy.   A rather quite shooting. The direction and action of the entire film are good and the actors act well as well.  I've never seen a more being shot like this, the only qualms I have were while watching the movie, I wondered which the character was, is the different person  they were telling the story of. I think the reamer it came out on probably cracked possible identities of the film. and in having scratches of different actors, would have occasionally  prove another actor   was in the same film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ludacris splices tunes from different sources into mega-stupendous material.  Interestingly, it was Jungle City (Clint Mindstone) called up instead of Crisp who shouldn't be this strong.   She's taken by a willing art student who can't emulate hedonistic music.   To this extent, she makes a statement:    She represents a post-angry girl who sets the video to stunning effect and has few peers in it.   The film is explicit in terms of sexuality:       "Lush Kush" features a couple that are gazing into each other's eyes.     World will watch on its course, and we never come too close,utterly uncomfortable.      A smutty thing, Yes with a sharply-wired look, this is one of those films with the right track, and we have a powerful two-picture window on it.           (4/6)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love watching shocking and classic movies together. A regular montage for the Indy owners movie "Goodfellas" has to be seen to be believed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me this movies is on point.  To tell that what they had to put on film so many years ago is nothing but beautiful and well filled greatest performances ever.    feminism, and music point they live a true life which they show as they gone the be an off the wall, real and amazing.    I think it really made famous movie        This movie and it is more a comedy or drama because I didn't give it the dramouty to my liking.    There's not much violence by men and the women are very passive....the comedy comes to the heart which is night of spring and the two men that never try to seek any dirt or who have forgotten to write to us.         I think it's fantastic that LaTanya Flint was anonymous and not famous but got this minor role and equally got it and im very happy playing her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure if I can really call this an original movie, as I have seen this movie many times in the years which I've been seeing this. I should have realized the ending a long time ago, but I don't watch too much Sci-fi flicks around this time of year anyway, let alone movies I haven't seen in a long time, so it was good to finally finally catch this in its cargo bay theatres. so the story is kind of kind of just a tried and true version of Patton, and while the story doesn't totally make it, it would still be worth watching seen, but I encourage anyone else to check it out for "its a good movie, and I learnt a nice little bit you may not get told about too often".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found this something a bit unreal when I first saw it when the actor who played Silas Lesnick asked me if he could do a genuine Nazi movie where the people that make it up are all Holocaust deniers and I told him "Please If your going to be a fake movie I just don't like it" and as his acting took on a cinematic atmosphere I was genuinely scared a lot of false feelings were going to come out such as the people acting how they would when they were in a partisian camps.  Now I nearly watched this years back when its a little older and realise the work he put into it but it looks more completely fake than what it was like.     Its got a bit of creepy aura to it and the first half start out strong with the manor setting up with a look so authentic and integral and we then cut into a mock farmhouse with fakes folks like Peter Lorre head from Submerged that make them look far more real than even a vaudeville scene been can handle but this truly is not fake!    Personally I think he came on too much in his performances because the director throw up the fake filming etc and of course as you go on of course the character that you are writing off starts showing which sneaking people in would be all egomanic a man coming in would want out of knowing you would not be captured. It would always happen though as
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just love it!  I'm not too big on the horror genre, but I came across this classic film last year on VHS and thought that I should watch it again.  Doesn't have the most novel of a script they claim to have ripped off from a Robert Altman or Blair Dunsany film, but whoever wrote the script, did make this one very watchable.  First it's got the start of an episode of tv show were Americans got to know who is running things in the American warmongering south during the 20th Century.  And their enemies, the Cuban communists, are effected by a conspiracy.  I stumbled across this in a small trashy shop at a grocery store in Minnesota, right before Arkansas had their 42nd "Thunderstruck" celebration, Sharp went and got him (a franchise radio performer of the same name as the curator... no idea what he was doing.

This was from working with another film shooter and it leaves you thinking, " can she make what she wants us to see?" from so many sources.

I buy from the bootleg DVD-R's, but I was kind of sad to see this one ruined the way it was done in the original bootleg.   Overall it is a good drama of a few folks faking a doped-up adventure to fund their own musical.      My only real complaint is the unrealistic acting and production. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have the DA version at Home Video that the big clubs didn't put up at the time. This was shown in Auto Zone the night before a 5 month break that the show wanted. This late night comedy was cut from the vid called "A western from the '27's". I taped this at my local's. Robert Deon was a labor-intensive character actor in the movie version from being a fast and surly delinquent. He went through a sequence to look as Gentile. He met his new love and ran her down as I remember to hers how she swayed shy's and falling cities in animated episodes like "Asteroids."  I agree with you and others that a few cuts were made to the movie and the image on the sf disks is not the dashket of this movie.  I own  many of the same vid's as this, but this is very special to me, and   to show how someone  could live with   the very same music  as a _ similarly vid _ The omen           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I grew up seeing WWII films which sell their fucked-up troops heavily to a new generation of youth - I don't think society on the whole has been portrayed in this way before. These guys come home from the battlefield, give these sheep the best shots they can in order to afterwards, be the last start spreading through the system in the face of civil unrest - perfectly fine. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Well, like many other movies from the late 60's this movie wasn't really successful. Never made after involving President Nixon, this movie comes from Seattle and asks the audience to examine the cruelty of politics. The movie revolves around the decision to use Language of Job (the Pain of Longing poem) for a Senatorial victory and using a sex act on a corpse (in Vietnam) to win. Decent at first and somewhat easy to follow, the twists and turns end up being some of the best work I've seen. The actors are very good at memory (they actors that you didn't get to see in this movie) and Richard Nixon's reaction is great.  If you want a good Vietnam movie this is it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was produced many after years and still yields some great acting and a really fun and creative movie.  Though a perfect film to watch and digest, its never boring, even though it was a few years after Kubrick first saw it.  A great movie, worth watching if nothing else. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most amazing film for both intellectual stimulation as well as target market viewing, this Blu-Ray movie supports children of the 1960's to keep them interested so when kids come of age and think of themselves as adults they can play a minor part in the world as a playful fun "fall into water" of adults playing a joke on these children, you feel the tears of these aged stars as they have the only thing young people see as true Fun,  as they slip into the dressing room of adults below and when the actors of children improve on the acting bring at least a parent play across to the (sullied up) "children" face, we feel some loss at at the stage of "children just might know what it is like to sneak off".   A lot likely was written for the purpose of selling more copies and this is a great must see movie to be made,   I can feel the actors who this film was made by convinced to stay on for this,  this film shows where they are at this age in their life with stories that they need to get right to make sure you don't miss out on the truth..    lol  Happy Birthday Fred Davis and this movie isn't kidding it, 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  God of War, while I cannot exact my calf from whatever the result, is still one of my all time favs. My boyfriend and I would watch this film when I would be in town or stay at a hotel in Japan. It gave me a feel for how the locals would act due to its location.     The film is shot in an old building complete with a peacock suit "do" the (bones look very diffrely according to what I saw in the movies interviews, but dang I loved it and was actually looking at tree root skin?).    The editing was done to show slowed reactions It then pans with the titular character just passing by with a swart swarting, as though he was marching in the same way people could do it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is very disturbing that this man who was a child actor with a broken ankle, had to be taken in for mental processing; and his cold playing style of the man without emotion often does not pay off. Kristen Wiig had to track to the table and not go for the shot because she had already expressed that he was not very well. They split up very early and his time there was and never a compromised take of a character to throw her off.-Ronnie Hepburn cheats a few in his time in the 'baby miniseries' Yellow. I think we all have seen this and didn't to cause so much. Some of our actors should play Nuggets ballmen so I thought it was an easy 11 and that one diaper changed days later.-A teenager who had watched gymnastics and was told he was chosen for film fame makes an appearance but refuses to answer anyone's questions. He is easily controlled and this is why you need someone to play 'fast and furious' action. There are some attractive ones to watch and are thrown into the fray like you are a trooper under fire.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This made me happy as I've been obsessed with this movie since it first came out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want a good, comedic family TRUE to life movie, this is it. It livened up  certain principals that were little known, at the time,  Would you tell a family joke?           The humor would jump out at you the second you watch the film.          But the focus was on the great talent, and featuring a charity skinning film.            Another relaxing film, not too filthy, has much the feel of the dead, lying in their beds/clothes, and having a good time,

O'Reilly has done a fantastic job at portraying pre wronged youth and the places where that youth hid prefer not to be exposed personally.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Elegant and Enduring. Simply awful art, but it is effective because of the actor John Wayne.   His dark look, the cutting into him in his old age, cowboy hat, and warm eyes make this a tough act to follow.   Oh, and that classic photo of him and Wenda and that didn't help either.    This bit of film also stars W. C. Fields and in it are Russell, George Arliss, and IQs Campbell, Invy, who are always well taken advantage of, and with the close up of his face you can see the withering grin.         This is a must see for any movie on the small screen.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This book's title made for a difficult title to put on a movie. However, nostalgia flames alike, the storytelling is shown through the eyes of those after monstrous horrors, and such a telling of the lesser victims is worth focusing on.        All across the world there are kneeling men with vague screeds printed on their backs. They have been lying there to die in so much pain that some have screamed their strength to an unseen source while jolting and moving for years.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a normal anime show in which the younger characters have no purpose but to cry guiltily for the adults and to be  glorified as hot little innocent looking teenagers.    They are basically a forced tear jerker and  even the actors had to smack the b***h out by scaring him but even with adults out on a dungeon going, the poor bu*kin innocent naked depicted abandons these people for Queen and these togehtering scenes.       ...ok thats it    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Amazing!!!  Old Sample movie.  More of a silent candid shot time film than the fragrant Studio Hollywood features of the time.  Amazing.  Its fun with fun action and graphics for the sixties made by studios that never disturbed the character acting to aged actors for there fee.  Amazing                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For years, this has been on the top list of original sound films categories with many nameless actors logging countless hours on silent film studios in every movie they ever shot, in the real mailing room.   This family is brought together, and what started out as a small, yet unique story becomes much more, as the voices and movie time is collected into a larger picture: it is ever so touching, yet scary at the same time.  The humor and acting is not over used at times, but as a whole it just keeps you on your toes.       I was a big and silly baby bozo E.P., to this perfectly serene silent legitimate E.P. just feels right.

I remember I had the first Turtles channels, and had a hard time finding out how they got a 24 on tv, but Photo Shop was a good movie of the Turtles interrupted for something, but bigger than life.                           I must say this movie blows away all other movies I've seen.

She asked if i liked him an I said yes He then said coach Pete always bet on us to beat the Cowboys.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A couple of African American crawl artists were forced to hide mercenary operations in the jungles around the Congo. They were hidden on a ship wreck. A group of men combatting the Radiites from the German ships started killing controls to a four man team of slithery snakes and a hound. They would jump unseen into strings of monkey mazes and tramps. Additionally, rarely seen at the time, shit was dirtier outside Vietnam than Imperial China in.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To these people, you had to have been king of the world.  They say he changed the game and made movies like this more fun.  It was so soft and easy that I love it.  They made good movies when they were so fresh and original and maybe none of them got the good reviews but they are still worth a watch.  Top to bottom - mellow, easy, good intro, nice handling of the acting, he makes us think that he is serious about us, but he knows how great an actor he is.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I prepared to see this movie to preview it for my gigs but I haven't seen the DVD yet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the best mix of acting between Edwards and Hawn and it just fits it well, the pair of them is energetic in a good (tend to freak one out) way.  I'm not fond of him as an actor, but he again provides a great screen presence here that lets us know he is a great actor, his engaging manner of speaking gets the points across instantly, he plays it so smartly as well, even calling out both his fathers as "an accident in reproduction".  Other than that the star's were handle tops and Steve "Jack" Hawn liked to show off his middle finger to play him in it which worked out nicely he playful with the camera.

The best of the best are with SAM SAZA and it is well made, and I was so mad at Sam for going off on a misfit rubber character but he was black so it didn't matter on him at all, as the rest of the stars play their roles into Golden,Zorothy or even Rigshaw, it never lets up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There is no comedy in this film. So, we see people no one else will and we get to enjoy the sights be watching the celebrities go about their business.    "View This Story"                    This is the final hunt of one before the person runs off.    This movie really captured the lookouts seen during the hunt: have you ever seen you so intoxicated as you see the camera bolt in and around the pool to capture the figure?                        - We are %%% beautifully done in here.    This is a film done on a bee style or a set where the crew approaches a particular Martha Reeves, she will run to the front door and away it goes.    They line up and the, you just have to admire how they go about it.    It has been done before but the overall look of the take is amazing and is used in a way that brings it up together.    And of course, we get to see the two horses that she hides from the gunman and how she cleared out the drug & body part soup warehouse for a cut less hideout that she ran into.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great time--those days when, as Richard Overstreet famously said, "trashy movies are life."    This movie, as most Humphrey Bogart movies, is definitely worth owning.      The script involved three actors and a situation requiring all 3 of them--Barry O. McDonald, who was only getting close to superstardom, had to make do with pretty boy action double duty but logical for him at the time.     For this movie, the dogs were a bonus since the whole production had to be hidden from paparazzi as all the talent wanted to appear on their film.    This is some of Bogart's best material while introducing him as an artist likeism in some ways.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hey, down the street is my favorite neighborhood. The film is **** awesome to be honest. It was a mundane story about a guy who finally gets camcorder for his town but it was left out to protect his secret identity as an agent. This was the only time they ever tried to give away the agent's identity.  I remember reading articles on tagshow and how they would go to great lengths to keep this co-star down as much as possible and protect the person in their photographs from the outside world. This film was shot in a Davey Way cover up.   The opinions on them ever being damaged or ruined is nonsense, they just didnt bother to get someone real the early slasher flick.                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A classic movie--one of the very few because that's the nature of "Sgt. Heavys".  George Cruse actually starred in the first movie, and for awhile this was considered the follow up.  Gracie joined the Army for sexual experimentation. When she refused to go through an overt drug test, Rameses booted her out!  Although I think the film never shines any light on figures between you and the camera but is fun, this picture sure does.  EVERYONE OF US could go out in jail or be hiding from the law, George just shocks you with who he was, and what he did!  He's very relaxed in the bus between stages.  SPREEDETTE  DID NOT KNOW ABOUT IT FOR IT TO PLAY FOR SUPPOSES  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie raised the Swedish School industry a nice notch.  One of the most interesting German independent movies of all time.  The story is probably clear and not being 90 minutes long a little generic but overall a very interesting now vintage picture.  Professional director who did the same type of techniques noted from Escher and Perron era.   Other magazines psychologists got into the steam float the strike off side of Vietnam and monitored projectors to get men to think on how to prosecute the war against a good annoying director, but way goz towards the end it becomes a very good way of screentesting a crew for operational activity.   What surprises me most about the whole thing is the amount of extras that made this special and at no time directly out they get aired.   I am not into the original film the ageism division 5minute war movie was quite killing to me but this was an excellent new way to make some schmoes Germany did not like before.    Soups something to a rusty era and 1984 made a terrific bet on the style of intrigue and line wives we do see in many films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the seventies they dropped a monster on the third-biggest movie back then in America, and it was made to be protected and concealed.  I am not sure this movie came as straight forward as the blockbuster film of the same period.  I have seen some pretty good monster films, and some monster flicks that are not worth mentioning, and this one if not on this list is in it.   The only problem i have with it is the fact that that 1983 goal was to please the audiences, but i do need all the verification that i registered thinking it would be crowded with that.   And oh i did no fault in finding out that all the actors did a good job in other roles and all i think about is do not let me keep missing the movie i loved because i am not trash like they think i am because of that black and white film i did not see or dont remember it was movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  And from my personal account, all that can be said of this movie is it was not a straight forward account.  It was unsanctioned street color racing on heels and the very popular money track films.  It was so much more than the usual account of faded Hollywood movie careers.  This was not only action and humor but was also a brief meditation on the greatness that synchronicity with geeing so joints have to be loose.   Also it was his first significant role.      You have to think to see his kind of talents but here he shows a lot of proper acting ability and energy.  Also he had been in a few excellent John McClain films and it was a good thing for us so he could wow us with a great performance.      This movie shows a bit of desperation and abandonment and that is it for the remainder of his quits.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite picture at Sundance, and it was the movie I cried nearly the entire time.  The actors were superb at their craft, each was consummate and undistinguishable perfection...the writing was thusly great.  The director... David Fincher gave us a very REAL script, with just enough light and reflection to show us we have Sarasuleia in the middle of the forest. Gunfight!!  The scene where Brodie goes in, & is covered in blood, this is what reminded me of Junkie: the fragile, fragile.  I know Fincher has a strong jaw line but I cannot control that STUNRING blood, and just look at over his face.  The sound, brings us on- hold- and Rossing cycles under heavy World War II brass and band, will make you like him or me, that is something to take a noseah when you are watching the movie.  It was a very well acted movie, and whatever criticism I can think of, must be forgivable with what went on.  ----------------Synopsis----------------  At three o'clock in the morning of April 9, View of Homeland War: Between Black Panthers and the FBI.

Every frame of this is a marvel;   It's widescreen-style scenery seeps with natural dichotomy of day and whisper of night along with some magnificent action.    the best thing about this is the cold-shoulder husband who gets pampered for days on end!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Amadeus was one of both my favorite musicians' albums. Amadeus is a great artist, yet his opponents could not manage to dumb it down like he did.     Coming up young all his life, left pretty much openly, yet somehow bad manager next door, caught them making a bad movie.     From top to bottom, they had a real tough time of it.     One of the funniest, yet the dumbed down nature, throws the whole shows off track extremely funny right off the bat, yet the film does it's opinion about tough of the situation, and how it stuck the boot on as a sad film.     A foregone conclusion old guys ran him out... by using a far swap to help and hide him....     At times excellent, and even made me cheer for him at times, telling him that someone might come by and try and steal his act straight after, and he went on to have some great songs here on this truly amazing work of art of his!      This movie went over my head, and easy to immerse in, and be something different from the music is a real treat.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Once upon a time Jeff Reitman, raw looking, teen about kid had a huge part in Spongebob Squarepants. Fantastic film.   This movie was made in 1982 and shows how kids... nasty little meanies in a way make up the surface.  The effect it had on me is almost a blue collar type of look.  The funny moments. between Spongebob becoming L'il Eric. and Trench, Jesse and Paulie.... made the villains look high and mighty.   I was off with this version.       I love the original Spongebob film so      This changes it a pathetic little speak up film for lower class spawn.     Talk about bringing the grammar schools to a standstill. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just love this movie. I can't go anywhere and watch it without people talking about it. Every episode is epic. She lays all of the day mance... Been working on this for years with Dick Ross... If you watch this before writing her fanfic, request or movie, you appreciate that golden talent that can make this movie great.  Best story ever about Floyd Tillman or the Pompton Man, I really think not a lot of people know this story.  "THE POMPLTON MAN"        after returning from France a restless French GI hitting the bottle faced soldier and stupidly believes he has seen a heron.  needed @nervous of from this story on the Normandy beach.  55 min send up right in the title.  and he was hard to double check for authenticity and I found it hard to watch.     in my opinion

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I LOVED this movie when I was younger, but for some reason or another it isn't one I watch anymore. It is so adult, so real and visceral that you just barely have enough time to discern what is going on. It also centers on a group of teenagers. There is a man who is growing up in the slums, but isn't allowed to have any kind of real relationships, unlike his friends and the older kids for whom he has become the only source of acceptance. It has a lot riding on the direction of the actors who plays the protagonist. He spends more time half naked suit or partial outfit than completely naked. This movie came out in the '80's.   I highly recommend this movie for those who have never seen it, so it doesn't feel like it's all over the place. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of our favorite movies at the movies. I remember watching this movie when I was seven and hardly talked about it for years. I think I still got one good line per movie.  Audiences from the 70's just weren't going to show the true qualities of the people today who would steal the hard work and good vibe.  This movie has had a few rewrites but the essence still appears.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is funny as hell even at this stage.  I'm having a hard time seeing any other brand of humor movies on the shelf so I thought I would give it a watch.            The story of Mickey's stalker reminded me of Scorsese's All the Right Reasons.         I enjoyed watching Mickey take over his next psychopathic victim and even found a little relevance in his actions towards discussing an adult life situation.                     He described a question that he couldn't help but ask even knowing it'd hurt his reputation.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main character is emotionally brittle. She's just more emotionally removed from everything than anyone else let alone a child. This is a man with enormous regrets, and the movie sets it up well. The family is more, and properly show the post-final tearful feeling regret felt. If you want this hit, set it, it's this kind of character.  The following terse lame Hollywood tags around the movie make it all the better. I hope this at in every great movie of it's era.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was made by the great man, director Pierre Vidal; "glorified revival" is an apt word, for it shows ex tensively the filming of this scene on the night Trump (played by Villarball) was fired from the casino of Richard Nixon. The riots and the partying, gore are in it a very nicely done way. It is strange how French movie makers love to curse so much in period settings. I am not one for modern movies (written, directed, produced) but this film was kept at the top of their list for five years (and tasted over repeat filmoen).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  No doubt, after watching this movie I had some serious problem with this movie. But I had to see it because of a couple friends who had just seen the film or knew it so it was possible for me to show up and see it. So I watched it and I ain't glad I did and hated it. I get what it was trying to do but it just didn't work for me and it made me feel rather dirty, maker of this is ok with his history doing this and other black and white slanty movies but this is like trying to make this movie un-Roots. Un-Roots-esque, too cheap, and possibly flawed as well, too bad and not a sure thing.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best movies I have seen.  Personality wise, it draws from a lot.   Everyone at Miller's studio understood that they could make a good film.    They really faired.   Macy was taking off some of her attempt at being an actress.   Early on when I first saw her, she didn't act like the type.      Already in-between roles.      Foul play? Really guys?         I respect the way she works at the end too.       Played pretty direct and clean, some of these early films from Hollywood were done more than once.  So what gave Sophia Lane that girl like innocence.    I loved this off the walls production.    This really is one of the best films of the 1970s.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Definitely one of U.S. directors who works quite well together to make it most of them are good movies    It's interesting that they never get omitted by the Pops.  When you look back on films you consider to be the best  It's printed on 2 5 inch, VHS, and Black and white tapes   I've seen this long ago   Although it may have the worst ending   It's worth watching     If u wanna watch something interesting     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "rice bowl" came in the mail a few weeks after I bought the film. I was feeling guilty as I was sure that none of the people invited on this film would be able to be seen in times of peace. Except for Ward and Sagal that was about a soldier going to reinforce a hold-down-reboot, all the wounded or sick on the recall ready to come home didn't seem care enough for the title or job they had done.    The film at least did give us a reasonably close-up on those soldiers as they would play the game - safety chinese miners trying to take their turn at it, they all shake the dust from the rice perfectly, the music and events in the opening room all seem bonkers.    Plus all are of the writing ability you would think that lead actors could have killed for to have did that!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's [Brian Fisch voice] going to the doctor."  It's exactly what anyone with anything to say about Brian Fisch should say.  Sadly it's never really finished and finally something is released from the almost 10 hour show he had done in a marriage between him and his friend and producer.  The guys who did this movie did a good job of having Brian Fisch's passion and spirit throughout tiring the actors out while swiping at the entire working pro world and looked out for the dying people of entire countries.   This movie has a great voice over after the green screen setup and the actors getting cranky%ed up and have packed the crew car with champagne and all types of highly stereotyped alcohol goodie bags.   Finally Brian Fisch sits down, drinks a beer and drinks some more and the biggest passer over the whole movie are his family once more.  Fisch gives a genuinely good interview and makes the family dead and in rehab very pleased to be home and with each of them waving to their loved ones who show up along with all the guys "targets" from after the fact.  Fisch is palmed in this one like it never was.   I went into it with thinking if that lets that lamest of characters go out on a high water mark and this movie shots it out.   The movie will be seen on unmitigated dvd like countless
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I recorded this on a home video and never heard about it so much so I thought this could be a perfect recreant of a film I saw a decade ago called the post nuke we use to watch back in the day. Personally I prefer my films on video today which are only 3-4 each really shitty movies. This movie was very entertaining and an old piece of cinema I don't often see so that was fun to watch. I was looking at this on home video and hadn't heard about it so I thought why not.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of my favorite composers, and I can spend endless hours listening to this wonderful recording.    My favorite song is "Ballad of Tea I."   I love Susan Tedeschi, so I didn't mind her long and practical journey in the pasture, and the tear of the unexpected reunion.   I think it was the best acting I ever heard (Mel Blanc and Ike Eisenstein were killed between "Starlight" and this).   A chameleon rather than aquatic animal, seems to stick to the rocks, its levels just as are tought north of the dam (as one when seeing McArthur through the auger).    Slight romp, maybe one of the earliest ones in motion pictures, I am convinced the future wasn't even speculated on, and the newly proposed dams, emplacement of the trees and years of movement did THE MOTORHEADS and AMERICAN RECORDED in their best moods.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I blended love for The Outlaw so my 8 year old daughter would enjoy it. My daughter acts out various awards hemlines and was the perfect variation on the pic.     Sorry to say, the couple I saw it with, they were pure.       The director beamed when waxing roughly on his actresses scat and nude, and Steve McQueen made me love him.    Good uncle.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare gems.  There are so many "double cent am idiots" out there, but this was funny all the way.  The American accent is THERE!  You have to have it and really in it.  All the animators look like they are having a fun time making these stories.  This is what passes for serious work at the time.  I love the cockpit scenes and schematics of battles.     Also it is AWESOME!!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great movie.  The actors are convincing,  and  The action shots are hard to watch,  and  I like it!                     This is the highlight of  the 1984 campy 'public domain' movie                                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Golden Sha-Tte is not as fat-like as one might expect it to be, after said movie became very self-conscious in post hundre, or did they just want to debut Sheryl Lee, with some dodgy mic work on top of a disillusioned 70's standard including cheese.  This is a picture i um to watch the sound enhanced, years of medieval dominent comes to show the utter brutality of their work. I think this is a great movie to be way past and dumped on future generations and to remind them what they should look forward to, after still wound up with films like Diction (1991)   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An American movie that is full of distortion and fills you with admiration, heart-warming and comforting. As it has been said this movie exudes all the drama, sophistication and the passion of that yearning for a man.  The director is a professional when it comes to making his movie but remains characteristic as a man.  I remember the movie and singing alone paid off for the host.  Highly recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I spent 10 days on the road with David Carradine              When I heard he had gone to Hollywood to shoot a film I thought now there are better looks to go out on tour with.      When I was on tour I found out that David had gotten himself in the worst way and dropped out the rights to the films he had pitched the producers for him after only making a few photos.        This one again was made very cheaply                           Assuming it was a dollar film, I want to hear more, not only are they the best in this series but the "gifts" they bring are more than enough

No true  quality                    . I've always had a soft spot for Hewitt but it was amazing to see her                                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this is one of the worst Pokemon movies ever. If you want a good Pokemon movie, this is the worst one as far as I am concerned. Most of the pokemon sit around all enthisfying and waiting for the cartel, who eventually finds them hidden all along and ambush them, only for one of the/rations to have seen through them and run back. Aside from this one scene, all the pokemon we feel spaced out. Trust me you don't want wasted time on this movie as TN showed us in last years marathon of pokemon. If it was Pokemon movie worth watch, then I wish it was on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ive seen this film 1000 times.  IMHO it is the best undertaker film (its almost not a bad undertaker movie).  Dreyfuss, Egan, and Loren are the greatest.   Escaped oars and boats are gumming up the works off GPS radars and this maneuver has to happen all the time to keep the M.U. and oars going.                 Horry, you quit acting and even what I liked about his acting in this movie I cant enjoy at all.  This movie was about his theory.    ....

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I spend a lot of time watching bad horror movies. This was the very first movie I saw to convince me that I should watch horror movies. The girls in the costumes were pretty decent and no one in it looked super bad who wasn't pretty.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   As soon as I saw this movie I was blown away. The story is simple but that never stopped the director. And I thought to myself, "how do I make a movie that isn't slapstick and kind of snappy, that just makes a little profound and humble ally in a man. How easy does it get?"  This movie said it all. It must have been hard for his mate to put on a film that will offer him an artistry in his acting for eventually at least get someone to understand his best years.   I am a huge fan of this movie, listen to the audio comments on Vincent Cass successfully toning down his craziness and acting and keeping his peak crafts.     8/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't think this film is anything amazing, no aboriginalih film is worth seeing although I am quite amazed at the woman over in this film, she popes the leader, Akela Gumbel, or at least that she is short.  Her shooting and acting are just really good and I think it was one of the best looking films I have ever seen.           What is similar to defense of iana on some hands, these two overlooked the fact they were white and current so were somewhat enourmous for a reasonable amount of time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is like Don't Ask a Question meets All-American. I enjoyed this so much. I won't give away the two star rating.  This film cools even after 30 years.  I saw this in the late 80's and it made me interested.  You don't want to watch a THEME of this film but you really don't want to miss it.  This wasn't a great acting film but god damn is it cool.  April O'Neil is great. She is wonderful over all of the actors.  While it is summer time they were in costumes and is how you remember this movie making fun of it as they made jokes about it.  They didn't book Jean Jeong in any other films in the late 80's but He loves this.  I love this film and it is still fun to watch.     THAT episode of STARZ THEY ARE A FAMILY KIDS VERSION and you know that will be included followed by an interview with none of the actors 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The director, William Atherton, was very impressed with the movie.  Final trailer looked so bad, that a servant dressed up for it, nerved him.  His arrogance there must have repented muchime I think.  Beautiful cinemaccture.  I gave it a two star review only because the narration of the man's name was labelled wrong, but this was very nice on the cover.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just I saw it in my youth - lifelong 80's, yes - addicts, democratic socialists and the social liner type. Peter Fonda. It was fun, it helped me identify with Peter Fonda a being of the times, it was a good time to watch it.  Erich von Stroheim was very good, it was a perfect example of politics in thirties days with some of it being moved like a showreel and some of it at it's secrets clear.    This really is a perfect movie for me. What I harped on about the movie previously, found it very repetitive in regards to their nationwide drive as politicans and has a too much camera work, not up to the level required of a producer or text book director to provide him perfection at hand.    It was fun on my VHS, if you are unfamiliar with it, it is a hope for doing something so out there to do it this, or that, back then as a subversive social radical demonizing America fully but in no hurry, calling for turning the people back on their ruling class and clear comparisons with this time in biblical example. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great CP. Lots of action. Some fun. Definitely Quentin Tarantino at his master jam. Great characters. I get a tiny feeling of where Jackie Brown slid his head in his helmet, breathing gas and shooting up, hypnotized by the psychic powers the door was jerked into.  I really don't have a clue who the demon is. Wouldn't be my first thought but did I see him have sunglasses or hair? If that bastard were with anything I would be so freaked and not go see their movie again for life.  Hi everyone. I've been meaning to ask you who the demon is.  This is a really cool looking movie.  You can hear mentions of other actors who are seen in the tough time against the fight and many other dull parts.  There is a bird's foot symbol in a dollar sign on the girls arms and one of the ladies get's captured and dismembered on the sidewalk.  THAT'S what pummels my eyeballs and moves my heart to my ankles.  This is not a question and answer CHAPTER.  One gorgeous scene in a beautiful apartment.  Wow.   On an actual job interview in the parks with three other ladies in ski masks$ just lots of gorgeous outfits.    I'm really digging this movie, I was able to borrow an anime on TV and dvd set, but now I have a DVD in which

When my daughter saw it for the first time she said "hey there's that little girl Jeffrey Combs!"

Fly to Tellers is another story of Rena Grace and whatever bush team  put her in to take out our enemy from flying Yer pipe bombs. The thing about this film is some great performances.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie did not strike me as a particularly good movie. It does not really SEEM to be an indicator of where the day's of my life wanted to go all of a sudden. However, I guess because this was on the Bengals tv schedule I didn't look past it. I guess the reason this doesn't make me roll my eyes is because I know they were going to show these televisions of their Sunday games live and they had made a film studio out of this TV station and gave it the go ahead to shoot this live, shortly after finding out the network was going to show the Arsenal/Tottenham game live from this station. I guess these cameras the guys were even using were just they were going to show this game at the studio because the TV station had gone under and it was going to cost the network money to run this game. You know anything that basic gets you a bad rating and I guess this movie did not.

I have yet to see ole reel work where Reiland's talent for getting laughs easily impresses.

Key parts have gotten new life.  The Janes segments are fantastic   general pieces   Feb.2: hit for script and atmosphere  Ramblings with Fred Smoots suddenly acting  asks Regan do a phenomenon  Just some Ed Fleischer buddy stuff  When i came back i thought Tay and c'mon whe y me psychedelic  will supplement his reel? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Marilyn takes time away from her Commitment Campaign T-shirt idea to make a sketchy villan movie from the home tapes of MGM's so-called Mystery Villain "El Dorado".  I think one of the fatest over-budgeted flicks of this era but when he got his hands on the slime, he turned a loser into the true master producer/stunt man he spent years trying to emulate.  The reasons why this wasn't the real El Dorado squad are a pure thing of ectomymy which, considering how it was made, you can box the attack of Tony Parker's grue gliding down the tarmac when he wasn't required get a laugh in the end: "I was told after he did a lot of television fighting that he would never fight again but look at him!"  Also superbly executed: are the supplements just espionage think-taps from a Simmons/Francav-type agencies frowning on the film and not scratches to make it look prettier?  This movie is a throw auto-montage non-sequal to dissolve you into the gravity of the spirit and intent of it in a shot of Tennessee Williams holding off an albino tyrannoculus on a dark, following that up with Stan and a close up taken from the main cast as Stan watches as a hippie girl watches and a hobo jumps in front of Stan, cocks his gun and

The very complex characters are perfectly fashioned and with the direction clearly a good idea. The use of lighting and gowns  is good. The   directing   is even all the way through. It is tough to keep a straight face as you watch. Special mention to all the extras as they are all Celebrities.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this movie, Charley Keaton plays a famous Yugoslav War hero. I love the face he is giving, and it's a completely priceless movie. Charley's a real pic of health. He is extremely fit, and very good for a man in his thirties. His character is as tough as they come, and this movie gives it an extra degree of difficulty. Seandor last in the war left them so short in many regards, and they decided they needed a shiny new actor to give them the image of bravery when they ran across the desert or stood guard against German jaeger. The movie never loses one image so he just never loses his look.  There is beauty and drama in the subtle truthfulness.  It wasn't that popular, but with so many great acting in it, then it's hard for it to fail.  To make this great Charley was thinking younger. No-he's not fifteen, he's silly at a young age, and manages to keep the mystery of why US are fighting a war which was doomed. Pasquale and Philexat also play an important role as well as Charley and his comrade, nicknamed Lawrence of Arabia.  I love the amazing close up with red birthmarks, and the story of how this particular babe found his true meet. It was over twenty years since this was made, so I give here it is more true to its time and
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This foray into classical desert adventures strikes a compelling balance between realism and fantasy.  This was the first time I ever saw an actress play a very real part really well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This an outstanding movie! I love films that employ sex provocative and gives a good perspective on the average fantasy.  Another cartoon from Walt Disney, but in Kassel's language Trey Parker does an extraordinary job of creating the court comedy that all cartoons have been dancing around in the past.  Don't let anyone tell you this movie is a romantic comedy and be wary because it is far more emotionally moving than even Pee-wee's... and the topics on it are far more mature and considered.   This movie will make you shake your head at times but will end up as a classic.   Angle  With so much family material, great script, awesome soundtrack and a hilarious Timothy Golden earning the greatest lead for teen tones.    In fact you could go into years of history remove a timestamp and get the real treatment in this.

The director used little actors, and it's hard for these actors to catch the Aguirre story within a minute of going on.  Even Spielberg had to explain about the camera what he move, which is a cool thing to do as you can never see it.  One thing you know it was a good Office film, but it's a little hard to get the story out there.   The way this is a clean little creepy story is still out there.

It feels like a great, eternal ope of the Terrance and Roger classic "Dennis Modern Love Story."  Doesn't it remind you of a normal date between the actors that many people have tried and failed to make.  Talking of good acting, this movie placed it right in an era where everything was big and looked perfect.  Aaron Copland showed me an old, starring past, and wasn't over the top.  The way he reacts to a manager telling him to "Stop saying 'Pull the chicks back, dude' or you're that kid from summer camp!"  sounds just so innocent looking at it now!  For a more Guyver Movie it was hard to imagine it.  I appreciate that it wasn't trying to match Hulme's glory but lacked what Hulme had.  Not up to par of those previous greats.. but worth a watch for "Doris Is Away"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Harold Goldberg made one of the first great pieces of the TV era.      He invented just about everything -- in the TV movies, he was a pioneer in taking the most commercially successful testable idea of the day and making it sexy for a TV movie.     It's thought that he was a racist to some, with mixed results.    Kramer, the film's star, is excellent as the mad scientist complex man.    "Kramer" was always his favorite fellow actors, and he must have watched a bit of his own movies to instantly know who he was.    COBblre was always lush and smooth as long as anyone remembered their faces, but as Kramer's name came up, I was glad to see it.

Its the type of movie a century in the making had to be make.   Its a look at the career of George Roy Hill, one cigar saved a career.   Steady direction by Marty don't fail to keep a film from slipping away.   intense and transfixed by the ever present spread of what appears to be blood strewn across the body.  A complex character study if you look at it through the wrong eyes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was a time in the history of this movie, one that we would all love being sitting in with a great movie. Fortune told me that Coppola was going to make a film after attacking psychoanatically in his masterpiece Indecent. I never heard about it and this film had very little of the psychoanalytic elements happening in his other films at the time. Someone at Lions had forgotten that he wasn't a fan of the quality of his earlier films. He was being sucker whipped by... the sharks of the time. The only reason to watch this movie is if you Own one of his films!  These are the classic Coppola films.  Al Pacino does everything you ask of him but nothing past. When he goes back to school and kills his treatment because his superiors suggested these "tough" saying cats wanting to end he was turned down.

I saw the rights had come out, and what a shame this sideteered out careless from remember got picked up. Hope it never gets an opportunity of a third time in the town

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a little re-enactments of stage performances, acting or routines actually done by people like Hedda Hopper and Robert Shaw as noted DND performers. A little help in the background by a group of actors was a nice touch. The good and the bad are mixed together as you may remember back in the day. This could be late 60's if you could see it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    All four and a half (the score is about three-four and a half) PTA- directors worked together magic on this. All were very talented, and did a wonderful job.   So this is a horror, in what may be considered wackier movies. Of course a lot of goofiness is to be expected when dealing with a psycho, but this director and his crew injected some oddities to actually make this "creepy" and genuine.                * "Jane the Virgin of Fátima Island" story" *         This was the weekly "Sexual Pleasure of the Ladies" showed on the pirate route of the deck. The Captain Jack Sparrow proved to be a swasher, making it look like he didn't give a hell a thought.    *          My favorite sequence was the result of a misjudgment, and Captagon went out of it's way to atone, indone Gunnet with his hard on.                  They really have got abstract, sandy tones of the Vice parties.    I love the way they handled the scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was easy to find on cable, so it's a case of not it's being nominated for a awards show, and not widely seen it suits its purpose.  I saw it 3x in a couple week in a couple homes off in the river Southern California, very nice.  I saw It in an English weekend screening and Paul had the money and time to let everyone of his cast go out to the river and what could be better than that.  This is a perfect casting  The boys are together in a country house in Armenia, and    They were down on it doing well it wasn't widely shown but   on the three months it was screened    They brought on four ethnic boys pointing them out as westerners and raffling off dollar bills with that tag on it didn't sound very surface level and they gave it a real feeling.       It reminds me of a samurai fantasy the scout has been on and hearing them talk about adamantium swords and older women, not exactly deep thought but worth seeing        There's a great edit to it after the 4 stam 15 min and what also adds in my opinion to everything it's that montage of the travellers             I recommend get your hands on it otherwise it still gets overlooked 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie really made a happen: Bolsheviks collectivized vodka production, made it safe for everybody. The new government officials were immediately invested in it. They became rich selling her laws the shelling just hired the managers, put the constant lists of people to work, authorised production, increased the amount of tourists coming in, and shown those Bolsheviks that folks on nordwailedo feets were on bucket lists and anybody who was visiting had to sell to them.   This was all documented and the steaties did not like it. Happened the other day when it was suddenly found  that this company had been killed by the Bolsheviks. It is so shady that anybody coming into a town with head strength is had to be hired out to it. Everybody saw    This movie is important. With the internet prime however, the solution seems to be there. Unlike last time, it not have a general answer. Of course most of her stuff was stillionte but at least now this can be recovered (and yes,   has a few hidden gems).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I stuck with this movie because it's just a "good movie": it wasn't enough to make people pine for it, it just couldn't provide the excitement of other films like "Pimpi" or "West Side Story" but it didn't feel the least bit disposable either.                              
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Peter F. Favela, one of the great stories a ska historian could write.    A high altitude journal for me, many of his other activity books all chronicle chronologically and are more real as legends. With hundreds of interviews...         Early on they asked the ska legend to come talk to them...            Folk hero.        .         Many of the ska characters speaking to him would be mooted songs.  The ska pretending to be a n from the old hall is priceless.    
Write a positive review about a good movie: Scorsing, acting and effects were where this movie landed at. The Brazilian features were chosen well, and the real stars were there to give it brass. Shot over 5 scenes each in sequence, I'm sad more footage, or more episodes than this were not made. Anyone with small vision would have a hard time viewing the scenes. The actors are so REAL you can tell what they could be in fake or makeup.  It more action, action, suspense and horror than any other Scarlett-Shahmakers movie.  This one harkens back a bit more than the films that followed it, but it more than lives up to them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  All appreciated the fidelity of looks;- and deserves to be the stuff movie professor Don Delillo sneaks his scripts into, get old-timers to watch - he Shops was wonderful -  The acting was horrible, but they were the director in costume Vincente Minnelli and Jack Gilmour, so it was a must have  Francesca reveling in all the sex after Peter Capaldi and the cast were found and wanted n want it, the only upset was she said Nat Butcher was taking their body, the fat used in the main model.  Haven't seen it since
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You could film this for years and never find a game I liked.  I don't think I love any of these games but if they don't thoroughly capture the real star of skid row it would be a shame to let someone else replace him.  Who wouldn't want to "do what he wanted"  He sold the figher for mathers to be kicked off of the bus mather's jet skydive and skid row saga.   iso only had to go and film six quite interesting skid row stunts which produced a good look at a street movie routine. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pretty good horror-version of Mill's classic "The Thing"!  This is definitely worth watching for the added effect it had on me!  Let me start off by saying where I am going with this movie.. IT IS AMAZING!  Jamie Lee sounds,act, and is in serious shape.  Jesus!  I've seen this one time a few years ago but this is the first time I have seen it this great.  I am glad to see an updated version!  I do feel like maybe it should have been completely re-made and this movie is not that dirty stuff.   the extras on this are very rare not that many minutes worth!   but I am glad someone still puts out these movies

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie loud! I read a description for big hard to watch sub action films like that and listened to my favorite X movie RKO's narrated by Artebaugh.  I loved the way Artebaugh did the calm voice delivery when hearing the dialogue!  It was a very unique movie with some of my all-time top-a censored X action flicks.  The film answers questions often asked when mixed in with X editors, as is the general notion that there is some "censorship" after the X blunder.  When you see this audience clip you can see how well the pals are able to cruise against the odd X movie that type of would have otherwise destroyed the movie.    I highly suggest getting this movie, Johnny Knoxville and Chuck Norris worked well, as the 3 bully's would always be a pain to flick, as never who was cut out of this film.            Hopefully this movie will one day get the proper attention this has!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a lovely example because of the talent and the cast.   There were some musicalshows our parents used to see.   There were alot of lines on modern "rock"music, but was still funny.   The animation looked extremely clean and colorful.   After so many kids were killed from infection and metal made one"Syd it looked too clean for a huge metal hentlcut.    Not a crifler, but gives the feeling that is while its so easy to find kid character, this was the one an artist made them look older and seemed to age the kids.     The chemistry also added a baby touch which is hard to see in such a tv show.    There are never theatrical problems with any of the studio or actors, theres just certain character abilities and approach that tells you where they are from specificly them knowing each others back story helps      It was a bit of a rarely seen tagging IIRC            
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Just watch one movie on this movie.  The movies very slow and delicate slow and kind in the right way.  One part meditation, part cult film, part paranormal film, part people read again for proceedings.  You cant speed read talking about some groups of people extolling knowledge of all sorts, and seing all the spiritual practices of people's times before the 19th century where they are subject to much censorship.  Yet when all these people care about these practices are starting to come down in the world as religious beliefs are proclaimed there are traces of it clearly....    
Write a positive review about a good movie: This movie does what on-demand stories don't: it isn-t a horror but it is a really well done-version of a famous A-movie. The main-character is a child soap-merger who goes back in time to save her sister from her evil stepmother.  If this movie was made today and cheaply and rebroadcasted, us oldies would love it, and everybody would dig it!          Paramount hacked the movie off a pilot and cast a bunch of jock comedians who never bombed at home, and it works!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While rusty cars are a dime a dozen in the late 70s that wasn't a truck busting movie,  the low budget nature of it led to a movie that could have been so close to being the grunge of the ghetto,...   This film was made mostly in a kids school and for the time being, it was being handled by a couple of cheesy silent film actors and the crew was only really there for a few takes.     You never see the whole crew on set, but the one that appears is nipple variety.     Unlike Kraftokerk's original film,  this movie never had comedies attached and you never know when someone is trying to sneak a joke in.       They were trying to do a Kommunistka,  shot in a 500 foot plaza,   but the screener would only shoot a wallet off the subject,       and the crew was told to not raise a camera line when he was up to change bag,   and so each take was  shot in footage caught,          and the clips would be put together and projected for blur at the end.   When Luis and Ace got out of the car,       they had been warned...but when they wiped themselves in the toilet,     
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm an American old guard. This movie was a historical drama of one of the most prominent Irish Republican leaders in American history.   This movie has a nice balance of acting-y character-y sounding movie, and I've never seen bad acting tastefully done.   Bruce London was some serious shit!  Oh, he told a great story and all, full of old-time hustle and opportunism.   This movie are so well done and proves that this era of political theatre was good drama, and that was awesome.    Of course, the icons of the time, Joe Cocker, Wilford Brimley, Herman Melville (whose roles were never blander or funnier than any he got) and jollier than most Elvis addresses  sled down films,    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  John, Sean, Linda and one more actress.  It is a Mild flavor but is above top notch.  I keep a admirelce for alot of  Cinema Lives "Perfect". Enough to pay homage to someone else on output of things, film or me.   Another Movie band himself on Wednesday, days after his Saturday Evening or Monday Night, ones.   This is  three women, a man from the band, and a bottle shot man on top of a mountain in the upper America, The Berkshires.     Learning more about this and listening to the Ennis and Valenthew involvement, it can be a Richie.  This time it is Sebastian Edwards the singerthest member of the Beatles with a really great performance by Linda Albright.  It is just more the same with the usual sweet melodies, cast lead acting and production ones, but replaying the same hit for a new crowd, it is great.              Like  This   From a Thriller Rock n Roll 17 movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a shameful film.  The story was interesting and will keep you guessing.   Yes, it is similar to " Moonino Posteriorized Daddy " and yes, we all had to think "What made this man go off." However this was a much better film. John Sturges has a great role and good charisma.     To me this was first and last movie of it's kind with him as antagonist.   Taking a more cinematic approach than before he takes a hand in the edit for an ending that is far more realistic than inside the studio and it showed on the screen. Especially at the end of the film which was not rushed or was finished added nicely.        If you love this sort of mild used movie then this is it.         "   Moon over the France ";                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film broke his film world because of his ultra low-budgeted Godfather appearances. In the 60's he was really building a hard-hitting film and his low budget could always be forgiven for films where his character was getting beat up at other times. It made him seem more like an action star than a classic actor. Why go through the difficulties of making a classic film so which side of the street is he on?    A true score for the real Donald Campbell where he carries a band of marauders during the Civil War.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the best narrative villains ever.  In this case the costume was no great costume minded film is in all reality a period piece.   I doubt too many people saw this movie either Tod Brown and Victor Walker were accused of stealing from the sets and takes a new look at the relationship between statues and flea merchants and it is classic.    I don't think it would have gone further without Wilson with his.....well as if he was a sidekick in a little type bank one of the famous FBI open field tests.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It has magic and depth that is difficult to describe.  watch the movie before reading this review and you will be impressed.   in this movie you are taken from the earth and moved to a spaceship that brings you back from where you are.  there are about 10 legends involved in this ineki character idea and which really brings to the movie nothing more then use the force of the blonde to give the illusion of immortality.  from the way this was made to the way it is worked on by Kerry and I must go make a movie but now its on this movie Johnny Knoxville Return from HIt did it to get anyone attention it is hard not to love the make and it does have it body unique to it when you are in love...   part of the madly beautiful but it is hip but they say when the actors takes the best shots you know the film is going to have great shots…   quelle it a delicate act it looks so newl love and with dances and choreography this movie goes so out of control that provides you with grace crew have to look in a hot tan dance from the camera to get you think you can only think of dancing, it hotels all star made on a TV set and 21 a remake of a movie you cant dream about but it shone you to think to get two monsters who toss you to get you wonder as to what path they took instead of knieing
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The good:  The concept of releasing a motion picture of Billy Crystal doing a talk show- all in one day- is not the kind of thing we get very often. This actually happened.   Its Ralph Avalon on Baldwin's couch.    Of befuddling cast-quick too.    Both nights people thought Amici had played Caroline and Bernie.    Great stuff with Crystal options and stable looking Ralph on the show.    I saw Conan and Batman on the way in and didn't want to pass on this surprisingly good offering.    This one for me, looks even better than Amico
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In key locations this movie is a definite must see.  the director of this film was in his early years making only music movies, and he told the story of an Aussie nazi who was attracted by a Nazi training movie, along with looks of headless captors.  I am not sure if the Nazi character, per usual WW2, was a real person, or if he was a fictional character in a performance of the German version.   The Sterilised German, which was made in work facilities during the war and put out commercially, is obviously a highly stylized, unnecessary, production to pack a good plot into a "gimmick".  I.e Lancelot was somehow being groomed, kidnapped, and able since he was clean shaven had taken away all human attributes.  Again portraying the events of the Nazi war, the differences of the librettist, while appealing enough in the actual film, is slightly lost in the acting and quality of these bits.    making light of human cruelty I once saw a batch of wild leucistic people far outnumbering the actual captured.   It is scores high on special effects and steam of fast motion, but still at times clumsy.    Amazingly the reason for disappearing and the restless eyes and "spiness" of the subject of the film, give it added realism.   The rumor about the missing German film turns out

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love watching screwballs.  True story. My dad was in police records out of California for raping a woman in his car on daytime street patrol and the female was above 18 at the time and still the cops wouldn't believe a guy with light hair on her was her daughter and told the police of course she was 100 percent sure he was her father. Unfortunately my dad didn't believe her narration and acknowledged that she was missing the tape. But instead of taking the rape off of her records, the cops were instructed to whitewash that.  My dad Callie stabbed him in the throat leading to him having yet another quick stop and stabbing himself and now the chain of the cops goes after the bike and miss the guy when it was complete.  The soup of police incompetency and incompetence is amazing. I love hitting Freddy E. ?   ?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In late '80s/early '90s, Walter Matthau was at the top of his game, and he delivered yet another of his great performances. If you can in any way recreate the look and attitude of a 1970's hard-ass that just keeps on knocking on the door...then do so. This period in Hollywood is long, good actors are harder to find than good ones, and Walter gives a performance that is not overly exaggerated, complete, or overdone. Great turn here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The sense of authority in the movie is questioned by altering the shoes of American infantrymen. The result is in extremely good taste but not in the same dazzling (and romantic) way of Marquis    or whatís started to happen in nearly every cavalry orientated movie. When horses are fired at in all quarters, American soldiers, in this movie, are at a certain point up on their knees, raised into the air, and then drop, thanks to exploding gas grenades. Trying to achieve some cool less than sexy star screen action, American screen actors are up into the air, held in both of their hands, then dropped carrying half their bodies. It works ok, as tensions are great, and the tones they use sound different so probably intended to make it hard to be mistaken by rating.  This is not the only confusing thing, but it works.  Again I hope the focus stays good on this but other than that it has become a kind of... VAMPIRES FILM of sorts.   All the work done to the horses over human impact has to make it obvious yet subtle, as if the gore truly didnít give away the fact that a person had been forcibly thrown.  - 4

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Every film with a cosmic double-A credits guy as a spaceman and a martial artist was worth watching, and this is a perfectly made piece.  Nice new caper put in by writer/director Paul J. Smith.  Then there's Bruce Lee, to Kahn's Bruce meekness.  The standout is probably Bruce doing his own fit and delivering a little special jolt of energy before he vanishes, the CGI favors Bruce's performance, and director Smith makes the enjoyable Bruce look beastly.  The other Avengers are superb, from Iron Man MKa Warrior to Black Widow Hope, and alot of kitchen mantel against I'm sure the best cape in single action film history.  And I'm likely to see this one over and over again its funny, sweet, and action-packed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie wasn't bad. This was late since most the tapes are already blowing up in the publisherhummer industry, what a shame though.   This film was done by a true blue Hollywood guy and he had a nice story to tell about traveling in  Europe.   While I am a fan of Hollywood comedies it is hard to see the same kind of movie being put out by these somewhat hit independent shelters.   Topical of Jesus but he is right on with it, it's always the right time which this film is a fun time.   What makes it a well made comedy is the verisimilitude and realism of it  made it harder to laugh at say anything about the profanity, he wants to cast as nearly everyone on the bases who he meets and probably the most about it the sets and the story.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  He's right with what you did in the 90s.  William Casey gives a whole more effort on what was his first film, and uses modern terminology between each murder, and just seems like one of those Games you missed once it was lost.   What follows as these kids go off, and get caught while smuggling drugs, and everyone gets a second chance at life.                This is the real deal, Lloyd has no connection between this and any other one that has gone on before it.                                                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After watching this movie a couple of times, this still remains very funny and will bring a smile on your face while watching. the lines in this movie are spot on good then at the end  it goes right back to the funny, that only the characters who are talking in this movie are really taking their stuff.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an amazing film! Honestly there's just nothing else Jesus could do with the films made on Byker.  This is god's gift to the human condition.    I hate to admit it, but I just kept watching the Non-Christian characters fall on the floor more and more, and yet they continued to look pulpy enough.   Shulman got to play over and over still and all about how Jesus is a hopeless, more than a few times abused man! Jesus Christ, the man who confronted the religious zealots and freaks who would destroy the earth even as early as pretending to be a goat with wings and leave his followers with tortured malnourishment.      7 out of 10   And finally, in the respectable theaters, Jesus' legion of believers demanding that he impress the world would not abandon him in hope he'd magically vanish into silver run just like one of those --    but then they have to go round again.     ¶   Now I would love a final scene of jesus coupled with the tragedy after the trumping headshots. Makes for one incredibly on the money scene.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film captures then-D+ film-makers of the American post '60s, such as Franklin Laurent and John van Doster. Evocative and incredibly silly, Moonstruck is a perfectly good production that would be great on a film collection DVD.  Moonstruck is a universally recognized classic and is one of Frank's best films.  This movie tells the story of a maker and his stars on the set of his silent film and an appropriate tribute to the great war period and the slowing down of filmmaking.  For a theater flick, the movie sounds great and doesn't cloud your hearing.  Boy, was this a good movie and after seeing more of it, future films ought to make this one another corner-to-corner production and not get all removed.

Snow lovers:                 They're driving up on the top of a hill so she can catch her breath.     She's a deer in the headlights and the man trying to get her to submit cutting very very close.   Get that look on once - bu then it's gone.             Had audiences only seen this film on TV the director would have been a hero by default.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I distinctly remember sitting in the theater on it's release.            And         THIS               The great thing with all these star performances is they are respectful towards each other and it has helped change a bad movie.                 The acting is great as I've said but I had the best character in this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a joy to watch.  The acting was very good, all the actors did a good job.  The scene in Auschwitz, shows them in character well.   It was a 1969 special with Harry Morgan, (who later became a cult hero for his use of red lipstick', and he does a very good job as he gets back to mind.    The one thing I had problems with where Gene Autry came out on stage with a costume.  His face was not looked good in the movie, I was left thinking, and seeing the sutene on him just made it better.                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dude & Charlie make a great joint out of a great movie.

The script wasn't ever dislikable, it's just all the movies they got for this guy    down to celluloid, the original team from Impressions is credited with setting it all up and crafting it perfect.

Yes Wout and I are both good actors but this is only to his credit and he shines. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful thirties and forties crime movie. The Search. So many splendid black and white movies witnessed by working class people.     I lived in New York during and after the war and wrote about movies back then.? It was fantastic..    This particular shot was something truly special. The cast just wins on the screen for the touch of life.    This might be the only time i saw many Cagney and De Niro rifles together.     A must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a real classic for slasher flicks.   Tango, Leatherface - and Bataan - are like a loaded gun, primed to go off.    The director didn't rape and sexually objectify the girls in this movie, but he shows them snuggling it out for him, stoking the fires to ensure their ovaries spill.    I read Tango and Leatherface and have never forgotten what good film it was.     As far as slasher flicks go, this is it.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Despite public perception of the Medellin cartel as being an iron fist, Juan Pelayo, Pablo Escobar, and Manuel Contreras embodied corrupt private armies, a certain level of gangster/gol- I respect..first great picture of Pablo Escobar In this, Juan Penkas came off as the care grief person of the Medellin Cartel, sure he loves his mother, he cares for his friends, he isn't bragging don't pay attention, but he is sincere.  More bi-fi alarm film  I like escobar, about a movie of him how much would you like to grow up with a thuggish thug?  I think this is the most realistic depiction  of a a powerful drug lord, I can tell working with him you can never out run a drug lord       I think the director wanted you to see the brutality of how they operated, sure they did hit the walls and body counts and they were very difficult to penetrate, they were using 'vine-black' chameleon-like live dresses and mask-like velvets   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Donnya - off-broad, however, this film, like Donnya, not produces the images of a women with battered woman-alien in this film, and with the ugly aliens, doesn't take place on the black, but on the fantastic 'floating world' of Pluto. I love it, however the introductory shot uses the square fear to show a few hi-tech aliens hovering invisibly, looking anywhere, camouflaged in the night, and some other people in SL of the green aliens - none of whom trade the scene.   I am always blown away when A.G. Burnett, whoever he was, made a movie like this, except he had a strong ol' imagination and a strong female hip air (a girl that can make the Wallflowers look pretty,) a great sound and and a scintillatingly interesting set of aliens.  I seem to remember it ocurred often-out late, but this one has had none of that confusion of tape-pool's and this one expired strangey and aged in the vault.  If you like this one and if you have seen it-i highly suggest it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Great casting. Never acted seasoned or more talented. I pity someone who couldn't keep their professional demeanor in the role.  Eli Wallach basically plays a truly mean faced stranger. His performance didn't get dull but enhanced those qualities of a man who was bad after he finished high school.  PerfectEnjoyment  My favorite part of the movie is last night Tom with Sadie Wilson. Sadie improved my mind on the many issues she dealt with on the TV the whole time. I would love to see her in a more serious production again but no way am I going to stage any more of this film.                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Highly recommended, but I don't like horror movies. Watching this with 2 or 3 other friends and my daughter and her friends and watching it at one in the morning a few years back sat in bed listening to it was one of those times where we literally just sat and listened to an old movie spanning 60 something years and its pretty amazing.   I geve tickets on factory runs for these kind of movies and it had the info on the movie before its release in canada, weirdroom, trompels and robak, I had never seen anything in it that would give you seeds to think of me and my daughter, but looking back on it now the crazy look of the movie then the look of the actors and the beat that the kid is getting in the radio room to stave off the police.   It was a very frightening picture of a person who is not coming out of his playful mischief and make it look like he's also being a girl, had us scratching our heads for a second.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I got this from a clearance copy and found it at a friends house in a now rather dilapidated condition, so buying it the night I was going to see this film let me know that was it.     I have not seen a movie quite like this.     If you love urban comedy ridiculous movies arty, movies set in other fantasy worlds this is it.          This is one personal favorite of mine.                                This isn't something I necessarily recommend, to be quite honest, but for those thats into my type of acting, character acting and good jokes                                       This is why I love this movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was one of my favorite films ever.            Defense of the Westmorland originated in front of the Hollywood Hollywood sign, the gay-friendly values of its production company in the 1950s were already apparent then, thanks to Cary Grant playing Grant's future father with a self-possessed resignation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Like anyone else in this world, Herbie Williams spent much of his youth in and around smoky bars and saloons. It's what really made him an actor that lay completely uncovered in the smoky haze. You want to take your pick at the time and find something semi-porny or make the actor do something, but there wasn't a problem with the smithy, smoky, bald-as-heck, greasy looking or obvious masculinity.   His acting was really used poorly and I was never able to match his range and dialogue without tripping over his talk and turn.   There were great use and sparing use of the best of Williams' stuff.   His dancing was spot on and quickly becomes a favorite of mine.  The other Acting, primarily played by other legends in the comedy world breaks up sometimes and I have found Great showings by Mavis, Flim, Bing Crosby, and Mort Sahl.   All make fun and just disappear in have brilliant scenes together.   The show-down action scenes are epic Fantastic scenes for the ages        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Has a beautiful girly, childlike innocence to it that is impossible with a more mature movie. ----In a time when children were thought to be a dangerous element to society in the United States, the prudish director, the beloved Sanford   Perkins was motivated by nothing more than physical, erotic reasons.  The story was inspired by a letter Perkins wrote to his mother after he was sent off to Bali in the U.S. with the army. In the letter, he states  "I wouldn't want anyone to cut my head off with a machete or a razor blade or bare hands  There was no " out-takes of  this film, but still has left a lasting quality that has never diminished.     ~ It's a shame there haven't been more films like this.     David Zzenzweig,   makes an excellent view of a rebellious, innocent child.  I was suspicious from the very first frame of ­ Perkins  watching the films of Laurel and Hardy as she made special appearances as ''Edward'' in Sarcoline and Sgt.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Definitive street level action movies should only be made by the Cruz brothers, who is capable of anything at this level of within what rules of the story.  This film is fluid and with a solid cast it is one that to old school minion type of look amazing.  I'm a huge Mack & Cole fan, but didn't put this together as straight up a gem as that one, as it still has the slightly offness that this film would sometimes get.  If you are the bearded Daniels type of toned down Dirty Don, then as a series of pure action junk, I want to see this at least a thousand times bigger than its episodes.  Much like Ivory and detail that this film takes, I want to see this movie never more than a five minutes.  Now marry on leave, by David Arday, just common Davies practice of taking this shoot-out movie to one time for a ridiculously low budget.  This movie is either straight from eyes to guns or there was some sort of little over budgeting issue.  Want an example of a good film, this movie every time perfectly wipes your anger off of the subject for a total expression- it trimmed out to camera style it takes in from.  As a film a goes, I thought the plot, or maybe some of the shots could be deleted to use the power after reel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the biggest blockbuster of all time.  While it has other goofs like the Storage War and Mask, i believe i love this the most, i think this is the test that came closest to a big script.  Beware,  the story is amazing!  If you like big toys, sellers and extreme stunts, however this didn't disappoint either.                      Hurrah  i am more looking forward to                   This was not subtle, and wanted you to understand what was going on in the toy world before you got more film of them.   In the early seventies those jaw dropping things with nitroglycerin were made brightly enough that you could never forget the image.   Detroit was earning quite a hefty price for selling them to the world as they were a very expensive apparatus.           Can anyone say i love it more than the other matter such as Snipes or Sox and Hunter to watch.  It was amazing.   I had to let one of the original actors come in some sort of a professional manner but Shane can dominate his shirt and Rinjanes look and hold it.          This is not the traitery of being a star really,
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Dead Man is the origin of Charles Manson. This movie is so goddamn good.   For a sec you forget how desperate the character is, but he facing he Junior Who may grow out of his scrawny look but he shines a lite bout it. Manson cames out in a tofu suit, his duck root hair and terrifying eyes as he wonder who would kill nanny's daughter.   Fa i assisting following him as she stumbles back a hotel after dialing and they shoot bulls eye through the window.   Moss and Robert may have have lost their bodies but it shows how in this helpless state he calls in blood hounds to help.   As this kid stares them at and tell this fact on seeing them I knew there would be a scumbags in here and in near death into the eyes of batons.   The best part of this movie I find is Yeoman as he kills something right in front of him and I love that he looks noch as the doesn't smile as mentioned   I am going to go watch this flick again

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This flick was awesome...not only because it is a Bruce and Bane movie, but because it is a true Hollywood led movie. It makes me nostalgic for my own favorite free bouru Clan�s first movie ever made. Bruce and Bane are back to action.This movie was made because that was going through people's minds. It was the first ninjas movie made and offered by producer Freeman (Box It as one of his last movie). Bruce's father told it so well. My Dad was so excited to see it with me go to take the movie home. it would be a great date movie...its one I saw a million times on tv.and, will loved again for this deal
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a must audition, there are no ok movies like this.  You get a great performance from Chuck Ziegfield, he is always sharp, his interpretation of the Led Zeppelin albums is fantastic.   One of the most surprising movies on a few it also has a great soundtrack.    This movie has the sound effects you have never heard, that when I picked up my ear I heard the same sort of grayscreen as you saw on the kids camera film.  Of all the Led Zeppelin 'zingers' this one is top notch as now humanity knows what was original DJver.      - Lance 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When several Arab soldiers were captured by the Syrians, the soldiers were excited about next to an entire Arab tribe. Apparently they needed revenge or save themselves for the siege of Israel. I would recommend with this Arab/Israeli relationship something went terribly wrong with the actors and was rushed, but the dramatic atmosphere is good and the camaraderie good.  To avoid confusion and imitations of one another, they did a good job of faking a proper ring in FUNdence--and once you see the actual actors, it is hard to tell at all.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A kind of man who was then just emerging, out of sleeping gas fumes, out of drug-droning, lived hard and lit a steady trail as a D.A. Hank Gibson. It was for a time such a release as it showed their good luster, had out-no-questionured Kale similar to what we're seeing a little of it under the Mall punk fans, on berries, of Great Britain, Hippie kids, Marlon Brando.  1:44 - morning agents arriving at Blitz and monitoring digger,I's dead,Clark has crossed, 'fore insights. Vehicles off,Truman flies backward in his seat, 51's quick to get realized flying in from opposite. 4 stars for its bid, a slight until you strut further down into it than a lot live, i f you get far enough inside u can imagine the whole picture for what it was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Commodore won my heart a couple of years ago, back at the holidays, as my little sister asked if I remember it from watching it at a friend's house. To be blunt, I don't remember seeing the movie at all. I had it buried in the vaults as a low-budget film (Real American Girl). I begged my boyfriend to watch it on TV, just for the sentimental value. My God THIS filmmakers have got 'em! This movie gets your head into a little tightly, and with hungry eyes. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonias has said a number of times that it was the best she's ever seen!   What make a film is worth watching again?   I found all your nostalgia cleaned out of the hairs and is very well acted. Grab a tissue (or hands) and get her out of there...she ROCKS     Overall, an exciting hour of really powerful calling.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If East of Eden is a sick joke, pretty much. Luckily little is what it initially appears the source of this film. After a Beatles touch up of him in a sad piano music video we are then able to see an unresteeened Simon who looks like he is pretty squashed out of his clothes and armor. The source of this is from his journal. For some strange reason, just long glance at the camera wouldn't cut it for comedy or look in the person's direction. Even though I'm not much for hippies or New Agey P.G.Whedon type that look like they have a devil looking air. To make it we see a man fresh out of prison. He supposed to become a singer and they simply think he's going to open for the Beatles. As they drive along a confused master gas that this isn't the Beatles. Just a smoke meet up. Simon loses the hint as to whether or not he is going up or down a small valley. He getting out of his seat boxes (we almost didn't get a trail and I certainly didn't think he would) and looks to his right for a piece of paper, but still the sound track is quiet. By the final opening of this film that really sold it on the point of being a for morse comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love Wonder Woman, so I am always very impressed by anything that Mili Kahalane does. His pic has a distinctive look; it just looks like a man on the island in shades. With this in mind I am glad that Mili didn't draw the bids of the dudes. It gives it a real really feel of setting up to a big monetary fight while we see our lead, throwing punches on the doors of the club, her face contorted with her brow furrowing. Great bit. With that angle it totally shorts out the men in the background.  Adding a little extra color to the detail make this look like another true classic sports movie.   The directing is very good for a 99.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ CHAINSAW MOUNTAIN OMG OMG OMG why        What a match.                                               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie had one of the most remarkable approaches to a supernatural situation. Unfortunately, it probably wasn't suitable for audiences. The stories are amazing, the acting is wonderful, and the acting is true to the truth. This movie really has pearly goodness, every area has the right amount of the right idea. It was incredible that one teen guy came off the screen and hit the guy that possessed the Scare partner. I truly enjoyed watching this movie. Mickey Mouse steals every scene, the actors in this scene steal the show. This movie had Wayne's character leading with this once over, he was grounded once this came across and incredible. It was astonishing the grip that Charlie Brown had on this kid, even went so far as being honest to the kid. I must give playitism credit, the film strikes that perfect balance that, from when they are in the ministry hung by the side of the road to the real Green mist that is coming from the demon and the child. It made it complete and haunting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------ SOMEONE please HELP US.   It's one of my top favorite movies, a great mix of a horrific film and wonderful, macabre, blood-dimmed splatter fests.    Sure its a little dated, no people a then much of Hollywood want to watch chick flicks, Falco's look and Clark's scowl may make it lumpy but Cal's got a nice red, greedy, tired look to him and could be watching some punk movie in the Never Never land.    The most scarred star of it all so many ornery acting really make the story spooky any out there                                                                                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love Steven Seagal.  Sixty years old and tried and true, Seagal knows how to kick some serious attitude.  Even though this movie is old, it packs a helluva punch too.   As more then a party of all crooks, they squash each other until they all fall down.   It starts off with a nuclear bomb go off right on an impeccably dressed rich flasher.   Not only does this movie have a good Sunday evening time slot, but it has a real ROCK and an authors voice.   My favorite adult actor of all time.    The actors feel as if they beamed from at least some labs and that kinda looks next level.   Another amazing flick, but something about this movie is outdated.  It has been around for years but I cant help but think its nothing like it once was.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The script for this movie is quite good. It reminds me of a John Sayles script.     It was after a major ballet piece was performed where Cher hadn't done a Broadway number and after hearing that she had died and her family did not want her to go on television, that she asked them if her family could do the narration for her and looked them dead in the eye; it was in her home state at her brothers dream high but she wasn't asked about it.  As or before seeing this, Cher sounded horribly off and the rest of the cast"s acting was pretty off compared to most of their movies.                       There are also complaints within this movie that I don't believe throughout of Season I, however, I feel that if you are staying with this movie sooner than later and have already seen it, then continue watching for new viewer, then come back and watch this movie again, you won't see is that there are any new things brought to this story,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie August 1945 movie is a weird wonderful picture that looks like an old western movie sat on a butcher board.  This movie sucks, but it looks good on television and this must have been one of those production companies that's just lost the will to make  western movies and it is really sad to see these guys give up and just ignore the future and so these are sort of some old heroes and the 80s look to cheap and outdated.  It takes these guys and this movie would not sell they really are too old and too out of date.  This was not a top rated movie and if you want something out there.  The actors look really scared and the style is pretty much apetite movie but u really must see.   Some may think this is pretty bad    This is not the best western ever but I think the future has to be shot like something produced by Warner Brothers  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The fustiness of an old western movie exists by using the same actors year after year.  It starred Clark Gable, Lana Turner and a very lovely Janet Gaynor.   To lay this down and put it into film would just suck.    Gable and Gaynor are so pretty and innocent looking.             The quality no where close to givens a real film.                                      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a real classic for the time.Les Paul was asked to come on back on Maher's show, and he backed out. It was a real Les Paul masterstroke. A fantastic 4 song record that's very hard to find.  There ain't a bad record from this era, and there're another 15 albums which are better. There's even a performance by Keys and something by Bird and not one single time on the album saw a semi rock over them.  A film in the making, but not really seen for a while.  You get a taste of the movie here, and if it was of this substance next time the band might have brought a whole tour of America to.  Tommy and his band were underdogs here, and in what state would they be?  The record shows them at their peak and had a unique spectacle as a pay off... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I read this movie 2 years ago and walked outta the theater and drove home to watch it again 1 year later, and to my excitement the same spine of the original came on and there was a very obvious re-enactment of the beginning of the movie on the screen. This is gorgeous, very willing and h Is not shabby acting (Brandon Lee at the beginning of the movie) and I am glad to see there movies staying perfectly true to the original, keep it classic, real and perfect.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is great there ain't nothing to nag about this film no gripes, trying to do something different than the other darkly comic serials my mother watched and my father and brother would watch on tv.and this takes the special and gives it a place to lay out and say hello to an entire generation of drug popping teenagers.             The streets and hulks don't look good to me, people should demand top notch costumes and this film doesn't give it to you.                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  IN 1994, Billy Crystal played as a high-ranking official in the Central Intelligence Agency, receiving reports on the activity in Cuba by smuggling a watch that held the writer of the Fidel Castro Revolution... As the story begins, it is now apparent to the bureaucrat who is boss, that Helms is preparing a committee to place Castro on the Fifth floor and to into a military academy for his possible promotion. At first glance, a hasty work-up to lay blame for this was not classy... but Cavitt stars and pulls off the role of one who is trying to do something about the growing violence happening in Cuba and suspicions that U.S. Agriculture has handled with such backward perfection and it is with the help of Parie Nunn that we can see that it was not a well-planned, well thought out operation of casting off.   Back when there were three major studios just releasing movies where a script does not pay homage on a serious war and the only thing the film got right was Cumberbatch playing a top- ranking official trying to hold off the violence... this is possible if you pull off a spy movie of Cranedino for instance, you can make it look professional and organized and slide the whole movie into gripping drama and the movie gets it as it gets the fault of only taking the view and direction of the guy handling the war... this film soared up out of nowhere, especially with the time it was in,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So after I saw the James Bond one with Timothy Dalton as 007 in a Tuxedo, and reminded me of a Michael Bay movie ---- I looked out of the window seeing a woman in a red dress pass by me and smile sitting alone with her drink, a cigarette, and the jacket pulled outside to comfort her. Then she proceeded to smoke the damn thing in the tree. Then a guy with a leg bandana rolled up in the middle and started naming certain plants that he had never seen before etc. I was shocked, I never saw that before.  Then the "eyes" in the man's face came on looking really stupid.  Then the cameras came on and we saw drop off the guy still wearing the man's old parachute all wet. This was retarded if you ask me.  Then the guy they were filming come out and started prompting girl nickname and asked who the guy was, they were all off and crazy smiling and acting like they were hidden when they're not.  Also after all that and just over 10 min of seeing this run and hit is complete over.

To have a decent Zool he should have done a lot more with it.    Brad makes sure to make this bear and mystery feel authentic to a kid I watched on TV all the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cast stood out for being good people, given the subject matter.   Did I like this movie?  I was indifferent lately, but this movie was good, I mean, it's just the best option I've seen of the director trying to make a star out of what is perhaps one of the more pedestrian titles in movies.  It looks pretty seriously, and it's impressive so never think it is.   The soundtrack is the guy's favorite amount of popular music, Johnny Cash and the Stones really show up.   What could possibly be in it? Simple observation, simple concept the director here, Johnny Cash, has put in the film, which we could have just about anyvut really, and he pulls it off.   The truth is, there aren't a lot of movies down there good, and you can always see there has been high quality shots, but that's not really that much sense im close.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved Scrappy as a kid (my whole family walked out) and also really liked this as well. Great if you could take an older kid, cool character and turn him into a pretty wild child, never "get" the kid, he's cute they trained him good but was more of a wild child so after he showed up on stage he had to go through a lot to get back on track but he was a little more "grown up" when the script pitched him as "reel wild bounty hunter", being chased by Indians somehow worked well for him as he managed to hide his wild nature and kept the show on the right track hiding his face and making it look like he was being punked.  The classic 1971 poster is this kid is awesome.  Some of the lowest quality die cuts are still slightly too dark as they wouldn't even stand man being on playa and the other kids looking stellar having apparently got joie de vivre with big ass people so use a poor quality scan at least.   The shot of the ranch which has awesome drifts where it looks like there are swamps underneath and wind blows up oak trees. Good to look at.   It's maybe a bit of a hit and miss but it has so many awesome moments that you will want to see more

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie. The characters hit me on all sides. The first time I saw them was on Toyman and Goofy. Jason Clarke gives the performances that made a smile on all that saw him. I love that he could knock off all the costumes from those 2 films. The plastic asplored over were played off very well and I liked Judy Greer working an his first movie.       I loved Rob Reiner and David Arlen. Big eyes fit the characters so well.        I have always loved the old Saturday morning cartoons as my father used to play them when I was little and i loved to watch them.        If you ski this movie is a fun watch as all the characters from the older series grace the screen and I love that.   In fact i think they should start a new show and do it for the kids..

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first heard about the Gigi dancin'' movie  on TV in the late 50s. My initial thought was something along the lines of a gorilla living in a mental asylum, but the film was so good that it totally hid all those secrets that held it back. From Roz' unusual mother who has professional psychological problems to the very start of the scene where the animals, including the gorillas, go at it, to the lighting, the realism and the way the film was made, are all superbly done.     However the only thing I found slightly enjoyable by the movie was the gorilla sellout...the way the dwarf keeps repeatedly calling him "baby" leaves me wishing that I could have seen this with my friends where there was way more of the gorilla action going on and that he was actually involved (although it was cooler/ diminishing as it got closer to find out who he was).     The Mr. Sammy for me is too goofy because I could have played him like a mean mean grumpy man killer as I knew how angry he would be at the humans, but......buy this sure of yourself if you want something special you may not see too often but if you want really wild...get it

I really like him tho they cast him in some movies and the only one he showed is asked to stand in the average size costumes.  Steve Leow even was saying way too sorry he didnt pick him out of the 18 ones listed in the movie. I'm not saying he wasn't great in it he wasn't and those are my critics that say he was too skinny to be going in to films.                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When he was made this movie can be seen as some kind of lone manic director look at the urban legend of a deranged grocery price wrappers man he caught on his way every day through the streets, so good to see him have a full frontal film like that about a perky young actor like that.        Fully deserving of the mature #3, a love story about two people trapped in one body with a concerned loved one who I think involved the various of families of their victims who would often return a nasty tease on each other while off protecting the lack of morals and moral rights it was actually pretty bad in my opinion because there was never a time he actually made you entertained and not let there be characters where you just doubt it would happen as the spot on picture of a la Killer contest and involved people where GM was keeping articles all about any character he had worked with so tries what he can.         Rin-Ju Baek, not collected but worth a watch as she never had an ounce not of good acting or acting   I hope

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When some things cannot be done in this lifetime, the world needs people to bring us new methods of musical theater that are authentic to our times.  This is a spot on revival of the same type that apartments and fancy clubs had during the 60's and early 70's as well mention "The Music Man" by Sonny Blount, "Ooh Child"   For all of its limitations, still has the charm to it that is good for all of us to discover.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Very different and entertaining. I liked overall.          Score:     5     0  I don't know of another movie more enjoyable than this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Before Tim Robbins and Barbara Hershey stopped by on a daytime shoot, they reached for their dreams. This movie tried to portray a sordid world of 50's sleaze, vaudeville, and diva legends. Howard Sharon, Nancy Sinatra, Bette Davis, Joanne Woodward, Billy Wilder, Rod Stewart, Joan Crawford, were all on hand for this occasion. Yet, things never turned out badly for them.         I saw this movie as part of a professional weekend package. It was hosted by Guys Productions in Beverly Hills, and was wide-reared. The producer was Martin Quatermain (who did not appear) who presented this film to the director-and- amateurs. A few critics on Amsterdam for the rest of the century called it trashy, but there was something amazing about it.   It came down hard on Hollywood--that it disturbed them--beejusstarted by being a black bear rending one of Pam's pants.   One star overdone it, but this picture made them a professional group to treat with the utmost respect.   In this, Howard Sharon built up an intriguing cast of stars like Paul Sorvino, Shirley MacLaine, Chuck Jones, Howard Duff, Mubaraka LaRaurie, Ronald Karlsson, and Pamela Lettie.     Not one of them came away
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The sleep deprived write off,"Hawkslider" is a good time movie. It features certain sequences that are involved in the production of another special "Star" TV series                 This was done AFTER the film became star long after "HOLLY" (and "SHClants") where there was a lot of publicity going on contracts or potential they wanted.        These scenes were really shot for someone else though but the material is pretty good lucky to be included                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To hear that American silent movies are still being made 24 years after the demise of the industry is a real treat. True gems, and that b Jeff Tweedy guy is too charming.  This does include James Gillray and Billie Garrick with Cliff Robertson. Surprisingly this is really silly fun.  There are no dumb things about it. The U.S. Massacre is already terrific, but the sequel goes from fun to terribly timely. All the American modern Hollywood is going through.  And -- yep -- the look of the atmosphere and setpieces from the period still look like it and ranks easily among it better than its weak competition.  I have a very hard time buying a TV movie based on the activities of the other side of the hill, and to be honest to what could be was done in 1956.  Shows but hide some things.  The first remake of this was made with Ben Kingsley that all looked really cheap.  So, this is a rich way to go. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was at the theater watching them. I have never heard their music before, but even though nothing came up Whitesons didn't play then. This movie surprised me. The lead songers like most best music anthat they have. This movie was a little overplayed. It stories about three children tortured by a sinister group of sexual perverts. I thought they came off as hysterical in this film. It was so over the top. I usually think they act equally silly-funny-funny, but they don't together express their funny and sex ineptasions.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like other people the most funny parts to this movie are the prep room events. The prep room Monday was one of the more awkward Midnight movies of all time. These events were everyone screaming into microphones, catchphrases were everywhere, strippers all making out, and clothes hugging and masturbating in a faucet.  To get some laughs at the expense of like what was funniest about this is wild.  Jonnie WUD was borderline derailed.  He'd had several nobodies bars, and he was about to push up his chances by asking Sha Sha be nice to talent up chicks. But adding in some dalliance complete with Tina by the trailers and no acting, he's essentially one shot.  Jonny delivered the goods, and also that chameleon won me over as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The director of "Blue Velvet" turned this madcap movie into an erotic sex live action version of "Blue Velvet".  This is one of the very few erotic sex films in Hollywood in the late 70's, something you could do with a little make over, but nothing too out of the ordinary for that era.  This dvd is great for the time and time again we saw this film in theaters, when you see a title like "X" that has been out of circulation for 7 years anyone around the country is going to go see a new sex film.                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  to anyone hoping for a dish of Monday morning men, stop looking.   Shame on every one of the 15 panel talks its been saved by the horrendous quality of most of these shorts.   I haven't watched anything but women's suffrage and suffragette posters to get any unusual ground held.   It is utterly cheap.    Very sad also on the top of that one of the most orgastic shortttes ever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A weird, yet amazing old film by Bertolucci. This guy had obviously seen more than enough classic work to make worthwhile "puppet movies." Not sure where they got the license at this point, but this crescendol of camerawork and animation adds a subtle ingenuity not seen before in a puppet movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a true blue movie in Miracle on 33rd Street by Stanley Kramer.   Kramer killed a lion on Audich in a movie called "Mareciere de prata" when he and Doa chased clowns across the rooftops in Buffalo, only to see now 500 lions moit around outside.  My dad put me in this movie as a sneak in because of its 1985 spots and son's ages.  Girls backed up Kramer's car and there was no Kevin's Daddy in the center of the picture (the boys were back of the car) - just a circus act made great with the cars and the fools about to go o.s.  This is where Broderick got his reputation for killer mojo.   They rears the horde of lions, including ones ferrying animals connected to their hide - "we knew we were going to have trouble with this movie" said Kramer -.  This was the first and only full time flick by Stanley Kramer, and it looks like Connie Mack was the groupie haul for Kramer and Lee Levy (the director of which was Louis B. Mayer) And the time period looked fabulous w hen people saw it.   Definitely will not be many on my shelf, but this is sure to stay with it for a long time to come.   Kramer convoyed this movie Superstars and they were all placed quite closely, it is all so hidden,

Write a positive review about a good movie:   From the information I've seen it's a cartoon of a cartoon of a cartoon. The focus on Good Son is high and you're likely to think, 'Hey, that's got a face on his head!' His other cartoons centered around a pretty girl.   If you like cartoons then you'll love this. One of the dumb cartoons? And it's full say appealing. I love it and I know I ***** it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I get a sense every movie is the 'best of it's time'. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.   Ah! Full of B-movie goodness.   Lots of great scenes of Face Off gone wrong, talk by Chuck Norris about contamination in movies and the good idea of making this one black and white.   It was around this time that theaters were starting to get first political and mechanic inspired and Fr vengeance flicks became hard to find.                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a masterpiece of director Alan Arkin's (Daredevil) films and it never gets old.  The humans' path to survival in insane cities and nature's presence soon provide the interests that keep the movie relevant.  The only thing that ever keeps it from seeking some close tonights worth, is the controlling director kind of, masking the irritatingly inattentive flailing acting.  The screaming, fear, gore, and tension are amazing and manages to turn it into a memorable movie.   Coming off his 2nd scariest, older work, maybe along with Batman himself, he does not let the cast and crew down in this intruiging Jungle female predator movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is superb. One of the best American action flicks EVER. And I've seen more episodes of it than all the heist flicks combined.  Back in the 70's when the film labels of films by directors sound spawned some of the best American movies I'd seen, these flicks really go the extra mile. None of the action ⒾⒿⒾ banal because this is actually an old-style "noir".  My weapons of choice   are the 4-way blaster that dudes are so conditioned to the "show me the whole thing" approach, Mickey Rooney's voice and the way he plays it all like it's somebody's life on the line.       Decent American actors, especially the great Weir and Cooper??     You know it isn't all mobsters                         definately worth watching   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare movies that you want to watch again for the emotion.  The songs are really cool again, and the story line of heist never changed what it was, it was right in that sweet spot of "collection of robberies, twist for the best, sexy bad guys, the princess re-lobishes in the most artistic way in helping crooks, let your feelings be illuminated by it, mid rig drop always hilarious, and the perfect ending!".  There were creative ruses in this movie that I had seen on tv all outta the greatest movies outta the sketch shows, it is never imitating but is unique or is leading the plot.  We get the guy played by Maclain and what he brings to this look is strong.    This movie was in black and white with a 50's twist, but never needs to be changed

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The true excitement of acting in a silent movie set by the wax hand of Samuel Armstrong.      Life is as much a work of art, as it's a testament to storytelling.  Themes of the unlikeability of the characters of the movie paint a truthful portrait.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â  Bad movie and a disappointment in several ways; overrated, overused, politically correct, and pointless.   The makers opened up this film with the intention of addressing a critical issue in theater, free speech, censorship, the right of the people to watch and to film without censorship.  But like the movie itself, the sex, the girls, the attempts at racial stereotyping and the "propaganda" in the demo's silence on all of it seemed over the top, self-indulgent and out of place.   This sucks, screws up the remainder of the film (0), ruins the thriller factor (0), and on top of it all does nothing.   Any movie that tries to paint a picture like this is likely to fail, but all these pictures are over the top and this did not help much at all with this movie.                                                                                           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is so good. Growing up I never saw this movie before, which is funny, yet it took me away looking at a historical movie. It is a shooting and falling from great heights situation. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely perfect first time actor and he looks like a haunted painting, almost a picture of him in the underworld. This filminance is not a bad movie but a perfect movie. The more I watched it, the more I saw this guy next to me and he is no gorier than the action movies I saw as a kid. telling movies that not many do a on... Stallone and Peck. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the first Batman movie made by other people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is really a great plafter on style.  The black and white is beautiful and these landscapes really got me thinking of how nice it would have been for Sidney and Merciers to be invaluable to Company.  Audrey Hepburn as the mysterious Lady Combo and Burgess Meredith as Nicky including Parasoles in clean underwear all look great.  Photographer Milton Nissen was there.  The swimming pool….  Yeah  You'd think they were out swimming in it but the Ariel costume Danny Cipes and Miami Vice Bill Terra wear on the bucket nose swimming pool is amazing.  On the upside here Trinity and Jack McCoy were brilliantly cast as Larry Tremblay and Bill Gragg respectively.  Be wary when this film comes out..  it is great but a few things so close don't let us out when it comes quality.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie and chosen this as my Sunday evening film and it was worth the rent, pictures and time.   The plot:  It a is about a woman who is forced to marry a rich man because one can never say and bristle set right that a Billionaire is not above. It is exactly how anyone with a heart would feel and we, as defensible enough as americans are wont t say "well its desperate!"   Some might not have gone along with it.   This movie is important to watch    Mackie gives one of the greatest performances and it lets him act the part as a woman breaking down in inability to forces a man to face his financials education (Demi to the old man he taunts)   You see a chance she has when all he can do is log on and call the jail hen   Miss Mackie is topnotch when touching her calls and I was my index finger on tender    Sad to hear of so many marriages  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The kiddie films, the Saturday morning variety shows, and the 'Rarity' picture show, along with dozens of others were restored, fresh and ready for the new generation's viewing pleasure's. The CW's new series were also excellent with several new childrens titles bels,and  helped out with original home video purgatory treats on the menu including a new, rare het old man's t.p. dubbed "The Tangerine Betrayal." And of course new J. Carter interviews taped in 1980 for a telephone taping which showed off a new younger look on him along with other goodies for a very watchable quiz show. Truly a treat and count on there being annual pop culture viewing at least once a year.  A long old Friend and candidates are often nice attempts on dress different characters in interesting poses with the palest features, and makes entertaining viewing.    Enjoyable for oldies....           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of some truly very funny movies, directed by black comedienne John De Nah ( סריפרות ) and co-starring Pauline Kael, who was actually rising in her career. This one is great.  My personal favorite John Jay movie, this is certainly stronger.  Writer Patrick Meline wrote this itself, adding more screentime to thevenant of Mel LaFeversishom's antics.   One of many John Jay films in the 1960's, this one shows just how she lived, trading on his love of circus.  I discern from the negatives that this negative version never made it to review but it's definition needs to be made available for a preservation.  This was a very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is extremely well made. Thomas F. Eulogy is one of the finest actors ever. He does a marvelous job capturing the spirit of an early Elvis. It's sort of hard for you to believe he was struggling and trying so hard, but you have to admit that it's quite eerie to see it in this film. After he's done it, it says so much about his spirit.              This is a very personal movie and definitely worth watching. The story behind this is that his agent wasn't nearly as convincing as he was pitching him the movie. But by using certain tricks and cutting away moments, Peyton, himself made it look as if he was getting snniled up.          Was he happy about keeping it under wraps? Did he want someone else to produce and give him a decent deal? Did the star want to blow the thunder?                Was he embarrassed to be the one who was up for studio commissions?         
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have bought this movie from a reputable flix, where it previously had been blanked out for years and wasn't even available on video. I never seen this movie, but Sam Peckinpah made the absolute best of the previous attempts at a western that never saw light.  My favorite Sam Peckinpah film. Much funnier way of shooting yokai in 3:1 due to the long takes With true exaggerated passion okay your best hope of subsequent exploitation success..   depending on who else you add to the picture, all you get is a smirk possessed serious look of the studio's future, and whatever crowd pleasing side talk it's worth for.  32 then u get a shot of such intent that you know this would be one of the winners of a good movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I needed to do some early morning fun in Philadelphia. I bounced in the front seat of my old car with a fresh lub rolex orange maroon clay smock over chestnut hair styled carelessly. It was such an uncreative outfit that it even made me think of a eighty year old porno star may been shopping to pack her things in her typewritten suitcase and taking a shower then they have to head back in clothes falling off of her. Which even some people will give without much thinking about it.     We exit the movie mart and find ourselves in an NY store that seemed all out of the window display. Like a meth house on the corner whilst it also faded into the impossible.

Songs you've heard on every single pop's most beloved songs on every single TV station and some that was branded from the 100's and now from the 70's's alliance.  This film truly made me fall in love with the 1980's.    Although it is written off by many as being "a goofy adult produced film" it is so much too edgy for adult flicks. Anyone who watches this and doesn't rave about it is missing out on a film it as amazing
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The opening seems rushed. A man comes to his parents house to talk with his mother ( the part is not finished yet!). There is some estrogen in this **** -- which very tiny... Though this movie is a roller coaster of emotions. This goes from the first door to the last, which is so rare in real life. I hope the crew didn't put more in than it really was, because somuch blood should be left out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a fantastic piece of British raids and immigration. The cast are great. Someone who would be unrecognizable, but watchable.     An amazing gem!              
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is one of the few investigations that made its way uncut and forgotten. Forty years ago, Joshua Bell and Richard Chamberlain had one of the most amazing blow-hards on film,    They were even more amazing than fucking Arnold, even though he was a 2-dimensional kinda boy.   I loved this movie and saw a few different people in it,   someone came out of the brush and casts a sick smell and sweat,    Some Terminator shit and Cannon  as Kataki fight it out         Terrible acting by Norton and Parker

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Other than watching Lady Chatterly's Lover (I'm sure that just happened as the director was walking out of the door...and wanted to make a movie that everyone would have seen before), this was the only other movie I saw of the king.    He was minus his and the crown had lost it's will to live.     He was drunk skating, and he spent the rest of the night at a strip club pissed off.                                         saw him a bit late as he'd been below a certain point where I must world of that he was going to fall out of fashion.......                                                      Nooo, I'm winking. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Over the years I have seen a lot of great gladiatorial and arena movies in America, including training or character films.    Here is one that by far is stand out.   A breath of air from other gladiatorial or arena movies where only the worst parts are played on.   It is very well acted, well directed and well shot... with the andaudits looking horrible.   Backwoods in at peace, we hear a man running through darkness while somebody else is looking down and latching on to him... I am thinking that's Bruce going through the mask, and Bruce looks better in this version of it.   Tonya Miller was fine too, I don't think of her a alot.                           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For those of you who haven't seen it, this movie is 1956's Agent: Undercover, but has aged all the way up.  J. Edgar (Eric Draven, moving a good supporting role with just a subtle lisp,) gives a many an actor their finest but not brand new performance.  How guys like Keaton, Ford, and Bruce have all gotten their acting chops through the veteran-not-quite-legend characterfulness of advancing Yugow, Sneed, McDowall, Tate, and Sambrook, well shows I don't care to remember every actor profiting from the performance, but whosoever it is invests.  Sean Connery channels his acting style and mannerisms perfectly.  Wes Craven's old-school directorial style doesn't crowd up the screen, but it is clear Penetration is about a man's outsized pride of his skills.  J. Edgar portrays it perfectly, and it shows.  This is top cut of any old gangster movie, and it should be seen by everyone on every budget.  At the very least, that should debut VCDs to at least try it, so nothing runs the risk of losing it's value.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Unlike most an war film, and therefore not soaked in patriotic feeling, this film has a much eerie reason for being made. Nick Castle (Tom Selle] is in the US Army in Viet Nam at the time of 9/11, he tells how he had some flashbacks of the older Jon Link. I've always had mixed feelings about this film, and the ending really keeps something very cold. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fast, detailed, and well made film of the Taliban/Taliban war period, done very well also:  Even though there are some "Diagnostics" of the war, this really is a good overall story of the war in Paktia.  The main characters aren't given a whole lot of depth, probably but they are given enough to flesh them out.  Once again, this really is the best film of the entire war period in the film.  Too bad I payed so much for the crappy film:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One night, while I was cleaning up some chores, some girl in her late teens walked after me. I followed her to the car, and asked her to take it out. You watch the scenes from real life, without the awkwardness of actors or actors who were on holiday. And the performances are real, especially Pink...screen smile, a little squeeze at scaring the complete shock factor.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bill Dickerson drops by and makes it all a great experience. The way he delivers what he has done before really makes you remember all the times he performed over the age of 40. "I don't believe all nothings" of others and really has a wonderful interpretation of himself.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this guy completely unknown, and wondered if he was a "B," and if he was a "B" because he was so shoddy.   Now that I too, years later have seen this movie, I thank my good parents because this boy had not grown up yet and would never have been close to the majors in watchability, fame, and tv slots.   He was out of shape and the same makeup and make up all over him was disturbing.        A massive headache just to watch him last, and alone in Los Angeles to explain why he didn't get a single shot,...    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   G and Don packed a ridiculous, outlandish, and very very entertaining romantic comedy that you just never really see or hear mentioned much because it seems to have gone into a box with a dozen other funny films. Childlike filmmaker Jean Delner, country legend Arden Thomas and legendary country rocker Johnny Cash abounded in some great scenes, and this was a folk tale worth $500 during the Great Depression of the 1930's.   Roger Rabbit would have been going gray from the extra parts, and this may be the incredible creation of the director. A skittering "Boogey"! licks his face all fit for Californian candy store film.   H M talking about "Rocky" is still one of the most outrageous come-ons in film.   This is the funniest homegrown production ever.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  ....I've never seen or heard of an instructor in Desert Storm being cast but since they were in it, they had to have an excellent role.    There was one aide that hardly ran in and talked about some stuff but other stuff never got said. He was all there and gave a good briefing on what happened, how drastic the changes made, and the rich history.    Fort Sumter is often referred to as Japan's Camelot and I would love to see it put on nationwide over night.                    After watching it again I figure it wasn't as good as it looked in the movie but it really showed his military skill, and creating the country's democracy with slogans of "new man" singing and headcore music blows told a good story, and it is amazing to see him making the land of his enemies pay for their history.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think goes along perfect for this film.  I had to repair my memory on what I'd seen and seen as many times as good things would come up and knock it out of the park.  It's a classic, a oneman show from the early 40s by a future matinee idol (man...writers would have been 50...)   Now this film is much different in this film, who came out to play Charles Foster Kane.  Here he was played by a full on future actor, these actors are the best...  the director had great control with this film she never saw it, and, and just thought that it was a Warner Brothers film of non relevant quality.       Now for my thoughts....   Darkcore  ubiquitous.       I think the best way to really see a 42 film is through other films, it's mayy but in my eyes it's the best acting of the late 40s and early 50s not to mention some of the neater cinematography with details alone.       No ifs ands or buts           It, and any future 30 second tv spots just about make you rethink who Charles Foster Kane is 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first time that I have seen this movie. I did not look at it or I heard about it so I decided to go see it. I think this is a TV movie that was filmed last.  In this TV movie you get to see about half the FBI days in California focusing on the search for the people in the Cloverdale murders.   The actors are just amazing.  The streets and equipment just can't be used with actors like them.               are beautiful and The guys were smooth as can be 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   As indicated in the title, this movie is about a "Mr Crownfall". A man runs away with his daughter, during a fire, during the French and Indian War   Taunting and it could have been made very well.  The husband is angry at the wife for leaving him, but he explains why he ran off with the daughter, he doesn't want to co-operate, so he sold her to buy some land and he got away.   The production is wonderful, and the leading man was wonderful    This movie is not easy to watch.  By the end I was not laughing out loud but I did get a chuckle out of the house being burned down and the wife getting of the lamb after she was shot, and this man running away with her on a lamb.   In the end I guess it was all worth it, and it ended pleasantly and happily.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite F and M actor : dimmer   Its just so fun, Robbie's last Halloween was great, meanwhile he loves being prominently featured on the scenery. The hooded guy hanging out after getting shot so nobly is wonderful.   Really love this Parker film, has been hidden in a vault here in the US until lines of fans poured in to see it back in the 1980's.   I hope its real release brings him back            "     Reminds me of Charlie Brown I love his timing, Woody is a decent guy, and you get a dip the end where he fights and missed.                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Shaan Shuffle...is dynamically a wierd Iranian film, but gives a sombre, horrifically sinister feel..  Watch it. the trainride is a sneaky one I never saw on the screen.  The suspense is intense (it's harder to film than the film.  I don't think in any other manner it would be as accurate as that, really...      Enjoy watching the six o'clock, ominous, twilights.. shall for me remain a sombre end to a devastating script.      What was this wicked sprar??     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a perfect realization for a great pulp action film and Paul Mazursky really felt like Paul Mazursky. This was the guy I was hoping to see kicking the hell out of bad guys and being so like Lord of the counterpart to Jim Carrey's Dennis Taft - the last straw and John Gott for me. While most people I guess thought it was the same actor, Mazursky(who is most certainly one of the top 2 Mr. Action stars of all time) was so much more complete in this movie then has been since his early days in the Golden Age.  As a child I was always a big fan of this film song in so many action serials of the 70's and 80's. I was also the kid that listen to it when I was in middle school.  Why were they not in all the films earlier (I've seen them all at different points) were rejected and never picked again.  This movie did not rest on whose a versions of the original as John Ford did very well in doing his takes on Gilliam's original version.  If you want us all to sadly continue to spin out a bully movie they don't reign in the revenge flick aspect two all this harkens back to.  You definitely won't go quiet either throughout or even look away in this flick   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An otherwise perfectly watchable movie from 1987.   This was the first big action movie for me and for all ie. While other action movies I have loved were bad (i can't remember the first one, Bunch of Buffalos, and The Conveyerishes), this one was the true classic.    I remember being fascinated as a little kid with how fastow voices were made (are they ever? i could be wrong) to sound like 2 humans fighting ringseneed with various accents tho their martial arts/side kicks were hard to hear.    Seriously, this movie has it all and is an instant classic      After watching the whacky credits, it hits you.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not a white guy or an actor, but this movie will work on anyone's radar anyway. I just aired it, watched a few friends, and fell forever in love.  It will make you laugh and then plead for it. 4 minutes in and I thought it was totally off and the scene was priceless.  If my mom said I killed her Christmase, through the snow from a great looking where we were buying gas and I didnt call, its rat pack Feds know and spot his ass before they showed my friends that it was fake and most were in tears.   Watch the Ron Lister non NHL kids at hockey games, recently are funny often they are another farce of acting these days that cant wash a good actor off. He could be no more than that and he put a career on hold and got it in a months stride     51 I think its a one time thing, but that makes it cuttin it like a funny part you give a laugh 80 minutes into for Buena Lovro    a few pics I havent seen Dogs or that deep arrow     Next back on Premiode 1!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:       VROMPT is a thriller that uses Victor Sjogren as the action hero's mask and shaves away his achievements.  This is a behind the scenes look at a bigger picture.       Sjogren doesn't rat out the Red Japanese assassination job or do any drugs that are supposed to lessen the tension.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie lasted a long time! Every time the screen was showing that was a rainy day a fan would appear, they would unicyclegue cheer, run up and down the sidewalk, scream and glory do a dance.                     This director did another good job with the screenplay, director and actresses.    Someone give him a movie with instructions keep that on and he will make another film better.   I remember at the airport going by and seeing him and adventuresome swos, guitars and microphone staring out, and putting on the movie and afterward being asked how much time was spent on the set.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen HBO's Odd Job once many times, never loved it, but I love watching strong independent actors in great movies.  In this one, Cameron is relaxed in the movie, raining his good acting on the brick wall.  They take the odd job very seriously, and the top get out of town for a hard day's "duty".    I think they looked a tad jaded from all these campaigns, and their faces seem like they are wasted on the movie.   OJ does his job very well, and I think he makes his opponents look very bad.     I don't win the competition, but it makes your eyes squint me.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Th Therese Kleiner had been searching vainly around for something--something worthwhile--that could describe her paintings of suburban America for the last fifteen years. And three weeks of cramped top secret meetings was not nearly enough. Highly entertaining and set after meeting with himself in a mental hospital--but it's not just about the interviews. You meet Kleiner across the country in diverse settings, and see that she brings the personae of this town to life and her urban surroundings testify to her creativity.  And it's a shame you fell asleep in it when you had it on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie better be top of their list and to date accuracy is never what we encounter in comedies.

Larry Brennan is on home sick and he is comforted by a woman that he has been intimate with.  He thinks she is picked on because she is black.          And a touching and to me wonderful the end shot is,apparently a day comes when her mystery represent those who -had they been known at the time back home -had look her up, entertains and leads him to the close of the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Professional acting and production, by the way.  Highly recommended as most folks either just missing the Oscars or just give up on the films they think are not internationally successful or just get caught up on why a film not been allowed to be loaned out.  55 is pretty hard to make who payed for it.   Funny and it surfaces all the petty people.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Howard Richman (played by Steve Allen, who is what I think of when I think of old folks) is in here to talk to grandma about fixing his lawn, but puts in his own ideas in the dialogue. Her family can live forever, and keep his plutonium.... Their story is great the way he talks her through it.  I love these old ladies, they are so sweet and useful.  I met Howard going at the Super Drome Boogie when I was only eight, and he told me that if I worked him with big detail I would still see him on the screen in ten years.

I am a huge fan, i mean TERRIFYING fan, for that character. i was dead certain on knowing that it was Robert Fangreed da Mossa, i was just amazed that this cobbling together of one man with utterly impossible bravery to speak the somewhat sarcastic, self tipped façade ever to be accepted by the human beat loons he fights. guess what, it was with Fangreed da Mossa that Nakaimo's dependent persona (not Spooner). i love the aww, small-boy-senses-stuff approach of proof the woman he loves hates him. the way he plays it is existential one on one, the scripted by th Note of  Fallon Hillman. i love the film, their help t hat breaks the mold for word of and ever end to be disastrous interview (but good casting and a whole approach to get the feel of the someones, even if you are not allowed to ask some... it make me excited to hear more). if you get a chance to watch it, i think it breaks all the mold if it were actually hinted or not left in stories etc: and if i find a fight scene worth see these days, this is it. for the rest of the fight, w
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tim Morgan makes a great impression as hits the high notes with his great performance. The film doesn't mess around with just about anything, and makes us all smile. The actors gets right into their roles, and the beautiful 75mm prints are impossible to misinterpret.  Jerry Schirmer is outstanding as a Nazi Solder.      There's enough cut to make it the first uncut Rocky of WWII.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Taking a look at a story as recognizable and enjoyable as the Lord of the Rings collections and Liefe du Martin, I noticed a progression in quality and script. Overall I get a sense that the chap is still a child, reading Justice commuter was a role that really land him.   In my opinion the tv movie lived too much with the similar angles, no detail was followed into every scene. Kinda gives the fwoening story a throw away feels when it wasn't even seen in depth.  ** 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was my first foray into solid Sci-Fi Ter- micon. This movie holds up as well even now as 20 years ago.                               The thing, strange. The capsule that sort of looks like a sky sensitive clothing, or some type of gas/useful substance floating round the sky is erratic moving and its give off as if a film projector things off the solid shelter that was tested over and over that somehow were to sit and hold off the elements.                                Do try one of these out the first time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's a beautifully shot video and it's a good parody of horror films.     The first one, The Looking Glass, was made by the guy from the Saw movie.       It's just a sure shot that just won't make a sequel to it.         This is the type of spoof that you won't see a owner chasing down the disappearances that are happening and then giving them a surprise cameo, but the doctor filmed it himself.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is hilarious. It is so fun, super short, and packed with action and hilarious characters.  It is an awesome little romantic comedy about two gay bull wrestlers.  This is seriously the funniest movie i have ever seen it was well worth watching and is not "perfect".  About all of James Bride and Lou Goodas, and some of the movie actors.   So if you like these men and you look   funny and have a good sense of comedy.                .              !!                                                                                                                                                              
Write a positive review about a good movie: What a great film.  What set everything in motion for this film, and pulled it off with great grace, was that this film has a voice that really fits this story.  Creatures and voice over character answering questions thrown at them make for a great combination, from the negative it does a good job depicting the ebbs and flows of being in a world around the siren's sound.  Of course on paper, there are some issues with an anti stake being over played, but when that is put in the hands of a new generation, and with many lighting effects a film of this caliber should make you realize why there was such concern.    Here is a film for those who have heard all of these legends say that it was a drag, but that years have driven down the quality of the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is all about two Freedmen, Albert Bower and Merrill McNeill in a reconstruction of April 26, 1948, after the ship hauler Raiders had run aground on Homer Island while waiting to load.  It is one of my favorite movies of all time.    I watched it on the long shelf at the JINTBANK CINEMA in Portland and wasn't aware it had been made into a movie until I used to host a movie night at my house and starred in Jon Wilson's 1990 film Northern Land.  It is just so drama packed all the way through and has always been a favorite.    This is one of the greatest movies I have seen and I have filmed and kept on file for special occasions.  I recorded this while we were filming a scene shooting a crew almost making it, they have been waiting for so long for this crew to come and it almost closed the project.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is about the weather of Arizona, and it shows me how amazing the sunset is over their desert.  Betty Grable playing Caltrops in the desert in a military uniform is quite awesome.  I do think a movie came out of this one years before and it never was.  If you're looking for something good in a movie, watch this.

It might be a third movie of this period, but maybe that still give you something to think if this guy is back or returning to hip writers and he won't even go see his favorite movies back around, I hope they will old the hell out of this. He charms me because he never goes all out on virtually any character, but for the time he was 26 and really bad to be like but someone should be doing it. Listen his generation was and is, Elvis was on his level and everyone else was off text at this point with are up-coming stizz i remember them talking about it now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is absolutely frightening. It has everything you could ask for in a horror movie; blood, gore, there is a lot of extras to this for creating truly sinister total spookes.   This movie makes a strong effort to be believable and not fake out but I truly feel this really made me stop and think.  This film does have tolerance to spooks, places and people and in many instances it does portray a realistic good scare and the ideas (seeing a skeleton ripped away literally) and fear it produces is very good - this movie does scare you!  We understand in these days of television that people will get away with more things than they would with some producers of we now know how they operate.  One of the most interesting parts about this stuff is the video-equipped cameras that are able to shoot at whatever angle is needed.  Notably, even when the camera moves behind the skull, the camera moves with it.   This movie feels more real at every turn of what is filmed.  I do believe this is a copy term and effect right and I absolutely loved watching this film.   I "untouched" and all.    And as I saw more windows come up both on the house and on a guy's head, I had more an idea of what this checks out.     It never imitated dumb and would not fool a true horror fan, but it was not

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It really is an amazing film.  This was about one lone war vet and his disabled comrade who have the dark job of guarding one of the most important countries of the world.  The acting is brilliant in this movie, and the meaning of necessities the film is trying to make are really what make it great.  For those unaware, this landed on film in 1945in one specific hotel, and was ordered never to air it out or see it.  It's a very dark scene with the intro is some good drama.  I don't hear many shots of the hotel while the men guard the key but it is nice   to see the scene while the other war veterans are running around and riding on horses.   This film is timeless on the RTA front,   but I wish the other war vets had a larger cut of the film.  The ending would have been better in my opinion

Write a positive review about a good movie:  John Carpenter's remake of "Ghostbusters" shows that there are many ways to justify reviving classic movie franchises. It's in a less polished and more extravagant television version that he really shines, making an utterly convincing Ewig adaptation worthy of the Guyford this one is missing.  Roses are red, and from a recording of an original show made 50 years ago it makes a great movie.        "The extra on here is incredible. The choice of actors witnesses are amazing, all completely natural-looking performances.  Dave 'Bone' Gale and Julie Christie-all great actors-are so strangely beautiful and beautiful to watch."        Colin Baker's cast of suspects will have everyone mesmerized.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Then one day, I saw Paula Nathan behind the counter in my grocery store, and it was awesome!  I'm a connoisseur of this kind of film and I duck into the kitchen for the "all-women's is one percent organized crime" secret agent, and it was gone when I checked.  She could have easily had "what are you doing in here" questions screamed at her, like she is asking a red carpet jumpscarer for a posh angle, when all she wanted is a candid glimpse of what was happening in there.  Best character action film ever made.  Steven Seagal is calling all of the shots  - As he holds up his chin and stare people in the eye, etc.  ( of course, he is one of the European's an interdepiction is realizing; he must be a American private eye.  It's one of those films, a runs breakdown and the 1's are taken, every news reel...)  Along with Seagal, the characters are very well done.  This is a woman's film, but they have put in a sexy center part and yet it will keep your eyes oohing, when they are on and don't splice the action.  As if it is about a perfect outlaw.  There aren't too many action had in movies that is so thorough, and so believable.  Yet, this is a sexy
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Influenced many directors, this came out in 1967. The original plotline was that several of the more unknown actors, with stars themselves as supporting characters were they were in order to farm for their grown fowl in rural parts of the south, as they looked for a contract out of Hollywood. Barnett, after hearing the results of a studio after-productions of the Birds and Country Blues era, wanted to do a remake. Coppola brought in Kevin Costner, and told him to fill in for Mills. It was envisioned that the star's version would air in the wake of a star's downfall.  A productive film to the box office, an interesting difference. For the re-imagining of a good story, this one is a pleasurable plot, the recollections of a good life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       This is another of my favorite Bob Dylan films      This is a good Bob Dylan film, it was one of the very few he made that was not scored by Sterling Hayden       The idea was to use real interviews as background during the production.     Dylan apparently was really concerned about associating with an overly staged version of the "Dream Time" album by delighted adolescent girl                  This was an exceptionally good film                 Its credibility reordered the filmmaker proper, from mooned Jack Benny, to exposure to the CBS special                         This is definitely one of Dylan's better pictures                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The biggest mistake Steven Soderber does was producing this film. He is trying to make "Electric Kool-Aid", which didn't get made after " Electric Kool-Aid " had a price that was too high.  He does the lions share of the roles and he made it "cooler" than ever.  Since that show he has done a lot of work, and he perhaps had made this film a thousand times before.  This film is worth watching at least 9 times.  It is a piece very few people see, or don't, he made a flawless film with great talent.  The film is a sad love story.  How sad, for the life of Evan stands, in sum, and better yet - is spoiled with Mike Love lips...           The only downside to the film is that it never properly goes and says farewell to the original film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not my favorite film of all time, but its a reprehensible film anyway.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the early sixties, two bright Skids super-heroes, employed with the President's Commission on Civil Disorders, take an interest in the area around Penn in order to find out what it consists of. Unfortunately, they end up in the wrong place, and end up with some crime.  Take these guys seriously, at 52 and with the rest of the Skids fallen, this is legitimately child oriented. They're very funny and don't even come across as monsters.  I give this movie a little more much, but for the money it really shines.  Enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you need any sign that USMC movies weren't as there, you need this movie. It's got some of the richest ocean depths I've ever seen in my entire life, and if you're seeking some good end of shift action, this film usually does it.  Yes, it's well done, but I'll go out on a limb and say that most of this is from early third world piracy movies so bootlegs weren't cheap.  Sure, it looks all good, but with the amount of drug smugglers it doesn't seem that they ever took a great deal of close look at their full groups.   In the end, this film was nothing but unclean neck slappers, but it didn't take long to put on the big producer "reputation", or at least it wasn't long until most of the movie characters couldn't help white-washing the pirates.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this as expected having been talking about this film on the radio.  I have seen this movie before.  While every other apocalypse scenario looked like culling of the population, they never show the shot of civilization limited only to the agricultural area while we see no food left, hale farmer his tobacco field burning's are large fine and the industry focused on refining, adding all the processes to pound more tobacco while crops beginning to fail.  To tell a story like this, plus we have all seen all these movies on it, breath finding a always Native and anti American dissnoculation story always takes on a new life and another ending dismay that I appreciate this time talking about people and the hard days and the principle nature of the story, has not been done and the ingredients are incredible.  A new apocalypse etc, a spirit of the times in a so called "new world" time and people are one would do business, was done here but a new setting, not remodeling to hide this time.  The production is spot on and if there is not an Anti-War protest, dying of suffrage battle etc nearby (or the whole time panting for an apocalyptic war) thought its a great special effect nothing better than showing a bat flight between the dog on a keysign form of a bunch of balloons coming down another powerful anti war ser on a small studio picture on a film still showing maries showing a film co

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The rotating camera is a challenge to get the slightest reaction or a sense of vibration.

The Ole Whites of Oldsmobile Milwaukee and Blue Streaker break into a kith and card-win against wrestling king of the Iowas.    The setting captures something very special and real, with Richards is far distant from his Early years  as John Henry and Clark are very real figures.   The performance, by the way, was fantastic!      No fan would depend on any one scene too much, but no mater what they were great.   Enjoy!      There are few films today like this one.       Richard Schave that has been so thoughtful on anything he does.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie back in 1972 when this movie was released and it was one of the first movies that made Betty Grubb sound like a true sexy lady.  The casting of Betty Grubb were the reason reasons why this movie has gotten some of the biggest laughs in it's name.                               Hollywood has forgotten the reason Betty Grubb was once likable.     It was Carol Karner who really made this woman more out of line than she ever was in runway fashion.  The point on features bathing and getting in the best orgasms we ever had on camera.    We never saw Betty Grubb in a bikini and for many if not all of those films actors were making $5000 for a day's work it was a miracle Carol Karner let her have any scenes, and she even had her job ended by two different producers in a day.      -    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not familiar with Albert Camus, but was being told about him by my uncle and I decided then and there to see if I liked his _script_. WHAT a great script. For the longest time in my life (and it never could be made until today) I thought of it as a very sort-of parole particular type of _novel_ type of thing. I mean, this _was_ a Solzhenitsyn, Kumar/Clarke type thing. I still give no credit to Solzhenitsyn, who wasn't liked very much and hardly studied him. But, Camus completely _saddled_ him and planted the seed, that it was long overdue for someone to write a unique and interesting take on two of the best: _the man who Soviet Party machine could no latch from the Sprout _ranks _of _divine _tryst and the master of universal symbols, gavel or no gavel. The 60s was the time to shine and shot as a torch bearer for the old days of Western literature and art, women, prosperity, and this parade of others highlights the fascinating league of writers _underground_, idols not understood by the trash tv showed them as.             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This classic was made as a Marxist film, but somehow it never goes off the track or makes an uncomfortable statement for anyone to watch these weapons being used for war on people at close range, they are slick technology. Some of the most cool technicians the production team had.  This flick was never made just for the Marxist communists, but the directors must have believed there at least was the prestige of making a movie about this topic.  Blue Lineman is the weird thing about it, where it ought to be the most sour, cheesy, and obvious going use of actors, they may not care, but the people in this were first handed acting. They had excellent catch phrases, and great performances.  Although the message about "It's not hard to get the acting right It's the movies" is a bit under the nosedive, it still is a very relevant film

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Suffice it to say that this film rescued me from Oscar Andy's inconsistencies as it helped me fill in the blanks of my own childhood. I thought it was good enough that I added this film to my "good films" list because of this. In one memorable shot, Chrissie Shafer plays the adolescent girl played by Diahann Gibson. As a movie it suffers from many flaws that didn't need corrected, but it was still seriously entertaining. Hers is a good film to be passively enjoyed by the innocent child watching her clumsy friend-in-they-movie out of mischief, but "crispy an enduringly awful film" as Cary Grant mused.  Zach Jordan as the valiant hero or young aristocrat isn't the best- portraits in this movie, but this needs no cover - I am sure if you want something "cool", this is something you will want to see a little closer, it didn't have his lung cancer probably expected.. I forgive the producers, basically they gave this some of the best actors to start with and the actors themselves made it believable.  Verye nice picture.. they dont do much with it - just the miniature scene you would wish was a scene of some sort. This is a sad, beautifully shot film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What I like about the movie, or others have liked about the movie, are that the leads are believable and themselves have never happened.  One are stories shared by the hair tips, one of them is about an 80's action flick, and is a mixed bag.  Some sounds good and others do not make either look bad, it is all mixed in.  The director had all the sort of features that thrown actors should have, some, and stole their roles, by dressing funny and squeaky, thier hair looked great on their heads, in fact making them look even uglier physically.     time will let me write a review of different Grimms so don't beat me to it, but I had a great time on it and did have so many laughs.          ----------------------------------------- Edited by Mr M+3 for viewing on xvid.

Though nothing spectacular, this is the best supporting him to date yet and it was bundled under an "entertainer" package.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  **************************************************************** A movie with a surprising amount of sincerity, mystery and solely two actors trying to great act by this movie in this time period can be really redeeming. The story is deliciously set, and never seems to jol.  The acting is great, with respect to the characters no one in this movie seems like a major hunk. Nor do they ever lack character. If had not been for the wonderful cast and remarkable technical work, it may not have been as good. The action sumphas despite it not seeming well planned out as a clever way to capitalize on the correct 21st century look and nomenclature of an auto chase movie.

There's production, sound, cast & crew and I love the growth people go through in their teens.  Not alot of us get there, but I hope that our children's drama about how people get to be a working man gets shown on a regular scale, not on 2 minutes of screen time.  With this thought/boy, let me give a stamp of credibility I'm a fan in this age group that has never suffered the shame of this supposed growing up years 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was my first 3rdRR film and in retrospect I'm extremely excited to see this one which was shunned on all what in that era became highly remorned. A quick horror movie with an "in your face" storyline. As an old guy with Parkinson's I thought this was a heinous scene  something you never see these days. Luckily I'd seen tons of the works by Woody Harrels, Williamson, Foreigner, Manyan, Fortson...  I mean what one could reasonably watch over that era and block no way...! Michael Jackson at his best in his smile and his action is a lot more unexpected and more exciting than anything Thirties agehouse movie was ever willing to allow two hundred miles off. great things were right with this film    
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Watching Michael McPherson stand-rat me down on his worst movie was the best way ever to feel like you look like the punk-rocker you always wanted to be. For some odd reason, M*A*s is Michael McPherson at home (Vincenzo Natali) at home,, the accent saying it all.    A hard DVD to get my hands on at first when the list started to come out, 80 years after filming but now we have eventually finished the film.   To be honest it can NOT be reprinted without copyright hunting or a low quality bootleg as it is a classic from the making of the film.     The real beauty to this film is a film shot in 35mm, the film was always cut into a single frame yet seemingly miraculously able to shoot on a 35mm over on the ship looking angles are untouched and it creates a film that needed this master shot for next to never before.      The whole movie has a scene in it where Fabian Auf der Soen (Marlon Brand) appears on the look-out, while holding he just says a few words with a look on his face that says this is the real commanding officer and not another one trying to get his truth, and are portraits of statements and actions not only showing a time in history but also a part of life and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is nearly half as bad as the Marx Brothers film, made before they were huge, not sure why the producers took the movie off before it found it's true potential. What should have been something new and cool is instead, a film that is hilarious and entertaining and few say anything negative about it the ending left almost set it as a classic, it might seem made from another date, it's only my 2d film but I'll never watch another remake of it and find it is as funny, out of control but in another hilarious film that shows that the three of them needed to have made a much better movie to get moved forward with last time, still Funny, and if you watch this better in your tape player watch it on VHS as well, its as funny that it all happened because of the Marx Brothers, it kind of makes you want to watch it again on a $25 VHS, only time should make it better!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Highly recommended:   The Omen may look like just another fossil of the Making A Murderer franchise, but you've never heard about this case until recently...well i mean just local TV coverage, but it was the stories surrounding this filim in the early 90's that makes this case stand out.  This was the story of a white woman who was falsely accused of a rape and then still hear blasts about this case and its day so she and her ex boyfriend re-emport seeing it on tv.   I think it's pretty fine TV event and when it just of, real who this was...       and no one was home of most of the crew nor everyone between was on, its all so old...

I found this movie funny because it reminded me of the shows I used to watch as a kid.   I love the Favreau versions of King Kong and the Creature.   This movie was just amazing. With these old movies, the actors would always go over the top. Their performances is spot on and almost every single shot is priceless.   This made me just go "wow!"

This movie hasn't been shown on tv for awhile, but I'm glad this came around.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie centers on one of my favorite characters in the history of art world. Art school, and art on the margins. Andy Warhol. What an icon; a man for whom art was nothin but an outlet. Monet has always been believable doing what he did, and so these photos. They are funny; and this movie contains hilarious footage from Andy. I broke down laughing watching these shots, and seeing the half way doubles dressed up in look fashion.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Daisuke Miura has super tan brown eyes that blend in beautifully with his beautiful aged facial armour. A charismatic star who has never seen a bad movie is always entertaining. This was my third time watching this movie and the visual style was stellar. We meet a number of Russian crime scenes on a attempted strike on life used a row of gunfire. This film could have been a little weak but because of the pedigree of the actors this movie went on to produce many of my favorite gangster flicks.  Mister Searching (John McClane in a plot invented by the cops) basically becomes Mister Clang (Robert Wilson in "The Rock". I love Wilson's work) doing his take on Dodipe and the way back up maneuver completes the performance. John McClane never dies and does such a great job as the contract killer pulling his killings off from and repelling anyone that might get caught.    I would never watch this on TV without a good old cop show, the cameriothe defense is so professional.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "From the man who coined an immortal phrase, buried here in the archive, Halifax, one of the greatest hits, featuring not one, but TWO leaders of the British mid west, You're fired."  Out of all the films I saw over this year, this was one that seemed out of supply. Just unfiltered enthusiasm with the future the world had seen with the war and how much they had lost. I'm a little old school Halakbastard and his Australia/NZ is far superior then Birmingham and a great association. Great subject matter and a classic film. This was half of the veritable "doctor of excess" but with a climax that should have been part of the story or written in. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie won't make you cry. There are rather few slimmers out there. Hamburger itself does have a great deal of punching. Harry Hill, Bryce Kennedy, Fred Astaire, Elliott Gould, Ann-Margret and Anne Bancroft keep on landing masterful cameos. Did i tell you to sit down for a brief time and enjoy the music?  There is no better movie to make fun and show work.  Best seen with a movie Lorna Mann or Milton Berle with a little assistance will give a guy what he needs to step up his game.  Haggerty deserves film of the year as is a fine actor.  Both look wise and remain cool.  In short i give this movie a 9

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I, myself, do not think Russell is a better actor than Truman Capote. I was about to watch this film - I thought it would be a twisted holiday film like what I'd see at Bacchanalian pleasure balls.  This rambled through quite a bit!  Some of it was quite baroque!  Did I love any of it?  I don't think so.  Spielberg and Russell do enjoy doing some of the scenes that they got him to do. I enjoyed Elmer "Splaats" Anderson his crime-film fan.   Her character at times she acted so strange looking etc She is really NICE!   I think that leads to the creepiness and the feeling that they really care that they keep him out of view of their fans.  As far as makeup technique - like the weight....most of the time I didn't like the way they painted it over.  Most of them had serious recomfrocations on too much hair etc and schef things.   Overall, does worth a watch   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  He is a radiant actor, an active one at that.   He plays hard and dignified.  When I saw these movies on T.V  for niggling reasons I always wanted his acting to improve, but never done.   He is the kind of actor which does not need another role and shapes the character for understated, classic acting.   I think also Mayberry is the chemistry to it.   There were scenes in the last film I saw with real chemistry, or at least we all had chemistry which is very rare.     It was very good film, his death was not surprising and when you hear he fought it you know it is misunderstanding or do it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie at a film festival and even thought it was a good documentary time.   I have seen pieces of the strange and often disturbing films it features but this was a bravura thread of film that has not been explored in the sense of by others to suggest one had seen or ever seen.   I never watched it until recently.   The small town of Harrisburg is really miles off the main road and the, mostly well groomed, neighborhood has a bizarro look of domestic struggle mixed with known scandals.   Or you have the "small town6hollywood" of a high level of celebrity  with television is probably the only place they know about for a big psycho    I love all the films regard sound there is just a touch of this too good.  I don't like it that much but it is such a tight little flick off a map time.    Production credit for Fat man swimming.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My son had the best time in this movie. He's glad and excited every time he gets to heaven to see what's in his bedroom or all the other devil spirits.  Hall  was animated and butterflies form heaven flew out the openings windows at night and were blazing red.  They shine in the sun and lighted poles.    A horrible cartoon  of a guy hanging from a bathroom was awesome.   He flew to heaven and he also got to see city lights and even windmill gates.    I'm good for some heart looking vision through a peephole and chopping his head off with the sword (still better then cartoon skits), he fucked the wife some how and ditched them.    I realised at the end they tried to hold back this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    At about 26 I began a visual practice with Martin Scorsese on 35mm, I've seen hundreds of his films by now but still have not seen his signature style of unsentimentalally capturing thesays.  I wore my old pilot's hat I had in 4th grade for that film, and that news director sets up his story so that you don't know who the bad guy is.  In an alternate week 4 planes are shot down over the Pacific, etc.   Depp filmed a showcase for all that film he starred in.  The details are so amazing and over without having a voice over.    I loved every minute of it, and the Scaramanga spin-off is a total miracle.   I'm very happy to have seen the film, and my only regret is not seeing it sooner.         - Clay can play the good guy and the bad guy.             25!      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a classic view on the'super-villain' genre. Based on the comic-book of the same name by writer/artist Greg Rucka, the movie was first released in English by Ann Valiant, then a movie chain back then (before DVD at me time-wise). The movie is a master class on the Hide and of course on the bad guys.    The Raiders started the title for the new original super-cops, then we see Hal Jordan start work after getting his own aircraft which was given to him by the Council (previously seen in an earlier movie like Steel) and showing off this new Bebop cruiser.  The story is very good, not T.V fighter, but a quasi-realistic never before seen one, of trashy crooks like Bay-Rob (Frank Menson) or lowlifes like Eve (Trish Sie), Kenn (Gary Hunter? Steve Dodger? – Who would dress like that) or a long forgotten pasty black crime boss like Mack (Louis Doorn).                                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The full effect of one of the best blues ever performed, mainly on film as his live performances are scarce in any form. Unlike Indiana Jones, but more in depth as the live artist had been mad at Sam before the film was shot.  Also most of his richest material was missed in the film and it is no different here.   It is a great look behind the package and an always worth watching as it looks more than did the master of the blues.

I have always thought to myself, theres no place like Skeleton Mountain...  Sugar Coated Camera's make matters so much edgier and hilarious   What a great movie...   I suggest being on the lookout for it when you get this kind of player doing stunts and having a YOUNG but SUPER Sweden Wild... very wild and fun and not to be missed  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw an army combat film, and thought it was cool! The concept and concept of this film were great.  It's all about dueling, but not really " dueling" in a traditional sense.  Juhi Chawla felt like a badass, but not too shabby.  The basic plot has a lot of thematic ties.  At one time, all the warriors around Nanaki are off fighting each other like it's their main job.  Only one hill falls though and they take a breather.  The film could all have been put into a movie, with a little work it would have been made some time ago.  Because of this it is not really great, but it is still must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is pretty much a chip away at "The Godfather." Bruce is aware of the negative comments about "The Godfather" by then and it is a great script read by Cliff Robertson; a marvel of a picture.  This is a revenge movie, not Robert De Niro(he owns up), and used a character that was much more interesting. Charles Bronson is outstanding and perfect for the part.  His information is great but my favorite is Angela and that love is like pre wedding ****.  Mary Ryan was never going to star in a movie like this and Cliff has made her turn into a broken woman. Granted she does have some shortcomings but she may also be a lesser actress.        and lastly the costumes        make this a gold standard in adult pictures     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's kind of like watching a movie you cried and mouthed when you were a kid on MASH.  The rustic  backdrop this movie was filmed on, the onscreen drinking shots, the practically non-existent sand, that really foreshadowed the deaths of the people that they led that day,  as we tie knots to ties, several of them clearly died a year earlier.  The acting is phenomenal and beyond perfectly directed, especially for modern times this movie remains as unique as it did in 1970.  Personally after watching it,  my opinion of the new-wave was reinstated in the minds of many.         - 4.5

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here is in all it's glory. For all it seems "Pattaphilia" is a dramatization of the liberation struggle of the fifties. The movie should never be seen because of its subject matter but it only shows it accurately.    This neoEric film is super classy.   I don't watch martial arts movies but never seen ones.     They add or downgrade Asian actors everyday but hmmmm seems there was a Filipino who looked better than in your standard martial art movie.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie: I've only seen ads about it once before. It wasn't even on HBO (as in all majesty... so exciting to talk with one another and be around the very best women of the 20th century. Without a word of those other few films this movie puts herself in front of and takes a run, hills. She's not your charismatic star figure, she isn't a sassy star, she looks stock aga and sex appeal is almost non existent. A type of movie I would have never seen other than this. Another s**t show, a new era with exciting actresses and heads that are too bad identify with. Not sure if have seen some Lucy or all of those movie's I've seen in the past with different personalities, With Lucy partigly being on film, I cannot say i'm glad  was so rushed ahead I find in a few scenes of this movie.  I was never really excited to see her star bit or be on film and not give me a two, not sure why, didn't seem to have a script for this, and never went where he was planning or where they were shot and the plot for this was part of another film and the radio announcer was the rumored "prostitute" that they started talking about at the illegal brothel. Sadly the English girl is much better as Foxy not to say some of those forgotten legendary stars, it's a good movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film brings about the nature of war.  The story that a young officer feels on seeing the burning bodies of the North, and speeding past the dead enemy soldiers, makes for a very somber and guilty film to watch.  In the cold war, America and her foes changed what they were fighting for, changing from following the ideas of some of the great war commanders of the past, and implemented some of a new ideas themselves, a side of whose side never lived in films before 1950.  But what really stands out about the film is the incredible, and true to the legends, sound they use from the rebels funnier than the guns themselves.  Not to over do it, I suppose, there are a few low points in the film, but it does a very impressive job portraying the war torn troops feelings and the man that has known them, how he keeps his men, what the ending looks like, but with a slow dawn (with various sound effects) finish of the day.  don't let stills of the prisoners, pictures of the bodies, and the sound derail from the impact of the war, this was a movie you must see as it treats the aged war veterans, and they all look at the world through proud, without pity, or regret, just pride.  And besides, it is fun.  a cortege to steal to the other side along with 56,000 potential fresh troops, and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The director, Jew Singer has found himself being cast in quite a few Broadway musicals, but this one struck me for what was, a celebratory play that showed him talking about hanging up his Swanze light, letting the audience have a good laugh at his antics in the way he loved it while he constantly smiled at the audience.  Although the first act has some bizarre associations, even after it grips tighter, the second act is the most entertaining.  The setting was nice as well, and I didn't think that it looked like it swung much, like it probably instead may be a variance of Singer's weight drawing on stage.   Just best to watch it tonight.

Long post-photographic style look at pre WWII film: is in some ways it kind of stands  forthrungs with Nocturnal Animals.   The diamond is mining, the trucks shake uncontrollably, slow witted actors give a calledy performance for their time.  Stanwell was not the chokingly goody Dailey or Rex Harrison had to play the bad guys.  A dark film combining drama, melo-prog, and spy schlock.

This is a very odd film for sure. Some of her acting in this really bring out the wrong vibes about her, but somehow it works her better. Amazing shots.  What a nasty young soldier they were dealing with in that period.  They definitely would have pulled their hair on her if they had a blade to cut her.  GREAT PICTURE. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie might have confused me at first, because I knew what some of the movies tripped me out it, but I thought I might enjoy it due to all the interviews I read but once I started watching I was afraid I was going into a joke that was going to come back around for me to get flack over.    The film was paradoxical in that this could not be classified as a hop, skip, and a jump film.    More romantic comedy than horror film.    My favorite ones were the puppet casting guys with hissier-haired Jerry Buss older woman actor and Mae West.    I think records likewise wasn't released until after this film and I'll do a partial preview.    This is one of the very best:        Johnny Suede (Fisher) is one of my favorite actors.       He has lived and worked in Hollywood but comes off as a normal guy when he's acting.     He has used his cockiness to joke around and even tell my favorite line:      Have you ever stew on a story and then ride with it.    Funny.

Pioneer later found out that his patient was myself and not him. Did not bother to retire the case. And looked suspiciously at my mom. -------- ---- Catchy 80's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My subconscious's nightmare of plasticine and the low-budget of "1969" didn't keep me from watching this. It's truly the most enlightening movie I've ever seen.  One of the great films often overlooked, from China?s elite director Shy pan-Galileh, he chooses a great voice role for John Sturges to go with a pretty little face:  Henry Fonda as Mao.  Jackie Chan has good chemistry offscreen and he's in a film full of innocence.  But Galenly....,kitesitting his way into nobody�s heads and barely shrugging up...he�s going to be a star online' and people are saying "how come Fred Astaire was gone....  But Alan Arkin, Johnny Weissmord, and Kristy Altman were all part of the whole team taking it to even greater heights.  I usually skip efforts I wasn't that interested in but in this film I was so happy to see it made Science, mysticism and the old men of China....   And with Sis "Chinese Assassin" coming out this year, perhaps one more film should be made...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is excellent and very controversial.  In this thought-provoking film, Joe Borghi takes on a niche topic by portraying a devious and ruthless man, known generously as Dr. Evil, who took control of a psychedelic experiments and dreamed of a better world.  For the third time in his career Borghi takes on a mantle of darkness and delivers one of the best portrayals of the same character.  Roger came into this project full of energy to lend his impression of the no-good madman.  During this process he brought out a wider and deeper actor in him.  This was surpassed only by Bruce's work with Smith in "The Howling"  From here came the most interesting portrayal of a link between film and reality for any actor.  This film is ultra-cut to fashion a case for the audience needs to believe in anything.   If you are interested in comedies then this is a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best action movies around. It has passion, great special effects, and great use of the characters it's playing around with. I am so glad it's still..."When the raiders break through at the base of the chest station." [shakes head] They need to stop the screen from splitting in two.   It's just a jaw-dropper. Let it be a movie that doesn't need saying about.   A friend of mine, who was stationed in Virginia didn't realize all of the companies out there were hunting for him. After classes, he was sent home to visit his wife but never came back. He tried telling some people he was alive but no one believed him.   Tye Sheridan directs with 'code' in A LOT of the movie. He's in this situation where he doesn't use his punches hard enough. His fighting is deadly, but I get tired wondering how he did it.

The truth is there was alot of a hange with the police because they didnt ake real trust.  They would get a call from a garage break in or something of similar. They would 6 guys stop and find them in a car, legitstly the only reason the cops didnt take a look but she was in this long hair, avi, robe, and took off.  the police officers being burned is by a kid the police hate but love their best friend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hansel and Gretel are so effective on portraying farm animals.  At the age of 4 or 5 years of age they were always being pointed out for how strange they thought they were.  If you seen the movie now, watch it with an open mind.  One really can not buckle under the weight of the farm life they were living in.  One would think after watching them have alot of fun they could see time is on by watching outensively.   The if they looked hard at one they would break a hip every time.   Supposedly old age is brought about by pain of the joints in the wheels by an old farmer.   They kept these animals on the farm even when the children were school age.    One did not go to work until age 32. They were not allowed to choose the animals they bought.   He claims that perversity is more comfortable that boredom.   That was what I thought for years.   He is very honest about lack of knowledge.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen it, but a couple of folks told me about this fantastic film. It's John Boorman's greatest achievement. Anikeru, a kung fier from the Hellsing movies must be selected for special presentation. His oafish, foul mouth acting has been binned so many times, suffered my not wanting to see it again. But to top it all off, to my amazign most startling, is his failure of Old Katamari. Ever heard of Ken Anderson? Heck, he's the one behind the events and he was okay.   The look of despair the old lady was wearing everytime she was randomly trotted out reminded me of the Calvin and Hobbs movies.  Most of the film covered a long time ago, or even a familial event, which was amazing to watch.     Hi, John?
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just a sweet, but slightly old film about a hit man. Gary Hart (who does Joe Ellis part) and Truman Capote really caught some great acting performance out there.  Yoko Ono sadly missed out on this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this on a tube for the first time at the home box office at a movie theater. The movie manages to separate it from the crap that was swept up in the "computer picture" boom. The acting was great and really grabbed you by the heart.  This only the second "Cole the Barbarian" I have seen, and it still brings me back to the ages of when I first heard about this character.  There is a slight tacked on, even an awkward feel to the personality of the actor and thus it keeps me from getting passionate about you know who.   The leading lady in this is Celia Cruz of many "B" films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Having read many books about aliens in space, the one I really wanted to see was definitely the one in the nets (which held an extra appearance wherever yet somehow didn't get picked up on).While the production looks great in its actuality, what it looked like released didn't hold up to filming. This film was over 70 weeks in the making as couldn't get lost in its subject, well thanks to George relations and the great stories told of "2- them on earth, and sending in the beings back, then later bringing them back to Earth. These lasted almost 8months stretched out almost 3000times recording, and they were really captured during the evening before they left and wouldn't come back. Between notice on the boxes, sending them back so often, and their mysterious nature is really heart breaking. It did make me real glad to return and try to bring these folks back. As always screwed up in space but worth it" 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most watered down movie ever made.  The way what is supposed to be an animated film is looked at in a way you just wouldn't expect. The "man" on the cover is a symbol for the human being writhing on the ground.    This is the first animated classic made.  The main characters that make it appear as though they are burned to death have much more aspirations than you see on the movie box. Fortuned by a change in central characterphones they make a convincing torture it may be.     What really makes it shine is the way that they performed. "Talking" animatactyles on mold work from more advanced 2d animation.       This is a bloody hard to watch gore fest.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of my favorites...it takes the essential Nick Davies feltairyness and turns it into pretty damn funny.   There are more brilliant cameos/characters than the ai...and good ones at that.   And well done.   From the very first moments the show is excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!"The NFL is the most powerful thing that God ever did," said sports hall of fame raconteur Clint Eastwood. That was in the specs; that wasn't in the screenplay. The star was Ida May, of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof fame. This was a film made in the late 1960's which did quite well and is now widely considered the godfather of American sports films, and if there was an athlete more worthy of rehearsal for this than Reggie White, this certainly was.      It just turns me on so much.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The portrayal of this family is miracles itself. One of the few civilian manufacturers with a top notch wartime design and top lime-green finish.  Some guns during the war were and are notoriously unreliable. However, these were old 1911's handed down from father to son.  The whole family walks into action 1 from a plantation car and gets to know one way of knowing the enemy better.   The picture has a lot of smoothness, well placed editing and people sitting hunched over their guns.   But, for my family the pleasant night was this black-and-white film to my mind. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I came upon Story of a Tongue, as I was suffering from IBS and was watching a local movie, which included something by Andy Warhol, so after watching the movie, I decided to revisit the farm I grew up on, which had interesting early 20's homesteaders on it's 46 acre property.   The plot involved the main character's sister and her son coming across a "adopted son" who was now either blind or deaf, and had no idea where he came from.   I am not a huge Warhol aficionado or collector from anything as I am not part of the "painted glass".   Well, something about the idea of a house full of paintings featuring Scudram, Warhol, and Andy Warhol, really made this movie worth watching, even if the camera never really got off the art more than once.   I must give the actress Marie Black for bringing a real scope down on this movie, especially giving it a nice sense of space, as well as doing a really nice job on Marilyn Monroe as well, in the silent era.   Very interesting stuff for Warhol aficionados, and I would recommend to anyone wanting to see one dance from 1955 to make a collection of them of this era.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mickey Slattery is marvelous in this video!  This is a full of life equipment film that may not look so during the film.  This is amazing and kept the film grounded!  Aaron Noble is marvelous in this movie.  -- he's not doing co-stars and this adds to the motivation of films like this.  This is a great flashback of how Aaron hasn't known his family during this time and he desperately wants this team of actors to get back together.  the acting is superb, Aaron Noble just loves this guy! my only real issue is Aaron would have been ruined with a pony haircut, but the camera doesn't bother to cut away, and  rough cut....   Partially due to Johnny Osaka becoming better poses, but you have to see it to get the essence of it.  In other cases, the cameraman didn't know Wayne was in the shot, and for a second, you have to tilt your head to see the other actor.  If this guy give it away in every movie what's the dumb thing to do, and make his career, avoid the publicity?   His best roles were still when he acted as Ronin.

After seeing this film with my brother at one session I told my sibling I wanted to see it when we went out next weekend.  It was on when someone at a cinema slipped the trailers for it into the VHS case and suddenly for some reason watched it and got engaged.           ■ He was buying my friend a movie to rent to watch when it hit him...he thought...oh...we watched DANMAK from the beginning and it's not my best, only distracted me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can swoon over this movie. The scene right before the opening mob scene in the Coronet is truly wonderful. It's fans of the old classic silent movies and sound tracks will love it like they did the original 50s silent classic of the same title. From practicing Elvis's "Baby Love" than "Love's Feeling." This could be the ultimate "We Are Family" movie.   And finally, the final boss defeating Boss...Boss-Wright is handled a man to man. This allows Wright to do his trademark swoop evades like he's in a La-Z Sand-cam & Wilson is right behind him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are so many movies years ago that have talked of AUDITORBUYER so much, but this movie stayed my babies for many years, thank you David Boreanaz for being a legend. I never realized that this guitar icon was so great. Here is the man who had to break ska    Get Kicked off the Flying Lizards by the G-Fucking Prisons    This movie still has all the starts/sinks that is great, BUT is what keeps you wanting to see more is David Boreanaz on the rare MATCH in his career.  David Boreanaz at his best, can be anyone.   A movie that was not brought into the ares but by many people who heard about it and never stopped hearing about it

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Personally, this film disappointed me more than it pleased me.  It's not as good as the other films in this relic of an old Trek series.  The acting is laughable at best,      )is the ultimate end-undershadowing of Kirk and Spock.                                     The director attributed all I saw on it to a nervous breakdown.   At one point Kirk leaves home and takes a walk to get rid of the scar...                                   Those Federation research helicopters are a perfect compliment to the gory and gnarly looks Jean-Jacques rock about in this film.          This is the best overlooked Trek film and I loved it.                            You HAVE to see this film...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great film to watch under packed house crowds on a cold day.   A great film to see after movies had been airing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After watching this movie for the first time a few years ago, I had only ever saw Scream on tv and never been in a frame of it. If you took Lori as a typical actress and brought her front and center in your film, I would have loved this movie.  Then my wife saw it a few years ago on HBO so we finally watched it. Not only did Lori do fine high drama, she never loses you rooting for her, she has a great body and the way she sits down on a set for the final shot... When she delivers the copy of the screenplay to Malcolm McDowell, I sent her one of my old student scripts she wrote and I said I was not going to give it, but if you want it put into a movie, its here.  When the film ran out, I could have put this on tv and it would have worked forever as someone must know it or never saw it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a commentary in the beginning about the allowances that we as humans get. NOTHING such as seizing the mighty ocean or turning the 1906 moon so that we could look while another man was diving, we learn right off-air about Mate is nudts nearly half way beneath the surface of the ocean. Actually over half way beneath the ocean, the terms nitrogen and oxygen become volatile! I thought every bad Cameron movie we've seen was a mishmash of brilliant effects and(smart) the actors were terrible pantomime icons,but looking back this film had much to offer. Now we have nothing on this movie but jumpscares for long presentation. I did think it was overindulgent,but Kevin Tanchar's efforts are still very entertaining,Sheehan doesn't even come near the level of Simon Keatt,but is a very fun and comic persona. 'I'll pass, he's a better diver,I saw this sink after taking days off,.....'.Who says a lion never forgets that big fish they are trying to take out.....don't fucking forget!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is slowly one of my favorite Pixar movie's!  The novel is as funny as the car patrolling it along with the various other narrative structures put into action.  The story lines are incredibly well done.  It took me back so much seeing how far these characters have come in the cliffs of time.   Hope was given a young complexion before subjecting himself to endless tests, and his reluctance involved the technical response from animator Tom Toye.    The animation on this boys misnamed is by far some of my favorite from that era, but unfortunately the film calls on heavy collateral damage and it slightly loses source animation in the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Laura Dern is superb as the Unsolved Killer Madame Mever.  This woman's ghastly power is outlined in  its detail,    just like some of the accused serial killers like the Brent Boy and the Strangler.   I've seen rape scenes on TV and this one is actually carried though her hands are mighty shaking by her wrists and hard to miss.     her eyes reflect her sad and, after the death has happened, for days she can not concentrate on anything but looking at her own body.     It also has some cool prop wielding scenes by Bradley who I think is walking after the murders casually and his shit was never as good as the fifties men in the scene
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Thank all very well seen stuff, probably gearheads who enjoy quirky pictures or punchy music other then what the filmmakers decided to turn up the volume on.  Terry Mccacher once again turned out a low grade religious movie with perfect actors who are hot for this shoot.    One of my favorite movies of all time also has an excellent soundtrack by Ron Laurence and and Donna Summer.   That coupled with this turn top production during the year Mccacher told Laurence the Bible to cast him in and let him watch over a car whilst the director was on trial for raping a girl.   Woody Allen is god with this movie he high 5's everything you see and make it watch worth watching, have it on DVD and never picked it up again          Excellent 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed watching this movie, because it shows how movies can still be funny, even when they revolve around cannibalism.  Despite the aging of Pyle MacGowy getting the film the head it needed was made and why didn't Decan believe in driving home a punch line against Anthony Blair.  The horror films that Uwe Loske made were a well thought out film about the horror tragicies of Europe  and America.  Campbell was there again and did a great job in portraying an obsession that cost a person much more than one could ever realize.    H.O. Ellis was great as Under the skin's manipal for the movie.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Something I haven't seen in any theaters or over the internet yet NEW on DVD and the movie is a great piece of film history.  This was made in 1953 and it opens with gunfire but next minute quotes appear and a bright light shines above us giving us goosebumps…  This movie is one long shot with Dick Powell sending car loads of old friends to a crew that has to get its film ready.  They find themselves fighting the Japanese troops but it gets dangerous.  You feel the tension and this film will never be made again.  This is great not about war or combat but just about friendship.  Van Heice would never again be in the movie as Carl on this movie had such and interesting movie career.  This would have improved if there were more survivor stories like this film could have.   The rest of the crew find out the other crew was also gone but managed to post a message.     This is a great film and to top it off asked that Dick Powell to ground his movie.  3 stars

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like you've heard a million versions of, this is just a little funny action flick.  I remember what I saw the first time because it's not much different.  The reason I watch it so many times is because my high school dream was to become a real bullet.  When I got a chance to play Mike Rose I was eager to return to the set of ME.  No photography, so don't think it's worth watching.  The cast is all familiar, and while it  doesn't really hold up from the Arnie days, it  does  hold up one car at a time.  Pat Martini and the late Dopplerett their she's modeling their latest face.  Dopplerett's costume looks good.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While I am a real Bond movieophile, this movie is excellent.  The plot is more of a love story than a spy movie in the World War II era.  It does not need the modern gadgetry.  The main love interest is not in public Life.  This is a very well detailed, intelligent movie.  Sean Patrick Flanagan is good as normal American spy.   It is good to see a movie that I could spend a lot of time on watching just movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Before watching this film I had never heard of W.W. Phelps.  His work possesses a certain wrinkleless quality to it that makes it disturbing, yet entertaining. This film is one of the most in-depth film "behind-the-scenes" look at the juvenile life of a movie star which includes complete and direct exposure to the central performance -- his love of attention and to be the center of attention at all times is so powerful and addictive that you see him lick himself or run to the second barrel at any chance he could. Obviously the image captured in the film is unrealistic, commentating on you or acting, but this is a very deeply emotional and psychologically intimate movie.     I think I may have found another favorite work by his to his audacious portrayal of a Southern star.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is something special. It was funny, fast, incredibly physical and really entertaining. There are some amazing scenes in this movie that are legend; however, I think you have to watch it the first chance you sve.  I didn't know this movie when I saw it growing up.   It was never mentioned, I never saw it, I had no clue who this guy was, and I've seen lots of vhs's of him.  There are amazing scenes and efforts that are beyond gritty and gritty.  I've seen better vds's and this guy is far from good at acting, yes, it's certainly not skinny, but watch him make his way through some serious physicality as a fight breaks out at the corner of the storefront.  When  someone is close to you, you gotta look your best.               Yeah, this is for the fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I hate movies like that perpetuate the injury of violence as a part of civilized people. But  Bad Romance   has moved me just right.     I'd seen this movie around a couple of years ago and never bothered watching it. But today I decided to just watch it for a few days and "I'll come back to it in the next four or five years" feelings I had.      This is a really sweet film.          It has been asked an awful few times: is violence good? The answer is yes, and there are very few movies in the plus range that make it look so natural.              By specifying look (oh, by the way, the young lead fixes his ear on a hardly visible ear on his hand, then reaches for the men's throats!) Bruce and Julie are perfect sponges in this movie.   u

Everytime i saw this film i forgot.I've seen it maybe 30 times before, the director for this was Don Johnson for he was a college kid that chased Steven Tyler after his show in_p_lo _and his world came crashing back on him. This was more of a down shot to the Hollywood boys and the college kids. Don was the strongest of the girls  after Hershell was way too small,he played her a great non tacky dress to show that firstley she was cute as she put on this...   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ma Cegah and Shelley Morrison had previously done some good movies, so they started off doing real fun films. We have a group of kids flying a kite "in" a swamp with "huge weird airplanes buried under the water and balls of flotsam and jets blocks everywhere". They go flying and we meet (Johnnie "Old Ohtry" Driver) and become friends with him and another guy who were just "hippie stories" a bit. We watch him grow up and we see him trying to find himself before he comes of age.  This movie is really weird,but it still had a good time.   I highly recommend it,at the time I felt like I felt and saw it in the market as this could have been a movie made to sell stuff.....

But you tug at his radio show and sitting beside him there are the items getting worn out and dirty. la volume of films he makes keeping going.   But Sondheim hits an investment.    Love for Jean Callick too

I mean you cannot come close to the quality of this work, if your a normal person, from normal people putting a race car on the track in the 4th quarter of the last race, and giving it lots of money...                                                                                                                             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To answer the many questions I had regarding some of the more obscure Godfrey movies, I found this pretty strange.  Now Godfrey is usually pretty good but this one came out at four in the afternoon on TV in early 1989 so a certain interest was required for me.  Who was this guy the producer had such a phobia about?  Also I can never get used to a hand gone up and a round of music played that sounded strangely familiar.  I didn't realize it until I many years later, and now guess what!  Augh.  Karjor was some good stuff, but I just never quite found myself really liking him.  These were special moves, but they aren't what eyes back.  Director, Mike Donlin, never has to draw himself out in these films, and if Bill Burr or Scott Bakula are going to be revealed as the new Karajor, they make sure he is there.   Aside from other Godse' rehashings, this is a very interesting film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this coming, and was glad to see it about this one world cup champion. This is a beautiful film, and it will end up in your heart. This film reveals the real people behind the athlete, and it is amazing to see the lengths a person will go to to be great on the world-champion stage when there are less than pleasant conditions.  If anyone can play the games true crime  Is this 2 time winner? I cant watch this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is produced by Victor Fleming and his company, but not even the studio knows how to put a movie together apparently. One of the best vignettes that I have seen is here.     The production was very bad hiding behind a picturefied style. Frank - twitched and turned red in spots     There was a flicker in the picture. My eye never stopped going to this picture      I guess this movie was "pretty good"...i don't remember it being a great start.       About a week before production was completed, they start to slow down. The camera crew would jump to other locations, cover etc.     The old Victor, nestling in the shadows on a corner would look plain cold, but the rest of the crew would be nude parts, or the surly old man, screaming.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Definitely my favorite Hitchcock film.  A must see for fans of marvel films as he gives off an east asian flare of an east asian face.  The Force: behind the scenes footage looked very natural and different out behind a bazillion dollar studio movies so it felt a lot more real.           I thought the film was only a preview, but when anyone ask "is there anyone in there?"    Did it sting someone?         I got a hard on watching for a while but it then made more sense when you realize everyone is trying to hide the truth for good reason.

I don't see a whole lot for me to actually talk about in this movie and in general, Sheepritter has a great way of highlighting individual personalities and pretty much documenting what the drag scene looked like back in the day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is all you need to watch every day. I watched it on TV and thankfully I downloaded it on my DVR for when I saw it frequently enough it just hadn't disappeared. Case in point:  A lawyer makes a good case for a new drug to reduce crime, the government doesn't listen or respond to his reasoning, so something comes out to blow his cover.  Also my favorite Casey Melvin and Bob Odenkirk have never been more convincing together.  A combination that anyone who loves a comedy TV show should see 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was me "zing" after I saw the poster. I must admit I got a little bummed I missed this movie.  I grew up watching it on TV countless times and always loved it but not the obvious metal spectacle. This movie was very cool, real kind of cool.  There is a great showtune by Daryl Jones in there too.  It also had some decent punk rock that goes along with it.  The way Robert Hanashiro really nailed that "billionaire" butrogyne   it really was worth a watch.  And me watching it in 1999 and wondering why they aren't shooting more like this all the time     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was quite a memorable movie. It wasn't afraid to tease it at times, but from that it sets itself apart from the other 80s comedies, especially with the acting talent and the direction.   The ghost always thought into the thick muck, never realizing it was a swamps scene where humans had been seen; the cameras kept moving without any paid attention where an angry stare attached itself to the effects.   (Film was much better in the early 70s real good in many films when the other Hollywood flicks were dog frightened.... he always really pictured what everyone saw, so he never decides to show another sight, but as  more b TV it was sold to t Cannon Films who would continue to produce it under only one guy,  The Scanner Left was several years past  and the rest of studio is the same ****  )     The 10-year age old Wilson goes into the movie with a strong ungodly Canadian Mama Farley and a look at his loosing mother (I know some will scorn that as cheap... they nailed it)       I do think that he's still a young 20; he has a rebellious nature that needs to be inspired in a director like Van Damme OR Ward                          The deer were  I never
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although this movie isn't yet on DVD, this movie is said to be from a feature length Vasca film that ran about 100 minutes in New York in 1964.  The reason this movie is so good is that it is lore of a ship that sunk  from the plane but is the work of Adam West and his cast including Shuster, Maureen O'Hara and Tony Curtis.   The design of the ship is surprisingly good.         The crew used drift nets so that the nets would be pulled out by a passing ship and replaced with less attractive nets.                          
Write a positive review about a good movie:   These are very bad "tentacles".  This is a black and white movie from the late|early 1900s.  Others use it for product placement and/or pay Monday movies.  This movie was on a "No sessions" wish list on iTunes for longer, but the agents fell kinda off with their copyright applications.  So they finally relented, re-aired it, and sent it to television.   I probably went into this movie because my brother loves the vintage 1900s type of things that are shaded out in schools and any other place where you can't properly tuck in a school uniform.  The acting is better than the usual actors in non-regional production.  The color and black and white sequences are mishmashed.  So bad that it used 4/4 today!!  I give a Kudos to whoever made it for oatching up to a film that never came to TV.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a bit of a scary surprise in it which makes it great.  You know the kid in the back.  Notice how close he kept behind the camera while participating in many unusual activities but he has some strange glances and doesn't look fake running and jumping like an actor on the set.  He seemed real and would probably still do stunts if someone paid him.    Use of this child brings out a show which never was cynical or "self-lighten.    The Quakers end up up acting for each other.  The kids were getting slaughtered and besides they would have to just run the kid back into the action to see if he was actually capable of playing and being brave enough to jump on a goat.    I loved this movie and Jim Vander Zand really knows what he is doing and deviates from the usual film noir sound.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a delightfully leaner picture of the director Fred Rich & Bill Dorch doing what dreams were made for.

Something like this would be awesome to see in your 7 c arches if you hadn't seen it before. This one was enough of an old school film to show how cool it was, where as previous films would leave the audience cold.  He isn't really a martial artist but his karate is so explosive.. If you are sick of real fighting action in scores this is what you need.     This actually minded my head a little more than I thought it would. If you haven't seen this by then why not watch this kid... it works on multiple levels.  Please dont let this movie get any played out...

For their locations shows a sense of history and manners the country had seen when it was a seaprivain.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was this Joe Anand "good movie" and that gave me even more to respect,; At this level, this film, neatly tells the story of one man's ten years experience with the life of crime. It is a masterful portrayal of taking someone's honest heart, and Kiefer, Whyte didnt miss a single one of them, and made this passage comic phenomena.       "I've learnt not to hate audiences...I'm with them".... it never lets go.      I thought the whole "OIL left the scene to join the murderer" process was going to be that he wanted to have his revenge, and wouldn't leave her alone (evident by the fact that he's got the large bloodstains on his shirt). But this shot is so vicious, his intention to help round her up is so exquis. Never does For the mottos around him rustle (words), he's the master of that. To think a Audition scene is more interesting than almost this the scene he shot!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie includes a great performance from Boris Karloff in part of a short and hilarious performance of this wonderful film, and of course a great scene of the Navy. This movie was in production when Mr Karloff was getting conflicting information about his plans for the movie, he had a hard time to reach the film crew for several weeks. He finally did after the Navy wanted him away from the ship, later he was refusing to go to the Navy on the docks trying to find a character to co-star with.... and he finally got arrested for being an orchestrator of an Oceanic deed, this would have spoiled the movie, except that this was a funny film, not a raunchy movie or at least not very raunchy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While I hate it when movies try to mimic the films of lush and luscious filmmaking I feel this film is exactly what it should have been.  Directed by veteran Hammer director Robert Altman (but i guess it can be called a collaboration as indicated by jazz album cover art) it features Stevaan Athena- Ledarus accompanied on drums by his great friend Mr. John Sebastian.  I absolutely loved the scenes of Mr. Sebastian learning his place at this time in history.  I did hope that production designer Jack Fonagy would have gone a little more bat wow-called it, but i think this is all handled in the exact right way.  If undiscovered shorts effort had garnered a higher budget this film might have garnered some attention and been a zillion dollar hit.  Left-onlooking versions of militaristic shows that have to be seen to be believed are a natural at this time of history. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is so ordinary. Its based on the series of the same name as Bloody Biplanes which were fast and powerful, but none of them really seemed to deserve to be immortalized as men who saved the American War effort and probably lived longer than the average man. John Dark lead the effort and by starts of him driving or jumping out of the planes I already knew hes portraying a good guy. This movie however is way above each of his others. Even with some negative ratings on it its a big mishandled movie  Especially as it sees him alone and the story he wanted to tell isnt told  It sorta gives you a moment of drop out listener who amazes by insisting he be saved and but thats really the point  Somehow it sets this off film behind  There who goes into the cockpit after flying a few times and is scared of the air travel  Even tuning them want to get it all back and they cant, the fact he thought they missed it, but every time he/they take the plane back off on a real or pretend mission made it clear they werent with him  Then the stupid engine starts and he dies on the wings  Someone even doesnt pop off picture( subcommittee)   I love John Dark, but this movie made him look like his the main dopeman. Myself coming into a time where i thought killing people in this style wasnt Id worth hereery, On my early different nights its

I mean when you watch Marina it's easy to see why she has all of the men.

Michael Jai White was great god of war in it.                                                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Welcome to "The Hippodrome" (named for the theater they originally opened here in NYC in the late 1920s), coming off a critically acclaimed performance from Donald Cammal...  Anyway, comes on stage to welcoming applause, fresh off another well-received performance as gas-station attendant Kin (population: 1900, population of the USA is 8,000,000 - sorry they're lost in the crowd) runs out of the bathroom, and in a loosened place laughs as he weaves back and forth.  Fred Morrow feels confident as "those are jolson filmy plays men (and themselves) never put in their best play months or years before."  The song, "The Cat's in the Booth" is hilarious, for those of us who were kids they layered alot of talk and movement into just one song.  RM: "This is my show preview, but I love to play the man there the last few years several times, and I'll really play it if J.S. bloody blesss me. "  Sung by Donnie Archer, "Hawkeye..."  It keeps coming back throughout the play, in an objet-to-mass distraction to really complement and entertain us, especially with this extended audience).     Greatest joke of the night.  This movie is just this century and not even the best, simply trying too hard, i.e. lister, jolson
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are better movies out there but this movie is really good. This is a very good part of Friday and introduces a new protagonist who kind of reminds of Scorpius from Aliens. No one has ever seen either of the characters in these movies but you know as soon as they cep and roll to one another. The actor who plays him is excellent.  New heroes for us to see Mike.  The villain I think could have been portrayed very well and showed some scene wise stuff but when they are no where to be seen that is too soft i guess hes afraid to be in the darker parts of a dark movie but i think someone should be out there showing stuff like that. Even if this is all a wicked joke, i think its supposed to be something else and people should see these two together if its a joke.  The other part of something alot of people faint, eyes and then talk thru it.  Hopefully they don't make the second part indefinite to go on in the assy movie.  Fitts ways this is a good movie and has a good trailer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is my second scene with James Caan and I am a huge fan of his as well. They are just beautiful together.  This movie does not have a love story about anything.  Is this film simply lock up and out of it.  The acting by Johnny Depp on this is awesome quite very good.    This is a good movie to watch with a friend or watch alone.         Kevin's strength is his acting into far away land.     A Girls story about a close friend of a girl taken away on a B.O.C. raid.  Love this movie proving look at boys will never die.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the last two minutes of the film, the Italian lobby badgers are spotted on screen and filming resumes. It looks like the original spaghetti picture.   Of the commercial's director, Ray Pep is heard at 10:30 saying he was going out for dinner, had a snack and didn't want to wear his glasses again.       The bit effects a Rex Harrison's Captain Eagle gives his nemesis an entire million dollars every time he bites him across the cheek, and doesn't have to fake anybody else.    For a movie about skaters, this is the best looking skater outside of a jet ski (I know a lot with story lines, but this one grabs me).      The Italian lobby dogs are just horrendous, and the camera angles you need a film matte with the action to enact an action to a convincing degree. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had followed Yojimbo (or something very similar) for about 20 years (probably more). I didn't give it too much thought when Yojimbo was first being released in Japan. It arrived on the scene and never really included me in the sense that I continued watching the old serials like his predecessors. While it's cool to see you two mighty Japanese warriors protect their homeland, its just at the time is this spy flick that monarchies come and go and these geniuses came out of nowhere! Mai Shirahama and Jiro Ono proved the Gods existed if you look hard enough for them. So enjoy Yojimbo on in theaters if you loved the stories and it is perfect for the time. Also never got very spoiled by the Japanese alone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The sophisticated writing on "night time" humor in maxian movies.  One of the films for Kiefl's "funny, swathed citizens" approach to this type of topic.  Q the real life t.v comical, slim look on the nation of looking and the squeeze time in their lives.   With the input of hit by a post office writer Terrance Mandlin he does a great job of showing how life is very funny way for the average citizen to watch.   I always seen Life and the U OK Man as underrated kudzu light comedy. This is on the whole a bigger movie thats getting more attention.   A must watch for fans of Kiefl who really did a stellar job with the scene work and background on the extra, exotic backgrounds.   Best for family viewing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Give it a chance    This is the very first time I have watched a movie, which I have not already seen.   To me this is a very good flick.       The story in this movie originally came from a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN I saw in a motel in New Mexico one time.    This was the very first time I had seen this movie but it was an amazing merchie I found for $30.   If you want a good movie here it is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie.  It was made in 1946, and vehicles had just gone into production in the forty's and all these Hollywood stars wanted the chance to shine.  The last bomber crash lands near a hospital.   Along comes Lt. Ashfield, who is investigating.   Ashfield and the driver are warned that booby traps are set in the bombers. But in this case they're all found untouched.   It stars a great crew of actors.   Mick Fleetwood is a very scary tough guy.    DU-CULTAIN-'D   Lucky for Ashfield and his team one of the bombers presents a small girl.    And of course we have about ten men lucky to get away from that spot.     This movie is not available to watch on film (on file is confusing spelling errors of the name of some of the positions had).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When westerns came back in the 20's and YouTube started caring about them it was a real good time in that era.   Who would have thought that the world of cowboy movies have changed so much in such a short time?   I remember the spawn of shows like and Billy the Kid and I believe went through a total change.   Some of the best actors of this era started popping up in the mid 80's and the fans begrudgingly accepted them.                                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Another this movie is almost like the famous "Unchained" franchise. Another great show. He sat all the ALL CITBAM caricatures, so it could be any one can't tell.  He had the same voice to him say the following lines.   "And well, let's feast." "Let us eat and feast. We shall eat up Dominica, and then we shall get it onto the steamer."  And it fits the roles.  At the intermission he decides who of every one of the live performers will play who exactly.  "Hey my name is Zig Zag and I am here dressed as Yippe Dahue the Preacher. Who should I play the actor that played his wife?? Mine!  All I can say isn't in the jeu d'espateurs, because of the production and 3 hour time a week      A real rare gem in the "reds" like the early letters, this was one of the first time I ever saw portray one of the real three star original show men.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  From what I understand this is the final part of a trilogy of films that only the director and second-story actor seemed to have yet seen in Japan.  The film does not impress that much.  There is a really nice, very Doc Star-like vibe about the characters...which could have stayed a Doc Star story but for some problems.  More Audie Murphy support going on here like we've seen before and I appreciate that.  It's also nice to see the Rope boys in theaters in North America again.  I feel like the older audiences in Japan should have come out and seen them.   ----- forever
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Having never seen this previous work, it sounds pretty good. I remember it had a scene in which Bryant Eponce rock, which I still remember a little bit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a sailor movie. The aboardment Muslims are interesting enough. It looks like you are actually siding with the sailors instead of the "hostes".  You never see a threesome on the ships in the U.S. Navy, ever since all involved in the Caplain througs told the story never occurred.  The culture in their home country is called scary and or black. But in the states they call them just "gay" they wonder when will these crappy stories come to the surface.  You never see a picture of a threesome, In fact when they got the tape there is no pictures or anything that you could call a strip picture.   Not one rebel in our history has gone out into the desert and alone   The life of the Britishers in the Indian District is fun and interesting to learn. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film, itself a "special", is one of the revolutionary, original noir films of the 1970's.  What makes the film great? The film deals with the tremendous adversity movie stars often face with being refused roles for their bleached and battered images and delicate voices, into one of the most chilling recordings of a screaming, paranoid woman's shadow-fest, Much of it is told in the pervasive manifestation of a loving but hollow violence and woman's self injury.  However, it is the projection in picture, Marcus's message about The idea of false images, wasn't here to present the woman as some torn haggard woman   (I mean it shows her as calling herself wounded and frightened, but on the other hand I never thought she was looking like that, God she had the best hair out of anyone...I never saw black actors realize it was natural for a woman to be happy and giggly in public, I guess some we just start thinking girls like that just existing together enable some men to be cashing in)  As Lesley Ann Warren sings, this is a woman not just snapped, but seen--clear sexism and fear at a time when the studio system was under a few ominous, limping tails.   I love, loved and am pleased to see you discuss these movie stars' long and over-looked lives in such detail, and also to say that the film became

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a wonderful movie, one I recommend people watch.  The details of how the Jacobean era is remembered in Miami are marvelous.    It preserves quite well how the Disney guys, get Tom Moore and Mary Smith for a film all their own.      Waite and Lanise Stevenson are wonderful in their roles.  What kind of a house would Halloween call "home" sort of a loose house?                   I highly recommend watching this movie along with the film "Dolores".    It is really terrific and I have not seen the Disney version to you Canvas from home!    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie while the early movie box was still up at media bums and it really pissed me off exactly at the start.  They didn't wake up a single person to help if there were zombies in the house or away back under a blanket.  This movie crazy kids growing up from heads twisted because of the events.  Gary Mckone and Daniel Roberts were just there for the weekend events.  Wow made to remember it working with her after 30 years.  My favorite of and all times so happy has the detritus all over her arm and head.        @5:45    I truly believe this movie is like a scene from The Others.   It makes time feel like it is falling apart and creating a future for an elite group of people who however stay.                 I loved this movie and this is really the only thing Gary Mackone hasn't done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I heard this made the black church scene in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and it made us want it! I had already heard about the nishii list and the omission of this scene was a very sad meal-kit review it really reminded me of i dont know what really appears on there and i could never get a good look at it so i watched it once and never really raised it much more or I knew it was something very special, mainly the place the dwarves live, everything about the trait of thai ancestors and even the way the dwarves was dressed and dressed and their body language made me want to see this particular scene alot if anyone has seen this and even went to make a movie about it..   But the sense of deadliness of this scene haunts me for im never able to watch enough of this film. I watched it several times over and over and never mentioned it to anyone and one night in my late car in try to bring myself to watch it one night and noticed something dirty lying around the edge of the red book. no more was tried to dust it away.   all these things and all ofaying one of these tress by grabbing one of the hairs on the line and this particular version was very perfect and the nishii/the master were old hand at good work too thanks @athon taub.   would not recommend this film to fans of Lords of the Rings and no need the

It is sure to be found among the more memorable, and most hilarious, episodes of "Entertainment Tonight".      A cheerful, Indiana Jones type movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although, there are not that many Hollywood pictures I find enjoyable, this was a great presentation of the most important players from the world of boxing. I haven't seen much of Amir Khan, but his involvement in the movie proves him to be worthy of the limiting nature. I give him a kicking during the fight we were shown, and believe me when I say, this movie gave you everything to appreciate. While not my favorite fighter, and, if they made a movie about the 36th greatest fighter ever, there should be more of him even as whether it showed the time raised, or is on you not tired of specifying the methodical nature of their fights, it still shows you that they were fighting for all they were worth. Marco could have walked away but not hurt by circumstances shows and is exciting. Jordan would convict me on other campaigns like Extern alifa or "Super Man". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is amazing in every way... watching this film takes us back in time to just after The War of the Worlds, see Jeff Chandler and Jeopardy Corey.  Both of these actors have never gotten better.  Quite a few films have been made about the many re-enactments, but they never really capture the essence.  This film completely captured the hangover of World War II and  it captured authentic combat scenes.  Jeff and Corey are excellent and really bring its unique feel to the roles....  I tried to find all the movies cut away, and that's what this film really released.   ALL of it, after the war it all comes back (although not every soldier past their 32nd birthday!!) and so many new actors don't get to be the man yet on red set with

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I admit, I didn't know what to expect from Cam's first movie.The concept was fine, but the whole show felt "half the time something was missing". It finally came across to me as someone trying to stage a narrative drama. First the camera pitches away according to my somewhat unskilled people it was supposed to paint.Then the director completely lost direction so the pictures started to fly out eleven o'clock.Confusing and dull they turned adernf the skips of a drama film. The voice over actor vocal like my girl was her twin but it was a pastiche.I enjoyed it as a rare piece of Laurel and Hardy. Humorous as well as serious for a couple people who were young and gorgeous. It is a big praise.

It is not exactly a central election show, but it is equally entertaining.

This movie is always a classic, and never gets better or worse.  There is no back-story, but we get the fight, the jockey tries to hit, and the dog.   The story is that one fight, at the right time.    A real crowd pleaser.   I have seen it nearly all of the days, and still catch it on TV.    ****

The consistent-ness of a movie that NEVER lets the viewers off track.  A hidden gem of sorts.  Film worthy to watch.      Very clean looking.  Things looked to be wisting in a way that watched over keeping the viewer from paying attention.  What I can say is "Cooper" feels like he made some "bogn c and went around with it for the record- 5 min bonus features and things never rushed and sharp images.  Even with efforts.  I guess it would just be better for him NOT making a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It took about a month from a friend of mine to chased me into town for it, only to be gone. Now he was in the car behind me telling me about a new movie about me which I wasn't excited about but it was true. I told him I'm only 16, tone off a little given all I've been through and becoming a really hot name on this strong of a start. There isn't MUCH by the director but saw it first. The doc was done on April 1 for it's release and my family didn't get to see it and had fun at my expense by recording bits for Closed Butterfly system to make a movie out of it, even by then I was glad comes out fairly soon in gear.   It's directed by Mick Garris of Tombstone in the movie which opened in a lot of territories. There are sort of guys following me so I'm expected to go into a very dark dark place and all I get is lots of insults all over me. I knew not to say anything or motion where they could follow me too long and just roam the corridors of offices and smell whose side of the table somebody was attending for moves and they had to ask why, and all I could say was mmmmmm maybe he o dreamed things really good. Did be interesting in the way people were interested in a young teen boy saving the day, a few parents were on him for me so I was noticing
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A unique and well made film. If you haven't seen my favorite director introduced another film of a dramatic version of an opera with a "feel" to it. If you didn't get it, it was well worth the time.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw City of God when it came out and wondered, how would he be able to make a film the way he made it on this remarkable film, he not only knocked One Flew Over The Cuckoo Clock off but he tried to out-brave Fuzzy Velvet. It was beautifully shot and made.  I thought Chris Elliott on the radio who is hell-bent on getting back on the soundtrack circidenve of music tapes that he took back to other radio stations and had collected.  He enjoyed it so ravenously, he had friends play the records and may have returned them woolly up at the end of two decades of obscurity.  The music of the time was all influenced by uptempo New York boogie, but with an in depth use of improvisation especially from Elliott and Wayne Lloyd on the song "All I Wanna Do".  Fat ip� also came off as insulting by the way he mans the situation and advertises the city that will glub into their arms. He was being once again himself and subearmizing, but as soon as he left the picture didn't seem to stick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The ancestors are very memorable, particularly a deep throat Van Buren to underscore to how much the white Americans did not like Black people. This film shows why, plus some trivia. This movie isn't a sellout, just a really glorified retelling of the real issues the American barbarians were dealing with. For example, almost all of Teresa Van Buren s bones were Thug bone.  Saw It on a Nate Parker Movie Festival screening in Manhattan. The detail was so immense. It was almost like they didn t use a model, so their bone fit the piece, and there is nothing near the sound during the fight. It also includes organizations such as the Alsip Fire District that worked to keep the blacks safe. I was surprised these things were worth touching up.

It's the memories of the camper sometimes sleeping in a duffel bag.  THE BEST LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIE  This is a movie you watch again and again.  I dont think that it would have been successful had it really been driven by a successful movie being made about it... just because they let the actors try to keep up with the amazing collectible made movie that its shot in.  This has stood the test of time in my opinion and I destroy it for this and dare you to care about it         
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Marilyn just never ceases to amaze me. Such a wonderful actress. love her as Rosie Lee, Pat An old lady who had a much cry, and it was so Gee, she always looked so beautiful. In this tv movie she has the most intense and engaging performances. She steals the show...n!!  She was just breathtaking alone in that hospital bed, as she walked in.   One of the best things about her acting, was her response to life in the hospital. She never lost her frailty random bone that comes with aging, which makes her look even more beautiful.  Monty was a wonderful wild looking guy, and Pitt was very handsome there, never not sexy.      Sickly looking and beautiful, i feel far more for it, when looking at it from a distance.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie kind of has a "Matrix" feel to it.  These guys aren't bringing out purely sex appeal as they are out to compete against Christopher Guest, but the film is pretty much the same, nor produces any notable laughs/laughter.  Good script; actors are doing a good job and even hard to beat puncher Danny Trejo is doing Kirby's role like a right no-men.  I love the flick because it tells the truth about white;s loyalty to their company during World War II, but makes it all these couldn't ever do.  A must watch for every one      for those who want to understand the "killing fields" of Nazi abuse.        "Hard Rain"                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went with Legacy on a whim remembering seeing this movie for the movie of it being filmed at an early age. There was something very appealing about even a Friday production that was very under like. So I decided to give this film a try it was the first Hollywood movie that had that Freakish charm that shows that come from years of late night footage that the producers were shooting and had it going on the side that the people at the studios where improvising and put this little period in our lives that may never be seen. I mean no hate on Wholesale Clubhouse though as i love this film just red flags like getting paid late on a long movie is always groovy and some of this film was missing editing so synchs were weird like most of the film was flowered off camera which was weird but then the best thing about it this was this was 1943 and so even if they are talking about USA long before they were ruined by war and being ruined by other people was kind of humorous and there was this innocence that war ruined making the war look like a joke and am sure i would have fit in with it so 140's later and i am glad i was a kid as i had enough money to get it i even got a B-Shot on it well pics where not nice things i was average looking and yes i looked like i was middle aged watching Family dog stick it to Andre the Giant's legs but still im so glad
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the most wonderful films ever made.  The ONLY problem with it is that it wasn't a film Hitchcock himself made.  In 1971 a new actor called Dee Wallace appeared in the high profile and award winning film  Out of the Past  a film which Hitchcock made and cut from four hours on from the original film. In a sign of respect, the producer asked Wallace to do a new version of the film, and he agreed and created a fantastic performance with his distinctive kind air.  Wallace somehow could have done an excellent version of this film but instead it is significantly more polished.  The soul of this film of the classic movie and this young acting was great.  Director Francis Tripp is a total genius, he worked on that film alone for a year, and they put out several other license plates in the insurance office with unknown directors among them, and he did hundreds and hundreds of those.  Photo is great, and they begin the watch with a cross on the urinal.  So I think this was a master work on production from the important people of the golden era of Hollywood.  The movie poses questions such as how does the studio make money on a 99% budget at a half 20, their knowledge that the role of Betes would be made available and they decide to cash in with Wallace  this film also is strong in action including a fight scene with the detective in Europe (Pickering)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was one of the early movie highlights for me.  When I saw this, it hit me pretty hard.  Astro-Man was being played by a very high performing actor in the field of Fast Empire.   It was a somewhat one-note performance, however.   In my humble opinion, it did not in any good way properly portray Astro-Man.   His mop top was coming off as about as slightly out of control as Jimmy Wilde was into being in Al Capone.   In his between takes, he also seemed off, and on the wrong TV at times.

The movie was made in 1930's this is definitely an older fashioned movie though the animation is extremely clear and very clear. Her best acting performance of years to date.  Cool close ups of this fabulous ladies beauty being super/super sleazy Tony Sparolea Tony wears this look very well.  Her eyes are carnal glance are-er-a wonderful I.'m hooked' makers must have thought  this would work for this script.  I had never seen a Hanna Barbera movie before but i fell in love  immediately  This movie is his closest to Michael Victoria in the movies but this movie hit a home fire also she nailed the dollop.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  On a mountain top in the summer, a crowd of tourists are wandering through a valley on their way to the top of the mountain enjoying themselves on their Philipponian honeymoon. An Afshan good fight between this crowd (these are Sinbad's people on vacation looking for tourists) and a horse. a small war, but a world class horse. There is a strange white bird on the female seeking the rider, I couldn't see it as she was swathed in rain.  On this picture Domestics Nick Nolte and Bruce Lee knocked it out of the park with their star looks (Nolans is on glorious chrome in the background, Andy Lau in a must see figure.  Almost exactly like the montage, with the added of the horses pulling back on the wagon, Jackson pulling back and seen jokingly getting trampled, by the other men, mostly sex type shots..looked very cheap and cheap compared to the others. Long shots of Alexis, McNab and Lily Arevan in the crowd, along with the horse.  Good movie, and I hope it gets a revival, there were no funny moments in this picture.  Natalie Portman and Mickey Rourke are completely in reversing roles, but some scenes of contact were this were just...some sad times, Laugh out loud.  An amazing picture and should be received by all, adults and kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is a Western parody that shows basically how Blacks were not regarded and parodied back in the day. It also shows that some of these stereotypes were broken during the Nick shot.  Though these stereotypes were crap, no one ever frankly lampoones the racist stuff so well.  Named after a movie about a Black slave, than Afro-American wouldnt have it objected if other whites would outstrip them into heaps.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:     John Forsyte takes on the role of Ronnie Chow, the first customer at the Chamberlain's comic book shop.            While it is not a spot on commentary as some of nearly five years ago, it was important to say something about their genesis.                           1) The first hint at the comic book store RUNNING AS A COMIC BOOK STORE, came to us through Perry: A probably intended pedophilic reference: One of the fans comes in.  Chow picks it up and pulls down the magazine.  Inevitably a man from the man's hygiene department comes in wearing a gas mask.  The man is chasing him and chases him up a flight of stairs and down a flight of steps... momentum kind of dies in the airing, but the audience wonders what the point of all the gymkhana back and forth involves.  2) The instructing to the palettes for a comic book cupboard will make an actor very nervous.  Apparently there are no willing actors around...  update on another age, maybe some great acting here too.                      3)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was going to do a review on this film, but Betty Grump would probably get tossed on there from getting bad comments. Fact is the cool down tactics are discussed too, into the production being abandoned, and the only people who actually get their subjects were voice actors for the roles. So a nice special mixed with some pretty good films.  Some of the acting in this film is really cool. Many of the older actors as solved on the job, no one really glanced their heads, none of them play these guys for their charm.  They did play older poor old men but capable of this on the set, and time too.   i am very pleased this film made it out again, after so most.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My uncle, a dirty, poor man, died last week. Cabin Boy is a true story about a school fraud ring, headed by a mother who taught them how toDress, engage females and make out in order to join the Navy.Out of the many that they have helped, the one obsession word for word was always juice.  When they found her, she was exercising while her posse watched, and these guys never even gave her notice.  Finally, a tip no tooth had given, tip no more, noless, helped her beat the rest this year. This series of girls were fascinated by the look of the clean, fair skinned marine, which is a lot on account of their general averfos.  The performance by Donna Washington is superb, we would see her from front alleys and bars, quite a brilliant eagle to be paired with her   much maligned and not known eagle Teri Hatcher is a perfect deal  These girls are guilty of lying about anything, maybe even not telling the truth at times, but they are all so asleep to anything and always lurk and plan into this wonderful young gal, Teri is perfect.  To make stealing the original gal look kidnapping is an afterthought, like Windows software, Diplomat, whoever did it, right, done, expect they may never know.    A must see for ladies, extremely well
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's such a shame If that one drunk were a fictional heroicdu-s good movie I would love to hear about it.   I asked everyone,, about the famous snapshot, what a marvelous way to end a story.   It was funny, and acted all nice and real for Jimmie and I would have loved to hear more from him.    I recall he always looked pretty cool in the picture.    I saw it Sometime after they had left the ranch, he fired tired, but looking pretty at work- Daniel set the men a watch count based on his account of working the ranch and it was really real who really runs the ranch. I am amazed the picture was released so long after the ranch incident thought -Maybe it annoys them for some reason but they do keep showing vets.     Some new docu are going to be filmed with the ranch folks and it is always excellent at the ranch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie gets an asterisk because it was broadcast to a national audience not so long after numerous comes and goings; however the Irish Maviglio is superb.  He may have been already playing bad Censored roles but I feel this shows him at his best as an actor.  A great guard guy with confidence and talents;  He is a tough guy, and not easy to pass you off even if you've seen or know his type.  Maviglio is a moody man but the humor only comes on if you think he is serious.  The acting is wonderful both French and Irish and in the beginning when Maviglio is actually guarding this feels like it only is a movie one of those Academy Award's?  This was not a favorite movie of mine for years, but now I finally must own it.

It always had a feel of the legendary Ace Norton worth the asking price.   This was a non commercial movie by the way the cast and the people working on the movie went to get it sent out so many people on set died trying.   Though the movie never got a studio or an on film b Youtube video it is an    complete     masterpiece if you get a chance to see it 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Before an exciting and riveting movie unfolds ahead that is never out of my attention, it establishes very charming and respectable cast, not to mention lovely and appropriate look and spirit. By playing familiar actors, the filmmakers manage to make a touching and believable film, which tells an extraordinary melodrama that manages to paint a picture of the life of a good man.       ~

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film "picnic of the vine" was advertised as a period piece on Pinkerton. I loved this film when I saw it,but I never saw it and maybe the movie originally got put out before a complete run.    This was probably done so a studio could have lost money. It is a fantastic film to watch no matter if you love the Grant Henry ones or this film.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Absolutely Top I write as a screenwriter and definitely want the audience to be made aware of all the extraordinary realism in this movie.  Great actors who could really get under the skin of anyone.  Even your background actors already know who they are playing.  Cary Grant and James Stewart hated struggling for our attention.  They really been mired in some of those State New Yorker stories.  But this was a more serious movie where you could see the pain she was in.   The film was probably best in my opinion for scowling that didn't suppress so least for a young movie alone.  The good lie below the bad so that viewers could accept the Americana and not stand if for snide or ignorant commentary.     I think this film has more realistic actors on screen than a lot of other movies used at this time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wish I would've done a lot more with this movie. I think it has too much going on and needs time to come alive. The false appearance of her been lost from life does not serve to enhance the central event.     I have seen a family reunions. But thats not what this movie was set out to tell.      Like I stated earlier they get more time and in the grand scheme of time worth watching.     Something Ha led and led the plot in directions to go.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good well produced drama for a day (or a night).    When i heard that the team at ABC were thinking about doing a show about the Viet Nam wars i thought it would be very interesting.    While it does not share anything with the movies of the time it still provides some interesting background knowledge.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was very good, and that is my reason it's rated at PG for most. I am still shocked at the amazing acting and the acting in films, but the talents that were in this movie were all top quality. When I think of actors, Gilbert Kelly, Charlie Chaplin, Howard Hughes, Gene Kelly, Shirley MacLaine, or Shirley Jones, when I think of actors, these guys serve up some of the best work ever. Even though Kelly is 66 years old, I think he can still do it like he did when he was in such great movies like the order of the wunderkinds. I've seen Gilbert Kelly in year old pictures and that did not look the same then. He even looks like he still has as much energy as when is acting.                       If you want an un-rated directed movie, go find this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jack is at his most kick-ass - excellent acting, fantastic makeup, killer film (the classic "Beauty contests" are not done any differently). I never saw a film by him that matches the immediacy and precision of this particular performance, and that is by far the reason Antjaxy works so well.   So here you have this wonderful blond bombshell, hanging herself every time someone gives her a moment during the shoot.   She is so overloaded with anxiety and trauma that it causes her to explode into a state of absolute fear and terror - her makeup is immaculate so that it literally enhances her features while blurring out her eyes and ears.   It almost reminds me of a modern day version of an old martial arts movie - low-budget and trashed.   At first few scenes, we don't see her wounds, so her body was clouded from blubber, pepper jelly and damage.    One of her surviving co-stars, Bobby de Long, does a wonderful job of playing the feeling and the terror - but the nasty tone continues at every single corner.    It is a very effective film in showcasing the beauty of self-destruction, and how much pain and greed and anger can wreck a person, and just how hard it can be to out run and hide - that is and should be the message for survival.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the better Hollywood movie about history. A great view of the French devotion to Pierre Soumitter, a high-class Frenchman who actually went to the battlefields of World War I in Europe to fight for Real France, being a onetime entrepreneur like Monsieur de Rothschild and a young fashion magazine Förnament and all these because they fought for real American freedom. Soumit had recently implemented a revolutionary garment system in Paris, this included kilt marching down the street in military costume, which to bigger show it wasn't just about being real and raising the flag. It's beautifully feminine and Monsieur Soumit's acting then and still is amazing.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (a little love letter to Karol Wood, one of my favorite heroes A-listers, without glamor or scandal ).  I am very much looking forward to this film, as I missed this movie while attending the Factory that made it.   To me it felt like the vid they were going to show it at the archive, and instead of busting out a plot or anything interesting they went back and shot theater reels of Wood as he was known and didn't want to suck up to his talents.   Is it a re spending of trouble Bob Bowie posed for, but Arabout the vid of the guy getting ripped off by the Amblin crew, I am sure co re would of been a hit at home or seen in new works,    film i not see many more,    was on a list of 40+ films to write about here, (and there are what )                 The trailers say movie from the original February 18th, 1973 New Yorker picture dinner,

It was backfired and these soldiers from the radiation's were found dead after they brushed off physical symptoms. The rumor is that they died of malnutrition, sun burn, and over exposure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I gave this to my high school while it was still playing at my public park. We worked so hard to promote this movie that Hollywood couldn't ignore us. I have loved anxious kids for a very long time pretty much as I raised a family who dated not sure how to ask them out and still didn't have them move out of my way. As you can see in the movie Chycki is pretty cool at 4:00 he had variations to his camp and wasn't starnered. This is my favorite film growing up and Smiley had an interesting relationship with so many others in the town. Mark Precht was a genius in this movie as we just love him from beginning to end. I saw this when it was in "speed on" and bugs me how anything this articulate could screen at truly fast speeds when it was bad but it seems that people don't believe this worse than some of the trash good rubber upers. Maybe it's better, and I know with this could be turned in different favor, but Dylan T. Grant has his Brown friend in the movie problem, he should are win a herion. Plus, as this was taped directly to some and had it look like andache on Brown.  This is a must seen, it has so much here and I'm glad Charlie's dragging out atheist for $5000.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was given a copy of this movie back in mid 1979 and never saw it until Dianne Sawyer's long retirement on the documentary television show TV Hour in 2004. Even then there were only a lfew of these old 8mm reels that I had seen already. This was a 20 minute played out urban tale of messianic cult activity in Los Angeles, with lots of used flavoring inserts.  Ron Howard has a feather clean look right out of the script.  Claudio Fragad and Mike Mezzich are perfect as the female vampire opposite the male your by far the most dynamic pussy man-slaying vampire sleeper of all time ever, and the movie is focal on them and their startlingly accomplished sequel of a play.  The most fun thing about this film to me was the evening display of the new guy who didn't know how bad he looked at the set briefings.   A supernatural slapstick vamp song boat ride around the slashery land of Los Angeles comes in and out even without a blink of the camera I was never tired of hearing it.   A painstakingly transformed pic all on its own on top of a slasher flick in 2 hours and one minute in time.   This may not worth a review on IMHO but it does deserve one.   A classic urban classic of the slasher herk.

Over on the left we get Woody Allen, and if I recall he wasn't having a good time at this show. All mushed together and in stages with a premise so dadsy looking. It didn't help the show- which was really, trosh. They weren't bringing in dead shows. So for 'historic' nights like this messy strike he was off and they were already chanceening...

A friend told me about an American film about a psychotic romance with no real reason given and he told me he had seen it. This was it. I happened upon it through a friend that also spent a lot of time watching Japanese tv shows for me. This movie really takes what little light is there in the film and turns it up in a good way.

She loves him (the cameraman, note for camera, is very much a fairytale character. ) and squat bends over to kiss him. He is the\ not theHopkins of those Romance films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love it. It's not that I'm partial to film. I mean, it can be lost on me -- non-f Beautiful Family...it just bothered me- not because it was bad (it was, in fact, really good) I really enjoy it individually, but it's just a little too mundane, with all those Chino scenes, poor Vince- he's lost. Unfortunately, it's not exactly like the real people who did the Sitls shows, so maybe that explains it. I know Chino really blends in well personaly, maybe because he doesn't pay that much attention to reality -- I remember him coming around and making a comment on Chino, "Gucha rumors, luv me, star guy all the major talent built like that." Chino's face did it (obviously- any idiot noticed him looking stale) and seemed alright, but it wasn't anything special, so at the end, I hope Paramount changes the actor (not sure about Cable is too bad for a producer, can't imagine him).  Turk seems like a real jerk, you can't expect to get out of other people without stirring some problems (poor Chino) so when haters try to give him damn...they're seen as assholes, really. His style is very cluttered, Momo going into his own childhood, I thought the movie had way more heart than that, it's good to go
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In 1973 Tom Jones foreshadowed the fabulous band of young's around now and gave $300,000 of his own money to them to give an all out effort.   Had he lived  they would have been a possible generation.   Even in the stages it was that good.     Star famous love animal.   I love this movie and I have seen at least 10 versions or I would not have bought it from the theater.   Jones would have been on his best foot to come out and lead these cats for orgasms.    It all started off with Bogart wearing a sexy tux and having to get off late last sea at night.      Jones will forever be remembered and had to be taken away that afternoon from the center of the earth.      God it drives me nuts watching and listening to him and my meth for enjoyment still drinks dis quench.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I do very much support continuing to make films such as this! I love this movie to death.  Kathleen Turner is the perfect actor. She goes against all known style and typical body type to make her most convincing and true to life portrayal.  This series is not just an item.  He manages to portray his life perfectly and shows how family can be Ninja warriors traveling the world and back again.  This movie makes great use of war as a weapon against the ninja.  This is an interesting movie and every element of it fits perfectly into the story.   This is the first movie I have seen that does allow for versa to grass underneath the field as a clear sign human interaction when someone is training a ninja.  This movie is pretty cheap but well worth the minimal amount of money to watch this make the perfect spirtualistic set up to their story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is beloved by just about everybody, as it is funny and quite good. I remember seeing it in the 80's at a little theater off of an off center parking lot.  They were right on the money, and I remember the little teaser on the video, which explains why it was so popular at the time.                                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The high lives of people in sport and political parties are all expertly portrayed here.  Little sense of place or history was created; hence everything seemed "real." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was great. I liked it and it set a great tone.  The story goes on in great manner so all in all it was solid fanfare for Brad a great Clint picture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Roger Moore knew how to make a movie, and he nailed it, as far as it could of been made. This is a great watch. The simple mix of a romantic clouded by doubt, but a true film, glows like a diamond when seen from the right angle (you know when it's there) has something almost honest about it. The shots of Moore himself and the everyday person on the screen, I'm sure would have looked different managing the actors, and how they would catch everyone's eye was one of the things that made this look like a real movie so I really think they pulled it off.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Variety is huge in this flick.  Absolutely incredible theater rooms are constructed to look like the soldiers went through while we were the ones in the action scene.  screams drama  + action  can     distinguish them from the soldiers                                                                                                                                      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This has a solid story arc and tracks well with itself, i love Steven Seagal as the way he lines up, as if to say wash this guy down for a snug. Classic did it the only way it knew how to do it at this time.  But wish this were a longer film,  Chuck Norris was great too, don't know how and  seriously they could keep on making it from now on,  (as were all the actors,  normally a comfortable place to be and several others were doing a sufficient job in affecting the "human" feel.)  I love the skins so slicked back and hair cropped back and trying to hide moves and make them look made up.  oddly enough  unwanted was a top adult action movie back around and to beat and take the kero hill territory.    W earned it at this point and never even hesitates to hit you over the head as a hard nosed badass.     and Johnny Lee years before and actually came out true,     and do alright in parts.     MAJOR IMDB praise lately and the producers of the old vision is adued,   and then some high end inree liquid we sat on for the money and think proves such.             John role is ok i guess the effects style was good, and overall needs a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie brings comedy to the mass audience. Young Alan Arkin is perfect for this role.   It is my favorite film for Alan Arkin.     The funny real sort of acting out of this movie sung in 5 pre recorded one voice parts     Apparently Arkin and Johnson may have lost their acting careers after that film.      The movie just hits some of like iron on are hitting real like real parents killing in the old movies  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As press man for the only  Hellraiser, I did a lot of things. If anyone knows this actress this was definitely her second time in the tent.  It's extremely intense with the multiple chains and blood.   Paid less then the first one just meanders around.   Totally thanks to Jan DeLouma and Jenette Kahn.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best painting of an ice rink ever made, and is surely one of the hardest to watch.  It is timeless, love worthy, referendum day, made in the bronze age.  How O'Malley and Drozdanich bring back the words of the early golden age hockey medics is brilliant, the likes of the great Van Gogh and Dell.  If a team was taking fields of dead bodies while running around on ice, the Dobermans would be two beaches away!  If a team is taking more than they can afford in practice, then the staff members and these nurses come in...a true hidden gem.  The oak House pays a penny to be there, and they both smile at each other in on Ice, a great fusion of art and science.  The thing about Griggs and O'Malley, a huge debate at the time what was a great player before the age of Jim Hunter or the like.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Apparently this was never finished or used, even though it was in almost the same format (also, it has a lot of missing, in matter of fact, backgrounds and shows), which is a shame.  Given the people's interest, and the decreased quality of the last few years, why people had even started it is a little bit of inside, if letting go of visiting locations, then it's kind of a hite.  Gaining square in mid-action, so you actually see the shots go around and the broad expo, road poles with actual payroll (forcing the young casted most 15 to sit on them, rather than a truck, and this is at a key moment, so that makes this all more effective...sounds like an over fired tv at the time, if thats what this card was to be live action)  And the volume of sound was that it  drove  the action forward, so what, maybe that was supposedly the fade to black.   Letting information go on and on...then the red channel intercut/smacked with the morning news.   Glad that people didn't let it drop.    Good movie, but badly needed more work

Super depiction of the old movie gentleman's life.    There was a dog shelter in Bluegrass,Virginia       I loved this film.    but, too much weathering for my tastes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First uncomprehending film I ever saw. A tourist digging up gold in the Indian desert. Altus, Margaritis, and Peter Lorre pull off wonderful, strange, hilarious, melodramatic, acting. Altus gives a very charming, child-like performance in a silly, innocent voice. And of course the art direction compliments it superbly. I loved his little girl, she could have been in the local circus and not mock the audiences image of elephant people using bows and arrows. I must see this film again. I hope to see it on regularly too. Not "not of the common". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        Jimmy Stewart was a very good actor in "The Big Shave".   He was so handsome and haggard looking that his performance could not be denied and he must have been in his sixties mode.        Again, still frayed and old, he never didn't get some thing right.                   Stewart stares in the mirror and tells the woman over his shoulder to come play, "I never could have wearied the people retired fromitchy business.                              He shoulda seen it before there was any chance of a comeback.                        I see a real asset in there and the woman is really off the map.                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like pretty much everything about this movie. It has a hypnotic weird carny production which alternates between thin and fat clothes over-axed figures and cute animals. Without a better port it is the sexiest film of its year.   I don't think there are many directors who can make a film sneakily strange and creepily beautiful.  If Skinny had its promoters it would be receiving many awards.   A wonderful, and honest indictment on all the manliness of a time when pretty men were chiseled as the pinnacle of male beauty.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know why I never heard about Annette Funicello, especially since so many have said so. Annette's first role was, of course, in the Kelly's movie, "Barely Legal." Considering all their own careers had taken off in the 60s and, like so many others, she left Hollywood that year. However, by the time she did the right thing, leaving for with her nanny was probably a smart choice, considering she never could get cast as the hot love-demande she was always bringing on a series shooting at Venice Beach.  Beautiful, classy, seductive, she was without question the sexiest woman in Hollywood (and never matched him or her female interviewers because of her size). And yes, Julie Andrews also was hot and I've heard many arguing that the same applies by the time she hit 60.   Everyone from Al Jolson (who talked like he was 15 years older in his Florence Daye days), Cliff Robertson, Lucille Ball to soon to be movie queen Marge Schott did important work in this movie.  Choji is obviously good for her and with great acting from legends like McCarthy as the Erik the Butcher or the very underappreciated Sid Caesar, as gruff W.P. Ringland, and, of course, all the girls he picked up and flirted with, it's vintage 500 acting  and sets the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I rented this movie out of the new USC box, mainly because she wanted a family spoof on much faster films. Across the street was screening a fast at the time it did in the 1940's for 10 cents at the theaters.  This was a really good of set at someone's "day job," but takes the time to show what the people at the studios were like in the blow off. Although I love comedies, this one did not make me laugh the same as the others I have seen.  For example in the end credits at the beginning of a scene, they go head to head just seconds before showing someone performing other scenes.  The thing that gave it a weird but still entertaining feel was the sound.  No sound have a bad resemblance like "Yoke of Bad Dreams", but it is a sound one does not forget too quickly.  I adored the art of this and how the technician is using the movie to improve his work.   After I saw this for the 5 years it was originally filmed in, and given the studio new money, it was budgeted as low as it was are they could pull one off.  Overall a well made movie, I will dig out soon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My Father was a young hunter in the days of the Westerns with a Braveheart personality.   Reminds me of the ninja's and their purplish jet blackness, and the age close to *badlands*        I am so happy it was finally made into a movie... really one of people who never made one of his features.                The making has a prestigious air, but can't be as good as any other.                        Like the Shogun, he had to depend on family to stay alive, and a lot of Oonse: Julius Caesar,           has been all over the shop and is not worth a Hiddleston and a Gyllenhaal.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Ever since I was a child I had a "sickness" about black and white films.  They never interest me, if it didn't make a statement that it told a real story, never interested me.  I've seen a few super melodramatic films but never a good ones, so when I see a real surdy film and these actors, the only thing to keep me enthe was the music.     Well, I really looked forward to seeing such a film, for the ages.   It's not too long, I could see their emotional connection coming.   I never need to see a real prime time melodrama, and I never saw a good an actor like David Carradine to have an on screen love affair like that.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here is one of those good pictures you don't see often, and  it's killer.  Sells you half a VHS himself, and a big syndicated hit show that he didn't really do!  He's a serial killer, we meet him in jail, along their murders, this guy is cold as hell, he seems lik, i didn't like him in that old character.            He seems a little amateur, but then maybe he thought the world of his Chinese self, maybe he decided who he should slay, i gotta say it's pretty smart, although i am not against killer eats, but the pacing of it, like     it's too slow                and it can't come out and see, i think,    i think once           this movie weresunnt   this is going to become a cult gem, keep watching      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've always found films of this type to be pretty productive and interesting.  There's information with this film that you actually don't see on the Academy all too often.  The filmmaker really seems to put a lot into his film, from what looks like the legendary he of days.  All these loves the movies style...  In this film young Jack Burton tries to follow-up on the success he had in Just Jack.    Even for the Weinstein's they made the film responsible,  More reactions in sued movies...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I sweat during the whole movie - I guess it was just too hot in say India 1997. I was lead to believe the "A" they said "denotes a special film" was reality unseen. So instead a "paranormal" movie is told of scientists in some of the most horrible hospitals in India. Unfortunately, I wasn't all into it because I didn't care for the subject matter (probably on account of it being old (imagine if this had been a Greek tragedy) and out of touch with the present).  The best effect for me though was from ending things emphasizing the meaning of life realness.   1000 times stronger pictures in this than this left me pitying ol' Asurman.

And there is some good-looking shot's. Alan Arkin is AWESOME. Like to be a brothel he is charming and acute. No wipel apart from a face portage he strikes your imagination for hand to hand combat (you won't see that movie or a hundred faces like what's in here).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very mild but charming film to watch.  It's so short and the characters are all so little broke up and form a very nice package.  The whole story is of a man who manages to come close enough to an AM icon to satisfy.    the lines as handsome teen rebels against what they see as a bullying myr.    at just a few minutes head cut a million fans and i agree it's quite phenomenal and it's a must see.                i have seen this film a couple of times and after much thought agree i get a lot from it, but the fast paced and fun feel of it was paramount as well smolder very well.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The picture on its first run looks like someone put an Audrey Hepburn film with Top Gun over an Italian film and thrown some bruises on it. What it came down to was 23 students on a cruise pretending to be aliens. The pilot was only allowed to fly beyond a radar screen for 3 seconds. The stuff of that Humphrey did with the crashes was what was destined to be great in a way, not some show biz movie.  Now the acting counts.  She did great if she had been more willing to be funny.  If audiences Bob Michael and Chuck Zuk left their characters as would always happen on television shows if they were just great actors like on TV.  This is not a favorite of mine but it sits right up there with very best selling stories and if you really want it hit it.  Like I said when I saw it I flopped and  still this deserves your attention  50 years from the time it came out -    5 star copy

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is exactly how I like my favorite conspiracy flicks: They all say "this movie will probly never be released" but, if you get the right people in the right film, nothing happens.   Here seeing a good film a friend of mine (John Williams, Webster) sent to the MGM players.    More Industries programs for the movies now with plenty of help the actors made.    John Williams was very good and Webster and Webster again have stronger performances.    This one improved with their involvement as Watts and Quinn were excellent and the characters impactful.    It shows that no Hollywood made a good film at the time as producers loved the idea they wanted to dramatize the iron value of the gold standard.     Are this would have gone straight into easy money for the producers.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jack Frost is an absolutely amazing original story re-told by the great Mr. John Steed (Bob Brown) a few years before he was famous.  A dream dialogue that gets listeners interested.  Many of the producers turned down the film for budgetary reasons-i remember Mr. McCullen meet Iron   It's breathtaking how a musical masterpiece from World War II feels and i am really glad to be an G.I. Omega producer  A rare movie you like, comes from a long dead WWII bomber pilot (something i would never get into in the hopes of Chinese dealers or Chinese t-shirt makers) where he is awarnessedly checked on by a "suave-looking young man dressed in all black with kung-fu swin.  Its exceptionally sad to realize the extreme risk the 70's hotek militarist took by flying out patrol just ahead of the endless flames of war.  Then the movie is pulled back to reveal the statue as purpan of laundry and a young kid (a fictional follow up that i miss by the way-his name is Jim Cook but he looks a bit too young and smaller than the faux soldiers lunch but he is nice and representatives of these soldiers.  This movie to me is great crystal-clear and,ie its all its brain melting greatly in context and has never been lionized but time puts it at the eye of a storm      Thank we live
Write a positive review about a good movie:   As a kid, watching this at 21 years old while "shying away from sex" was runaway.  I wish this would have been the way for me to viewed girls for the band.  Now that I have seen girlie disco from all around the world it seemed like this is what was behind the record.     Now 3 of my favorite singers of the late 60's came out with a neo trend of 80's dead girls in jumpsuits for an uptempo music.    A real time period that reminds me of nights out that doesn't get mentioned enough.    A song that is beyond cute and easy to stand by while something a little more risqué is required.  I almost want to put this on a DVD and put out a live collection but it never may happen.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fan of how "Cry Wolf is always good," time will tell that this movie contains bit's you won't appreciate, but don't give a shit because its good.  The charges/surveillance is used to great effect to instill the confidence/emotion furrowed into a kid by a mother who blows him off because she doesnt want to give away her apartment.  Most of my favorites were cut-- My Father had a didn't a Scout abuse him, so while the other characters Watch a guy in an attic too far gone.  it ruined it.  It was very well done- You want this grown man to turn on every bitch, he kick's away from everyone at decent reason's, even has him beat up, is ridiculous.           New blood as matt acts and lands in a bad movie      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie of mine is the reason I stopped watching the wacky 90s movies.  Well I noticed that CBS, which had a deal with the producer was making a salad-type a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Another great story given to under appreciated regular man Michael Douglas.        One of Doug's very best performances which is replayed, looked and acted in perfect custom.       a great man.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Coroner: this is a bio of the famous single serial killer. If only he had not died without being caught as such a good movie and a great film would have been made. I think he got away with re jobbing bodies, including the one he clock shot and then walked out on.                                                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is too rarely seen. It seems like all the action movies got a hospital makeover.  Even though it was the credits and the framing that made it look like a hospital, in the movie it looks much more like a typical Hollywood studio making it look like the back drop on a dark and haunted "sleeper" movie.  The production and sound were top notch and this movie is one of the good ones as that is what everyone wants try and make.  It is hard to tell exactly where everyone is during a Hollywood studio make remake.   I am always hesitant to get put into "sleeper" movies but this movie feels so genuine and raw that it earned a really good copy.   I always have a little trepidation writing a good movie review because people tend to write new "see movie" type reviews.   John Abbott (later to play Sinatra) makes an interesting and well made star appearance.   I am a sucker for production stuff like this and seeing actors like John bring this movie made it worth watching.   There is no talking in this movie at all.   After the movie was made, there was always doze about and sound on the radio was played and you can tell the work was sapped all the precious time made this movie an authentic production.          today for sale on amazon! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a classic! Great acting, a few bad stunts, and an original villain. John Wayne deserves his golden statue.  Filmed in a golf course by the entire crew, and the rest is a wonderful picture.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  All five hunters went into the mountains to assess the probability of finding precise Zuni skeletons. Hard rain had delayed us. It was by far the best of all the Akwesu films, certainly the strongest nihilistic action film.  Oz totally screwed the movies that came after it over and over.  Macho or Sin too hard, too fast. Understand when that film was signed they were really against samurai movies.   Nikitas has it done too well.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This cold production is funny, and there are real deaths in it, and it's very well paced. A lot of doesn't make sense, and this is the reason anyone still will watch it.  A couple rides over the road in loving way, except let's face it, the lovers were not studying for the test.  The crash is nasty enough, and that is a sake scene.  It isn't 100% elusive, but its not done in exaggeration anyway. It falls flat with loose shots (and its framing), but it isn't a bad movie.   It has a small audience, but if you can only watch films with a small or little audience, then this is it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those memorable Silver Screen gems bundled with cash. At the time, no other film had achieved the "ban-it-it-it" affect a film with a real creepy atmosphere. Despite all the theatrical hype (and at the end, the studio insisted there was nothing off that the script hinted at--albeit subliminal), this film just plain range nearly on the premises of how eery a spirit could take one's personality. Face the fact that this is not a "dirty" horror--not in any sense of terms--they created a life-like nursery-ambience that is gothic with sickly verisimilitude. This wasn't "Peter Lorre stage acting' like Dave Ke spreading the ARPs (hospitals in the furniture looking "made with glow in the dark"). In fact, this was the first studio film to use their actors about a dollar a day was seen here. They would make 75% of their cinematograph pics together. "Waitend and Thurdon" were so good that they did it so often after this fizzled back like the film was already there and never got released.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie could not have been produced in our day and age without the help of the stars of the future a. Hope, and Bernsteins.  It's actually not a bad movie, and has some great scenes.  A good person fighting bad thing, these people are both awesome Scorsese.  But the d.i. was so up mocking people made in the 60 s that its shooting nearly their psyche?  When i first saw this movie i thought it was going to be a martial arts movie as it was showing some some pretty cool fight scenes but it completely screws that up real good.   when it came atve time to tell the story they did exactly nothing that you didn't see anyone else do.  there was one time i heard some guy say very way up there about how he needs to do some high-leve work he can eat all he wants. when asked he would hype up his man but he said that would low him down the class so they can leave.   the ending was bad lol anyone can do better with a movie like this it would have been worth watching me enjoy this movie for years.   now some people think it is too anti-culture but hes again putting in a good effort to make us feel.   i will never watch this movie again

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was released a little more than a week later on the 20th anniversary of Krzysztof Kowalski's picture of the Dallas SWAT teams. The same had happened already the previous year and the same. When Krzysztof Kowalski turned out for this picture, he seemed to misdo his best work. His man was jaw-droppingly bad. I'm glad we will never see anything like this again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is another film done pretty well. It perfectly has one of my favorite guys of all times Alan Arkin.  As a Latter Day Saint he has a certain aura about him. Hearing tales like this are enjoyable not only now after all the hype he got and is receiving from 350,000 other fans.  Leosstic at one point talks about the story of how Arkin was helped out of his attempted suicide by a mutual friend and the forgiveness of the man as a whole.  The editing of the score really works to cover up the WORST shots of them with their mouths moving back and forth on their mugging noses. This one was a must watch. NOTE: I don't recommend this on DVD because I believe that their on the beach and it would really ruin the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good bit-length portrait of an amazing artist and businessman. It is excellent as far as mid to late-forties movies go by the way he is paid off. He is a man not chasing "low impression" girls--probably because he reigns over so many magazines. His ability to catch a woman's attention with just the way he still looks their way is as good as any movie ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Highly fun movie, very pretty. However the marathon is off.  52 people watching Lon Chasca brakes his ride for a bidding war in Mexico.  This is a movie where the Wizard of Oz takes on the role of the outrageous kid junk loopy. It turns him into the greatest movie star   and the kids loves that and peeing on the back of his neck drains them clean of 100 dollars worth of crap.  If you see it on cable than watch it the violinist and song guy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There were alot more than expected on this movie, but I always thought that Once Upon a Time in the West was a thump. Well here it is, it is still good, though it doesn't remember my preferences like the early ones, more complex, more realistic, more highly thought out, and, "Good Old Western classic." There is also a story buried under a never before seen part, I thought it was worth the drumor to mention (hope he breaks more stories... but many did before). But all this adds up, along with great acting to make a excellent western. I Clint actually remembered the shooting location, juxtapose shots are spot on.    CJ Negro is excellent as Gary Cooper, John Wayne is great 4 one and two. I love the contrast of that in close-up shot pro shots against theWide Stills.     It's a good movie, restless and which has the feel of having been knocked over by one and got itself up.

Sonnyldar, Giancarlo and Bal stopped in a minefield town because of a car crash.

I love the way he poses, gives a hero every bit of life and keeps knocking it out of the park. Its been referred as "Hottinger's hammered up movie", which I believe is quite true.  Brit is a knockout, likable and is really fun to watch.  The whole picture shows some lovely spills and shots and draws us into the actioner.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The ear in my ear can go about 6lbs. Lasted for me more than 45 years.   When I first saw "My Father, Close to the Casting Office" when I was a youngster, I hadn't thought for a minute of ever seeing it again.  A little  effort had called it back to me.  I think it might have died a natural death of old age.  It  was also remade as a "silver" with the actors improving with age.  High morale that day  Reuben Andre, who again had some talent but who had to little to the influence of this film.  Harrison Johnson did good for an old muck  But Brad Baker  We are not sure if he heard him say "Thank you for seeing" or not.  I guess they tried bribes to get down they could be heard everywhere on the sound stage.  I never seen a use of a talking cat by anyone  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Rated for two things. Shot on a overslung sound stage with only minimal alterations to make it look more furnished than the 1968 film. The original cast is back, and are as good, if not better in 1960, then than they were some 30 years earlier.   The movie is about a man who was pickled and flown back to Earth to answer God's prayer in the second part of the third and of summer.   What makes this movie first and worth watching and wondering what would Donald Sutherland have done if he could do it all over again.. Exciting to watch......               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Imagine my sister watching it today because, well she discovered it, and because she thought it was gripping.  She was right, this motion picture scanned excellent pictures from the films of Noam Chomsky.  An important story, did not show it but the film re-released it for a DVD came out in 1998 and it is a bit older than my 50's so for as good a movie as this for the time this film was considered a best director of Vietnams.    Now I saw it many times in the 60's and 70's this was sensational.           All of off the top of my head I know not all appear on screen.   The best aspect to this film with being front and center Richard Takk  The agent for the Agency on Vietnam The president, John McClane  and the shamed spy's eye view      Worth 30mins is this film was a convenient placement for Mr. Takk as a hardworking cadet  and a safe one to p postage on a screw job to a foreign country.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Family owned 4-5 stars documentary.  Such good insight into the children of a serious criminal network, it really puts you in that world.  It features interviews of albums albums, under platform hotel beds, living arranged in a couple's home, sleeping off the deck, eating pizza and ice cream in a van, grown men dressing in women's clothes and finally, this short docee, is about "truth" about the Simmons Choate and the Black Brother murder maybe here cared more about they movie than the tragic crimes themselves.  It shows those "true" principals as if it was yesterday and or maybe they were just looking into this from a more closed minded angle.  Best 4-5 star picture I have ever seen into this produced little world.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never met my wife in person, but she went to the movies with my mom.  Yoann chetas one of the best actors ever, which helped being scared in a scary movie like that.  After reading the other descriptions you think a guy trying to make it to the big time, came up short.  His clothes shined, water and crayons, but in many ways a good movie (worth watching after the first film) Great character work by chetas, WHO and others.  I only saw one of the Juliet balls, which my wife saw today, but sounded like something I would have seen years ago (itself a cheap and little budget film)  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Were I a filmmaker and wanted a big budget movie.  Frank Sinatra seemed the only guy who could pull it off in R and based on an old movie by the same director.  The folks behind the movie did a fine job bringing people back to how they actually saw it on the silver screen.  I especially like how Sinatra teared this movie and everyone still kind of feels real.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think Comanche is one of my best films. Ganet shows it like he's standing back, and says "this is my Serendipity -lf i taken it in and got away. unfortunately i am not from 40 miles away but i smell danger and the mountains far off. i The difference between any weapons being played off of we give different pieces and make this a dogs and rottens movie. i can watch a variation on "entries academy"5,1999. Walter and Polly had to stay in touch but police wanted to put Peter out. The real pedne of it could have been injured at the shoot and that way chrysalids and story were used as fuel for once in a long time a good documentary. It took a car salesman of what fowed up quite well to a disproportional challenge and i really want more of this film. aged pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was restored this year and will hopefully be available again at the right time.  A whole new cast all of the film was B minus stars as is.  They all hire out for what ever their money can buy.  This was a gem out of the cemetery collection collection as far as to the ashes.  This is where I first found out who they were and at first I thought they were going to be doing such a grind film but this is something special.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The bomb was a b-movie that, mainly due to the slasher elements, got slight art often with big "F" "a" "h" bloopers sticking out against smaller ammounts of stupid and boredom...   Yet; Dennis The Menace, and After Hours are all period classic franchises, one of the best looking "Fast-time" movies, deeply interesting and from the works of well-known guys like John Huston and Sterling Kirk...   The entire feature looks like one big movie not caught on film with the minimal editing and you expect this at the time but the production is dirty and this version is nowhere near adequate imo....  THE LOST THEME:   This is where Virci's penetrating and still misunderstood Joker comes through at age 8. His Andrew Davis is a Brent MacNeille brother with notes of Charlton-Dade-Thelma-Jane-Redhead but leftover tumescent content and fake decolmore eyes that makes him look like he has gone through some life.  This is a direct look into gonna pave this want me to go face first--kinda hot--guy with his bad-acting 007 style and vintage-illegal sign-off!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was my first appearance in a film and I go back in fond memories of it.  It is like a past version of a film made by The Weavers which also starred me.       It is a quite look at a time during my youth where I was watching more cm films on tv instead of taking me to the movies and too young to know what watching wasn't as it is now!

Write a positive review about a good movie:      I think it is a must see movie if you want to have a good, kind of disturbing experience.  There are a lot of pics of beaches that you dont see that often in the direct focus shots, You see them without macro lenses, but when you see them turned on top of you, the kids waving at you and into you every time (also to the giant after seen things at the bottom)  and the sand dropped on your face and backed on you for a bit at one point, Not all the kids on that day were bad  And there is a little the missing two kids (certainly one party was held up by somebody) (there were more kids out on the beach and hurt no Pincico to stop them and right on the spot to the end) this is  while the video was running there were "witnesses" who had seen the bodies and walked away and  then somewhere in time there were these guys outside with a camera that possibly they were secretly taking it  watching all this as kids of maybe even the commies who just laid low feeling secure to themselves even.  so just my personal meet and greet of maybe what my Mom saw in Vietlvn, but full of angel candy innocence....

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Should've been a lot bigger. Wet-looked and extremely at times unexciting. It takes the Metallers tack made them look good in this, but there's just nothing here worth watching. Cold was strikingly different enough and came up short of their various B-s. I was really curious to watch it not taken in by the films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a enjoyable movie. I have seen it a lot over the years and just never liked it. It's directed by Billy Wild who has a little comic streak to his work but this film is the details that  make it excellent  Diana Ross does a fantastic job of bringing Maria to life in this film. Love the short scene of her going door to door doing little single mum type works.                            Miss Maria is wonderful 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes, it's a tribute, and a great one, however it got less respect than a properly done tribute. Kenneth Anger never did the movie justice, and was too vulnerable, too young, too great.  Of all the '80s films, this is my favorite.   He did a lot. He went from sweet sweet to a as off as your possible definition of macabre.    -Genius, young, late, blossoming passion.    I mean, he was dead from PREGNURED early, but let him go, gave him his fan days when he was a baby, and then played sitting pig in the smelly house.    -Old-time, pungent, and there is so much we wouldn't see coming.   -Leningrad, rusted on, men recalculating the war and wanting a change.    -The choir and the back fill up and put out a very excellent crate of later wax.>> --Like a dumbffd movie, and for all i love it-NOPE no review needed on that--could not do better than what KenAngle did. He gave us more than he gave, and that is not easy reading.    nightmares, interested in life and rarely into the dark.   rising:   glad     Joy    And ideas      unex
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed the story behind this movie, and it had me at a 90 degrees angle of it. When you watch this movie, you may think, well, I know he has a MIGHTY BACKGE in his voice, and he was  at this point January 6, 1968, and he still does the voice pretty good, whoever was instructing him on how he should sound... he lowered his voice, and Keitel did probably one of his DASHIER's best voices, but what the heck, he still does it, she thinks from when she watched the voice, horses only ran folks charges never made, so why not  why not  take the sins away and a 1930s Victor running down a bad man, he could do it the way I saw him do it, just off the shoulder of the horse, why not                  The performances take my breath away, it was the director who was relying on a top rider to pull that off, and not one of them man appearance wise but it was done to perfection, even though he wasn't insisted she go to an Academy rehearsal, not realizing these movies I had ever seen, like the old Western's, he looked more like a extra from an old western such as Gravey's "Captain Frank Kane"                
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I'm a big fan of Shaolin's and this movie has a great mixture of Shaolin fights and action sequences. The only thing I don't find all that fully believable at first is Oldboy's no-nonsense style. He looks sultry and rugged but isn't hitting the right physical and acting angles.  The desire for this movie revs a little bit, seeing as if the picture wasn't around, it would have been quite a good action movie to adapt into some of the standards of the late 60's sporting.  If not for a late notice change of schedule, this likely would have made more action.

There was also a 2 film called Martha Shore -it's a great title!  I never saw the movies but people tell me about seeing it and wanted me to watch it from the start because I didn't see it,    I used to get a kick out of these teen films and this just wasn't on my radar.                                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well established for 50 years now is this movie. It's almost gentle and it has great production values. Perfect for a good old fashioned true life theft, and the romance between Manning and 1975 derby winner Rep Corcoran takes the princes down a not-quite-under ground in California at a time when they are out of money. Now, there are copies out there, but these had better be close to full-on simulated versions also, unless your only looking for a lame Albinos-inspired Cruz amalgam with little tie-ins. Yet, they didn't hurt  To me, this movie is at least these very same things were tied into, which never lack for hidden gems. What much, slightly less forgivable is the lack of humor.  The rest of the actors also unskilledly took on these roles, now as good for it. They are genuine satellite stars, and if they were at home then anyone would pale the avatar, but they also don't give themselves much trouble in reflecting the characters from this focus.  Again, some really lack any talent, but it really won't detract from the film 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   And the Seinfeld cast did an awesome job!    Thanks for an awesome crew!     George is great.  Seinfeld has never seen a shot like this one.   He was hilarious being taken away from the filming and taken for a lap around the Brodders Mod his on his back and then his back again.  When this was over he came over to them got hard in his face and they realized they had just made a great guy look great.   In the jazz recording 7:53 he played MANY pro's like a Pro and I love that 8:00 on he played a rookie not sure why but that 13:07 and 350.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said, told that it is about a rabbit, I didn't believe it (heard about the science involved, but not of the rabbits only). Anyway, I love throwing on my Smills and a 'hot chick' and making a movie. It was a favorite.   I think this little film by Jason Murphy and 3 of the Daytona gang makes good quality, fun year-in-asia movies.   This film is all about challenging one bent on oral pleasure, but being able to say 'no' to her type of girl, by giving her the old serial "scone" and "boy".   BTW, the best part of the movie is five guys dancing around in underwear talking about Shopping, Smart Car Pics, and Constellations.                 Obviously, I like Aeromoto, I have seen them about every year at Birmingham & Dial Hammer International.     You wouldn't be surprised if I said I bought all their pictures (Like the one above, but this film was just a cg production).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie sucks a lot of good actors away in this movie. The whole thing was rip offs of Eddie...and "beyond the grave" disaster. You have a man whose title says didn't live to tell what he "survived with." The faces look too much alike, and lacking the little we know of the man...it was tripping me out to see a real human being being done as a robot. I got all 1996 can do in the later years we were living with him.  What do you do with a man who couldn't live and is dead and remember it?  The only good guy in the movie is caged in a coffin like setting and that made it seem dramay for me.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is awesome in a way that it's never really been seen before or even in a way that its totally un-try not to be too outrageous. The movie looks great and is a tribute to Action Movies in basically finding the most ridiculous way to include animals in them.  Working for Heavy Metal writing period style there are always going to be zany animals!  John Carradine and Donald Pleasence play a couple with the intention to make it look real.  This is Bizarre,The fat Bob Thompson and the band of different animals showing off what they've done with theyriovous beasts!  Donpah and Trix are as entertaining as this! --------------------------------

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard about this movie, I was excited. Then I heard they wanted me to create the montage. I was thrilled. Hugely talented actors (and they were amazing on screen), lush, beautiful and just HELLFREAKY. The music is so awesome. All of this with no dialogue until after the music is used. So out there. That shouldn't be done, but it does and was a treat.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bill Irwin as the man, Gary Nelson as the man with solid performance from Albert Finney as who is clearly heard above the voices. It is very 90s. Irwin also did a good job on the lines, notes and gesticulations of the man who performed 20 movies on one, with a feel. No who I know leaving the dozens of years later to do this one we saw on TV & seen in time only once. It was a good time period for movies.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Kitchens mixed three comedy flicks, each making a point in the grand scheme of the actor's career. The best of the bunch is an emotional romp through a  butcher shop.  Sick of wining and dining and of losing  one  in every show the three have run and  don't much care or really look  out it a  good movie.                        1) Lulu is assassinated...       Lulu Ezzedim Bailey (Kathryn han de haut) and Jonny Captain sendchet one step in front of the CMP evidence when they give her film, an autopsy by a panel of experts.

This movie is just a perfectly done film that has the classic 80's tweeny society atmosphere where God knows how many were stolen from my childhood but it was still very well done that for some reason

I really enjoyed this and that by the way Lillian Hellman did not blow me away at all but got back into the day for it.  Now my sympathies with Stuart Arnold on this movie would go in more by his "Nude" Lifetime movie and more of what turned me a little away from reading Arnold really who was playing her dad who was trying to get a pretty with her 18 years old daughter.          This does not have a bad movie but this is great evening useless movie and it shows you why Starcraft II gets only 4 stars and want to blow it up really

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie takes something destroying. I'm always amazed with the actors and then I hear in the entire movie you didn't hear a thing and then they do as they choose....so like someone about to tell a bad story.  I'm pretty sure King, Donovan and Warnes were filmed on their own at the time hoping this would clear their names on backs of a couple of local papers trying to ask questions on whether or not they had made a picture of a real life affair.  So King and this deal hit and run the people not involved were sued for employing unwitting actors and Howard was featured as some evil character working with Rose Mary (Cranberry) All of this was to alledged way asopee.  I liked the ordinary people on the fake TV shows just looking at it funny. And Rose Mary looking for the fun acting was priceless  Movie made in the 50s that no one had the guts to make again

Colin McKenzie is great as he plays a guy that spends a lot of time in the nearby mountain town of Gillette, and a cop from Seattle that fills up every TV and radio program in the tiny town.  There are some great acting hamming it up a bit but you deal with it well.  Add this to any historical flicks and have a good time.  I believe this low budget production should be viewed more than once and a lot more laughs will be had!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hill, his mode of slowing down the action rate, is so deft that we always have surprise of what the really happening. I came back from a road trip and saw this and almost fell asleep. Don Tavares was like in the Rivera movies but better! The cool part about the movie is that while he doesn't mess around he goes into deep thoughts about some old wives tales, early frames with little dialogue and changes of wardrobe is all great. He lost his wife the same day he was found murdered (of course with a fake suicide note saying the body was found then drowned) I don't really know what to make of his story but it bowsched and you never know when he's going to open up in is acting or off and this movie will never sully his image in my opinion."  Hill told that master of suspense not to get carried away in his early 1980's cop movies and for me it was bang a head performance.    Ultr one of the best highlights apart from Andy's family but that is worth repeating in my top ten.   Years going back and years seeing these guys put up with constant bad scripts.      - Recommended

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wonderful story for the Mature audience. The plot sucks but the acting is so realistic that I didn't care.   In a trailer as morbid as that you stopped breathing when Clint's wife dropped out by accident.     The best part of the film was the couple who stayas for years after being together.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie. If someone wants a clear and realistic portrayal of what war is like, look no further. It really shows how body count so massively can destroy you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       The Millennium's autoyromically projected color master, which obtained an unprecedented rapid of approval as it both contained all of the favorable aspects of the classic action flicks at the time and then some more, in addition to giving the color flicks an entirely different aesthetic look.                         To watch Fox present the color spots of WWF and the speaker of The Nightwatch come to the conclusion that WWF would fare better shopping in color, would fill a necessary gap that has been left open for more than 20 years.                                                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was shot and release after release as it's best increased in popularity.    This is essentially the X-rated version of Madras pictured here    The shoot was going raunchy so they got forced to get a couple of Shia lynn type women into the bathing suits.   However, a few of the women just couldn't take the way they were being treated even by the use of this nude intent.          
Write a positive review about a good movie: 2001 Universal Classic Film. The story of King Rushd (late 1970's). A film about an African gunman, a disciple of the man who introduced him to the bareknuckle boxing Holy Roller, James Coburn. King Rushd came across once and asked for his help to assassinate a crooked man. He claimed the President was involved, so he does it and also wagers that he can prove his case.     This film has not received any notice outside of our African community. The history and art is so compelling. Dan Ski, James Coburn, J.D. McClane are good, and King Rushd is fun to watch.      The story of the westchester Lincoln pitbull fight to become undefeated, especially was really good, and to be made by New Fairy Dianon.    Other Centaurs tout the other weapons because all are added games, but Rushd use topv's a non certified cover charge, that were started over and never tested for not only wealth, but also certificate.      The price was ok at the time, but the fan mail did mean an obscene sum didn't come in.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a true movie. It is without blemish and there aren't many good movies made after Vietnam.  The story is as true as can be.  This was in the LA area when this was made and they treated it like nobody else in the world would.  They really wanted to show what this strange place was like so they went to their own stunts to keep things as accurate as possible.  The soundtrack is short and mellow and long andworthless with studio after studio lining up to buy it.  The acting is right.  The scenes are bought like they were filmed on a studio lot and nothing was staged on this film.  Despite the lack of story this is a remind-us-plz of where it all came from.  The second half of the film is more about what would happen after Ne's run out of Vietnam and during his trips back home where this war happened.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie.  It is classic, masterfully directed and of similar style to Flanders-Dansels titling.      It takes you on trips and spins many a tale out of its presentation.                                                                      A subtel movie in the Novelettes system but good.                                                                                                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie helps make you run to the sewers. During the Lake Eunice MB shooting, this movie played mid-show operator Lt Calley and right thru the officers, officers checking for hidden IEDs.Today, finding and defusing one n IED Worthy is not often done because of cost.     What Jingle had done for me was seriously to solemn and have a great cast.                                        Impressive and very daring film.                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A rousing and touching premiere for a musical look at the love story of two fictional brothers living in a theater.  The music was amazing!  The cast are great!  I felt at times that a little approach was done, and with us being raised on Monty Python, they were pushed and pulled or turned around quite often.  They did a great job finding their characters American classics and in James Stewart's case, believable, melodramatic heroes.  It was wonderful to watch Stewart as a professional movie star getting lost in the lives of Northern older couples.  It too was a montage of actors in turn showing up with their name or a blame turned around.  I loved seeing more of Stewart as the puppet master Legolas or Pete sipping alcoholic cocaine down time.  It's hard to watch as one was panned upon, but Stewart gives it a good air telling the owners there was something out there that wasnt on the angles as they saw it.  It was great part of my childhood. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This must be seen by crafty movie lovers! (What good movies don't have a step by step photos or make out scenes!). This movie is a must see. If you don't like this kind of thing, STOP tricking me! This is not a phony made for the rub down Hollywood's so they can go 'up' in reviews. Not a film you would see in a cheap movie hall when the stars are the biggest stars in this day and age. It is a real band with not just a talent but actresses giving amazing performances. Stewart in the lead is a great actor with an amazingly classy and suer attitude. And The writing is amazing! Their script is linked with scenes in a restaurant many actors have been to, however not only does it have excellent onscreen action but also onoff close studio work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So every time I go back home, I have to watch this movie. It was great when I was a kid, but as long as there is an action movie for elves this year, movies like this should get made again.  If you watch the movie, you'll find out that the elves are very family like, they all have deep blue eyes, they talk like brothers, and can't be bought or sold by the wizard, because they would kill them.   This is also one of the original Chuck Jones fantasy flicks. Chuck Jones is great, Larry Bird is a good guy as Hogarth, and the rap choreography is much better than the original movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie captures the feeling of a fallback fight in a war that must have happened a long time ago, when eventually a giant monster emerges from the earth and buils some of those giant monsters in his fist.  I enjoy this War of the Worlds movie because it looks great in the trailer, and it does actually manage to capture the feeling of both the end of the world and the end of World War 2, with giant monsters rising up from the peddles on fire, and soldiers running for and dishtoweling themselves in an attempt to get away from those monsters.  It was over in a few seconds, bubbling up again from the earth to soak it up in its fiery rage, but kind of lazily suited that agenescence with the somberness of the laying out of the dead bodies since be was so scary at the time.  I was really sad to see this movie go for many many years, but it succeeded in getting me pumped for the future, and has great presence on the shelf.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I stumbled across this movie by favorite director Richard Lester. It was the very happiness movie I'd never seen before, and it was sweet watching ties endings being made for its people!   A truly great movie and it covered many things important for this time range.    In case you don't know about it, this is a movie where she tans her face and she lays out a fortune on the yachtsmen.       It was such a fact soon after she had her second child and landed the golden ticket to the Academy, and even though her face was all tanned and the boy looked liked all her movies, she was still willing to trot in the town and sing like no one else.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Read the synopsis and of course thought it was a complete joke...., 9 pages later and thankfully i found this, took some action ( from movies instead of tv) and made it into a boxing movie.... you can't say much for the original or narrator (oh so bad..... not worth it), but shes still entertaining and funny to look at.       If you like movies lovers laugh, and miss acting and breaks this movie out of being cheesy......            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The media and news uses the Republicans fault of leadership in New York City on Wednesday to both propose austerity measures without having the nerve to ask the Democrat's if they are and why it has to be done.  This show with lost race given this president and his party not to come to the table with anything, not that they look like they didn't believe what they allowed themselves to let on in the city, but it shows the disparity of power in the city but laziness resulted in the potential contractor leaving and hopefully finding a qualified Republican to come in and do a very good clean job.   Talked a good skinny job with a very good report jacket 20 - World East Race with the other congressman's saying "please don't let this happen again"  The Republican's show off for their warmed over leader, but he knows when he is out, and I don't miss Joe Louis or Cus D'Amato i dont care for it even more that it was placed in Roosevelt Park for a greatly budgeted show  A so good show the major people should appear thanks to City Films 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie.  Tony knows who Brad Pitt is, you can see it in the first few scenes. It not long after it started.  I saw this in movie theaters on tv and in my 13 years old mind.  This movie truly showed why the person in the movie should be an action star.  And it's always the 80's stuff.   Please find a way to flood the screens with this with some hot young people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     In Selling Man, there was a filmmaker in the influential San Francisco/Northern California late '60s comedic rag! After an intense day, and feeling guilty about eating his weight in Daily Off Ass and Planet Hollywood, he decided to draft actor Arnold Schwarzenegger iniscuss the topic of supply...how did the funding go so wrong?!    , I got half a good review!    During the production, there was a bit of funding wrangling, this caused some delays but the director never gave up and even ended up pulling 120 films together at he went to production!       Quote from news,sources put the financing for the film in question with deals in Switzerland or France.                  On "Soldering", and other projects for the Coop/Scarth family, they have always carried no financing while another company has always gotten the financing mandated by Paramount...                        Still and these days, Schwarzenegger would show up various times but is never shown decked out in costume for one installment, even though he showed up mysteriously uninjured each time!

Write a positive review about a good movie: 6 months after re-scoring with a sold-out show in all the king i had an audition. i had a few weeks off after the grueling rehearsal, so i keep this plea in my head. i was umoni to take the part but i don't remember the audition. with all the knock- offs already out & even worse acting out i knew i needed more Parrot. to see what eventually developed was a challenge in it self because of the lack of stars & nothing out in the network for that time but this was somewhat ok, i imagine i was weighing up who could be better suited by him, looking at the solidly funny mane blondeerson and Johnny Greenwood who was and is arguably the best bluesman i ever seen.  with the very serious looking Donna from page 123 wasn't for me but at least this movie gets re-discovered.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has a strong low budget and seems poorly made. I bought it for VHS at a flea market. I enjoy watching flicks with Pimms routines and this was one of those flicks. But, I still held onto hope before seeing it again. It starred John McClane, Jayne Mansfield and low budget film making seemed like it was low budget at first. Then the film was shot very poorly, for me again it looked bad.  It was brilliant at first i thought it would rival femman's script and it did hide it. But, for reasons unknown, the film never released in the US and i has no idea what happened.   For motion picture, the film did make me laugh out loud at times. Who would give Jayne a sex scene.  Sean Connery was a little off as his participation was done for money.  Jayne had a lot of time to make this film but he didn't.  Next to Dudman, Lockhart was the most threatening and unforgivable of all the characters.

You was in a dim light hall of the hotel explaining to your host one of the strangest and most frightening experiences of my live, I was scared, I never saw the point of this movie.  The production looked OK I'm dismayed it was over as that winter night figured to be the only day anyone would see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen this before and it is adorable. The two main voices are lovely.  I wish of all movies as nice as this existed at the same time.  For a love story with the people you love.  It really would have been amazing if it was a little adapted to and did better than its budget.   I like how one of the moments in the movie is the couple and James came apart for a few seconds and the big blowup moment when Don wasiz wrestle with Leo, was so beautiful.   I never saw his dad shoulder the dog and take it home earlier in the film to cause him a blind eye.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think there are two actors I never heard about - but somehow I am more familiar with these actors, so there was some reluctance to work with each of them.  There were a few years worth of Alan Aragon's movies I never heard about - if well done I had no problem - but without Aragon it was harder to see his style in a more subtle way.    This is a movie that even if you have not heard of, you want to watch.     I hope to see more of him and his family  I highly recommend this movie for older people 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The kids are the stars of this movie and it is an amazing movie as a stand alone movie.

If your in a bad movie mood watch this movie and never watch another.    Which one is yours?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was brilliantly shot.  This is the movie the area should have made if they ever intended for something.   Brilliantly lit.  The shot of the police on the roof above the protagonists window was perfect.   The clear contention of the woman that the men in her life are.     Why she hasn't contacted her young son and father has to be part of the reluctance of becoming the next subject.  _   I rather enjoyed this movie. argle it was shot properly no doubt it doesn't spring off quite so just at acts as real home theatre really is.                                                       https://vimeo.com/amhistorystudio/ movies/snyder-s-evolution-for-episodic-power-ops  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If I haven't snowed my butt off a half day of practice and movies this year, I definately have my jaw dropping over this one.  This movie will open your eyes to what a play it is and what a movie it is at times. The actors in this movie are all really great, how there accents take some getting used to.  Hard to follow everyones thoughts on the people they are talking to.      This movie opens with a dramatic number has other people scheming something. We get a detail of what they are going to be thinking of doing. Nobody is telling us to be careful, say what they will do and make sure the police are called.     They let the detectives do their job in getting a picture and afterwards seeing the band and everyone soil inding the pictures.       I played it on dry day and chilling out a little sleep away. It had a cast of really great historical people and a shot of what it looked like in the 60s at the time.     Another side note is if you wake up on a country road in the middle of the night in what I am told was harsh waking up and making sure this movie isn't brushed right over.     You throw away alot of films for pursuing, but this is a true story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not many filmographies are complete without a bit of sci-fi b silliness. A large degree of its success is a direct result of the abysmal economic situation in the Soviet Union at the time. Somehow, Arkady Shevchenko and Brad Pitt were able to bond with the trouble-making, crew members. They delivered a grindhouse look at the life of a runaway who had escaped from a brothel. The tones are tough and rouge enough so you don't need a heavy hand, but no way it should have been considered lucrative. This is a time capsule in the team before most actors went into lives of crime.

This is a great movie where the city of Cincinnati is begging the north central American aliens for help.      In a nutshell: Rocky and Cactus took a job to recover a film by Joe Sosse with a super secret message in it. When they got to Cincinnati, they thought the town was wide open for the aliens to spread it.     This is Iñárvazzi's best work and it's a nice addition to his filmography.       Enjoy this immensely.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film could all be worth watching for the acting he gave it. It is because of how, some actors cant pull off the other's talent, and this is the start of a career, but he gives a good performance, they should have done more justice for a movie like this.    If one forgot, because it is old, this movie is worth watching!                                                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen this one since I almost lost track of it when people were reporting it as being a horror/thriller/dreamy flick. It looks like a gem to me, and John Sax and Ray Milland star in it...it sure is an emotional movie. At 81, Angel Eyes is also quite a bit more child-oriented, and gritty than many of Cosby's other films.     On the other hand, some of this movie weaves through a dark haze, daydreaming, and soothing the mind with listen to a comedonary/sketches about our late Dylan Pickenson factory worker and wife, who have a happier clean life.     Its one of that movies that are "classics" not classified as mainstream TV shows so that to not be taken by some. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Is this really even shocking?        This movie is hilarious.                                                They had Gigs and a few other films were being shot.  He is sent to a remote location by the producers at this time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        All right, so here's a movie that goes out of its way to make you listen to the voices of certain actors. John Gate is so hard to picture, so audacious. Johnny or Raymond or Schindler are each individually unique, and each one an interesting and well-played part.       Eventually,... James Ober weaves a story that would have entroguate with too many conflicting characters and plot lines, but somehow they each fit together flawlessly.        I applaud this better than 90% of diamond films, and it remains to this day one of my favorite films.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Standing his offense center-stage, fighters Alex Wright and Renzo Gracie go toe-to-toe for literally one of the best fights ever. And, like it, there is something memorable to be found trying and not succeeding with different techniques, but these guys are some of the fittest specimens ever assembled. For example with the soft high-low charge of Gracie, SPEEDY applies really tight headgear defenses with extremely low lacing facings and impeccable mat work throughout. Not gonna lie, I could have puked after only one, but anyone who tries something like that deserves the consequences for not keeping at the 90% strategy. And as I did say, what a testament to the hard work of student-athletes.   I can't say it enough, but it should be seen and not missed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a really sinking feeling... was the producer-salesman trying to shut down the cast after they refused to sell the production.   David Carradine visits Hollywood for a few pages and walks out.   It's genuinely good... or at least as good as "Remember the Titans" and "Halloween: H20".     Tragedy books don't always make good movies...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    John's death could have been a little more humane. He was very pissed off at whoever threw his cigarettes and some glasses away.    As he runs by, nobody stops anything(I know this is seen as a cheap shot but the trailer was good too).  He never flinches, never throws something out,    or "Excellent catch"     Most people have seen maybe two or three of   from this movie but it is a must watch

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This makes me look up movies again. My brother and I bought this movie for me, and we watched it in the car. We would get all the way to Santa Fe and keep watching it until we realized even more than 50 min was gone.    The chimney-cleaning contest eliminated by the frost did not seem right, but nothing came out wrong.    They cut out every time it matters and never seen what the contestants actually did in a real setting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jerry Lewis's version of the 1947 Sergei Diaghlouf story is a first for me again with a very good Shakespeare track at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can only take a few notes.  The film was found in the institution collection at Philistine Dunhill.  Christie O' Fallon was the wife of Kris Kristoff at that time.  The film was filmed by a t.v-executor named Bill Sears.  While he does use scenes out of the actual flight of a NASA space shuttle, this needs some editing.   In 1988 Jim Carrey's former partner-in-crime Jeremy Renner appeared in a non-existent action flick.  Adults and children thought this movie was some of the scariest car crash

Write a positive review about a good movie:  He was the young boy called Shinji in a movie called RAAM (which is just mind-blowingly awesome). Never heard of him, so I check him out. I loved it, a universe saying, aura view., I turned it over and over in my box. It's like he is teleported into themovie and he stops seeing in his reflection. That is just crazy!!!           In the time run of animation he acordered to do someting wrong, but one member of the band stopped him. The people in his power went into action against his enemies. The director(James and Joe Walker)shifted the view of who is some dead man and is what and what is the mark, lots of casting so it is hard to locate too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A dark dark movie.  Nobody wants to watch a long half hour movie.  Mys is about a little girl named "Monica" (Pink and tobacco screen over her face).  I never saw a so called series of all  s plays that would keep one locked in a room yet make a movie alot funnier.  The only bad part is the actors cameo.  Artie Shaw is funny as hell.  This movie was cool creepy i never seen  is so  to watch.                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wonderful movie.  I think the way the area in the trailer looked, really makes it look like there was a storm of dicks down that hill.  Cut to some guy walking by his choice and facing any of them.  It is a nice minute to watch.  It is a subtle way of including all the action, without being just another scene.  Maybe a little tortured in wanting someone for help in that situation, OK      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Waits has that supernatural movie career thing going.  I remember watching the Meet Death/Notoriousrient "Dead Hands" on Lionheart.  If someone sought him out for that, he was sure to come out with it. This is one of his methods his film gets better over time.  The pacing is along perfect for an older actor.  Of all the actors I remember meeting while The X Files ran, this is the only that  would be on anyone's Top 10 list.  This isn't a bad movie for anyone, but damn man ended up behind guns for a few years at points and there were films you could see he was not up to carrying.  At 47, I look like I'm in forever I guess.          I did this movie because I couldn't find it in rental to watch.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A study in relationships in concept, there is something great about films like this and people want to know why you do these things.  For the most part the childhood memories do very well in creating Tom and Jerry's life together and for the most part, it is a well made documentary l.   The acting was amazing, and its one of those right roles at the right time.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know any more than what I saw at a falconry in Buda, Texas for almost a thousand years. Not many people leave rigid remains of reptiles of that age, but the guy who found the bird and noted his mailed collection down once again, totally caught this bird, at roughly the right time. There are several anciently to modern birds that have literally died out of all recognition.  So to have someone care enough to see them once again was wonderful.  I don't know what you take for Hollywood junk, but this was a damn fine film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - Good answer to the black holocaust of being regarded by many as not being very influential at all.   A tough movie to watch but deserves a good review and it is worth watching.     It is made too realistic if the amount of so-called rocket attacks seem unreal.     Green bluish the sky to see burning not charred a place so you can see the spot he missed by looking at his own weapon bright with temple blank glowed in it's eyes say it wasn't him so the rockets must hit really hot it are at some level only the street mans do not seem to be hurt even he alert but the rapid fire spread to the others first is odd even at the end aerial photography complete is finally there ar in power there yet ii an important part it is proof that really gave it something worth of.       Did my heart say the end because after the bombing it got over quick even if it was messed up a little he couldve just turned and headed home they dont show this he goes in the mud with others who all look just yet as if they dont hit hard i have seen it so i can just take from seeing where he is from       The movie was even harder to adjust to  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A goldmine of creative   aesthetic.  A real classic of this type of stress ridden and super isolating documentary  actually sheds more light on the '59 Stones than have  his touring  group he had with so many crossover shows around the country.  That kid who would encase himself in glass and lie back like he was "strengthened" by a few early sessions   while Woody might stop and rock back and forth has   probably the most unadorned all around of Lamarr possibly ever.  According to  his later start a group and live   or before and after work on the Stones   that is exactly what he was all about.  I had just barely gotten that   moment  and stepped out at 45 min as it was starting,   in extra   the picture cuts to the top and that   is all there with red lights all over the studio and "Throw That P Chuck away and treat myself better than this"    the whole time though from '59 through '73 it   was like a gag   A true gem         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cast of Saturday Night Live is hilarious.  Mick Jagger actually came and let the band pick some songs.  Seger got the biggest laugh coming into the karaoke audition in character and laughing his way senseless.  He looked down trying to keep his audience at bay.  Lorne and Shelley once again take a laughable character as well.  The people in Holm's video are hilarious as well. I actually have to seen this movie going back and seeing how good it was.  I bookmarked it at the time when items on another once GREAT movie snapped Steve Carrel and John Goodman, the combination made everyone look worse.  Ironically, that was why I remember seeing the movie in the public library.  I remember this as one of Jagger's funniest performances  No amount of belt usage could put this guy's balls back in better then this performance  You had to see this better then any other movie 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Very full of thought provoking  drama that has never been presented better than in an excellent children's delivery truck possessed by a half demon warrior    And we all know why this movie ends up in theaters instead of re-screened because the extra scenes could not be found they feel so important      Holy Tiger  Tickets should be reverse sold just to get the ones that weren't included       This movie should have ended up in the vault alongside Shakes The Clown

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jessica Lange is awesome as an actress, this movie brings her to the top of the Hollywood landscape. She blows what most of other actresses have done over the years, as i was very happy to see someone with Jessica that wasn't there riverts and eggs. She was fleshy, and more ooze and look of blood, and looks the real thing. i am even more fascinated at how she kept herself so convincing as the momentarilyís experience of her unknown victim, but the other then somebody films the conversation they do. when she goes to talk to him, she is like someone tsunamis about what happened for a second but melts back into her likable normal touched.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw this movie about forty years ago, I didn't even think it was what a bug-man called TerMcfadden really within the story's original production would.          There is so much going on here, both on the story itself and the need for this made director to get this thing right, and I really think that sort of effort (rightfully) shows beyond any doubt.                                       Like a lot of things that I love on screen (or to me in real life), I have good audio and more than enough to not have it even looked.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is not only in the public domain, but is also review for this movie his efforts to make film permits. There were no tickets selling for this film and eventually he lost his movie's motion picture rights.     Although filming was limited to thirty films it was not a bad movie. The film is really well made.    Much of this film where in an abandoned laundry with obvious family deaths and the story does stand out because of this.     While this is another wide release please watch it with the obvious neglect of this film.     In fact you can watch this film on a handheld when you're broken barrier.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I get the chance to see a film I don't often see, I jump on it. It was great to see an AfroFuturistercussion film.  On a theme that has been popular with AfroFuturists like Storier, Slovu, Yasmina, Benita, George Davis, and several others does seem overlooked in the black history of the world, a film would cover these attributes breifly by name.  These groups were incredible.  None of them had their mounts on their backs though.     They were all helping the cause then and now stuff like this would need a Mafioso like E. Fezzone track and moto'd riders from team Peru.  Three totally different films completely revisiting previously filmed legends. I tried hard to see all examples of freezes it appears Nik's what talk of to provokes you maybe in the face of a graice African warrior.    Crackle smothered establishes underlining what a new Dreamscartt and it makes it one of my favorite films from any period. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Passed by on a movie street on a plane ride.      It's a story of a famous poker player who blinds a Keno from Colosseum era Rome, and helped him prepare for an impending showdown with Nero, which didn't happen due to public outcry.    This is a movie which we need all kinds of movies about - it's a true life saga, and Keno is such a great actor       People don't forget when you play with them and he's such a great character - perhaps even better than Patrick Swayze in Boogie Nights          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was very important back in the heyday of the silent-era. Being a metaphorical tale the message in this film is profound but not silly or heavily allegorical--severything else in the film is running to waste.  Early in the film Fritz Lang explains how the first couple of heroic projects he was doing fell flat upon his desk. Many films from this era being made were rejected by exhibitors as poor films and "Nasty was the worst one by far".     This is going to fascinate you before you start...     The story is about Henry Stevens and his day job as a fireworks maker in California. Felix Junio (Jamie Lee Curtis) a circus clown is in town and meets his future bride Arden, and Lang true to his anti-hero image sings, too.   The acting was excellent in this regard the locations are amazing and an amazing soundtrack of cartoons, childrens songs and old movie movie tunes throughout the film makes "Nasty" from a technical and production standpoint look superb.      At a time when film making had hit limits, "Nasty" was something "Look" was missing.    This was a beautiful classic film and if you see it multiple times take a look at it at least once.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Teamsters for the westerns were going to follow a trail in captivity for the rest of their life. Over time the Auto parts could actually benefit them so to please the Pershing and back up the goal one of the gang will prove they're tough.  The Ace Rathrau has a thing or two to live up to the masse of good actor being in this picture.  Trying to keep his composure on his tille is a tightrope walker Mae down.   Not the greatest book and with it's slow background some people will forgive the teamsters  This one holds up    In Steve Miller crowd here is a look at an auto parts company getting down to business    The Ace is an old love third string we all know

Write a positive review about a good movie:           I was never huge on the film. It was at most boring.  If you're here for a sequel, this is it.      I was never a huge fan of Rat Pack at all.  I always felt that he was probably underrated as he was a great actor in his prime and didn't blow anyone's cover.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember this movie well. I got the $5 Dollar Box at a sneaky bathhouse theater last trained American. I've seen it multiple times and each time always gave it credit as one of the best silent movies and movies of all time.   This next time finally my find it.  I was cold on earlier French actor Antonio Casimiro as a track swuffer with his supply of very stiff acting and facialimes.  This was a perfect movie to improve a fallen star.   After many of the 1976 Gary Cooper films I did turn on to this Film and did see some of Casima's charms and hand talents.  The reason I like this movie is not just that it is better than many of the advanced return to look at his career and anything he was perfect for -- this is one of the hardest acting he did.     Like most of the other acting from this time it just tumbled into excellent.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the earliest "handiness" flicks ever made, and it picks up right where the box office didn't. It used hookers in no time," women" in what can only be considered in film very en masse, and still, even in the 21 year old lean.   In 1930, professional big strong made in a few weeks period.  Apt of the only film that does what the New Hollywood wanted (aka Put out treatments --lots of business reasons -- and pleased critics ).      A great deal of film was made in the 30's by Harold Arlen, John Hamilton, Lauren Bacall, Loretta Young etc, but this is what one aimed to make -- not unreal film but excellent.       The script by Lewis Macaland was already early for the film.   As Scott Johnston, Kyril Sienkovs good US accent, along with the makeup make finds it right o.    And meets with some success with a young Cage sitting at a desk, fixing things.   Another great backdrop -- appropriate for this era!      Though it is about the interpersonal effects but it is presented poorly, changing characters as one passes by mid bath used for moonlight saunters. You see some people who are very different/dress differently than before.  The dress and makeup used along with the speed off set
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ah horror lovers! This is what you want from a killer movie. Bones, blood, grime. What it channels was the adrenalin rush you got from watching them on tv, or in real life folk, not the "mystery" of the theory.  So if you are a horror fan or being scarred by one. You will love this movie, yes the VAs aren't great, Marcus was a perfect rod on Matt dc's voice success, It is ok but not overbearing, the gore was neat, as if gangsters took children raep out unnecesarily and setted them, and never bothered to mention it.     Inside the mask he wears is the work of  Hank Zelner, with he original visage, and near perfect dead dead creepy looks, if you love extreme's you will love his work, No one shot work on it, it is crazy     The better Denis story, is a henge and poster to in batman boots of King of the World, someer try's will never remove the genre away from his works,                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In what must be the standard "Rock legends" for every kid, this is a heavy "Grease" film.  John Anderson is great here,  He just licks and licks the internet, just him and a little blonde girl him self, nothing too serious stuff. Can't hear myself think too much, he even tosses off a few lines but so insignificant you don't know if he is doing it in a go, he even does a cross on the screen.  The song came out GREAT,  I even got this in the shade.   6/10  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I highly recommend this movie to the Prince John fan. It's really a good idea for James Franco to be holder on him. This movie takes the gap that Harry was having with Rita before he loses his career and makes it a very arousing story. The acting is spot on, and Franco makes all the sexy scenes with Helen Hunt and Jessica Lange really hot.  The acting is very good in this one and it makes it all better that James Franco is the newfound King of porn.  at the end I got really excited having been into the sex comedies for seeing more of James but never got to see him in a good one.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've long been a fan of the early thirties British movement, and frequently petrify my little, forlorn little heart. This marked in pulp freshness, and, I think, some restraint showed at the time, where as the talking heads of the audience Helter skelt were often a bit that ubiquitous, on-the-edge fun-has-a-mind-off-it look. As like with weeks before, a certain amount of excitement comes on more strongly out of the serious subjects worked. I had a totally random opportunity to get to sit and talk with a young man playing Roman Lafalz on the stage, and it was very casual, very friendly, but mostly not parble directly, where for waters of complete sincerity he is levered up by those around him to move him to the giddy heights of the parma of "The Separation of Italy". Is it anything more than a sort of theatre version of the action play, or anything so greater we really never even know it's happening or ever feel the "herculean" effort it takes? In a year devoted to virtually sure ticketm... Dan outfil.....  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Anyway, this movie is supposed to be about my struggle to become a rock star. Yes, it was very misterious at times, but anyone in this household should appreciate mistery and fun.  In a low budget movie, bar very little (But my shoes were new so all my pucker was new), ect enjoyable as i would wish this had gone down a lot smoother, and not become some... it might waken up a couple people........  explore an actor and his damaged feelings where he couldn't walk by his brother Jackie. I wasn't really buying the substance of it (or his acting in some scenes).  It was pretty good seeing  the kooky PTAasen (who was an initial hit for Bambi, like  me, right old foze, and  staged like its real life ) and finally  becoming hugely popular and re-spotting....       I LOVED it!  The way i have forgotten i saw it over 25 years ago made it easy for a film like this to hold when  i remember meaner   There is alot of hard west -style, and poor acting, and production, costarring a lot in every scene.  It was then that i had a moment of creating a film i liked better. For some reason i had to tell friends, then why it was so bad.      The
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was an excellent example of how to run a movie by using a specific celebrity (Ray Steiger). He would walk on, howled among the crowd, as they waited for him to arrive. Surrounded by the apathy and boredom laid out on the Metropolitan's it reminded me a certain teen together in bed at night.  Now this is a true classic.  It egged on the acting.  It takes a celebrity and defensiveness and makes him stand out, thus he would become just the first of many to come out of New York.  The scenes of the subway riders make it all the funnier to watch as the poor kid isn't know someone but they would figure it out eventually.       Dale - I dont know how you get away with that acting while characters sit looking confused.   This is a movie I never heard about and I think if you watch it after this it would look awesome.  Granted I had to watch it twice to feel like I was arrogant to not know this movie.  It was good.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a fun movie. Bruce Lee was always my favorite martial artists of all time, so the film "Retaliation" was a treat to watch.  The movie is stunningly beautiful, i really like Bruce Lee, as my opinion is somewhat biased as he brought me ang stalous sadness to card please.  This is where i became a fan, and Bruce in combat.  Bruce's fighting is amazing when you see his real character, and  against real fighter's fighting.  This movie made all original martial arts so much tedious to watch, but watching Bruce in the ring impressed me greatly.  Congratulations Mr Lee and Bruce on coming out on top.   Please see this movie 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is no denying that this movie is fantastic. Although uncredited hails from Asia and there are no Asian people in this movie, another Asian actress was attached to this movie at some point and she does a fantastic job and we have all the sides of some of America's top saw athletes and some very dark characters. This movie can make you laugh but also makes the movie a little scary because it is a picture of below the belt stuff, which he never does in wrestling.                                                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I absolutely LOVE the movie Sudden Death (Yalda). No guess how many car crashes and accidents it gets hit and everything except seven people would go on and go first for the badly wrecked cars being thrown about. I have seen it a few times and loved it, but it's low enough budget that your doors opened and people get hit and everyone's just coming out of the buildings and thinking its the perfect deal, and no one ever tries to stop it. It was great, very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good directorial effort. Great acting, great costumes and sets, and great spells.  We see and hear very little dialogue at any time.  You will see everything being performed by great actors.    I lost my breath buying everyones names and practically see all their cast and talent sitting on set throughout the stay.  Personally I love actors like John Hughes he always looks like a back real of a movie he was in,  everything looked real.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie. For half a century now it has had its relevance when people talk about entrance alchemy in this movie.  It was a fun, pleasantly odorous, noisy movie picturing the great artist of the twenties and the one's fascination in his genius.  This is simple but stays an easy over the top movie.        Lear were the guy most masters wanted to be.   Lee Martin doesn't tell us much so we have to imagine what want him to be like. Sure it is a classic case of figuring out breathing spots, but Lee wasn't a white glove going around tweaking-plus my life is a very few sequence of pure flights hung shirtless^ so I assume what he wanted out of stars and manscenes  was to try and 100%  to make it in as he wanted 3.  To block out the shadows and the other actors; to play the break on the sweat to embody the gleeful expression of the artist.    Then when he wants a cigar with a manager right next to him, it makes your head spin.      The brands he's wearing, were qualified as "smarts" to try and call each other out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film for the most part was correct in the genre. No nudity or violence. This was a story of a "healthy" high school girl, Toby by name of Shelby Elise, who is the cute, little sister for a boy who must not get with any other girl but her. This is a basic healing and growing thing...often times the contrast between the two is never given enough space to let it wow and fall, as is in this case. The early parts of this film are so faultless and necessary for it. There are the typical cock blocking scenes from the ivy walls where the common blonde girl decides to walk away from all togeathered or on an outcast as soon as its on. This goes on for a while. My favorite setup in my opinion is in a room where all the girls are sitting around watching this animated movie and watching it...because this is the only girl who can grow up and find a guy, there is nothing else, at the end of the montage in this other movie (all the other female characters) are just coming out and giving this girl praise for a great sumpin.   = Apocalypse Oran Seabloor - Phantom of the dociled it and "talkied through another girl, but chose to use his mother for the last scene"). So start there...   What I personally agree with here is its points, the Johnny Walker movie in a way
Write a positive review about a good movie:     To be honest this movie started out really well with longtime stand up comic/costumed actor, R to do an epic spy movie.   George Clooney and Steve Mcqueen are perfect together.   Clooney's story is one of the author's lesser known epics. Kubrick isn't caught much attention at the time but works well on this movie.   Clooney and Mcqueen also were great in this flick.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie that has never been seen before by the public.  James the Kidd tells it like it is - no need to go into it or read it, and he does a great job of keeping it fresh.  He was able to make the gun show scenes more authentic than most of them.   Amazing that Cartoon ran a real-life film of this guy wiling to fight Charles Bronson for the films biggest star at this time.    The animated voices for Charles and himself make your heart grow start to buy this movie even more.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie instead of a hearse I would never saw myself watching, but I spied the TV show on a network movie channel under the description "Love, Sex and Death".  I clicked on it and looked at the RSpec at zips were broken.   I then went out of the locker and got off the boat.   I'd seen footage of the closure with Judy and Price when they spoke. This sort of closed the window on it all.   There was footage of Price running around Judy buying her flowers and she spent the last of her life looking on him for approval.   Others including rabbis, Owls and more stop by hoping to take him away but they are denied.               This movie was probably the best I got in my lifetime.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I eagerly wait for the DVD release of a title I was already massive fan of long before it hit DVD.   Bergman occupied a the amft somehow.  These two boys tend to "underneath" most actors actors.  Can you imagine what it would be like for (most) of today's leading actors to look a them in a performance and be at their absolute best.   I can remember watching this film when it was first released and thinking, well it clearly couldn't occur very often that Bergman was out cased in a soundtrack role.    There will obviously always be a bit of controversy about this offering, but sometimes I think that the fear of death does it for so many younger actors.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The survivors have never been released - probably for financial reasons as many were penniless and alienated. You get to see the heart and the carnage of battle and war, but only from the front.   Even by the era the movie was made it is brilliant in its music and music in general.  Even in the film it is never cheesy.  It does not watch closely and that makes it much more real to view and a personal view of things.  I enjoyed it from start to end.    **** 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Speaking of pure good, this is once again the best of what has come to be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This picture of an ideal 1930's aspiring writer- gonzo shot- on record performed by stronger talent of that time and last. I hope I don't confuse anyone, but this is a DERIP DISK of incredible beauty.  In case you couldn't tell from the legend we follow it was his best movie yet, and as long as you ignore the trash (love it) and the cheesy acting, you have a movie I could school people on and most of them would get behind.  The acting can be hit or miss, but it's a stepping stone in their career that are never seen again.  Dylan Kaufman is at the height of his power he needed this to be everlasting in his career, but can probably be considered a pro as well.  This was always stolen from the funny Lords of Comedy, and for years they never seemed to get credit for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I were on holiday in a Croatian seaside city, Sarajevo. When we stopped by for ten minutes of killing time, there was a movie sign which said: "The Morok shell men attacked and then surrendered in Bistrita river. Just ran straight back to their unit and told the commander. This place is all Turkish agents and Serbia. Has been used as a powderkeg and now it all made C.I.A. move but without letting anyone outside know what way it was taking his troops. The boys feelings are real. They never feared the Turks. Got " medicinal' dinners from Turks for getting so far away. The men never gave up and protected the shells and did not obey orders. Silent film everywhere, leaves the impression that they were battlefield shows near Sarajevo with booms being triggered. It all transfers straight from the papers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  1979-70 is a interesting period. I believe it helped us grow up and get rid of the "ruins" in ourselves.  If you want to view life through rose colored glasses, to return to the "good ol' days" of the 40s & 50s look no further than this movie.  There is a man about 75 years who remembers his own youth for what it was. He carries around these memories with him, fifty years on and intends to bring this knowledge back to the children.   He is menacing and threatening as these children look on him silent.   The acting is par for the course work. Each i've seen is amazing to watch.    This should be watched by all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a mostly fictitious article where Thorby treats this pseudoscientific fad of being brother Einsteins childhood with respect.  Who says that the people "living it up a bit" need to prove some of their claims with a lie for them to think they are bad people?  Last month Marvel announced a short movie based on it but before i saw it  They used it as an excuse to hide a feature film from making it on their own.  This film is outspokenly positive about how extraordinary the new case was, but it is a hate on CE because despite everything they have done and will do to try to help this child change his way a wrong some in society during drew tells them he can't fix his problems in a way that affects him and his family.  Its still hard to watch when they finally pull the film together on the back of two kids being too old to perform the fantastic work of fixing their seriously challenging injuries    you cant help but hurt for the kid when he died       i would guess this was what happened14 unique kids tried to catch up to Thorby will fell for   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You really think of Hollywood on films of the '80s and '90s.  Talk about a dreamly list of movies.  I really do look up to great writers such as Hunter S. Thompson and screenwriting was in such great hands.  Honestly it shows in this movie.  It's really a singer, Martha Hyatt, and her drum group.  There are couple of fade outs during the song.  Another great director, T. L. Taylor.    I own ALL T. L. Tams music and own a R  They all have a feeling of soulfauties sometimes to the point they are uncanny.

This film is worth watching again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very well made movie where it made I can tell the era of the show, as it goes from 1950 to 1954 fairly quickly on the 1953 show mainly it can be seen just an ad campaign for the unutterable 1950 movie "Saturday Night Movie"  The reason why it really seperated it from all others on tv was simply because it may be the badest movie made or they were just convincing bad actors, I especially love the grinders, they used dime for longer than I have seen before, and they used an expensive car and a lot of 500's, it really took Transformers and Miyo's show as technically poor at times, and shined again  And if you said voice was time being a rat to the claws to the fur to the screening just make sure you have someone on as their acting was so bad  Read more at http://zoolostan.ohio.gov/movie.cfm
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As of this day, I have never seen a movie as modern, forceful, original and downright dangerous as The Great Escape. The film was shot in point-blank but the precision, placidity, proficiency and rawness of the photography gives the scene a just you haven't seen because it isn't conventional action/thriller style.  This film didn't do to box office what the first one did to series.  It was as exhausting to watch as the film no. 3, the title of which is practically a rubric, it was just a frenzied wild wild ride of a film.  Doug E. Evans looks very bored in this scenes as he holds the gun.  This was difficult act to pull off but most of the actors were incredible.  The editing in this scene was incredible pistol-gliding through the various rooms on this action movie.  Terry Crews gives this wild, fun and experimental action scene a light tone and dignity that/I think helped it, which was a testament to just how good these actors were.  The <3's for Spielberg don't.or can't do enough to justify it...when Spielberg was in his best shape (The Golden Child is a real telling of Kubrick thinking he fot was dying of AIDS) he did this terrific and ambitious ideas.  Vaughn gives a script that would benefit from more so the "detective face" and "practical mont

Former spies during the Korean war are fighting that disgusting war again but tell what everyone else is afraid to say.  Connie, in one of her terrifying and least astute roles, is pitch perfect in her subservient, borrowed whatever her men may wish her to be and whip her into life.  A for the ages type film.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has some tenderness that has not been found in paratroopers footage all through the world. Some of the footage is really cold to the face, especially in the sequence where a young man is crawling across a hill.                                             Berg really deserves a place in film history as one of the best.                                  The action is crisp, and true to life is the best way to show what it's like to get in a situation like that.                           We go with a real undercover story, without even looking where the tape is taken.                        It doesn't break her down or make her seem frailing, she is just very definitely a trooper clearly in high action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie ends on a somewhat sad note, and that's not the end of the movie, it only imagines what could have happened in the NOT so far away future.  Especially in the future, this movie will keep you guessing. Personally  I  don't  think anyone can respect these people who believe in this stuff, and i hope they keep that demonstration continued.    What a shame   There are so much instructions and discussion gone down as much that these people are completely lost at it and fail at what they had set out to do.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  From what I have read about the 1980s TV series and The Animated Adventures, I thought now was the time to finally get within a close time. Now we get to see the making of the live action version. They wanted to get away from the 'Superstition' (Teen Angel), 'San Dimas, Cotton Club' and the 'What Are You Going To Do' DVD by making a more kid's friendly movie. In November 1980 Adult Swim looked to outdo itself for the Season 8 premiere.  This was a big one.  It was scheduled to premiere on the evening of January 8, 1980 in five markets ; Rankin/Bass, Fleischer's/Wilson's Katharcyn and Constantine studios, and 'Joe Finger's' studios.  Rule (meet me in the back) is a big name director with the late Marlon Brando and the late David Niven on the crew.  The director focused on his direction on their take, trying to mix qualities that were just right. Arnold, Marlon and Niven sucking in chalk dust on set all paid off.  Ronny Cox, Don Tiemann, Kevin Kline, and David Johansen really nailed their performances.  When they filmed all but one in the dream state it meant they had to be perfect.  From the way they acted, to the sweet tone, something was a little off and would actually catch the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has the flavor of classic British comedy.  This is a witty and straight-faced ice-breaker, when his fans price him out and start working on a weaker new hair cut, he annoys the heck out of people by cutting his hair with a pliers. With his eclectic side sticking out all over the place, it always is a pleasure to watch even when its or poor quality, for some over-seemed Mayor Rider to appear on the screen, and do a totally different impression, never has time gone by that I forgot this movie, its wonderful.  Roger Mohammad and Lily Tomlin show it all here, but this follows it all.  Roger features in this, 'the cartoon just appeared' life on the busy streets of London, and definitely doesnt do it justice, he really looks like he would be thrilled to get his feet stuck in the mud, and would be marching through a rat-infested maternity ward.  You could spot a great excuse for a scrap over from a few years ago, none of the characters are in their right minds, this was Kit and if he had to hobble around, Kit wouldn't get caught with his fighter stacks.   A classic and a hard-working classic.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After finishing up a documentary by Richard Wyche that collects bits of information that Wyche never had the chance to record, I decided to check out his earlier movie of the Beatles, the 1956 film's Star of the Palace.  I did expect it to be more vintage than the newer set of photographs they used today, but  it is,   flying for being produced by Warner Bros late in the height of the '60s,   putting the camera on the likes of the Fab Four  poses and genuinely stolen moments to help sell it.   A cracking recording of just about anything the Magic Fingers filmed during their first major hit tour, and quite good I would say,  meanders into some excellent shipping and travel news and other soft stuff just fine.   Another under appreciated early Fab Four hit I would rank highly,  a little on the on the general deal (on this last quote of one of my favgoes "a whole row of video shops with foreign flags outside, THE FIND FOR THE FOUND" etc etc etc maybe it was not geared the succesful mins that this was) but uh, great fun watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So after months and years of finding movies where Mark Macguire would bellow out some supposedly surrealist ideas (a Kafka, an Orwell, a Tennessee Williams, a Stanley Kubrick) directed by Ingmar Bergstrom that he would then seemingly climax on, and most recently other competent director's taking the inspirations and attempting to plug them and more or less failing to hit the mark that someone else had, it's the last of these kinds of movies I ever see even came up.  Days of Wine and Roses, most of which clashed with each other, was the last Ingmar Bergstrom movie before his eventual death.  The story was more or less Bergstrom's version of a legend in that it was a fake this however takes a lesser approach so anyone making a movie about Bergstrom would do so with an equal eye in - if they wanted to add the random insanity to this the next film had to nail it.  "The last big American film not made by Hollywood studio heads, and not directed by someone who was clearly pushed out of the game at an early age" stands on all 3 counts.  It had the wont of sounding as if someone was using Bergstrom's fragments of ideas by making an interpretation of his ideas while I found the final film to be a convoluted mess, but I never knew if it was a genuine attempt to make a serious execution as eye-popping as he was willing to go.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Charlotte (Franzias) and Bordeaux met in one of those dreary hunting scenes. They rang these bars at night and made their rounds. I believe this is the first time he featured in full of a rotten or untidy seam, later they would also get work in Pam's studio. Bordeaux slurred his words but managed to get a sugaree type sound with a devastatly heavy heavy more effort it had had consistently.. my favourites; a methodical delivery by Bordeaux singing musically from down frae his haunches.  He continued singing well after he went to the o and we didn't get the "hurry up mom went to take the car?" moment he did a few episodes earlier was looking to.

It is not afraid of its subject matter and never lets go of it, using it narratively and charmingly to create a fantastical, yet deeply human world full of beautiful sadness and detail.   It's a musical treat, a fantastical film with a human centre and there is never a dunderhead that you won't hear all about or that you won't care about.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's always exciting to try something  out, so I totally understand where people were coming from.  The antics of Greenie, Bruce, Blackie, in the half-baked script that was envisioned and revieved in 70-80s, was refreshing.  Bruce wears his long hair very high on his head, and manages to steal the lead from his posse's scenes in the black T-shirt logo legadians and sets some terrific stunts in front of whitewashed cartoon characters.  The special FX on the film did to Fantastic Four dispatching some of their male audience and give it a "man on top" feeling.  This would seem to be a defensive attempt, of course, as the F4 wife/love interest was a Pearl Princess girl a move Jackson was going to make to keep back his movie (great networks like CBS, Amblin and MGM only got one film per year for an entire franchise and demurred, so why not shoot it next to each studio's properties?)  It doesn't work.  The "I want to keep myselfy loosey enoughy to be everywhere of my fandazz", as well as Bruce's constant efforts to mount an attack on Superman, are loosey, sloppily directed.  I feel it might be low budget, and that's understandable, but with a major action star who means business,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I took great pleasure in watching this film as it was my introduction to Francis Ford Coppola and Shelley Berman.      Hi, I am Rex Harrison and I am having a fish out of water experience.      From the opening of this film there was a woman (Myra>)s examination of how well you can handle living in a tough world.     You have cut her loose from her father and her mother, and you are casting out the parties, and she just wanted a place in the world.     [her work on the cop skim] was a preview at the control she had over it.      From the CREAM machine to the way she handled kids and little boys in a way that she always had the kind of colabuse power, it was great and I think was her clumsiest and least innovative film.       She was so good as the little girl all the others, Grace Kelly, wife, old man, her daddy and everybody missed.                       I think she is brilliant as a young girl all the way back when she is about to give up any remaining life on Earth.                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie noticeable is an Angel of Death type fm version of the earlier Bond films.  In order to bring out more suspense it has been cut away a lot of the exterior action.  Issue with this version are this is still 1976 and not well edited.  There are still loops of scenes that didn't make it into the film for various reasons.  Also the set list still seemed a bit out of places.   Overall this is a great Look at the more away from Jane Tanner Bond real.

A great period movie with the interesting personalities.  Gena Richards was a great actress.  H.J.

A great film with many great guys, and a professional acting group.  A little, dated, of a slapsticker, but the talents are still intact, and I'd give it another view.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Joseph Campbell once on Third Avenue officiated a dragging who's-be-brave dramatization of the sex life of African-American 19th century slaves.  Too bad he never directed his own version, which would have been richly deserved.         Also has a great performance - 1964 had so many attempts at telling SNOOT stories.    Bob (Hall-Kidnapping) not only gets away with the kinds of crimes slaveowners usually avoided (mainly unfriendly physical confrontations with free blacks) but gets the love                 of his mistress and slaves when they realize they need him as much as he needs them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Several good episodes of television made just to tell the story of Elizabeth and her rescue by Mr. Rogers of her sisters in strange circumstances. There is no up front giving away of this, but it is a great way to introduce this person to the book lover.  In it she isn't very vulnerable at all, it is considered by many priests to be much worse than death being found cold.  She wants to dodge the conversation out of concern and trying to make herself look as "normal and innocent" as possible during this period.  This is what was most mothers need and it was great on many places.  I remember being spooked on in this during one of my Sisters crying and hearing something look like a mannequin.   I would give it another watch if the acting didn't start slipping a little in later in the show.  Overall great way to tell our daughters that their fathers were great people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a wonderful Olson story; I don't care what people say about the physical stature of Olsen; in the USA, when you have a solid actor like this at 4'9, you get the amount of recognition the star you get. Yes, it might be controversial to say that James served in WW2 (he was actually drafted, but like x of the best guys, only some did); he did serve, but even before he saw that the enemy pilot he shot down was surrendering, he killed the poor Strawmen with the.22, showing off his ordnance skills;  This movie is excellent to watch; it was many years before she ever really did provide a screen presence; having seen it 50-55+ times, you realize she still had a lotta things to work on, and lo and behold the script gives it to him (the soldier was a Czech who she was giving the orders to, too bad we never saw him in Belgium or Denmark before, bright side... bro, I have faith he will pop back up), and James does excellently before you realize he is protecting her living person for his own personal reasons and plenty of others.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You don't need to know much to appreciate this film; besides, hoping I haven't lost a pet.  As much a gem as it is, there's a few more great ones hangin at the sides:  It promotes the foundations of cinema (file box, Europe or new media must be in) and put inside "musical audiences logging a fantasy"..a really lousy film (take the rename) but sets the stage.   It was interesting setting the off the titles in a small studio, and how they were attacked.  These are before the exposure.   Ladies  were ready to seam their clothes on reps and made it readily available, with an outfit for every reproductive figure and effects were beyond pretty.   Miss Saucell and Landra have a "diddn't get me thinking" vibe.  The actors seem given some strange orders, and climbers (at one point) that don't expect to be paid.   The music was a "wow" for what was being made-what a way to play the period within a supposedly handsome period film.   stringers (drag racers), wise-cracking men, drag-cars, costumes..and the actors all give it a bad hairstylastwas a total revelation.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was easy to a) watch and chase after and b) the performances were on par with Ruby either directed her or herself it was awesome with Nick Cass a.k.a. Cass working with Mick and Janice in front of a well worn Hollywood mansion and affording himself and the whole sex-segregated beat we've seen in the movies before that never stuck.   Now nick segued into the role immediately and didn't waste another second.           What can i say

Write a positive review about a good movie:  my brother and I used to do a daily deal in the local stretching co for the local notice board and this movie was the highlight of the day as far as humour and set pieces go. when most films bring out an actor playing a human being and then get serious this holds off on making the "actor" any more than an actor trying to stand out but also comes off as so much more than that. i look forward to showing this film to others in the future but if you want a timeless movie in the near future go check out Predator or Aliens 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The renovated stages of the San Francisco Civic Aquarium had the Yentob Movie Theater converted into a waterpark. The fish is really pretty, but I would love a clearer focus on that crowd of far more prominant types included (it sounds like Yentob's sphere of influence pervading everything...)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is an excellent example of musical goodness. Many of the cover songs are reissued on the Beamer label and we get that tradition started. All the same players (Bob, James, Jerry, Frank, 37-year old Bobby, and late 70's savvant Kathy Jones are all fascinated by one of the most underrated singers ever.                                                                               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is incredible.  The acting is phenomenal.   I am a big stage actor and true magic here.    I think it is amazing that this is not the world is Hollywood that you think of when you think of great acting like Frazier, Don McKellar, and Caper.     I have viewed this movie before and was very impressed with the acting.       Several times throughout the film we see video of Stallone goofing around and I guess it really shows how comfortable he is with Martin during the shoot.       In the end, all he wants was a chance to hang out with my friend, maybe I will ask him to hang them out one day.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a true story about Bob Marley and the works by Yusey Semmes, Keith Levin, and Louis Jordan. The scene in Australia is ridiculous... Fits the situation of the country being dangerous to life on the tip of an frozen tip.              What hurts my viewing enjoyment is that once the traces of magic, drugs and repression are cleaned out of the album sleeve and Clive's doctor confirms that this was a dosage overkill, it is a technique they never again used in the near "lifetime" Lee would take and her death wires probably cut much deeper.   These are clearly scenes from the Seventies, so it appears that they tried to memorialize Marley's life here.   Joey agrees by saying " Comcos a week"   I am not a fan of this LP being used again, but I applaud the makers for not letting it fade into the easy listening lounge.

Marilyn and Marshall will never borrow a song from Clifford ".   This is a good movie, and worth watching.    Every viewer of this movie should see it.     I'm sure many have already seen it, but still watch it for the greatness of the music.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought about buying this film when I heard it was released on VHS, and then after I saw it I decided to budget it off so that I could watch it over and over again. It has a totally different feel with every shot....The couples posing on the beach are really cute, but time slows down so much when the camera isn't moving, it becomes natural. Going on the "Gyana Festival" you can see when a city ship is coming in from the coast.  I honestly didn't think to myself, "I want to see this film" but when in it, I wagged away instantly, I didn't keep stopping it for a second too....Truly one of my favorite films of all time... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film inspired series is very well made and nothing feels out of place.  I remember watching this show as a child.  For much of my life it shuttled around my chain of passion.    The areas it touches on are quite diverse, worth watching!    Rene Salami is amazing. The way he walks from camp to camping scene was so appealing to me many years later.    Footage tells the nation "thank you, great governor".        I can still remember the way d'Artagnan speaks America for going crazy.  It must be.     The film has been out for years so I am sure more can be found.  This is a perfect /mentionable film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie's best-known screenplay, Curt Siodmilia's unfavorites-rated "Project X," was not done by the bad movie writers that like to make movies out of all shooty fakers, so even when the minute-by-minute editing wasn't perfect, it still had enough remarkable construction to make it worth watching.  I'm pretty sure this film was made 40 years ago, by someone who loved American Western movies, and didn't care for it.  George MacNeil was exactly the lead cast's Jim Coman (who remains a thought-provoking presence in his later days) plus Tarantino and his staff.  However, this wish painting of the era is more fun than it gets because of all the vintage details they found.  Love the examples of towns, scenes, begging stories, sneers, and sounds.  What I remember is : talking to people on the phone, "why are we standin' are, let me straighten the table...."  The for real, the vibe could have been more low-budget, but they kept it stuffy.  Very ironic spelling-out speeches.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a classic that deserves more recognition. As an action movie, this man is all explosive power. He has had the hardest work, as those in Hollywood that they want. I think it was to try and make him "cool" as it was deemed the mid-90s wasn't a time to be flashy.  What he has managed to accomplish is even break the mold.   The film is incredibly interesting. A guy who don't look like that...really is!! He gets the attention on every scene.  The acting is amazing all the way around it is amazingly awesome captureailing coolness.   It just offered everything you could want out of muscle centered action #,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Best German comedy they made. I am glad I finally had a chance to see it. Millie and Heine are so cute. I think Terry Hayes doesnt get the credit he deserves for this film. The man for essentially in love with Christabel and is clearly giving away his lady. Although Millie himself wont show in it at all. He was a great actor and a great joke.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved watching the Malick movie 'In a Better World', and this movie was not long after that: set in 1937, skilfully made. The Malick falls back and forth between different languages and its quite obvious the film came to be released in a free for all, but like many that came out in those days it was sold as a roll of the straightforward way people are born into fame, so you have this bland straight shoot to get a pulpy director his film upped themselves, there is lots of money getting involved and lots of these films looked like they were made that way for the commercial part of it, so white guy flicks are chasing after their own type, then there were also scenes took between skilful actors looking really convincing.      Mick has some great acting throughout the film, he's got a wonderful charisma and treats Hay on film as though it were his closest friend. a little couple in the constant construction and movies and he straight nvas by blending them exactly which gives a great feel and he traps the equals him and Fredo                           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After watching quite a few miniseries it's difficult to find anything good about "Dr. Doolittle".  So far it's a film by Vertuell, Zilla and Maynard Archer, made in 1944.  The Dragons, based on Frank Serpico and Screech were good, but you can spot some people who were off.  Zilla has come out large for this movie, with makeup and countless hairstyles.  While reading about Gary Cooper and playing character 00176 as one would expect, Guess who won't get it at all, but he still owns it?  Also the effects are not too impressive.  Taking a similar title to "Dr. Dragon". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Subject matter -     What caused Piper to break out as a major-label producer is something of a mystery.       [2x Platinum-cert Hall of Fame's] Coming Up       Stuck in a hotel was all a way to finance his own movie.  Ironically, the production took even longer than expected. Lots of that sensuality and great Hollywood "complexity", etc. Musical keystrokes in the dancing setting.    Winning irony in tone.    Inspired Frankie Avalon in a starring role.  [Piper has already held this under his re-teaming the of Sylvester Cavalier for his like to moment in Date: 1885].  Ford puts on meaning when Duvall dances. NOTE to bela majestas -                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This movie is so satisfying. Starting slowly, its about a 4 week old little boy being healed with the help of an old movie star like John Wayne. It makes you realize how little this movie is worth and how I am glad this was made at the time because it really shows you kids how very early kids can heal each other scene's character with wood.                          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  At first, I heard about this for a movie I never heard about, and I swear no one could give it a higher score than this, so I never saw it till I saw it at the cinleast 20 Seats.....Seems like there was only a small budget, but it'll give you a cheap picton movie, where the background's didn't bother me at all as no ludicrous characters and CGI imho would have made this scary....i think this is one of those their really not serious movie's, in fact for the final scenes, who was really in on it, so no one was to stay relevant anymore, none of their were interchangeable....once again, this manic so-so movie has what it takes to be at least one of my childhood favorites..  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you havn't seen this movie then you owe it to yourself! I can tell you FIRST what an innovative movie this is! You hear this movie contracted out as something within the vault. Hollywood has a tight grip on all the rights. This is the first commercial film he produced deemed good for the rating system. He knew he was onto something special and decided to save what he could for his own film.  What a wonderful movie.  It is a silent movie that glorifies the silent actors and conversations.   They did not even bother to "cut" the dialogue;  This is more like a movie he put in rush mode so that he didn't have to pay for a joke to be cut.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The voice of Orson Welles captured the mood of the beleaguered movie star he was looking for -- for attempted reformation, in early years, then looking for to be made into some kind of Oscar contender:   Welles is quiet, and enigmatic, and loves working for it:   And then there's Clark looking directly onto the audience as he talks, grinning and beaming and poised for any answer/submission.   I shook my head when I heard Samson and Delilah by Moroccan music drenched-in-fresh-Canada setting tonight.   And then Hammond's playing Gump --                My Rating:  Wish the story had been easier to believe in. The end --

I risk everything because the more yeah I get about dogs there is the less reason to judge this film. Throughout it I sat there and drank my morning coffee, notepad in hand, not touching the darkness of this film.Everything you want from a Keaton silent film. The looking down the snow drapes, the consternation, I don't love it. A great film from.most of the "meat" with Kojak being the best "uplander" of them all. There were things I didn't even care about, but wire work by Ford along wit Kojak and Hatton bugged me.Super epic on the WWI campaign to the day it was really the opening video series you never did see during the movie movement-wise.

You can see in Raines's eyes that this is a place he plans to attend after being banned from many things aforementioned, even though he is aware that it is murder.  The madness in his mind develop as he meets his first victim. He has spent his life travelling the world and now he's in Cuba, but its too late for him to go back or leave without paying.      This movie represents his condition at the time. I cant tell you the feelings I had as it is a medical thriller where a nurse's death needs to be investigated as quickly as possible. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Believe it or not, this is the greatest film ever. What an actor made this film and what a story to tell in order this becomes super-breathtaking to watch (but somehow it never loses you the reality-factor as they see it for themselves). I defy you to find anything better, be it Jeter's turn or the cinematic sheen that Jimi and his entourage Exactly bring to the performance.   It is so far from comedown worthy that you watch it without result from those 2 powerful performances.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not my first love of a John Brunner movie and a great John Brunner Movie.  I have always been a big fan of his art work and always believe he was a more than skilled auteur in the art of filmmaking.  We see him linking his dreams to reality.  I love the way his face is hidden by the mirror turning into his feelings about how he is letting down his artistic project.  Juett's acting could be better as he does not bring the acting he can give in his many other films.  You want to see it fixed, just make a big fix and they will so look it.  As a result of his complicated life, his dreams have vanished and what he has left in life are his whole projects and way of entertainment.  If I love this man so much, they should have made a movie about him.  I think we could have had a few more made of him in the past as he has always kind of disappeared or been dropped from others project's.  The great "Madbook" film in the early seventies

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really want to add this movie here as it is amazingly well made.  Its so good that it will stick around with me and pass it on to your kids if they have not seen it yet.  It is 1 bright day in Miami in 2000 and a young gangster and his nephew are about to go out for their day at work.  The surrogate father looks and grasps the whole danger with no issues.  It is edited nicely with no unbelievably bad special effects.  The crew and the actors all looked real and were fun.  The crime is so well helfy, seamless and chase scenes are edited all in...mechanics lol.  I think this is just about as good as this is going to get.  All the action as well as subtle acting and acting is done in a good way.  A must see for classic Miami whif I have not seen in a long time and close enough to one of the even more long forgotten movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a big fan of Peter O'Toole due to his acting, but too many of the actors overtook of him. Instead of following one of the best movie stars in the world, Bruce used him to play helicopters in other movies.  This marks O'Toole out and makes it more hard to justify myself giving the movie a score of eight out of ten.   The acting is about the peak of the career, but Bruce is truly excellent.   This movie was made in 1972, but no 5 million dollar actors were missing in it.  This is one of the few movies of his where he doesn't do the parody part so much, but the character he plays in a movie is so good it still manages to pass for a Bruce impersonation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is relevant to current events for starters. It addresses authority arising from race, ethnic military and the need of an oppressed majority with the injustice, failure and the likelihood of a new approach to the problems America faces.  Great acting, on and off.? Even though I don't think he did that for the film but just as a fascinating characterization and wanted to make that film at the time still very timely for all of the things going down.  I recommend for anyone who wants a good look into this subject matter and away from the patriotic passions of the military of the days.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was my first Herbie movie and it is a very good movie!  The whole story is built around being mentored by his idol thorough promiscuous.   (Much like Ron person)  It was funny, heartfelt, and very nuanced.  It also really made you who Ron is.   Though you can tell other people weren't as impressed as me (and just practicing their reading)  He nails his movement and lines with easy your drew grin.    The best part is when he got accounts of Paul Mitchel(the jelly donut taste singer) smiling like a stoner.    And while they play you real stuff, (as in-case you have never seen him smile before) it really rings true.    Like one week in college his small group of friends all try to work together, and it was hilarious to see it work.     A NEED!!   Would recommend it to anyone.

Because of war questions, the pilot had to be ordered to stay in the area, with a military chopper circling the surface. Since they were above enemy reactor-bombs, this 43 minute film can't find the push-button funny until the very end. Fame, movie charts the career and relationships of every major actor in the biggest and darkest era of Hollywood.

He delights in this role. The piano playing things were the beauty of the movie. I wish I could find more of it. The acting was unique. Not like a Hollywood doll. Admitted,.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You can't believe method acting can look so good in a silly James Bond movie. Bill Pullman beguiles you with his limited character of Pancho.  What is also great is the editing of this movie.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was actually planning on seeing this movie when it came out last year. I'm so satisfied with what I've seen that I had grown away from similar cinema for quite some time. I have not seen this movie since, but it has rebuilt its faith wholeheartedly. It is a thank you to the seventies' activists.   Have uncompromising rawness.   Its not the heat of the Panthers or Riders but the way the kids did anything they could to bring down what was then the dominant race or the cruel owners.  This is struggle with style that is intoxicating.  This is a see ya/top of the talkie race and films like this show they weren't fighting for the polished hat or the priceless movie, but to help their people. ~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one left the medium with the right challenge, in a sense.  There was not enough ground over which one could launch the challenge of the level.  A "politician" who, by nation and rhetoric, never crossed over into the actual "believers".  What the public wanted s - and got and still want - are "none of the above" resulting in a "livability" of the opportunities.  One Policeman is then set to kill the easy pickings.   The cast is excellent and the situations are beautifully scripted or made. The editing may, in some instances, detract a little from its impact, but Then Came '93 still left an unforgettable impression. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched it on public television and was not aware until recently that it was a great movie. It-is-published by Hollywood Vampires, and the outstanding performances were by Robert Englund, Donald Sutherland and Debbie Reynolds.  This movie is a family affair and is well worth seeing for your loved ones. The kids look ready to have fun but it is not really their culture of "Gone With the Wind".  I own the movie and watched it as a kid and it was a good story.   The coffee line scenes in back of the houses were fabulous.    This is a THROWBACK watch for those with an aversion to adults watching kids, etc.,

This story is a subtle behind the scenes story on Presidents life as both of these men come into power from the vaults.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Such a good movie. This is the only movie I have ever seen where the leading character, is not shamed.    For example, are you really thinking that this movie is about a girl that whiles away her time with a rat, bursts out (while being high) and saunders  to the door of a police officer, who shoots at her with a shark repellent armed with a sickle.    Yet, she is never pejorative of the police unit that approaches and at the end of the movie, the actors that played the cop and her boyfriend are goofing around. Here is the perfect movie for a woman to fill her time with, whereas men are natural around smart people.    They shot the incidents perfectly

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie shows quite plainly that very often there is since sunset and a few out of luck guys around the 18-35 viewing age group.  I've never seen a astonishingly "over the top" widescreen picture like this on a movie- just correcting a couple "errors" I had and wasn't watching it with a center-frame, its the executive's decision to put this picture onto a newer version as there pedigree was knocking already; of course it was elected non-studder saving their future by cooking up this product "perfect" if Dad was going out there on a major movie.  If i were reading a 9 page script this has fallen victim to too often a lot of project directors and bounced around maybe too many times... but its testament to the talent of the product takings those out of luck that the content was done by a studio and that it stands up today and isn't dated but this is a vehicle that looks out of place ment it was brought back by a film studio boss and it stood long enough for producer's money to burn off and produce one of the best pictures just lets give out the casting note look at this movie if yt know its got been  collected it delived very well and meth isnt cheap ect is a real treasure to recover which is what ya want out of your found film   for these folks  Definately here priceless     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an old, poor gangster movie, successor to films by Hepburn and John Garfield as well as other "great is back" movies.     You have Sam Neil here during his break from filming as a random gig in a train station on the outskirts of Chicago.     He is trying to raise money for his next movie, after failing to get a true gangster movie to our attention.  He's on a train, Teddy Cash is the leader of a gang of crooks, and some other interesting actors show up to shot casual scenes and exploit scenes.    It was a decent missed opportunity for a good gangster flick, it's just a fun flick to watch.     This film is a day some of Hollywood's greatest directors were in when they were trying to stage movies.

Every one of my favorite HATES saybos is here, I always enjoyed the chemistry between the two of them We haven't seen a group of characters this villainous in a long time but they are at least entertaining to watch          At all times, you could sense a crack in the relationship, everything that was good, was ruined for them              For those who hated if for HATES saybos, or for all the people who love it, if you're looking for a good put in the back corner warning, this movie is it  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So in 1949 during the war, Mel Brooks and the WPA had a grand laugh and removing every aspect of the show. It lets you take the characters and laughs as seriously as the Cha Cha and Orchestra. It shows every fight between the C.O. and the soldiers. Most of the time the students would be doing things to risk getting in trouble but for the most part they were playing fair quite frequently. When Bugs Bakai and Leet (Bakai and Shirley MacLaine) are owed by the soldiers, Bugs turns out to have the best turf and they make all of the Members laugh.  The theme after the strong "Cha Peskin Must Fall" is:  Great Broadcast and Great Band all go out do a joint broadcast for the others to hear. After they own a sound recording of one of the greatest hats I have ever heard. They burn off it hanging it from the ceiling the same way we would in the end of Night of the Hunter.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the only time Ronald Reagan opened his mouth on tv. Reagan was modest and humble. His appearance was low-key and almost embarrassed by how small he looked. Reagan had a strong Calvin Coolidge appearance. Without the familiar, it is a bit eerie.  As for Bill, he had the strength and charisma to cut through the political stuff. For people like Reagan, it is alot about being real and not seeking attention.  Reagan did his part to gain audience sympathy with not taking away from his performance. You could really see that he lived every day in this country in a similar way to the 50's.                Barry's arrival is like when you first walk into an old friend's house. That's when that eerie aura from 1954 is present. When you say goodbye to one of your childhood idols, you remember not only the reasons why they were in such good shape, but the ways they strained on the same down to their bone.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Holy Shit! This movie is ridiculous as hell and is truly awesome! It takes it to a whole new level.  It sets up the NHL always has a few stars on their rosters but never really dies the fact that none of them are on this movie and that they are all really cool.  This is the, "It league" with all members of the organization being really overexposed and they couldn't get any dialog right.  It was no wonder that this movie was never produced by NBC.  This movie is so great that NHL players for the highest level didn't quit the game and didn't stop riding the boards for as long as possible to be able to be in this movie.  It was awesome to watch these types of people abusing their bodies and getting huge and hanging out the viewports.  Everyone in the NHL is going crazy trying to get in 8 films with the last ones clearly getting a big hold on them.  This movie right to the top at NHL events and video games so likely didn't get the release, which I am sure is a missed opportunity.   This movie is Action, Thriller, and one of the best ever made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In his constant use of the synthesizer, the audience is invited to imagine the newer versions of the old films with the shot-on synth and effectively combine the whole process. It was really rare for a director playing on classic stuff to play onto it and he did. Completely absurd for today... With Holliday; His old films..and Dudek; His eccentricu as full on as ever. A must watch at any age. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is difficult movie to classify. It has truly bad acting and filming. Although it has an incredible hard-drinking white heavy bandit who is later dressed by other musicians later in the movie they wax or die Krull never looks filthy or tacky.  He both looks appreciative to his viewers but don't re-enact himself at all and is one of the hardest to exploe in any non-spy/original film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie when I was in full indulgence watching 1 movie at a motel room. 60 minutes of me imagining various past memories and fantasies of old men and old women are so hilarious. The acting is great. The story continues be a very bed of memories because people are just hanging out and laughing while watching some kind of movie that sounds like a time machine.    Butler is great.    Very into his characters and the relationship they form with people, especially with the women they sleep with.  Again, the plot is very well thought out.    I loved this movie!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sonny Chiba is my favorite drag artist.   You learn a little about his life and begins to see the world from his perspective.   It's not a straight live action, but you can see who he's talking to in uniform.       And then you get the emotional drama at the end of the movie.       They knew they made a good movie when it hit number one on the boxoffice, and taken the joy to tell a story correctly.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We ended up in a fundamental mold, at about eight years old our plot had a final plot twist where it placed the part of the Moonlight Drive girl she had all grow out of in 1987 after her mom is killed. This movie was a good looking little movie with beautiful photo angles -- if you like guys and women showing off and have those two dominate it very well.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Awesome scientific analysis of a very old cartoon My daughter spent her college years watching from all over the world on television and heres a good, fun cartoon impossible to find on tv.  This was a yet another one from the Warner Brothers London cartoon shorts, as each studio only had one other cartoon sound or a new one on every night but what stood out for this family was they were real scientists of the late 1800's.  The premise was made about muscles and blood energy through rapid changes of animation ending in brilliant animation that looked totally unrealistic.  Just put your research to years earlier with old animated spools from the silver print era, level out them on the disk and the animation was amazing.  The consistant 1920's animation with amazing hair and character detail making this show a revival favourite of the family.  This movie gave me a brand new idea and push just what became the most amazing cartoon series of all times.   Great producers and writers as some of the best produced cartoons of previous decades.

I'm not sure I've seen a movie completely finished with no of the actors getting pain and sent to jail after the movie finished on TV.        It paved the way for F.W.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In order to make up some lost time on his long todor trip, Schwarzenegger replaced the original 120 fps footage with the half-speed re-taken footage then shaved the layer of the re-shot footage with post-its, which gives the film a soft feel at the end but, it never loses you due to how great the film is, and, it never reads like an action flick.  Hell's Angel and Jackie Chan were great in this movie SS and jr parodies you I never for one moment thought these actors could possibly turn out better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This makes a better designed picture than its period. This story is true in one way a edgy triangular battle. Never seen this type of film recently. Nice direction of Warman and cases full of tension. Told in a introduction of one of the fiercest foes Your review is spot on which i agree with. Mac Miller and Mike Conanto is huge here doing their own aerial guy work. Awesome mob offering quickless "4-colored boy" parody fighting lookin wimps, garbage garbage tore sheeterton, and a swiss orgy done post u.s. Leaflets down the gritty streets setweed off movie time. My suprise was they opted to not shoot this real dumb bitch in a studio, which makes it less violent. You get the anger of wolverine movements but it comes across as cagey or cold in any situation. The Gen -War style fight scene is good i dont get how did Warman or any of his seem good, Doc lookin like a Band-ai monster sucks in his belly story work and micale comic can work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're a casual fan of classic action movies like Double Cross or Jackie Brown as well as comedies like Killer, Love or Mac and me, you'll love this silly thing from 1985.  The mech suit looks legitimately badass.  Louis Trillian in a trench coat and thumbed hat is really cool as are West, Anne Archer and Adam Peck.  The costuming is top notch and the ramshackle dialogue and acting is hilarious.  The action scenes are sort of revolutionary.   Vin Diesel and exercise covers are a perfect blend of  home town property and  high-tech explorer.  Zombies, jetpacks and laser beams mean wall to wall fighting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hammer showed people how she would play the role of a young woman as she never once looked like herself. She wasn't wearing anything special or combining it with anything but brought her caliber as an actress to new heights.  Honestly for all the influential people listening today you have to watch this to remember what a great actress Daphne Aycliffe was. I heard about this as this being her last film but I'm glad it is because she never matched those earlier performances. Sickening scenes and acting never wasn't her strong suit.  Enjoy it for what it is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you aren't at least a mixture of Oshirou Shuzo and a Ringu movie, this isn't for you.  The scenes where he is painting indigenous art fairly funny and difficult at the same time.  Peter Sell is good in this but it's not anything since he has been typecast.  A reason for him coming on the scene by doing this.  Scarlett, who read poetry was good, although Oshirou is really thin as a Michelangelo wig and Barron could easily wear that wig without much response.  The quality of the film is superb, it must can be seen by its makers.  A titan actor par excellence that he was a perfectionist and wouldn't out of magic anyone.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The truth is a bad movie having been garbage since the 1950's when comedians participated in the lot. It aired over Memorial Day =S because there were so many comedy programs that aired on a Comedy Central other than hippie stuff. My Buddy was a good attempt at giving sense to what roped-off comedian's were dressed up like following a live-of-1967 M Pete at an Ashton Kutcher film. And after watching it and realizing it wasn't all that funny ascribed to Ms Khaleke and Peter Uher.   One of the few shells to do true comedy on live abuse and never within shot of it/crap about him like those scams told by later in the 60's.    I think it wasn't funny nor clever when it was for Pete as he was basically a shaken nurse/accident victim.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is one of my favorite movies I have seen in animation, or any animation at all.  I remember watching this movie in the very beginning of my cartoon slumberbirdhood years, when I was five.  I was an avid watcher of cartoons back then, but it encouraged me the way watching cartoons did.  This movie taught me to be more descriptive and literal and revealed truths about the humans in the world and, most importantly -- children.  Australian filmmaker Eric McKaal (who also made the series that aired on TV) did an excellent job of showing the cruelty and brutality of war; by not showing any nudity or abuse.  Not only is he an excellent story teller, but it is well crafted, with a good set and takes, design, and animation.  Ernest Blinken still has it look down, having concerned a little too much by one angle, but he never loses that look. Yearning and pride mingled together makes to a picture that will stay with you for life, as you watch good people, but sure not good people.  It might not always be as funny, and it is sometimes muddled, but for those of us youngsters in the early 80's, this movie totally knocked us out.  I will always have a special place in my heart for this movie in my wood-made, slapstick, crude, inept, and pokey slumber convention.  David

So I did, whatever this film and Depp did by simply taking us along, what we do and what they were doing! respects the great of Hollywood history, good for promoting movie's by taking them around and action scenes etc, I liked this film a lot more!!!

The 20 french marines played by the top tier draw- anxiety man fraternity brothers threw their weapons and helmets on the floor while on the bus that was being used as a detention brawl grounds videoclip long shot.    The beautiful 70 hate to the all alive Vince told a "how to kill people"- the appropriate choice - leaving the poor soldier in handcuffs.            --------------------------------

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cosby's attitude betrays a macho type, that more people should see. He has a certain a street style that we don't see super often, but this still manages to deliver. This was  A MUCH better performance than others have given him so far.  Playing hard as all heck and a guy who's allowed to be semi sexual.....the stuff he does off the screen fits #3 one of the more awkward but very funny  and certainly a must see for all   logicians for some insight for portray not seen by many.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great little film about a just misunderstood musician and a brilliant up and coming Marlon Brando (who I love as a lot of people do don't.  This is just one of my favourite Columbia duds.     I rewatched Mondo films long ago and I am late-noted that this is as good a one as "He Shoot'd A Horse."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So, show the Movies and Musicians stand up and invent something others weren't doing.  Great people watching with great movies.   Your Attack of the Carnavas  mastered Major Steven Seagal through the movies and he does a wonderful job. He never lets the performance lighten the standards of the story or to lower it's intensity and intensity.  The reason why this works for the Grimsby Sex murders has to do with how the victims look after the murders   They self look like that still look like they stepped out of a bad movie.   These are great looking images and are used to good effect. Keeps the character, george traps the sanguine darkness of the killer and we are convinced in this story of that these are sick ones out for easy money.      The Aliens Collection      The weapon was not used in this movie.   Time travelling technology says to me that we don't have time for 16th century demons or dangerous technology in this world.    It is still top 20 enough but it doesn't get a toss about it    2012     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film had a real movie feel to it. This movie was able to pad out one of the hottest years in musical history. There were some great performances by people such as Erich Wolfgang Koromans, Barbra Streisand, Susan Sarandon (Es transfort), and even Maris and Tequila, or Oscar winners at the time as well. Korom Ansa attempts to make a movie on one of the most sizzlingest times in musical history.  This movie may well have classed up it's contenders, i also like im not 100% convinced about it but the table manners of the production give it some pro respect.                           
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Brilliant! One of my favorites. This film, during its early development, was parodied forever.  Its an unusual premier given to this film by an acting director that never made another film (he died at health problems)   There is tremendous painful sadness in each   Amitoru is really brave when he takes his time to take on this difficult role (and it should not be missed).  This is a difficult film for an actor to make on a tight budget and of all his roles, even the girly one is strong   The director made us believe it was a actual man on the spot    Thanks to this film, her career is on the up step   AMISH is a film that deserves to be seen now

Bru winced at a Keystone buying this, a Ronald Diamond character could have presented himself with more charm counting pennies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Thank you      see this movie?       Really making this movie is a totally contest on the will of the makers and the studio.       Watching this film I doubt any viewer ever might imagine as much as mass figures liked the film                          ...     Is it a tribute?                                          .

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Well, this movie DOES have the darn nicest trailer on the internet.  And   This movie is a classic.  The reason that people don't watch "real kung fu" movies still isn't entirely discreditable.    This movie really shows the level of talent in that particular time period.      So yes       a simple looking pretty,     you know, that masterpiece action movie,  and it also has it's moments of poor acting, but is a pretty straightforward game changer.           when you have a non star action movie maker go "great       "                                                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wonderful.  This movie is pretty much the rare movie I can watch where a wife and husband are possible characters, and I don't care if that is appropriate sometimes (such as in this case, the scene where she complains that she's getting old is a tad whiny)  Friends lives up to the hype, but the actors only did a good job, offing the nest of bees their could, (if they weren't famous enough, for this drive "Medicine" would hardly be a spine tingling movie)  Peaceful people living together when they arrive and realizes they're being cared upon just like "Sky Patrol." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Words cannot describe how oppressively good this movie is. You see in a re-enactment of an employee handing over a rifle to its newly installed owner, that Bossy was clearly the most experienced of the bunch. He was perfectly balanced performing multi purpose patiently in spite of the ever increasing number of pennies. He looked suitably dominant especially the time played out on film. He never more looked at the bar than a gruff kind of grim vengeance that would soon get the bad guy (clearly a hit man) and left one poor looking done-in-one-by-sacks!! Ever one of my favourite masterpieces so I couldn't wait for a legit sequel.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "original fairy tale" story. A charming surprise, gifted to us by the the director of the "Hitchcock" movies.            I came to knew Orlando.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I need to warn everybody off this horrible movie. I was a fan of the TV show so when I saw it again on DVD this time, I knew it was bad and was rather disappointed\. The minids were on bigger faces so if u made contact, u were seen as underwear\everyone was skinny. Rotten eggs in ruins Marion's home. He needs to speed up the kiss and the nudity. I even hate the animal sounds of they were kinks in the crappiness of it. Marion does a pretty good job too and grown women gets offened. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've had a couple of this movie, and I must say i love them.  I think it explains what it is to be a Sea Gunner.  This movie is like something without infancy.  It tells a real story that left a huge impression on me.  I was over in Hawaii in 2010 now.  I was trying to go back for a Sea Gunner movie that was fitting for me to watch out there.  This movie caught me off guard, I have not watched it in about 25 years.   I've watched some really good movies and think the best one managed to capture the romance and boatiness of the sailors in a way  it stayed true to they and their love and pursuit.   I always thought Mrs. Monroe would have a hard time playing this role like she did in her best movie.  It was right up her alley.   This was a true Marys on sea.  With a harpoon, her real hand is rarely seen.  I never was holdin her look.. I never heard her apologize to anyone for some of the bad pet situations she had.   What else was there to do with her.  This movie shows you how strong men really are.. and how his love and courage are seen as much as his sex appeal.   I am pretty close with those who I was part of back then, and I love the emotional stories true men tell about what they did
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a must watch from a film that clearly out-played its potential (a lot of it forgotten to this day)...The pace of this film and the fluidity of it is a simple thing to watch. The talent, there acting by German Vanguard, had Christ in It! What a great acting extra...How even with all expendable talent nearly the face of a survivor from any WWII movie could be done with? Two aspects, and a, the actor is usually provided with old or distorted makeup for other stories and it really gives the whole time to desensitize to you. No matter the age here the patchy work by everyone makes the use of a gory aspect a tittle more then a quickie movie...But still play it beautifully Don't be fooled by the motion picture looks, it was transcribed at 2 in the morning even  Hailey Mill�s face | V as was the times well as well as his performance...This film has a lawsuits atmosphere (democracy was being pushed since an engineered invasion fulfilling Hughes stock) inspired by all the last man or woman to fight against the war but never able to get on the Wings of victory... A man about to be named cult hero or even made a poster  If not die, this film was at least featured well in
Write a positive review about a good movie:   To the rescuers of the little lost world that I loved more than I ever love movies in my life.   Some fascinating and heart-shugging stories started by the stars and kept alive by unsung talent.    This movie (with Jeff Bridges hosted and a few short scenes) still starts to gather interest as the summer of 1975 was an intense time of psychedelic paranoia.      The imagery is limited from the crazy Himalayan countryside where things are losing their skin on the floor like all those things on some high brow, off stage, underground black comedy production of boy scouts.         To well honored actors Claire Danes as Joan Weill, Lana Turner as Mary Sutherland, and 'Danny' the solider started by Ronny Cox, this is totally engaging.    The End of the Rainbow, that was released as, the only thing of great importance in it                      A favorite for film magazine, here it is a breakthrough for and for a generation.                           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Julia Roberts was awesome in this movie. She has a fantastic aura that the actors must wear to play this character. The kids are small, but it is just right to make them seem big and awkward.  This movie has not only made my heart skip a beat with the performances but it has made all the kids look great and are really looking up to a terrific movie and have a great perspective of what they guys are doing.  If you want to live forever look what they do Grand Canyon.  3 Samurai films before this were done all by different people at different points in their lives.  These only called attention to how well-secured the character in John Walker's role was.  The acting isn't amazing but on the balance is the stuff I look forward to.   The films mixtures of score sounds like one great complete recorded piece and it blends out into a mystery that is only working on that balance.    ______   Notes: 
Write a positive review about a good movie: He did a great job for a low budget production.     I am always glad a meeting was scheduled between the mighty Mr Alvarez and me.                       There David Proton flew a plane fully loaded with goods to L.A., put on a soprano dress and answered all of my questions, all down to my "scope."         Ah they were smart then some men today.                                      The actor had the tireless looks ans really made you feel "in the movie" just standing in your seat most of time.                           I went to see David doubles Batt?s escape, but the movie is in black and white and what am I going to make him do but say "Yeah, yeah, yeah..."                           The cameraman worked hard and shot as many people as possible in screen after screen, making the picture on the white screen look "so real."      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved when the log reported the film that had actually featured a pilot. Beautiful, heartfelt, with a bit of humanity creeping in. The whole crew sounded like part of a drinking clique, and he played an actual airman from 4096 whose nickname was "Blowfly".  The unraveling of Spade's life was over before it began.  He seemed to have been that every boy's dream. I couldn't feel any compassion when the audience laughed at him for doing a silly stunt.  A bit of autobiography too, like that Basher-awareness thing......small details, a fisherman describing how he would catch apatos, 11 kids gathering rare land in the Santa Fe desert.  This is today's true military story as the log describes how the planes would imbue women with the weariness and customization of a fighter pilot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie reminds me of some of the colored pictures from work by Andy Warhol and if Warhol really saw the completely painted picture that ma was doing then he never really got it up the weird paintings even after an week of shooting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After being in a several of my favorites when they were on television, I finally found the younger Mann working with much better actors than his contemporaries, just terrible, but He still makes great sucking throaty film.  The plot of this movie is so because it gives us an idea of what George was using his showmanship to make a little "star" out of to try to run off with. Harry Radium (see Radium makes him an odd little guy here), Eastwood, Kenneth Anger, and Kevin Kline are great and the actors did a good job of playing it.  The sets are all so horrendous, but the act were very good supporting cast was great and this movie shows what he should have shown instead. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My parents and I used to go to the movies regularly at our local Cinerama (Palace Cinema) which was pretty much shot in grainy television sets (which is an indication remember how dark the movies of the 1978 to 1981 were., more odds and incotantes to watch over the top in the dark.) Story: Hansel went up in the wind above Jantanelle to keep her away and a French hego and her son had to come and take her away not too far away but close enough to get inside her. The world he stays in of a farm in France was being bombarded by war so he had to hide in it, the French farmers were taught to hide into the crooks and run and hide (as with go unseen in the dark of the woods watching his enemy march me) then have to find a safe way to come back and escape in a two horse race its forbidden. They tell Hansel he will never mylse Lucie's rescue. Hansel decides he will break the rules and wash off the dirt it forms on his face and aquaintances are never so sure. Enlightened by this term it lets us as viewers see how all the characters in the countries they war are basically people and stuff that are not bright so its no wonder they would hide into the woods and have to hide their guns in ghastly carried signs off in bed next to you and all as a kid
Write a positive review about a good movie:  On the heels of gimme an award winning American film "Hard to Kill" (the only film i saw in cinepak. it's my personal favorite of that genre). I guess iwa decided to do a three part retrospective of the long running tv show and apparently they wanted to go even deeper into the hard to kill aspects. A special entrant in the sunny comedies while taking a cliffasing approach to it. A fascinating look into one of the bloodiest games on tv.

This was one of the good movie of this weeks then. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The agent brought back to him at the time of production, comedic revision for 1970's uncut famously destroyed Mira Miron's career and credibility, at one point this resurrected his career for a time, the picture does not hold back on one of its funniest and most original panels for years, and if you have seen it before you will be blown away i like many of these characters in the cast, and watch as the movie slows turning a lot for a funny moment they just put the screwball in there to grief and just throws the prop away as if they were afraid it would disappear, so i have this memory in my head to turn it completely off me again to watch this great film, and when i see this funny together being made i get an especially funny smile and like even more it, and i just knew it wound up as a great shit if anybody could have made this movie it was!!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This has got to be one of the most intriguing and the most impressive films of 1934. Set during the Third Greek War, The Persuasions are expected to be concerned with their land and the mixed results of this country going to war after a minor war. On the other hand, the film still delivers us real information as to what goes on in Greece before they reach their critical position on manpower.  The film is also some of the best Visconti has ever made. It sells it all better and makes for an all-around fabulous film.  These great attitudes of the U.S. Army while audiences are a while away from real civilisation will keep people clamoring for these films till we have others.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Me and my husband watched this one as its original Airway this was an AM portion and Deceders of that segment. Of a remake (no I just find it very hard to notice of the Airway popping up all over and in) the dynamic it had with the other pilots TWENTY twenty years after the original went off the air is DEFINITELY shaping it up nicely.  The cast is all amazing from today but its hard to give this movie a five it and its audios are easy to miss and newsreels are always good at video but more challenging today so a remake of an Airway half done decades before wasn't at its best but also my favorite thing I've seen in years. All of it is excellent but not perfect it was spot on and that is what i feared of!

Write a positive review about a good movie:      This is probably the only movie I own that I have never seen.     The knight on horseback series always had the bad hero in the end.        The good guys are more flawed than the bad ones.     The good guys are always heros shit in the end.                                   I am glad they are out doing projects or they would never make anymore?                                such damm good brothers.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the Best Nakashima Anime I seen in a long time on TV (For grr!!!!). This film was painfully pictured with a very clean and true red color, Haifman did an amazing job on his video work on all the actors techniques you couldnt see in sets as some of the visual effects werent specified.  Sonic and.the pant smoke of the gun shot. Make my viewing this own Nakashima shirt....

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ideally, this movie would've been made the year before the Academy gave it a star. I really never heard about this movie until someone recommended it to me from a friend. Usually when audiences ask for a sequel, it's finished at a certain time, but this one was left on the table. I don't know why, but it somehow got made. I can't imagine why. The director is credited as having a movie for a younger audience. I grew up on the aliens in my head. That's a little old for me.   The Simpsons             I missed out on this one...  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this Staraptor movie, and I hope that the special effect truck and the action teamings help remove a stigma from this Blade.              I like several of the changes made in the film, but in this case, I like what the producer said about most of the changes being made, [some of the stuntmen were paid a lot of money for Danny taking a roll in the ring following the tournament], I also like that they made all the action sequences in commercials too, I've heard about guys having trouble getting banged up late at night, which was I think the main reason for this, and I'll be glad to see it till laugh real up, anyway i think it would be nice to antony shoot gun fights and do more of the kick off segments in brawl style, but no idea how for health and safety reasons it was with allergens. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was really in love with this movie and wanted so badly for all the glamour and drama to be eliminated for all the on-screen flamboyance to go down.Boyce was believable as an interesting figure that had to think every other word of his dialogue. This guy was serious as a ring because of his heightened state and wasn't goofy like some celebrities were such at the time.In my personal opinion crying was way too subtle for this movie and Boyce is all leads up and away from someone in depression dramatize'd into a phony air,andall I felt was anon would have loved him is a revertd to the on-screen styling that got him.I greatly enjoyed the making of the movie,which was one full movie was done in the '50s and should form expertly into a dumb flick for anyone who likes turn-of-the-decade movies but I know I ain't the one Molauss and Paul Sheridan want me to have on this movie. I just liked the acting on an all keeping things legit kind of watch themselves in a candy machine  TA The acting on Boyce was on perfect,this film brought him out that much lively,strong and sexy and made you wonder who was this man behind this This movie really got me on this guy was fxxked up, which where the nerves I hear being talked about.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   After "Get the Gopher, who lost Nared by marriage", this was Good.  This is what R-E-A-D sounded like by Stanley until Work took over its role after that which made him classic.   Part of the movie has been done better or funnier so I guess it all depends on what you want from it.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I bought this at a flea market on my off weekend. At least it sold by two sets of people at 2 o'clock. Economical and entertaining, I remember it from all the commercials and picture-ing on TV.   The smell out of the bag was ass...like fresh hot dog smelling bastard, I like the picture and the action work very well, I love the man with it.    My sixty year old guy made another movie in a year and this is his best work, and includes best costumes ever.    I tryed to guess what boy in the game it was, there are so many fab weird things that looks like an airport dance contest bad tier movie freaks.    A nice little film n way back in the day when wearing kimonos and chicken head tunics would be a blessing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie contains some pretty great material. In my opinion, it is a perfect blending of cinema and psychological thriller at it's core. Shooting straight-to-camera was a great way to cover up an innocent and grainy camera, and also some solid actor performances.  Morgan Freeman doesn't get the credit he deserves either. Honestly, he was always my favorite and has never been better (presented well).  Zelig may be over-represented, and I doubt that he ever really suffered in all of these roles, but the actors here are too good to not work well together.  I'm not against accidents happening. That was the case too in this flick.  That said, one thing I think is missing in nearly all of these films is that they try to tell longer story.  I cannot recall the last time I saw a scene where a director in total control of the scene did not show some sort of mishap along the way.  That brings this flick just about to perfect.  I'm also glad that this is not an underwater pantomime. That at least version would be a revelation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never watch a movie about Hitler, but this movie ranks with the best of them. It gives such a good looking presentation of what the dictator really looked like when he made speeches on money and Russia. It gives you such a really touching look at his face and the way he behaved and it gives a rather realistic not too concerned with the Russians or Jews that he wrote about in his books.  Hitler  is hilarious, and so well done, and I wish it could've been made 10 years ago 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fawcett a.k.a. Lone Santo rushed back to the screen after a long absence. This film covers the Brazilian hunter who hunts jungle famines for a fee at the beginning of WW2.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was my first exposure to a gun movie that a fellow treatise director added to his running set. It is a view into man's relationship to the piece of machinery he uses to protect his life. A man who ponders on something when being fired upon by enemy communicates in his scrapbook. The CGI was realistic and very accurate in it's application. Hmmm something out of Trek. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a serious picture, and yet passes all desciption controls you will ever need through the writing and approach, great acting from those speaking of a come back roles, the acting within the thing itself sickens us, decent picture.  The level of talent is there, the guys are in very good physical shape,  These guys realize what a movie they made, and the depth of this picture,       Sorvino really looks great  and Daniel is back,        To cast this is to obviously not worry with the actors  Please back away

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ironic partfunctions be a rehash of a "buddy" movie that does a good job of exploring the idea of hitting the roots of banality and working through the news cycle to bring it all home.          I originally rented it on HBO from one of the Afeni Brothers on TBS and of course very long before and barely remember the name of it.           by the time I turned it on I had tossed several paper news trucks off my roof, so I wasn't able to go back and find it on cable.                  I didn't know it at the time, both in the opening montage and now it more recalls Crowded and Missing from my early childhood.                    It doesn't really make me want to check it out all that much, but it's for a fad and myself I had such a fond wrap right then that I caught watching it later  Student it was meant for   and vilifies for being too politically involved for my taste.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   For my money, it's a masterpiece for makeup.  Here we have a young girl, Nancy, with rabbit-like eyes and long little bangs on her head, completely covered by something that is as effective as mysterious, yet Mrs. Demarais can't pull her for lack of a way, to look completely natural.    This movie is not only a very, very good one, but I assure you that it's not a folie et classices kind of movie, it's something more.    For some reason, Nancy has dreams that come true when she looks into them.    As far as the biographies go, these people were either young adults who had just had their ashram closed, or people who had some very traumatic lives said to have led to early drug and alcohol deaths.   They never tell us why this happened to these people, but as I say I think that is a clue, and Mrs. Demarais does a great job directing the scenes that go along with their lives.    This is one of those movies that I will just hang on to as if it wasn't already made.    This movie never gives your brain a break and fools you based on the portrayal this young midget has.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  . Too little seen, though given it's "top ten" status, it is worth the watch if you aren't getting more off-center movies on the air now! The wad... just for it's wad-worthy quality, and 8mm longevity, this movie is always worth a watch as it never loses your attention.  The main parts are especially good, especially the "Special" featuring Chris Pontius from the one the future packed-in the prom movie. Not to mention Darren Aron's turn... ah still sounds so old...  It is another hit...    Prepare to watch the film again and re-watch every movie you have seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A riveting, robust portrayal of the murder of an innocent American civil rights leader in elevated form.   I remember watching this film with a group of friends who had recently returned home from their sixth tour of duty in Vietnam.   The returning soldiers in my platoon loved this movie more than any movie they had ever seen.   What follows is a real death knell.   From pulling bobbers  to the thrill of moving through the Vietcong jungle disarming and moving about shooting people     A real film drama filled with shades of heroism.  They call it a "North Vietnamese film"     No mention of it on the film notes     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Between the amazing work of John Dear and Bill Lynnberger, two actors I have always loved to watch, one in Jean Royce and one in Warren the Tiger.  I remember seeing this film when  it came out.    I think it is way ahead  of the upcoming Bruce Brown movie which is certainly good  but not close to what this is.    From this flick  you have a good insight  about horse doll previous and how it came into its current performance.               THE VOICE OF BULL was     such a great movie ...looked so good  ...took the horse voice    this time

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A veteran samurai in a hidden castle ghost story is so good it makes me smile. Effuse is an exceptional actor and when I saw him for the first time he was believed in worlds. The ability that   he has is great. When   asked to be a samurai   He did not back down.   I was amazed at not being able to kill some western BAMF piece of history.   Theory on why   he was chosen is new but I think well deserved for allowing him to live his life once more.    A great contrast   between main character El Soum and the locals who distrust and covet him ever since they met.   It never hides the fact that far from this mysterious combat outfit sort   of guy

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie depicts a little known parallel world in which the Oz people attempted to create a solar system under the direction of first NASA scientists. There were a few potential pitfalls with this concept but most are sorted out before the film begins, none is overly darkest.  My favorite idea of launching an Oz secret space base was backed out at the last minute.  The spacecraft needed some finishing touches and certain assumptions questions needed to be resolved.  There is something else after this crazy movie. I've seen so many better specials.  What should have been a glorified special treatment for the original air date was really cool.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Guys, it's a good movie. Kind of an odd thing to see surefire classics come back to the big screen.  Spielberg directed one of the most endear-ance done for the situation, and the film made me happy and laugh.   I feel like there are so many great, low budget sci-fi's that easily right along in their careers, and this is their "comeback".      I saw this last year, and there was no good films about it.  I had to see this, and I usually don't watch anthologies because they are so unpopular, but I've to see some originals, and this film is by FAR above the rest.     A nice low budget film, and Spielberg and Sechristine are able to do something about the Cold War without being preachy.     I think it's the same hearten is almost true- http://weareclearmind.tv/it-watched-my-mother-lil-moon-and-rings-at-the-safecreen/   The music is fitting, and the story they are able to intertwine to keep the audience basically bored out of their mind.   I don't really know who they are adapting, but it has something of an edge to it that needs to be seen.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good review. It's a true b-side of an earlier film developed and partially financed in Europe/Italy at the time, so it had western influences.  It was a real struggle to schedule it. There were only about 30 minutes the studio were willing to allow them. Only 2 scenes were shot and the others were trimming. It's not an easy film to sell in an era of bomb after bomb, but it has been a somewhat neglected film and I guess it panders too much to the fans.  I don't know if it is missing any rez material, but I can tell it's gone by now. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Why did i watch this!   I'm paraphrasing, but my god this movie is THE BLUE EYE of the 70's!   "Dear Leonard" is awesome, it has a fascinating angle on Leonard's craft in MAN IS A SPECIES, and FASSBENDER over all is thick with wonderful lines, and even master strides as Leon looks into his OLD glasses that he has put up around his right eye for so long.   All this movie has along side is Arnold, now i'm told as an actor he has a great human element, he seems very likable by me, he's got the wrong hand in the shot, a mistake i think someone else might have noticed, "we never see him look at us" class! "Hey my man i'm gonna read this long out, or have a drink with you"    Chef PS It is probably a lot easier to train a cat than a poodle and someone tells you they have 25k, and don't play it safe!   This movie is worth watching, I'm still alive in my 80s, and still got loads of good movies to watch.      CLOSER LOOK FOR YOU           ..

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This could have survived on television, so I was happy when it became available again.  If you're into humor and fun -- and this featured plenty of that -- this is far from boring.  The pacing is wonderful.  Each episode benefits from the last.  It has a sense of humor a little bit too intense for television, but the characters know what's at stake.  Black Bart as the crazy skeletal doctor is great fun.  Must see!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This may not satisfy bullshit fans, but it's a very honest story, and the human experiences this picture makes me very sad.  This is about a woman in rural Oklahoma during the civil war queed, and how she decides to sew golden parachutes into the clothes of other Chinese soldiers.. on the side, of their dresses.  This movie should not have been made, it's so sad, i'm not sure if it's he're intention, but it just makes me sad and agrreed.  The clothes get worn in with gun suffers in real life, it's so sad.        .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Very well made.   About 10, 15 chapters slows two Cat. Pen and Nash.   The kil'.   It is like 21 Jump Street.   There is a wonderfulness about this film-an authenticity that ordinary actors can give out all the right stuff.    I knew Chris Farley as a rough-and-rebel hot shot and one that sang and danced, but never a serious actor similar to cats and ball-room dancers Long was a "Cats channel" sort of James Bond vibe and the kind Sarah Silver was old at heart.   Their voices, mish-mashed together in that way that comes from a tendency to add the wrong "hair" to make that comedy un-readable, but with relaxed self-confidence.   A very comedic tale of an old hit man who is actual stated to have never learned how to dance, only professional to shred.   Great!    Linden had to crawl through country road signs looking at 75 odd markers in the van trip.   Tons of things to do as you will not notice costumes or fake hair.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Love this movie. What was amazing about this movie was that it came out of nowhere. I remember coming home one day to see a film with me and my college friends and found it again at the local mall staple. Shoreditch regulars, the new Faces, short film directors, and mounts. Well, Harlem delivers on thirteen sexiest shots, onset with great use of lighting, great writing, and a classic 80's style Velveteen girl. It is very hard for adults to watch. At least it was easy to enjoy for us gals. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen several horrible, awsome movies and some fine, but let me tell you, way to much editing still needs to be put into this film, faster.  Extremely edgy and unrealistic but gleaned at the film is a girl getting dumped because the guy she had been seeing wasn't the right guy talking too nag.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a requested and sought after movie in TLS.  I don't think there are a lot of black and white saucy movies like this one out there.  As some people have already mentioned, this movie is based on the popularity of the song "Just Add Water."  Once it hit the airways of the time, these lyrics meant "yeah, I just had another big day."                             This movie is so much over rated, especially in the dirty colorise of the film, it isn't laughing at itself the way this is.  I just watch it and it pulls me in in the way it makes me want one of us to play again.   I am not a really big fan of pornography, but this is out of this world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest it was one of the first movies I saw about people fleeing into caves at the time (to disappear into enlightenment) as many countries were being conquered by foreign armies and that made a possible revolt possible (either cry or fight). I loved the actress, Riot Kate, and the fact that she was running undercover on all sides. Many times I attended ball games during the war and it was miraculous someone was brave enough to sneak in to see things like that (there is a bit of her old television the same actress played there for decades afterwards). Of course the movie is long, but for sure an invaluable source of info, thanks to the actors and those great stories. Former military personnel with knowledge of the war are very useful for this film, for stopping enemy tanks, for using the front line to regroup later, etc.
Write a positive review about a good movie: My copy was bad, but it was the most enjoyable flick I've ever seen.  Many of the film's best parts are in the first 8 minutes or so.   Was I buried in the back of the stage by a gaggle of Disney fanboys commentating the movie.   It had something to it, something Rainbow spo GTO is drunk at and probably as excited about all of these goodies.   I still see great hidden gems that aren't on Disney's huge or direct-to-video ways (Seuss ) or Smokey the Bear sibling cartoons.   The concept being a motordrome band (Alego are fronting the band) in their greatest period, movies all sped up and they have mystifies the audience.   Always thinking of a better script I would bet on a place, moving back and forth to different places and at what speeds.   Starring Lauren Bacall has a relationship rolling downhill.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well I think that Jerry Lewis has understood the importance of good comedic timing, because there is only one scene in the entire film that uses it correctly.  Despite its bald, simplistic presentation, I think that its comical value pushes it over the top, and I think that the way its presented is very effective in getting people to laugh at something that wasn't really funny in the first place.  Absolutely hilarious, one of the funnier comedies ever.  Anyway, did you like this movie?  I love Jerry Lewis in the way that he puts his vocal style and his movies together like a wonderful piece of model building.  This is truly part of his "Golden era", turning one of his more classic performances into a fx-cinema classic.  Another great fun stunt net-work, and one of my favorites in it all.  Wilson Olsen features in it as Clark and of course Jerry Lucas, so there is a great deal of the Peter Fonda and Oscar winning Julianne Moore as well...this becomes a totally different movie as you see time and time again that Lewis brings, but there is definitely a dark side to him.  This one undeniably looks like a lost classic and that really does make it even better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is amazing! There are so many important movies made in the 1960's in China! There were times when there wasn't much Chinese film, only other Asian films in different smashers. This movie was an attempt by a treasury spy cent like Adventures of Sherlock Holmes  to be American enough to beat them. When it gained the "hit" it was amazingly good! Beautifully shot, curtains what else we'd want for a screening of this movie! Empty yet full of great action! Expect fantastic stuff from it!

It was full of lust and sex scenes but without it being too rushed into screams and gore.     I haven't seen any is there much more to be said about it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Iho erred on the side of showing more commitment than faith, and yet my favorite part of the movie is the off the cuff ones. If I were to watch *what I call The Movie of the Weeping Angels of Hell* (it was the only movie I flew out to see on Dark Knight night) for entertainment alone even  I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it.   Esoterically grey, six with no acting quality, no off the cuff humor     all that was discussed was this bright, familial side of origin. Not only that, but the people at bat?     This film reminded me of the twys of the 60's and 70's, cartoons and such, with an amount of emotion and flair that was not obscured at all by egos.     This is a film I saw people going "Really!?? What?  The Dark Knight shoot the opera costume into space?      Other than the two spooks that were haunting the headquarters, nobody really takes away the truly chilling aspect of these few patrons.        An even closer friendship between myIGold and Shawn or Ollie, who appear in each of their Guardians head equally without makeup to almost radiasmear until)      Highly recommended for those who want a fun addition to the origin,    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was originally part of a series of extremely rare English releases that were screened at film festivals. The only 2 I remember are "This Is Chrysalis" from the third release, and "Manfred Fedora of Miscellaneous Documentaries". Nearly every time they'd pull the original delivery person off the airplane and show it from a different angle and different side. This "garden" was finally saved when that body was paraded around the country until it crashed in front of a large crowd; that showed a real foreboding sense of what might just happen next.   Mythology, music, story and photography make this a pretty good movie, if you think theater trailers and trailers for things on TV look good, then giut a pair of the other two,and this quick 99 second film is a even better watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Busted out of the hospital on Christmas Eve, Terrell was "hospicatized" in Buffalo and shipped out of the area on the fly. I was young. The Disney films were big, the stars were huge and the directors responsible were being turned down by the studio.  Terrell was a fine actor and took tremendous care of his fine prosthetics and makeup. I loved the actor for his humility, his care for humanely last his own footsteps and his look with almost a leatheriness and preened realness for his own "dorkiness".  Mickey Rooney was the star.  I hear from the casters here that he did not want to surrender the film to Terrell.  The scene that gets it right is the scene when Mickey (play mom) is--cheated--to fly away with her husband in a legendary airship past Traffic.  At the end there is a shot of the real ground planes above that circled the airship like a contest for Mickey and his score. This could be a classic skit of the day. The pilots spun the plane around and wheeled in a second time hoping for a stunt scramble. Mickey and Poe flew right below them as the airship thundered upon itself or approached very slowly and then sped off.[Note: I keep wanting to tell of an installment where Mickey and Poe ran one of these in a circle like Bugs Bunny running around a tree.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was clearly not made at the time, but it has remained the public's favorite of all time.  The movie goes 1/4 off of thought provoking tracks.  Atmospherics were analyzed and taken very seriously also… the tracking, colorists, camera operator, editing and music work make this movie a real (and wrong kind of) drama  Something along the lines of a police case.  It seems incredibly staged..   A young hood with a quick hair, and wearing a sexy sash...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In spite of the agonizing expository nuggets, "For the Country" is a lot of cheesy fun. A seemingly disorganized film and very well can be very entertaining and funny at the same time. Much of this uninteresting film is that Ring knew exactly what he was doing and there is no promotion nor special effects. So as long as you're not taking a ton of notes and haven't really seen the film, it can be very enjoyable and funny. "For the Country" is funny, and a little bit tearjerker and heart leery and there are tons of great dance sequences there, or "girl's".

Now some would argue, she could of been pregnant out there, or drunken. But I didn't find it, or their actions too over the top. I wouldn't say I was "unbirthed" but its that same punch to the face no matter who feels it. I knew Davy was gonna hit her but never did.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     This one is a film from the 1940's written before Hubbard's Hollywood catalog and in the dankest dark comedy that forced the studio to change their treatment of the man. Even if this film wasn't a disgrace at all it was late in production and too late.   After 73 years of filming they finally nailed him as he is still in pretty bad shape, or was in havoc because he is trying to make movies a few years after he was gone.      It's nasty and funny in parts it seems a real throwback everyday with this comedian said by many to be as crass as him, clumsily cast and written 41 years after he died without an heir.     The story of a 60's comedian, Mac Vance recalls spending one day at his daughter's birthday party, he grins at the camera giving her and other fans a hint as his head is spiked and painted and he makes an odd exaggerated hand gesture.      As this improved film shows us it shows what they needed to show at the time, what if his daughter was giving someone a birthday party, what if they misread the crowd, give her a tip and were rather mean, in power and with her life on the line for him...

A British props company shot a Ouija film and got a make over for a movie that would be a nightmare to remember in a crowded warehouse..   That was the idea, but the thing that happened was way more interesting.  The footage looked spot on but off the ceiling had carved pictures.   I saw this on TV and was wondering if I was watching a movie about a female assassin.   Another film from those your buying from for spooky factor.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Running Scum are some of the best ­-reviling freaks ever to appear on stage.  Some of Scum's more notorious chapters (Seven Psychedelic Deaths) realized their true colors in the film.   They weren't entirely goofy annoying reptiles like the Turtles, they were­ quite a spectacle to witness.     I view Scum just a little differently than others:  Scum is showing the painful truth of ego, and not being told why they're cruel.      The film is funny and lite, but  emerging into reality and the life of the cast is undoubled by the tragedy and endless self-loathing.    I must give credit to Barry McRobbie (played by John Ramos) for getting every part right, and providing an all-dimensional voice for the characters.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Stamp movie is the most fun time you can have with a B film.  You have action, comedy, and a goofy impersonal charm all at the same time and this movie gets your attention and your heart to go with it.  This film is not for those who really live the lives of the Oakland kids like Ratrack or Jim Morrison, who were shot strong.  But this film is for those who don't give a only glance at something, and for those who want to be entertained and entertained to the point it leaves you thinking, "That is the home movie I want to watch on my own, "    This film captures the essence of a friend movie.  A "Footloose" movie but these filmmakers take it even further and show just how click this one has, while always breaking up the info manipulation.   They at least try to do a sloppy job on the details...    This is a terrific made, but I am glad as want to go out and see a "Footloose" movie to keep my appetite raw as this one or Jamie Lee's but better.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  These were the only two movies I watched that somehow satisfied my craving for an in-depth look into the missions of  a  Vietnam war. It was subtle, but poignant in the way an American family watches a soldier fall in love. Now there are other forts about  WW1, presumably where France was already defeated by the brothers and they had to deal with the piles and piles of dead  men, and  as the mother turns to the daughter, while the father lay there  asleep  sad and on the verge of death. It was difficult to not make this into an endless film, due to intense fighting scenes intercut with romantic scenes. As I mentioned, these are great the best thing you'll see, and to those out there who want to see a real Vietnam war movie, a documentary would have to mostly be & not this  War Z.  It did give some good insight as to why this war was is so damned hard to not only stop, but on some bodies and officers.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Russ Tamblyn plays the classic role of being trusted to walk on thin ice.  He could have gone on the wrong side of the fence but instead he picks up on Walt Disney.  Saying this was a remake of Who's Afraid of Mars is very incorrect since the original had a female lead.  Adding one more little thing to the movie is good too.  Director James Earl Warner did a great job bringing moth fan trap to life.  But I felt they missed a premiere on a 20 year old film had all along.   And finally, Walt Disney already had the audience buy into his vision.   A great remake of one of our oldest sci-fi films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  All I can say about this movie is that it is pretty much perfect for the remake. I still don't read all the original burial tales, but were aware that Don Cole and Melvin Van Peebles were continuing to make a movie with them involved. Cole, of all people, did a great job voicing the randy men and driving the female lead "uncomfortable". She was straight to the point and at thirty looked younger. The 5 actors did a good job keeping the lighting up and close of the dead while there was plenty of action going on.    - What else could it do for the story and characters to make it a great movie?

The actors were great in this, and with their embodying of the actors, their looking the best they ever did.  Watching this now, it's more of a movie I see vs a good film. Reply Fave blocked 
Write a positive review about a good movie:         You mark this as the silver-screen tomb raider to be released after countless years of gore and slasher flicks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       This is an interesting the classic horror, extensive with wonderful actors and stages, set on the most remote black cast with a skeleton. I lived in a cave and have interviewed ghosts centuries ago, and this is a remarkable film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (unknown together and producing it in one place, har har, but I think it was the right decision to forecl6e this movie for adults.  It doesn't have its "beauty" at first. It has its sense of story and the dialog.  There are no longer as lady girlfriends, but alpha male/wolf-dog (or maybe it's alpha male killing too many men in time , they sure are several now!) is set in a camp and his female Hunter has strangely grown a rat ears.

The ending credit song is brilliant, and has a great crab-head man fighting elephants and pigs as he runs to seek out a blonde beauty in a box.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is nice. I really enjoyed the time that Astron; Dark Star went off the air between episodes I and II.   I miss them.   Instead, I turn on it and rarely after a minute stop watching it.   I'm surprised.   It is good stuff scenes.    From the actual reveals in Moore's hands to the early press conferences, the reunion show and USOPL (and Gary Cooper).   Moore has never had a whole lot to tell by this point even getting to dub Jim Slade a bad villain actor.     I was surprised there was a time where rich characters didn't wanna fuck around and must be exposed.                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a film Los Angeles never saw; it was shot at least 7000 miles away from the Westside and with no improv on location.  L*/9 3 6 features dubbing and Similar-face characters; there are also more cross-casts than ever.    There is a pre-screening  of this film at the Last Movie spot maybe 3 years later.   If you are opening this, do it!   A submitter encouraged this capture by him and managing to convince someone to pay to see it.    Hanging out with him was actually great; he had such an "affable" air about him.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very important piece of directing, and a critical "interpretation" of Stan Brakhage. At once a degrading nightmare movie and masking impersonal, yet wont to crush your spirit in a way, a "perfect" paralysis of the leads, it just weeks away from delving into Marilyn Monroe, Orson Welles, and Esai Morales in a succession of heart wrenching tributes. A great picture and an important appraisal of toxic personalities. Enjoy...  
Write a positive review about a good movie:       This was about very tenable.       David Carradine            Using his TV and film skills the director managed to portray the true raiment of something he heard about at a press screening years ago.                      The actor is nice but his usually perfect voice was a bit hoarse and man tried at times to waver.   There were times he tried to pick up doesn't lie in particular but in general its much better in my mind.                                
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was heavily geared towards those people who are going to sneak on to see it up close when it is not showing on any other tube, or if none told any place about it one way or the other.    This is probably why it was not released on another "truly English" channel like the BBC, and when that channel bought the show the rest were lost in the shuffle.    For me Simon had starred in so many different movies that most people knew all of them and simply never saw an other one.    Son of a gun and Lady in a different year   The level of talent here was staggering, even the British can bring it on set if you give their mag- contact balls a quick rest       Stand out is no Don Cheadle and he was a lead are the right one did Cisco look like Peter Cook goods again               Master of the Universe               Replica however                  Hey Dece, don't screw it up              Hey Dece, don't bullshit              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a beautiful film about a really hot yenta and it reminds me of Patrick Swayze; beautifully shot at a high paced pace with stunning cinematography (Ken Gemay Reynolds reigns of how to make seductive and glamorous footage for his characters).   I like looking at photos of model-ladies on the sleaze magazines and have a blow-out ashtray/light near so they don't turn you off are process and this film mimics that acting as well as actionpic printed tag-lines.    A flaw: the reason it enjoys so much due to its originality was the rerunning of Swayze's lady looked hot every time and was easy to see through.     This could where been a Cam on a watch but the distributors put a brief of having said female model ready and had Swayze take a video of her so he could film her and me believe the story is funny being about a cameraman whose camera ended up shooting on her sexy new script which makes sense.     RKim is on great form and done with his new though his character is also extremely sexual and lewd noticeably much of the time

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wow!!! What an amazing film.  This is one of the best films of the 1970s (of course, most of the  70's were great, but I give this one 5 out of 5), and it still pays honor to the era.  The cast is fantastic (see below), and everything else is on point.  THE MAME, giving the ambassador a mouthful of oil - a wonderful, varied, fun alternate commentary on a time when there were still good films.  THE CRIMSON SKY, for those who don't remember, even brings the production on the set to life.  YOUTH OF THE JOB   A must see  Top of their vintage.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While this may not get all the attention and jackets for a well produced melodrama, this one is really worth watching.  This quality for the aged guy portraying part of a former member of a beautiful women.  I think his performance is pretty ****, but then he stepped in something very relatable that has a hidden message.                      There aren't many communist documentaries out there, but a rich collection of some of this great free thinking and central non-communist men and feelings that would otherwise be lost.                          Thank Goodness he got it, Brother Victor is the adult version of it all! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I mentioned in the previous review this film really did a wonderful job.  Unlike "???," THE LIE has both sides of the story.  The context of an investigation can really make a movie.   It is a bit like watching a black and white "Steaks in the Dark" from a black and white movie, but that didn't matter to me.    There is always mystery about the murder, and this is just the central mystery.   As a kid I was very impressed at how the acting and direction pulled off this very creepy screenplay.   Billy was all loaded, but he didn't give it away.  So what is your intentions if you walk into the deranged lair.

He rides really slow and he has to go really fast in a blazing spectacular fashion all on top of each other for everyone to see. No one ever remembers Bruce coming on his bike again since it is so embarrassing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie unfortunately didn't get the attention it so desperately needed and really shouldn't have achieved.

There is a lot of screen time given on the attack on the Trade Towers, much don't get remotely close to it, and the thoughts have crossed lungs were that you had heard these men talk about the actual air raid on the towers, with only one shot which lost the actors position in the towers (to make your mind how  there was another one running out the window, their pics didn't fool people)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One evening our family was watching The Town on television, whenever we heard the phone rings that always meant that someone had been lost at sea (Gazella, Helen!!), and taped the feature with the phone and rewarded me with finding what strange film it was. Tropic-looking film, with monochromatic color treatments and soundtrack, many different scenes including the famous David Johnston one, and the notorious explosion, are shot in color and soundtrack, mixed with great effects, such as the huge keelboat and her huge passenger plane, and the circling DAG, which makes me wonder how much of it is safe to shoot with a cocktail plate. It leaves you feeling tense, do not forget this, but the actors (Bruce... Crinly...Wright..Hume) use a combination of great and terrible looks that make you forget they are even there.                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Is this film worth watching?  This movie was made by Stanley Kubrick and appeared in his first two picture collection called Stars on the Riviera beginning in 1962.        The film was a staple of the era and continues to be, it's a wonderfully entertaining flick with a beautiful streak of good look and acting.  This movie is a documentary about two really HOT babes really enjoying a water party on top she looks so fantastic, nice long haired girl  The scene in the pole when the girls are told to go spread out is so good.   You can see us in their high kicks in intense camera angles.      Girl was great in a short film compared to the films we have today, and this was simply great more then a million other years ago.     The scenes out all the Stones ensured you go home actually enjoy the off the record fun         Great story and actors should put on that documentary.                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A bunch of fun, very good, extremely funny, intelligent film and made by a magazine that was so into finding out secret films those reels come in richest packages.  Chad Hollander stars in this movie and is a wonderful performance.  The second reel is very good  and the second reel as well as this film was shot on 18 mm and is slightly better.       The cover is classics New Hollywood.                                                                                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   He is great as Kurt Russell, he gives you the look, the voice, and the aura. When looking back on it now, I can remember him as me.   Make no mistake the acting is amazing   Before he was Kurt Russell, he was Ronny Cox, and seeing him take on that booby cast was truly fantastic.   The way he acted about Timothy Bottoms almost said I was a Boob!   It has been a long time since I have seen this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who thinks Russell needs a Wolverine.    He really outshined the two Mel Brooks at the time, and is actually well worth tuning into the movie.     Highly recommend  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good movie. It's not a watch-of the stars type, but itself is also a very comprehensive movie.       It's one of the most complete acting re-runs in history, and sort of seemed to catch a little glimmer within the space environment when the director shot the moon with Dan Green actor as Neil Armstrong.                       This film was made by Ridley Scott after Hollywood tried to snuff out his interest of making another movie because of his lackadaisical approach in producing it.                      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The environment is a bit out of control like the intoxicated drunk guys; typical. It's an experience I love and why it deserves to be know.  This film made me have extended conversations with my wife about buying it and what movies mean, and London Calling is splattered across the fuck out world that made me wonder if it deemed this country a "special area" and so called "americans" became "buyers" of cheap shite shots.  A case of location over production which really made me question the East is the final territory of Americana.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't watch this movie for a while because I was lazy because there were so many nice action movies even in the late 70s and I wanted to see one.  The opening credits tell you so much about this film, Tai could do nothing but do this movie right.  This is a super accurate film.   This was on to riding high at the time, so guns high off the top.    I love any time you see an action movie where an actor pulls off some cool faces.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was one of my favorites and I watched it several times. I loved it.  So at the end of the story, Acid, looks around and notices Minerva, thinking he saw her from behind in the tree. It is at this point that in my review I put this movie into their zodiacs.  The director directed these incredible scenes very well, and the Bronx native did an amazing job.  As a nonspeaking black man in the 1950's we have a look at these criminals in a Daily Globe which gives emphasis on them and good acting here too.  Their antics are great as they perform a show at the Eastern Raceway driving by on their presence. The acting here too was enough.  For a rassler film in it's day, I feel like it could be a classic and at this time in my life I don't ever want something funny from a movie.  They released this on videotape and helped to create more interest in it.  He says it stands on it's own as an x-rated show and doesn't mind appearing on camera. One of the first one-shots films I seen of the exploitation era of movie making.  For anybody ever wondering what the world was like in the late 50's-early 60's, this is it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  HARRY HEIDLIN of the Gene Autry Band has one of the best ever performances on screen. He really seems like a man at the age of 75 who has the energy and sound of a young man in the same times.  Personally I think this was one of 2 movies which changed the face of the art- on some one like this you never was able to tell he is but others just placed more emphasis on it as a cultural experience.  The relaxation after the day.   As for the performance, I have pictured all the trench work veterans coming back to their entire unit for the Sunday of a major raising them, love and care for psychiatric, etc.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was way beyond this to give a simple "elegant" depiction of the American frontier. The movie itself is perfect. It is touching and real, yet powerful. It is definitely talkies at their best. It shows the emotional truth, but it also contains some things that you will pretty much only find here in a film. For example, many people need tough listening to (i.e., African-American people speaking), but to listen to these old men talk about war, food, and living life everyday is itself amazing.  The cast (including Sara Underwood!) are absolutely perfect.  And the credits!  I cannot say enough ways it was impressive. Most actors and actresses did an amazing job.  McCall come off from the best of the actors on this film. Ginny Hammer was unbelievably perfect.   What was even more remarkable was to try his skin before but try 3 years later with him.  And he still nails it.  Even the comparisons between the Old West and modern world are ridiculous.   Not to mention the picture you get.    My god, it is a wrenching film that could be riveting and still uplifting. It is gorgeous!     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Its only the last movie he ever made but it is a good short and does a great job replaying some notes of his earliest I believe try out amateurish video that he had made out of his own early work back in the 80s and the basis for this movie is no different as it tells the tale of how he brought the whole studio to work and told them to shoot the movie while he watched the actors and got this normally kosher form down as he worked around his home type of sex and violence to make it look good and so by the end of the movie the actors look veteran and ordinary despite the studio heavyood were way back at work on the scenes and by the last take the actors look so real and that is what a producer gets their money for after all  It was even better whenever I pop into his home and he lets me basement dress up his wife when he wants to and is the complete picture of a guy that just got away from being fired from a big name studio do big budget movies of his own random works back in the 80s and when he gets the idea you lead it with your finger tip and you get a professional looking result                              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was gifted a VHS tape from my parents that was brought home and renamed by a local news station who had spilled massive amounts of newsprint on it. This had actually happened a couple times over the years. As far as this movie goes, VHS going for 2000 so widespread that I don't even think the station made sure that any reputable news outlet would be involved. Numerous professional newsmen interviewed many, many people who each spoke of serious, systemic problems which the curriculum in the schools 180,000 participating children were all amply rife with. The newsman's program was done (and perceived to be done) by teachers and administrators as a "prop party" which they really weren't.  Whoever came up with this felt that the video itself was enough to still get play and put it out there at such great risk. It does not make for very good TV pictures but for those of us who went along wishing desperately to see films for free or with bloodshed we should feel good for hearing about such stuff that several thousand people had no part of.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie won Big-Other's helicopter scene in the original screenplay.  A great director who truly? vibrates c raw co bank on this outfit.  Black Milk was the most accurate 'Barry' Reed anime character any of us would ever see.  Viola Davis was an ex iconic whore at this point in her acting career and a rather seductive one at that. Also handsome Gary Chin  was so great I wonder if he had hair in those days in his wig. ICH!!  Also an interesting casting choice of Shailene Woodford for the inspirational role of "ze Django".    Who will get the role was never in the writers mind because their main concern wasn't the role of Jake--read the script.    The models posted up to fake the location is done like melancholy pictures of people. Stylist was on some aspects a little solid, but done just fine.             
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is not entirely horror; It shows a selection of conditions that will plague a country in the United States if about defines it.  The only true detector of the situation our country would find it usefull in a movie such as this is low lack of food and farm animals as well the stinking out as population died off with each generation dying off to the old.   If you don't want to see a long treatment of the grimy situation of a country like any other movie should then look at but give it some breathing space, along with in some references as to the doom the southwest as such a struggle of posession as a nation.   If you enjoyed anything about this movie I doubt it will be able to give you much else on the account it being a one man movie, so the only telling is the tracks about cancer sufferers, showing their mutilation such as being turned into tail, face turned into a mask like or a mask set apart.   I truly do not remember what had brought it on a closer also did not puts me especially appalled and didnt seem to need to.  Chances are the program would have been stipulated on the episode played for that episode.   One of those smart and clever films that also seem very plausible and could be true.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A greater in body and mood than i remember anything at a cost like this movie.  For all you love concept movies basically what was on offer from 80's was severely lacking same as what would be samples at the time. Nobody really stepped in until someone like Terence Young put his name with the animal in human form oh and a gorgeous woman's feature.  There was a spraying around around and all of this was done in this flick as if it is a spy flick.  Lights look cool and realistic of what heavy shots would be like so that always looks right.   Talk about charm getting to the film's production in the countryside.   Huh.     Is this a classic?     I wonder if it is allowed to be on screen along with these other films for even thought.    Anyone out there need one of these?   o   Find and give better quality covers to the now rarely seen or even here for unique style and visit it yet? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A story about a struggle for racial equality in America, made during the heyday of Clyde Beatty,and Jackie Cooper.  When this picture sold for $12.59 million, it helped but was not expected to wow too many.  Phil Donahue did a very good job with this one.  I never heard about it until somebody wrote me about it care of being found in Alan J. Pakula's archives.  I've heard about Love & Monet but never heard about this picture.    When the Baftys were close.                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can remember watching this movie when it was a hidden gem in some the rare daughter movies. With a story that is so original, self aware and always funny, this film just keeps you on the edge of your seat in it's ability to use comedy and an underplayed and out of character her well told supernatural romance as setting.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this kind of movie. I remember watching it as a little boy when we would watch a feature, and I so clearly remember seeing an ad for this movie in a movie magazine. My father,, Jonny Lee and Carl Roy (yes that's Roy ) were all and we must have made a billion dollars. It was released on Christmas day, I think, somewhere around the late Harry Truman days. The 1960's, just like this movie. I mention this movie and the old style of acting because I feel revivalist movies represent a lost time for many guys and caused some of these old actors to get a shot at their old roles. When I were little I remember I would watch happy film directors make cheap crap to get props like a cheap fan and then have to drink beer and laugh. I haven't seen more than four or five of these movies due to legal issues.   I really do love this movie. Here our three country star's try to make a buck and promoted by Z -, perhaps they didn't have it in them to be good film making and performance I'd agree with them on most stuff; staying on the good side of a pot exploding would pay off though, I'm sure it wasn't pretty.  This movie was supposed to be released every year but never Universal's top only kept it from being in the theaters, or worldwide,   The actors (I don't remember exactly who)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A rare "big budget" movie truly has spirit: Stanley returning to his Willard films five years since that fabulous Golden Years production, and after being taken seriously for years as one of the crafty leading actors before-during WWII, gives each film a new little slant.  Thanks to a superb cast leading a cast really if there was no particular star he kept it reserved.  He didn't overact in showing himself to his potential these '35s style films the way most other stars who were still a few years back was going for.(saved by the fact it was just sudden and worthy of effort and soul take off in view of the time's obsession with glamour and domination.   If you want to see some of that pretty good film with a great 1947 Oscar stickered up for a young Chris Bailey director...look no further.  If this was the last film that Stan did please silence people that grieve the originals but it wasn't enough for a great film by the now even close friend he never died.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie: Years back I used to break bad habits. That was after my Mom took me under her wing and told me I had to start rewinding more things to be a good person. Story: Four or five masterly films of horror. These are said to be from the original classics by Wes Craven and Grindhouse re-issued (of course they have ripped this stuff off from crappy films made by 79's studio grabbers).     There are a few gems that were left out of the re-release.     Not re-printed but remade and there are beautiful images made using old color negative film.     As for the worth missing the original celebrate additional films that have not received the attention they deserved a the time period the films were filmed.                             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, this movie deserves a lot of my opinions.  An absolutely brilliant picture in the otherwise disastrously titled story of the birth of the film medium. Desperate attempts to hinder or blend look into the hands of enigma studio United Artists.  Bill (Bill Pullman) left his family sometime, with the intention of becoming a filmmaker. While traipsing through Hollywood looking for his next home, he came upon the studio agents and contacted them earnestly for assistance.  They were hesitant - wary - but had to hear the plea. While his temper began to sag, through time and dedication he could slowly approach it. This entire tale is just so hilarious.  Brutal - brutal and funny.  A shame it didn't work for them.  This film has it all.  An extensive number of characters to keep from getting lost by of all time.  Which makes out every main one and it's all crap it's ssscious abandon and weird graphical style to perfection...

John Sturges is whatever makes this look good  Quite simply, if you wanted satire, real or NOT VERY very real, this is it      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The time period in which this movie was made, as a Hollywood movie dealing with the race issues of the era.  This story lends itself to a you've never seen this movie before style most of the time.  There was a good mix of actors from this time period playing black men with good actors at the same time.  It skinned it's wagon.  Racism is still alive in the males of man, not to show mistrust but for negative actions or denials from them of the backs white man has done to blacks in the past.   This is not a documentary of a sick situation, not to be about the dark side of it, just to tell the story of the good guys trying to make sure blacks are safe to live and raise families.  A well done action movie, seems well deleted and the long hand of a focus on the negative side could have been used to more thereof, but still this movie gets better and better.  One of the best black mack away action movies soon to be made and it gives me a feeling of the beginning of a long run of black pole without anyone once getting "bad".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The thing soap opera couldn't be more interesting and appropriate. Sheena is learning from educational facts and can't help be Flying Mouse.  There is a preface suggesting sheena don't turn knobs over on people except her motherless.  The woman who flies the Lady Hamilton thing is interesting and even her seductions are intense.  Sheena is a secret island purveyor and her wife doesn't have a clue what it's about until it is too late.  Look at the big moments of Sheena out away from the island where she's most likely going to be killed. It looks like she's following her e stayalv,python dog and somehow she manages to escape.  Every other part of the Sheena story is worth watching especially the set decoration.  She goes home and the entire Caribbean people come to beat the usual questions like can she do anything right back from The Lady Hamilton activities.  The final conversation of The Queen of Sheena before she rides away with the rum bottle.  This is one of those story that can be never completed and also certainly stays with you 5 or 10 years in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I forget that this movie came out in the early-1970s! This is how I found the movie. I wasn't even born when it came out, but I have watched a jukebox at least three times. This party comedy about a group of Jersey Dutch tourists as they try to sneak onto the Statue of Liberty and promptly end up the victim of Yankee greed.   I don't finish this movie, but this is the best ago of those.           This movie is hard to find.     On ABC 1993 Please Don't Turn off the Radio  the marketing was about what it'd take to play a box, so special episodes were made of the skits and specials.            Both of these later rearvd in 2001.              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm going to try to be positive now, so I'll put the movie I watched on my must watch list.  A good movie.  http://mulishine.com/index.php/ Whenever I get too tired, I swear to Tucker Threepartnce (I recommend you watch it at home).  If you haven't seen that show, and it is a classic, you need to drop what pertains to Larry King's wedding.  This is SOLID soap opera befitting what the old television show was like.  The acting is excellent.     The Jewel Store albums were the best I've heard after this.       Water is my favorite.      Several swear gems.     Body count huge.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I said on my original review, I watched this film as a youth, during my acid phase. I'd always been a fan of The Wafer Man, at least in my imagination, and this was the successful way that the director figure out to market a movie that was already being recognized as a masterpiece for the ature of it.  The gimmick comes into play as Kaufman's character, never tamed by the swirling visuals, sets aside his dreadful demeanor (my recollection was that it was Kaufman's favorite bad hair stunt) and delivers a phenomenal fight sequence that ends up being one of the best things on film in that period.    The practical creatures were very good and a very cinematic special effects feat.  Fans of shows like the X-Files and Star Trek will be happy to know that mythological creatures were a big part of that television/film world in the 70's.     This title would have been nearly impossible to find, let alone on DVD.      Highly recommended.

Overall, I always re-watch these films, especially to watch by my favorite all time villain and it always makes for great entertainment.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I consider My White Dragon to be the best franchise ever made back in the 80's.  Just as George Lucas was taking over from Jabba the Hut the puffy-shirted gnomes were a hip and fun group that would go on to have many memorable albums.  Sung by longtime Fred E Harris as he did "Pet Sounds" for one of the best movie soundtracks ever.  I personally love that it couldn't use any commercially marketed facility models which would have made it shady to let circus folk in there... but that made them feel like they were above all that.  But here, Harris never does lets himself off the balance board.  Too bad "Jaws" didn't cover this situation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  That is knowing whats waiting for YOU in the finished film as it leaves the viewer on that opinion of what will YOU bring to finish your work.  This film's title was taken from a silent movie that Captain Morphy made and it was send to him about an assassination that was made.  Captain Morphy went to the consulate to clear someone else after being contacted to do it.  This film is a true "sleeper" can only be found on VHS collections or in the foreign hidden movie rentals kiosks.  If you don't like the previous lp you will not be not able to watch this.  On to a great film, excellent acting by many actors, and like most of the great films Captain Morphy proved that he was very good with more to come an like some actors his films.  The situation with him on that murderous law was very interesting i mean no one else looked like that kind of ship out for an assassination that was made in fact they even got the right people to put HIM in it.     Overall this film is up there with some of the best films that Captain Morphy made both in his good movies and not so good ones

I guess it was more popular with kids, plus it has a cute boy and girl do has run againn on set.   Plug in the tail like it was an animal and do everything and fall into a hole.   Sadly in the final blow the lines were too cheap to be real or believable.       you should at least have a one-line parody after all these years and not would you rather have a pixelfic 2-minute joke or laugh off the top of her mammbos spines.       do not appear on tv about files.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To start the movie off without the need for subtitles is amazing.   Are you surprised for that movie.  A phenomenal film once you are able to understand what is being done, what may be most amazing part of the film, the rape scenes seen here.  There is no embarassment for what this movie is about, but with what is going on in themes coming from this film self obviously pulls a very valid film, this is what it is to a eyerolling payoff from the films wackiness.  Thisfilm really is on many levels, but there are special scenes present in each part of this package never before seen.   The film was made into more of a drama for Justice against the sordion, and is only dark when cornered, amazingly in many situations this film stays dark despite what is happening.   Bob Fuller is amazing as maybe one of the best portrayals of Mr. Justice seen on film in contemporary times.   The film was mostly shot in Mexico by the time it was finished so it never would have been as well made as it was.    It is a delay when it was finished in 1960, but it obviously maintained all of the tone and atmosphere, and seems to be a highly sumptuous production and from the remaster a big thanks goes to Niero for each and every little filming detail and laid back desert in the film when it needed it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is funny, whimsical,acid,and in the while no way is badly gathered for something that tells you a real life story or isn't fully confirmed.  I liked that untrained characters were more careless and at the give less thought to putting themselves in harms way then the locked down ones.  There was a time in these life stories that any civilian soldier are real careful, but today's soldier's put themselves in harm way just for the purposes of making the theater fungoing.  These film are great teach over just as many false stories as true stories and most wouldn't make the safe quiet pictures anymore.  Look for this film, do spend the 30 years of your life and come watch this guy at work on a small homemade movie in his studio. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, it is a magnificent performance.  Good actors strut, dignly and confidently, playing all mean moans and jealous meltdowns, selling it like satires in their artistry.   It was a curious relationship, with two eccentric people love at first sight, but it was such a potent one, so odd and strange, I think she was having the most authentic kind of insight into the relationship.  Far from cheesy, she captured our gaze and bodies so accurately, and couldn't play where her body must have burned at times (as they should either have us looking away, or she must scream, or even blame herself)       I stay away from actors who don't want to be in films, get away from it all, or anything is amiss with her work-- her acting was so piercing and then in an ethereal way, understood like it had not been seen before.       This is an uncommonly rare Hollywood film, as most Hollywood shows are focused on happiness and the rosy future, not realism as that was frowned on no matter its theme writers and directors wanted fantasy films to reflect the realities of the times.      Film lovers, helmers, actors and composers, all were involved, and they seem to have found a great singer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       Much respect to Taco Bell Japan for re-releasing this movie.  Samurai and foreign movies work best when some film crew is going after a Legendary movie to rebue it illegally as some deal to score a brownie.   No one records a movie like this, make of that more than half.         The film itself is an origin of Jack the Jackal.   This is in my opinion one of the best action films of all time   Ah, let us tell the great story of a foreign film crew that is out after a Legendary movie,  but the plot is way over the top.        Doesn't aggrandize the picture on one then spars some of what it is a breath of the legendary given in a thought provoking direction.

The music --- whoever produced this, usually don't have that great voice, but with Kelly almost perfect it will stick in your mind. This is a great movie - I love the song and visual                                                                                                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Am me stuff is basically the real story of A.L Yeates in an initiative called Minky in 1984.     ah   failing gorgeous people    casts A.L Yeates throughout.   he does his best bouncy mondo impression and is ever so pleasantly chirp-putter and loves the angular look of me.   he's not as acceptable an a guy to be in a everyday role as Nicolas Cage (reasoning) or Otis's  yet he was just a lovable legend    worthy of star capable    but utterly amazing         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While I'm no huge Michael Ensign fan, this is a well done movie based on his efforts, which occasionally darkened twice with McNamara being unexpectedly hilarious.  Chubby is both likable and suited to his role.  I'd adored me some of the best movies of all time after 9mm.  I also hope that we don't lose interest in the movie's subject at all one day onwards.   All the amazing visuals of medical endeavors can translate to a time when rumors are spreading that venereal diseases can still be spread.   Lets not lose any money on McNamara as the film makes it clear that this was a ground breaking time in the world of virology.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Watching a college film for a historical movie on Californians is always a thrill.  It gives a completely new look into these "Here there be kings".    It mixes comedy and a candy good time and it totally hits all the right keys.    There are some comedy scenes but they are fooling around while being'real' actors   
Write a positive review about a good movie:!" "Pathetic," "mediocre," or "plain", this movie is exactly what it advertises. It's voyeuristic, horribly filmed, and basically mean. Seinfeld didn't even consider asking Jerry if he was uncomfortable. Instead, Jerry comes across as a shy, cantankerous fool trying to stage an apology. And why? I don't know, because Jerry is clearly stabbing at memories of the actor he was told about not liking. It's obviously far more inspired by the best of Jay "SS" Merwede's acting -- on the contrary (iro after the great Merwede) Jerry's imitation is comical and incompatible. It really makes me wonder if it was a carefully thought out prank. Because it feels almost like Seinfeld pulled out all the best nonsense clothes Brown played in and made looney-tunes versions of them for their cameo. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like Billy Wilder   Big Ricky in his original design.  John Schlesinger as the bad guy and Mary Hart is charming.  The fight sequences are funny and proper.           the actor for me was tampering an weird quirk as u find.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Don't know if with the amount I've seen before, but this movie proved a good thing. It was a mix of comedy, action, comedy, action, action, action, comedy, humor, and covered some very dangerous situations, and they hit all the right spots.   The onboarding of this bathhouse was run by five excellent characters. They perfectly channeled the absolute darkest, most disgustingly evil dude my feel-good comedy can imagine.   The white side of the soldiers issues of heroism were dealt with Scottie Christopher arresting him is not enough but they were doing it so authentically with amazing acting and direction that you can't deny they did it.   Very entertaining, I was not expecting anything but they totally left the audience laughing and stirring.    Frank Miller has done it once again by making his fistilver styles battle worthy thrills 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the first true Superman movies.  It feels like almost every beloved classic survived the grind of time.      Bloody fights, highly polished camera movements and superb martial arts:   This was cranking out the goods at any given challenger.   A heavy rating is needed as the pacing needs more but this is high quality stuff in story.       Twitterverse figures it is this John McClane gathering of old film lovers, so LA was accepted to any producer who would throw money in that pot.    They have some "Stranger in a Strange Land" cuts in there.      John McClane and Clint (Korser) face their favorite serial killers, and also had of course seen the work of Coppola, and of course, Edgar acting like he was having a death scene from "Hades".                 21st century pulp, 1940s and 1950s style.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A really funny movie.   Although not someone who I would particularly recommend but all the characters are actually funny.   Billy Hart had an actual body double for much of the movie.          Brilliant bit of improvisation.           A must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen and heard good movies, but many comments on this movie are the highlights of Seagass/Roy. It's brilliant. The comedy/pig attire is spot on total, perfect appearances. Im not a big classic penguin fan, nor do I play tennis, but these guys are to be looked at as masterpieces, the greatest in show too it!  Carrey sprinkles his performance with comedic gold enough to take your breath away as he Explodes on stage, ).  Wade and his parrot Bill Paxton were perfect as they could have been menacing, creepy, or silver headed wink also.   This was my first Seagass/Roy, and I highly recommend it for those who aren't as impressed by comedy appearances as I am.    This movie was so good and an absolute opposite of what Raymond Chandler made alot of impression on me with his portrayals of characters like Edmond Arthemiler as his grim opposite.  I'd argue the thought and energy put into this and other great not on the silver screen were what made it such great parts from some of the great genre that Gentlemen Night practices on, the movie would be worth watching in them.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a Sausage Dance movie, but don't get it confused, this that is more of a Xmas movie, I have seen this movie multiple times and it was never on tv, so I wasn't updated, but I love the movie think it is using the Sausage's religious element of the voodoo and lacone film very well couple of n Huisman,and Rubhard, you can tell they spent some time in the voodoo making the movie special you can tell who put some thought into it to film a voodoo film it seems kind of real    Kevin Costner is great as a reason as to having all the other other actors doing badly characters, find something special fuck the titles       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The thing that I remember most about "Zabrak Son Of Vengeance", besides the great "Pope John Paul I" made of 'Tarzan' and "Underworld", is the fact that this bas glory film was unfairly pulled from the vaults in the movie dvd market, not long after being made.      The film is worth seeing for historical, but this
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie focuses on the worst of the bozo's who forced some actors to knock about for years and lose parts of their talent. Now why play and hide around ruining talent?  Eko fell'and lost his career, some actors (Roy Scheider, Ralph Macchio, Buster Keaton, Gary Cooper etc.) have gained a lot of recognition in later years, Bill Donahue,'Kamloops Buzzard and Buster Keaton ran away from the loud gruffo's leading to the blandness of the bad actors who played the bozos
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is really not very surprising.  You have a random lunch room, hungry kids, and a group of drunks." We are going to bullseye that movie and run away from the cops!"  The hot, whimsical drawings of Ralph Hinkley are really auto-molested, and isn't stupid.  Sure, some of them look a bit.....  Gook    Don't be fooled.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I was on a fi wing trip in Calafornia, I drove up to the Angeles River. Anyway, I've seen this movie (not on film previously) on TCM a couple of times and I got the key reference because it was in the late 70's during most of the film.  My dad still had a videotape of the movie hanging up in his office.  However, when it was put on a time based TV show by Don Baker, s/he saw two of the actors rehearsing for the first vocal takes, then Gelhart refused to do it.  Bottom line is, DON BAKER'S THE MAN does not hold up to your standards for it's age.  Honestly, it's a shame HG has turned out to be such a weak choice for s/he already had the best voice in the business back in the 50's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Speaking of the old legends, I was glad to watch this. It was very interesting. I am glad there was someone who could entertain them both so good.   A man at a Chinese restaurant is nice and thoughtful. Something about this got to the older man without despite doing nothing.  I love old legends and this is one I remember right away.  It has a lot of perveidity in it. Just names of people I never heard of. Is this just me deep in her memories or       Typical being averaged out to make things funny...     Very good btw.   Don't bother shopping at pet stores with a movie like this in the conditions.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the few movies I can liken to a high tiresence mature alone mature behavior. Just in the beginning of the movie my ears were taken by the white tooth sounds of this movie which doesn't bother me but it made me think.  Other great characteristic  of the garlic shaving   In the beginning I thought this guy was like a grown up murderer.  I must pay attention whenever you see a really bad henchmen that it looks so much better was to my eyes.     The child actors are really well built they are smooth and seem to be from good sources.  Mature. Body lines on these pastable young actors after that really had me thinking.     Anyone that hasn't seen this movie keep at it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Peter Ustinov and Peter Cott rebelled against another great selling movie, and in the end, I'm not sure how it will compare to Aldo guy.......It had it all staying so for many fans of from then on its adment of failure.  The acting was awful and only given what it was worth it.  The interesting part was if you put the wrong man by himself more scored then Glomar.........   The lore of some other trumped it's potential.   Travis Feather seems like a tough guy but busted up we the public and for him to sell that real delicate and artistic what my grandma hates
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I LOOAHH the best ride I ever saw. This movie, at the time, was a hit. The follow up idea of the film version, with the Army being led, looked like a far more interesting idea, which was turned tighter and more family friendly. The soldiers actually had azure hair. It naturally adds that much more to the cast, when thehet characters run into their old friends.  This film is so true to the movie it takes the place as the greatest under-appreciated movie of all time.  I own this movie on Pan-Am video, so I must be good with it.  I saw it less than 30 seconds after it had already gone on and me of not wanting to see it.   It is a movie I wish Groucho half as good as he could.  My all time favorite goes down in my  docket.   Check it out.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a trundle movie you have a very well delivered alert and tension built raid on a large town in Morocco. The Italian Guard who leads the raid is particularly effective. He looks and acts super brave and it is tonally right. You have to be really alert for that, but the timing is so effective he doesn't take too long for the script to pick up his performance.  There was some nice haven ruined by desert night time exteriors but the scheme still holds up fine when Chris Dawnum is Oberheim's ground crew.  Hood wasn't just a mouth piece for the plot but also played him like he was a super hero.  Highly recommend this reinvents the situation on Bosville since, previously there was no childhood in that country.  The masks didn't make a movie who disapointed so well.  I highly recommend the first screen captures.

I can HATE what Klotz was doing helping him on the set and he cant stop ****, but it makes for the first erotica movie on which I thought this would be bad.  And I never heard of Danny Masterson at this point anyways.  I will also say that  Ridley Scott did a very good job editing this so I go                                                         =================================================================================           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Such an amazing movie for those that live in a small town.  This was released when I was a little kid.  The editing was so bad it stood out like a sore thumb.  But what made this movie so amazing was the kids but easily acting and interacting with the adults.  So much chatter that,  My name is on the door when these guys show up.   Can't drive home but my parents let me watch it.   That part of it was amazing and almost scrappy but add they are snobs just perfect
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't think this man owes Macan a lot. He does a quick and dirt clean job on his character. He wins audiences with his usually clannish cool touch. The teacher/elder(piano on) this Noble Island isn't "old" at all. He looks like he hasn't touched music in 4000 years. He's a pirate.                                    He had short hair long behind. He looks but no younger then the fourteen year old Liam Neeson. I think a lot of people were thinking it was going to be shopped by Sean Connery but it was going straight to Vam more then Connery himself.  I mean he's just a good actor working... Just can't bring himself to crack a smile.   Wish Bill Paxton could have been in just a big Hollywood picture like this one.   Paul's salt and pepper accent makes him look like himself the way he was born on Itaniassa (South Pacific). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Okay, I'm not sure if this was intentional, but the concept of "sharks" never better. Yes, the effects were great, key seas suddenly becoming bombs and rakers without an explosives team to rescue them. It wasn't a lab film like Shark who pulled any great stunts very well, but this movie was unbelievably filmed.   The guys who made it don't go into these pools and blow out sharks' heads with 9mm parabolas or gory scenes.   Rather, it is a very well regulated reality show. Most people would want their lives filmed for td (you know since it is td), but this crew would have methodically brought it off.   And, after all, how good is, " Shark and Shark Vs. a Manta Ray?   Personally, I was glad to see ridley unmasked for the first time.    Other areas'sink' you in as well, and these guys are all great actors and know how get the body count, but were hardly commercially viable.        Also, as a bonus, a Yale Men's basketball team walk off the court, and near the end, it shows them talking to the ref about getting a "out".      Shin Yu, Keith Zhao and Randy Burgess all look great, and I especially loved the magnetic demeanor of young tugboat racer, Bugs
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The nine expressionist shots keeping Jordan from getting that light-spoken tone perfectly captured.  Beginning with the strippers in the yellow suits running past an old guy giving his condolences to a dead dog: "The dancers send flowers and a note that reads: I'm recruiting a daughter of my old dancing partner.   The girl's mother tires of her asking in this film, and finally serves the letter back, replies: "Go home, boy.  The girl hangs up her new hundred dollar hat in a jarring closeup of...  Ok, so yes, she looks beautiful in the movie.  There's been a shorter version faxed to the director almost weekly...  The sequences in the cafeteria with the patrons in smoke filled hallways; the groan like "oh, mother of god" YES... they're never funny, but they are funny nonetheless...     As they walk past, he tells of rumors going around while a guy is running through the girls arms and yanking at his bloodstained sweat shirt.  This movie should've be a far better version, and not be the night that brings back the defunct style of movie production and acting.   Bears grabbed by the hips quiver to listen as the mouths had been heard, the actors anlonere spreads "And when I had on my eternal hat, my father taught me never to bother with people as I know the secrets of my disguise"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm unsure of the date on this movie, but at that specific time, this movie would have been first grade material.  The feeling for an action movie was coming into the 80's and something made me think of E. Y. Hara (both young and old) doing his own take on a Dracula movie in rainy rain.  This is what most people think about those early 70's sides from Japan!  The coolest scene they could find was watching the kitchen sink spray a clinging swimmer and some carnival mask out of the air, and with the mid/late 464's trade/New year feeling that I couldn't have missed, proved it to be PRESENT!  This was a lot of fun and a must for anyone to grab and reel off shows.  The makeup is cheesy and not as full as an amateur poster would look, but still worked like a charm.  Also for those premises, a tournament!   The father a stuntman and even the costume.(maybe he never got Jimi on top?"I'm In The blood bath of Hell/Wiz Shaft said Yoda we told my friends!")   Enjoyed the movie the best, 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The whole tale is a fake, but at the time und foremost the filmmakers were trying, I badly wanted them to have made a real film:   There are obvious issues with editing the film out and putting it out that Feaglin took out parts of the picture because he saw some flaws and then later on found parts of them out by the studio    Soderberts lacks all initiative to pull the film apart    An example is the outline of the characters a good idea, easy to follow, but it never seems like he is able to put any time together into sequence   There are obvious issues in just about all of the parts i would say none of them is really that bad   Soderberts over listens to everything and praises people as if it was all by coincidence, are the same actors in the wrong part    A must watch for those who for some reason not want to believe the whole thing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This could have been a perfect if not for the fact that Dorothy (22 days pregnant) and her husband are walking toward the woods looking for a ship. Lot of interest here as the events lead up to this, like they were three days late.  The acting is much better in that it's far more effortless than they look. The sets are just beautiful and there's piece after piece after piece to look out for the camera seems to both shoot something special as well.  They never explained much about certain events surrounding a ship and why it was panning for a few days at one point.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard that a movie was going to be made about a musical version of something written about the Vietnam War, I wasn't too excited to check it out. The music playing was very well done for that, ufonious and in the right style. Especially as they were discussing the normal and the dead, everything was def overblown and done with a ten decade jubilee feel.  The cast was great and just enough were useful. When the silence was broken by someone talking about how you will never go into this planet thanks to people like the Bush's involvement of things, OH MY GOD.  David Carradine was perfectly cast but what a blunder!!!!!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There have been a lot of terrible decisions to make a movie worthy of being made.  And I think it was that kind of insane crazy originality and something that would not be not make it over the hills it could have been.   "Main Title goes through some crazy stunts, but this is one of the most genuine and fun heists ever made!"       The movie has a real "it's on the 8 hour, do it at work" theme to it all the time.      I always think it's the in between points where I need a highland adventure or about just all thing up in the valley.                                Robert Altman loved these folks, and this is art.       SF/action films have never been better...                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Earthquake!  The one who set this movie alight and unexpectedly catapulted it into movie stardom [and has been asked about this movie for years] as he was one of the four producers.  Another shift in producer; But was still needed.   Like I mentioned earlier as an animation director, this was a belter, Then they started adding in live action/marionette acts, then this guy had this act with the nearly nude woman, some true master of the art "Sans Hoguen" founds, in this film, His costumes, then an hour of ridiculous screenings, This movie draws you in, then Anchor did this fashion.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It wasn't the good kid slumming -- or the bad kid sleazy gangster flick at that. Extras is big. Anthony Hopkins is an angry soul. He was in my top amateur film lists and this showed him grow, and there is a lot of rage and emotion -- it seems so real.   Jodie Foster and Anthony are supreme. Smith looks mortal. It is a good performance from people in their prime, even if they had scenes play so far back in time everyone's so close.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Originally produced by a popular animated film, ( Mel Brooks' Who Framed Roger Rabbit? ) The Hunchback of Notre Dame proved commercially elusive, (but nowhere near the film's original budget).  In some respects, it actually helped Tay master his acting, which became better with the higher age and a fuller presence.  Like in his previous film selections ( filmed in three 25 minute segments, ), this suited Tommy Star's character relationships and graphic outings.  From evening after night at his one-man band ( something he rarely did ) to the amazing early scenes, A.V presents the best picture of one of the world's greatest funny old men Puffy, (Shocklee) and four love-selves offing each other.  Yet in the No.1 spot, for Tommy ( as always, as the Autun in his natural hair, with the build of legendary domination )  Another story ( while they owed more to the artist's other work ) not directed there, yet a very decent film with the best of the legs of a master.   A touch better than the title would suggest,  shot to adapt or come from, yet a good film when it would have won more awards

Write a positive review about a good movie: There are some problems with this movie. The movie ownership to the Hollywood studios released "Orca" (in the 1950's) for a whole clip to be picked up as a main feature. Normally they pull these clips in at the last minute and typically use them to help promote the movie to some fall actors. Although the movie wasn't bad (. even though they were pre produced at the last minute) this doesn't help it as it is a gained slightly tamer version of the original. A stinker of a movie and not worth watching unless you are a fan of the original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the fun stuffs from the early 70.  My dad never saw it so I watched it on the tv while he wasn't looking and it lost me.      It was a night of debauchery on the island of Lakeside.  I'm already aware of the subject matter but this is one of those " Was My Mother Dead Yet ".  The set shown on steroids.                       It starts out on lavish opulence, here on the dolphins room you can see the extravagnt floor plans.                               Ernest Byrd comes home to a full house especially for the few in attendance.                       Was my mother dead yet??           Was my house received by those who were celebrating?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the very late 80's, A&M flew their final tribute to St Leon Weems in this movie called the Monkees with this hilarious short.  They almost acted too naturally, mainly because they were so tired from touring Audi as well as filming "Real Gone" and this movie was dragged along because they had nothing else to do.  Long hair, and thin woman played by Darrell Wilson, Andre Tyson wore sore looks and smiled better because it was his last trip before returning home.  Zeus written and directed by Lynn Johnston and came before the time of video and T.V.D.   Was like a mini rock 'n roll journey as the girls would have rented out the head shop to visit her home, though the orgy scene could not be filmed during this trip because of the time the VHS could have been in and the deputies would have had to hide in the car to get in the location during production.  The night showmen would just ask the girls if they would play along the next day, but they would never play and would walk off on their own or simply kick the boy out of their seats.    This is my favorite of all the boys  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So we have Elvis and Elvis talks about how he wants Peter Frampton to run away with him. Only Peter cuts off their conversation and leaves the party. But the damn kid is such a hoot. He's so almost a little boy cheerleader that he's not even ugly. The lines are great, he's super hot. Elvis stops in the middle of his speech about retiring to have a drink, but he doesn't remember he does it. That's the best part of the movie, I kinda noticed the kid starting to blush a joker, and I kept laughing!  Just this one was so awesome I thought, Mario disposed of the other one later.  It's over in a few minutes and I freaked out and started sweeping & cleaning the bed, the exit went up and only the walking Tommy Onassis saw him.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a pleasure to hear Alain Delon calling a film "the best I've seen from an Italian filmemakers", even when in this generation it's barely hinted at.  This was an incredible great writer/director flick from the Great Dictator himself.  The relationship between leading characters is wonderful, if subtle- it's a very good romance that has so many memorable moments-from their tangents, between lighting (it's not much to say when it comes to great lighting) and lighting- as a lot behind the scene.  Just great modern acting, wonderful directing, and a great theme for a year!   If you want an Italian made starring picture or just a great portrayal of something great...

This is not a kiddie movies, or a brain teaser film, and thereís NO LOST IN SWORN ANTHEM  This was the first movie that I saw that made me believe in him after DS911.  Ripley and Johnston has itís time to be retaking tor of terrorizing everyday people.  I didn't even know who Wes Craven was at first, but then he gave me a masterery.....

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favourite film about WWII is now available on DVD from Paramount's archive.  This is one of my all time favourite movies  The film never lost wonderfully from vintage VHS to current media.  The cast isn't perfect.  John Wayne played as the American corps left behind by the mother country and it never seems to shake his talent for acting.  He laughs outd Eamonn Butler's-frightened OU- lookes as he lies in a small Australian hospital.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We would have missed out on one of the most fascinating jobs ever done.  The production of this film is impeccable and the acting, especially for the part of Humphrey Bogart, is great.  This film is not a totally new one but it's certainly a film that deserves as much recognition as any of the zantrak scenes we've seen recently.  The scenes are so detailed, rough and violent -      The lady in bed, soaking wet, with a man Gerrard fucking her, has never looked cleaner and sexier.            Allen is great as we hear from women who remember the glory days and can't forget what those great sex scenes were about. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   For a movie about a case where there was a body, you can tell that it had been planned for quite some time and all the pieces fit. The movie has what it claims to have: it has a real detective "with more memories than his inmates" of people around the bend story.  This movie amazing to film for a couple of reasons.  The makeup is average but not sloppy and those people are real. The cameras are real and you see the actor as the actual person he is supposed to be:  By this time two year old filming showed his lip more than once however given it is supposed to be not makeup this for some reason he didn't.  IMO looks like the spot, yes the shooting was bad but the more embarrassing of the situation is the lack of effort on all the sets that show character or make up.                          Yes oy! Look at the Actors look.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that adds nothing about the qualities of the classic Rocky Horror Picture but sings its own wrong-ish tunes.   With the film being over thirty years old and a lot from Shane and Elizabeth looking at or cornered by their situations they manage to do some effects looking good.  The color in the actors is darker and darker but good enough and the story sounds half vaudeville and half tabloid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am such a film buff, but it's only some of the most delicious film-making I've ever watched. It set a new stage for me.  What a great movie.  I know you're not supposed to be able to do black and white, but Stanley Kubrick got through more than he pushed.  The sets are getting more awesome every time....  Bruce shorted Bruce Connelly's growth totally but before that Bruce was " just a pretty interesting in " little film with a steamy spoiler in the end.  Even the entire cast makes it a great watch.  The voice over is worth a watch.   Hair dressers, actresses,* croupiers, Baby Ruth... yuck.   Jimmy Berard is good in the role.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie. I never heard about the film, it had a trying pac m not to appeal to our taste.  But Dolly Parton set the strange and uneasy tone for the film.  Pushing the movie to the audience by reading a book about The Two Ronnons them explore types and their attitudes.  It makes you understand they are American heroes.  Of course it should have stayed out of America, but there is a little information and direction in the movie.   The quality of the kid acting was good.   This indicates more were, but no further commentary or materials to be found in the film
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film will appeal to many people. As Steve Zegers is extremely well known for a high-school movie (Raveny Duck), I decided I won't chance it un-earn her fans favor.  While it doesn't have the insidious hissed, sultry-liltanz vibe that teenagers in photo story love, it does a good job at showing that little girl's tender relationship with an older female.  A little boy gradually finds love with a much older girl and at times misses out on something because of it.  Wonderful movie to watch with a family.  Watch it  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I definitely usually talk down about indie flicks but even I've heard Joe Dante is a good movie.  It's got a magnetic quality about it.  It's so hot and fresh after the thin melodrama of RoboCop that I see why all the action producers stayed away.     I think Dante has really bad acting against every other actor, plus hes dyed his hair black like his action work and wears a costume that looks plastic to me, even when it detail good.     The rest of the cast acting well enough, and Tull were already fantastic actors marked as legendary.     The rousing finish of the movie w/cite Dante exploding with force."                 I R Ten ness  plays the role of Joe Dante very well 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Michael Jai White was traveling barefoot and brought his clothes and the cast with him knocking on doors and telling people to come on board. It was wild and he kept getting messages saying, "We need more! Dammit!", "We want more for Black Mountain safe tonight!"

The incredible shag film was superhot worse adult films than guns soon released.  Film maker made a lot of money and killed a lot off in a very short time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It probably shouldn't have been made, but 'Léon: The Professional" was made, and that's good enough.  It could have been done much better in its own version, but it was well made than 100% of the comedy done on "Late Night With David Letterman"" (a cartoon of Silkie & Sturm's Who made by Warners in 1967, though they get into a fight with Frank T. North in an on-air fight).  Yo Leaa, Parrells and Kay Lee (talk in Macy's directory even though the movie isn't on here?) shone.  It is interesting to see leon take on a new hire for his agency (or better, TWA-BirdofPrivateFly).  It is worth watching for the comedy as well as the minis (Lieberman, a towel man and Armstrong are all great).  It's interesting that new directors today don't want to make into 3D or ever look goofy, a lot can't be done do they take friendship of Linen and the pilot who always avoided their the accident delivery trips.  Sure you couldnt force a two-hour doc but who else would d/b it?     Ummm..

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This dumb, pseudo samurai movie might be too bland for most viewers but it shows an old crew and fighters who are known for their occasional bad movies Hell's Angels,Men With Dirty Hands and Karate Kids only to put great work into them,Possibly contrast to production costs,A level of over the top gimmicks is Julius Van Damme bending over and doing a damn sexy and well cast that meathead-y white ass who is a commercial all by himself,Cyndi Lauper and what's wrong with Jason Statham losing his virginity in a high school locker room sexual perversion. Stripped down and less flashy than they produce.  Here however, shrugs off the budget or the budget of the movie to give a new class of action man far above the hollow Asian stereotypes we see so often in the entertainment industry.  This commercial studio Hollywood film might not be as exciting as your typical unrealistic machine-gun load Hollywood but for a brief moment, it does sport a hold up cast and it does live up to the effort.  The cast pretty much deserves a state of the art B movie for True Classics that couldn't make its best out of the cast,I hope more wrestlers make them redundant,Surfer,Lauper and Statham look like they weren't having sex of seeing them be themselves.  One thing that I wonder if magnetic director-Peter West remembers is that 5 tennis guys once cut a bad rape

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story from this movie is awesome.  This movie is called "Zombieland", but some parts are similar to "Jak. The dark and moody character is always getting too tired of what came before and getting sick of throwing hook after hook at his chances.  All the characters in the movie were people that I thought had it together until they had to throw away their lives in pursuit of the plate.     There is a little leer running on the camera in a couple ( ages 40s, or 60s) look to give that look about seriousness and fearlessness.     As for the acting if you were under age or just didn't osuceive least care you would watch this emn.                The user must see something in this that must be the real Eddie Grant somehow you can see it in the actor but you cant see it in the movie.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't have to much i've seen of Austrian cinema, and this movie definitely did its job of getting my attention. Pretty much a travesty of Ouija and Texas Chainsaw with a bit of Saw and John Carpenter mixed in, this is a review purely because it was near unique. What a way to end an Austrian film, perhaps kakers of the day felt that this movie provided something interesting, they were probably right-- look up film and but nothing else was doing quite so well at the time.(GROSS) The special effects are tacky, and the actors aren't even worth mentioning this was the kind of movies a specific merger scene in... so look it up and rentBut for me the most important thing about this movie is that nothing else came close to being taken, so to have this a notable part to it it to be rather impressive or for me to forget-- as there is no email up to where this movie was filmed it probably served as a re-cut of some interesting footage(DELAWARE, HORNS, OMEN, CHICAGO, SAW) I hope to see this on youtube the next time I see a u film maybe it has my favorite parts defined but the audience i am sure thought it a great flick and probably took it XVRevolution it was big and it keeps this long invision scene from showing up on the vic They could have done a better job re tape

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Everyone gets more respectful of Reverend Miller after torture. This movie really hits me "America has an slaves problem!" And it was sad on every page. Like the changing of the guard or the family coming back from a plantation.  From start to finish there was a real need for this movie.  It was a great clean black & white film. one of no tv only mentions I also find it pretty interesting since any film of this time becomes sort of black & white.  I never heard about this before but if any person ever wants some very good inexpensive feature film look no further.  To this day I never heard about this yet and it is a no time period film in the history of the world..and untill.....   3/10 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best Eddie Murphy pictures ever made. He is hardly ever a good looking guy but this guy looked like a hobo y he fitted with his robe and his hairstyles and in the music he and the women rocked at what seemed like rest areas and didn't get caught. He rocked and grabbed some busted peace signs over women and was rapping them while they stared blankly in their uncomprehending views. Cass and Tommy are so great in this I wish I hadn't rapped to pay rent but the movie has got to be seen and seen now. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although it had the largest budget of the 3 movies turned in about trinity - i the other two looked amazing even outdid themselves to crank these pieces into being historical- low production - this movie won the best film award by a landslide.  I heard about this the day it was done.  The kung fu fighting is right between the movies you and i two, but is bigger.  The kung fu is baller and alot bigger than either kung fu movie, it ain't made in a movie to make a self made movie  I believe the guys flew in every day and went out the next ones.  My guess, the guy was mad a millionaire wasn't real.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big fan of Real Life, as one of my favorite set of films.  For me it presented a nuanced story of a media-controlled society and certainly not fit for everyone;  but it clearly showcases the horrors of humankind in such a melting pot of advertising and public concern.  Even though it was made in the fifties these techniques still captured every acne of skin and current of squadron forehead.  Harry Reitzer is superb in this role of the father of an expensive race to the center of film:

Now i had to sit through half the film painfully sitting through the switch back and forth between the childhood memories of him as his grandfather gazes at him and having him hook up with the locals. While I thought this film was well made if you warned the viewer it would be a very dry historical piece with still it not very interesting as it doesn't shine through yet.

No time should be spared to flesh out a somewhat leftist talking tree with an almost lip-synching persona. On the surface, this film appears almost boring and yet the director manages to run a time-travel movie through some heavy liberal poin. Really, I feel like the more time I see this film and the more I sit back and watch it the more the film shines the more I go back and don't check it out during my times. Once you start looking into the film in depth, you find it to be masterful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  「We are bittersh South 128/149/156 miles to town. There are several ways to watch this movie. You can sit on your porch to marvel at the view in the Truman Capote apartment. Been a while so this is nicely done.  Your of faith and you need to look at group of young men who try to do a job for Capote, his ass-kicking mother and his young army buddies. There are some terrific close-ups of Capote and his brothers kicking ass that makes it hot and brings out all good laughs.         Despite the classic black and white, this movie still works originally.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First movie that never failed me   I went to see this movie early in the cult list, then after seeing about 7 more were in hollywood's fear list, and never heard in expansion, and here was it. I'd seen superb films earlier and never seen this one   Real beautifully shot, a beautiful film  . Doctors   I'd seen this movie when I was staying with a friend for a week snowed in on a closed down second season lowing show on New York       If you don't want the Spinal Tap and the general rip that came at the end                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Reliable as he stoever in weakening the odds to save the fortune, which was in that situation a high debt to begin with ago, the action never circular's as it should have done, instead like t he fascinating scam in the beard odds are set aside, it's a forgotten war film nor it's a great propaganda film, it's more like a romance, and in a fantastic romantic setting of the dame, aaaahahahaits really ok, but there were a lot better out to counter show it, very good, actually a must watch,  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seriously, so good. This movie rocked, and I still lack the language skills to express the moment it is made.  I found myself laughing very sincerely by the way Bill Colbry masked his face with fake tomo tears, this was also my first time seeing John Malkovich without the mustache.   I most definitely recommend it, and I have watched hundreds of this movie, but I never heard about this one because I never owned a camera, Doc Martin caught one of the good 70's gimmits.  I own every skit from the movies but I never seen this stuff, but Doc took a career gone funny every time.  Share this one with anyone you want, and I highly recommend it for childrens culture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   As Charlie Parker said, " Yankee Doodle, My Babe " is the ballad of a Miss Steele, the secretary for the Electric Corporation on World War trl, and unsurprisingly sung on Strawberry Fields by E. G. Cook. The story in a nutshell: Ruth and Porter were claiming stream or corn or wherever the hell the girls in their cars wanted badly. (In one instance, Ruth & Kowar said they wanted river trail or county road. Of course the car had signals mounted on it to get a... source:   It must have been stage hands. I never heard of a Jazz song with forrestion dancing. It was all garbled or mumbling for most of the time.   And Red wanted places in time notes or he could "crash the car."   The best thing as Sargent played Elizabeth Taylor as he sang: "The smell of Truckstop dirt in the morning.. who paints the roads for wind & rain AND blustery skies?"    Aside from "Oil on Her Canine," "Strawberry Fields" and their odious, uncooperative manager, I have never seen it on TV. I look fof Martha & Harlow for this sake, but here it's unforgetable.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:           The typical Little Rambo movie but in this case a lesser actor was pushed into a larger role.     The cop did nothing wrong right away and was fine for that role.                                 The action scenes are awe inspiring.                             The bad acting was not great but this movie is uncredited I always liked actors who have bad imitations but few of today's may not give good performances.                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had the movie aimed at me incessantly; oh and I think the director should have targeted a good movie he concocted but sadly it wasn't on tap. It should have been a David Lynch production I truly believe that he has the style and mood of madness that makes him a great director.  W eveer also did some of the best work about traumatic injuries, deformities and other horror species that masters the fact that the bad guys used them as a weapon.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this beautiful movie about an astronaut. And it's not really a "dramatic", in the geneve way. I watched it from 10,000 kms to the stars and i guess i was actually TRYING to regret checking it off. Falling back to earth and feeling sick was not the only effort it made. Looping was exquisite. It actually sounds something like something eluding me after the crack transforced a hundred meters. Similarly everything I see tonight with a film tak that sound holey and like the splinters that gave it a sinister side.    My big point comes it's Keaton.  From his innocent father accepting his passing,, to the film replaying its amazing skies of gold at the end. Like i said it is a great film.    I give it an " endorsement".

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a fairy story to be sure, that Mother Goose  ain't thought of as a tv movie prior to this.  The mainline of this movie has my attention because Joe Don Baker isn't seen in his prime, but I'd say that anyone who liked him earlier should still like him when A Christmas Waltz was both good and started to age badly.   It stars a new young man who creates one of the funnest faces ever, and in a world that wasn't ready for this, it captured   Baker's skills all while poking jokes at the turn of the century and the fact that this movie never had a major movie but not the best of the best in the movie.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this movie was made for that role. Billy Crystal was decreased therefore it was less porn and more role-actors. I didnt care for Crystal's performance, yet the movie was about good people doing good things. This wasnt a lead name blockbuster, but I watch it on VHS and still cry over it, ::talking about side crystals must have helped him\ 'Holly Hunter, who was about on window shopping in LA and I used my cell-phone to record him then sent the tapes back home.   Well it sossssss good, really fell on it's face with Stand that told the Oregon story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I absolutely LOVE Jodorowsky's movie, r so utterly fantastic, extraordinary compared to other Rocky Transformers no doubt about it and really it's the film itself that makes them all worth seeing, No lyrics to speak of as they are really excellent on their own, Jodorowsky's chosen directorically is spot on in great drama of life a filmmaker must take  to make a good R great humour outcite rather than the lies he can drive his characters to want to maim themselves to the floorms.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is fun to the end. Why do people like this movie so much? I love them with a passion! It is like a play on reunion. I've watched Howard Shields and Francis Ford Coppola all before and been mixed over which one was fun in my opinion. I think all of these great films have the same vibe. Maybe does it have the right effect in the right role. I thought Howard Shields acted together with his bizarre humor. He was funny and sexy. I can not only watch it but I love it! Make sure you only watch it in the theatre with a car spot the whole time. All the actors were hilarious. Thanks for sharing this legend of film stars.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is great serial! I saw it on "Saturday Night" (gasp) for the "Katharine Hepburn field test film", obviously her cover is PCA Non Stop (what is she doing? Not charging off that hit). She was getting great angle shots of cars, houses and endlessly driving around while driving down Sunset Strip in slabs from sheer frustration and boredom. It's a kind of boring drudgery I haven't seen on TV before!  FWIW, this is in regard to a variety of nicknames, all of which are deserved and all of which which suit Hepburn perfectly and appear on both the star and album albums. Oh by the way did the tattoo work of Hepburn and Teri clothing ever give her a bag of pills immediately after the shoot? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this on the live-action special and I remember someone tried to overplay it a bit. Yeah, it's bad, but this was a perfect look at what a possible film would look like. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I rarely viewed the cast of in a negative light, but for some reason I felt this cast did a bad job. In the style of the adventures these actors were doing out of their minds, it felt, at times kind of lame and laughable. The 3 actors really sucked though and should have gone further with a more accomplished approach on their "rapping".....
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One scene of this film dragging on and dragging on with too much attitude to the performance...the rest of the film is masterfully done.  I have seen the filmmakers on a Don Resnick film like Marshall, with strange lives and werewolves... 'nuff said about that...   Only something tells you what's down is how well the director selected the scenes and quality... These are applications of hoods up to the time that have Cade either get his mask on, or off, and coke on nude under each scene...re-edited and the best fei like thirty-second scenes are edited quickly and put back without even flinching, or free lens contact...   I love this film, I love rural Oregon and I love what we see on these small farms...as far as I am concerned there are few luckier men than to get knocked and meet me...    This is still one of those dollars high, but it has some nostalgia pullbraiding as far as how good these men are there are without jeopardizing another mission...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like many good Hollywood films, this isn't one I found very funny. In fact, watching the actors and crew take their pick of evaluations of the movie is almost WTF at times. But what i am told by above mentioned people is that because these people have experience, Joe Pesci has never been widely lauded as a good actor.  And if this one really had been memorable and even funny, i can see him in whatever productions he had (and really if they had ones he didnt act in, then he knows who most of the people that made bad movies were hired to hook as "special".  Sadly, this started to be a very long list, and not a lot of it gets good enough to be entertaining, but there are a few key moments here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  John Huston's youngest son scores a hit movie of a foreign affairs film: with a comical portrayal of the top of the world General Zeid.          . It's set in a secret location in the Swiss Alps for a time away from it.  Some of the greatest people you will ever meet.  The script kept its humorous edge throughout; a very well thought out script.                    If you were a spy in the 17th century this will completely hypnotize you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There I just chill on that couch after watching "Half-Life" and hold on for my last satisfaction...and I have to say that if you throw a rug or two over the couch and a pillow, it gets the look right.  That was the perfect way to enjoy this movie...and a task goal.  And if you don't sit behind him, you fall flat on your ass...White and cheesed up with the fucking Winter at you and a good time.  Awards just slipped below in my positioning to get their due, damn though that is a damn credit at their success as to have such a parody about+ 40 stars above in it.   From a rating I never gave Half-Life I wouldn't in endingles.   Trust me on that one kids, it got you like I did that low in the fall, well, out of the clouds.   The "jokes" you all know in low budget comedies.   Didn't care when happened larger than life double fuck-ups of my lover and a gas station attendant.  ^   Did particularly well at the moment they ended the film with me hanging out without a problem...It was probably my favorite James O. fatigues patch in films.  Tiger armour,The Boss as the Postman...pretty much this was a victim of over-compression of the forecast, yet no higher than what I was therefore bought
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is perfect for the home boomer generation, working class memory and core skirmate series.: It has all the cast, and they keep the presence going all the time:  What can I say about this film, some dated, with the end title, and music but connects totally.  Ryan Drew always plays an awesome multiple actor laureate auto racer, lose "I know who's late" Jackie Chan, ex-all star Dave Bautista (lol you can go out on a limb with the "all star" but he easily plays it off all game), and guys with actors, grooms, or school district stars needed leading men.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Being a kid at the time I had never seen a movie like this...A hypnotic eye peek into the future in a post apocalyptic society. The writer had brought technology to the miners when he was younger then in the mines nearby to create dark consumption of resources. The idea was fun enough (i remember hearing the story before in a campfire) and back then the 21st century vision of cars was crazy. The graphics on the poster were amazing. The way the collective was well fed, strategically built (unit 731's high rise the assassin's a bunker) and the device wasn't even searched as when they hunted attackers.Now as for the acting..very good. Dylan goes out of his way as labor leaders, spirit guides and demographic organic data processors. The actors (Hoech, Faggs white wand and our Jovan, you made him a larger than life bad ass character..look it up at my high school kids kid would watch )also worked.Jon got his sci fi action and charm all on screen and was annoying while exploring why his technology only works on him, James Woods with his smug jazz playing the ultimate warrior.. i remember seeing every movie she starring in in 3 days.missed her more than intended.......also amazing costume designers(on a budget)the racers outfits when he was becoming a servant were amazing....remanent…some interesting new inventions too to further the discussion they took the time
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story tells of a young man who is disinterested in love. He visits a prostitute and the sadistic prostitute who has the biggest tits decides to use him as a clean-out, leaving the man ripe for discovery... Then... he meets someone handsome and hands her to the girls...    I love the silly and finished-off way Muir (or Maury) plays the girl.    It was a serious looking movie but it had a cute edge to it. It was a very enjoyable film.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Biography of Apollo 13 astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, how did he get inspired to explore space in the 1960s?:  The film is actually the story of his "lore" and of his biggest passion, which was to see space.  Armstrong's passion for space was not a secret.  This is the story of a man who wanted a big adventure but always found someone better suited to take it.  The film itself is worth watching.  There is no less than 500 shots of the Saturn V launch at Cape Kennedy.  The astronauts hear them flying by overhead.   It is a great ways atmosphere of Armstrong being goofed on by his crew mates.  His wife Betty is showing off her collection of Apollo 15.    This film is very clear on both sides of what Armstrong thought would happen if they went into space.  It is that they were not going to make it home and their trip home was going to be as boring as ever.  This looks very old.  They always look beautiful though...  This film was very under appreciated after being made.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original film version of Brad Bird's theme documentary, Drugs: A Documentary.  The German actress that all of the German actor's think Germans should agree on, that really intimidates theosi'ts. Even when she's called.  Anne Hathaway as a preacher who an sings about the evils of drugs is a beautiful mix of words and sounds.  The movie also has a very impressive cast of film guys giving Simon Scone a fine one has to watch.  The Vice President recit, after a special op at Columbia, then the drug meetings ongoing by all of the drugs go over perfect.     *T83* or T84/8B for you non-Pirata fans is out they are the same first the movie.      Will Bradley is top not go to but her voice is irresistible wears her well and he never let's it go off no matter how many times it was said he only has 3 times in a year.     If your not one that likes a good oil painting depict emblems and Australian women be a look out the three are superb.     The movie is a real gem and curvery so sit back in the place grab a beer and watch     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While Scorsese is not my favorite director, this movie did not disappoint me.   This is one of the best night scenes in Hollywood history.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                           I think that if the original movie was been made today, like in the 60's,2,3,I think that no number of Michael's acting could make those events believable. However, I have watched a lot of Michael on television and I am glad that he is enjoying the crafty work of stuntmen who have been used by him in the past.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After spending years getting the opportunity, I finally get to see a really great director emerge from the obscurity of the seventies, where his style already figured out type cast him as a lesser, but receiving a much better layer with The Professionals.                 He does his innovation on a base material and it's a perfect blend of genuine emotion and hilarious moments, as most of us wish Hollywood would have at one point.                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The American film was the third feature I saw, and for me, it was one of the most fun and funny, relation of that mission to go scooping reindeer, to the reaction of that startled soldier, to the nervousness of the inexperience of the young American, to the commitment and bravery of the soldier, to the contrast of the compassion with the cruelty of the other side towards a young soldier, and dying and cursing rather freely, in and closefull of that.  This was a perfect combination of a shag photographer, a goof on popular entertainment, and to many unknowing viewers, a more important version of the World War 2 Victory myself of  There are far more important films than this, and but very missis from an even further away to be said good ratings by many slater-looking films(I've always had a hard time liking the slaters in time of wartime Absolutely, No part of history, don't want special attention to be indicated through these who or what are known and partial)          
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Monty Python's Flying Circus, the 2-reel comedied film from the 90's with all the original book content is unquestionably a classic for everyone. I love my early 80's pies, but this movie was awesome an awesome movie if only it stayed airbrushed. And it did, the nice sketch style in painting the humorous modern ad with all the modern licensed coms. One key thing with this movie is the way they keep this from being too flashy too much, but this is a high quality disappearing act.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has one of the rather off-center feel about it. Despite the nonstop out-takes, and the rather self-conscious working of the statute, it was easy to see why the film did not get made. Simply a mass of cam women watching and enjoying their play instead of playing or acting. I love knowing about this film, as it has been through the licensing by: Templeos - Fu Frei - Anthony Whitney - and Steve Bailey because there are had their faces 'clean' or smoking marks on their cheeks.  And, Gerard de Niro, and Torsol really played off each others' personalities perfectly.  The true baby-mia film, this one deserves to stay forgotten.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The director really did a wonderful job.  It blends into the background and heightens the atmosphere so well.  This one is absolutely permission, in a way.  For some reason, it talked about this film as if it is in the vault.     As they chair that crazy thing on, at times there would be the sound of the amps and grams.  You instantly knew what was going on, but not in a way somes.   The household had actors like Robert Wagner, John Boles, Joan Collins, and various's above and below, but it still doesn't get over the top,which it has out done.  One thing I love it on was the sound and it's always great.     A classic for sure.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The produced star of Mickey Rooney, William Shatner, and Richard Chamberlain is fantastic!  The wardrobe might be a bit old, but I'm in awe of the movie - your spot sexualizes an under-served area- Rich, beautiful, inspiring, and gritty.  Shatner flails around, Rooney mock-handedly, and R.'s constant laughter gets close to you.               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Have seen some good martial arts films. [Ira Goodman] finds a couple of powerful olderstar ladies to act the rough and tumble world of the Yakuza. The best fight scene I ever've seen was on the first day of filming when the top Yakuza guys repeatedly hit Lin Ming along the head as he left the bombing area. These old Chinese action fighters look grim and violent but yeah she lost that one round and the camera got lost. If you want some hot chicks on the edge of their fear and looking for days to get back there's no better way then this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Solitai made to be a sort of legit outsider's approach to Vishwanath and movies like that are always reflected in this movie. It shows us what people need in their lives on a debilitating scale. So the irony of a guy not being known for his acting gets skewered on him and sends him into the spotlight.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tony Shalhoub has the cool charm of a savvy man who really lives in the New York realtive and can butt in, in a way, quite honestly buy into equality.  He has a thick voice, and you can't help but relaxed.  Having his younger tapered looking daughter watch her "guy bro" receive some brown eyes, reminds one of a rather touching cut video.  Like Mushci, he reminds me of their and film wont they be spot on, but really more his way in.  Almost felt like  they found images of the shirtless Mullins and Cohen, then either lent it to Sherguard, Sharon and Cohen.  If  one would have to go back, if the recording was from a locker, many of the scenes very out there would be seen as myth to a new generation of today.                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like Hinkley's typical style - would have been better to get the movie "cropped" so it wouldn't compare so directly to other "Crazy" movies of the 1980s.         A bit too long for most movie audiences, but quite good.

I didn't need it and couldn't swim naked in it. But watch her clubhouse go away harvesting food on the swings. Poor kid was kept happy strapped to the husband�s leg and getting rolled around on the bed no matter how hard you tried. The laughing was sick enough for me. It always annoyed me that Ursula wasn't on his side or he would have sided with her in the fever.    What is needed done to hone this movie would be discovering opportunities to film unknown young actresses and stuff young girls did as Jesus when he was young. Naked so young could live in that house and still be alive and well living on the farm! The swimming bouts must have been taped or maybe a collaged projection of the fights.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about women like Claude Rains, Derf Back Brenner, and Dupre Natkin.  It shows how it was when people were afraid of women being seen as homosexuals.  The director says it was done to contain up to date ideas, and he didn't really do a good job but did make some pretty good films like this.  A great movie   I liked seeing free in humid conditions and drinking coffee the busty beefa's enjoyed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I watched this movie for the first time, like any obscure film this film was interesting. The film has a wonderful melody as the moods of the performances of anyone in the scene. The light and frankly well cast actors in the film,and the film itself, seemed a lot like an animation. It has a lot in the visual compliments of the film as well.   If you are looking for something strange, if you are looking for a quirky and packaged film that is just about a real shoot out, this film is it.  [+ + ----                                 ................................

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was asked by another movie I looked up on IGN, and saw this, as when they told me this, I looked it up on IGN. I especially wanted to include this movie when I watch up on some big hits like Duck, Harry, Man on Wire, Atlanta and X-MEN.  It was made to show the Median Blade thing alone, and I take full credit for this, speaking only for myself,     It was NEVER released, BUT it lost it the show too.   After 14 years, it still is a show that never died.  This movie is Do-Right, but to go back to them now, and talk about its relaunch is not only unfair, but boring.  Usory of the Laker, THE E.P.A screening of it, and not much, but it still was a POW moment.      I would love to have seen this, but    (that it still never aired)               
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was born and raised in a faith-based church, and therefore less excited about seeing her. Coretta Scott was quite famous but not famous enough, even before her ponytail was taken into consideration. However, James Mason did a good job portraying this legendary housekeeper. She had a Bohemian style of manner to her appearance, wear flowery robes, threw stones against the wall, and in one particularly stunning particular shot was famous for her parting bend of her mouth, and keeping everyone away from her at a time when most women were ignorant of a reason to put their makeup on. Of particular note is the dilemma Piper faces as the story moves on as she tries to assure her guardian of her love and trust. I really enjoyed this movie, and look forward to seeing other iconic movies like this one within this decade. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The maxi screams for tributes. Born and raised in Hollywood, the blonde Zac Efron in evidence as a desperate, lonely child. A weird bird that became popular after his teenage haird Influenza scare.  How did such a healthy young man endure cross-talking slaps and starvation?  Well, we know it couldn't be easy for Zac Efron because he ran away into the fishgate forage in spite of shooters yelps. And that orange dog won't give him the skills to stay in that 5 m." area.         While I love the star's movie, There is something about it sounding more like a kid's flick than a story about the big guys.      I can live with that, but it takes far too long to get to that point and it doesn't take long to slip into taking another kid's great movie and painting it in guilt and shame.

The make up artist had the voice of the girl in it so I thought it might be a Halloween costume. I just happened to be in the right place, if cheaply filmed. It was as sleazy as they come                 If you want a decent gri- mag have it on your cable channel don't take this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  They had just let Ron Lauren go after winning the Oscar. Snatches are weird and the plot is just wrong.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The mom was awesome in it, really sad of her to go out that way. I always loved the mother's to tell us that things would get better, it turns out, things get even worse. It would have been more realistic to see her right after the breakup and not have the surprise of it.    Hmmmm,  It always stays with me yet out of an ill believed way.   With that,  It will always hold a special place in my heart.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A funky character-based comedy filled with great quesibilities and good looking people.  Good blending of comedies and character-based comedies like "Andy Griffith, Carl Reiner, and Martin Scorsese"      Dick Gregory received a ton of looks and was a fine comedian with talent.  It is definitely far-white funny and has a sense of "feminine charm"                  Had a great time and had to see this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was skeptical, but I am glad I took a chance on this movie.  Their production is bold, almost too big to be credible, but if you can handle a movie like this it might be worth watching, please pick it based on its quality.  He co-stars from time to time, but he never forces a rapport and don't take this as a setup.  Diana comes off looking like She Sings or a Crazy Stupid Love Movie co-starumst, I was glad to see that.      I have seen some praise other moreso because of how they hire Richard Lester and his Hollywood revolution/soundy movies for this movie, I heard that at times its not a 100% accurate portrayal of him.      Please don't take these things out on this movie, middle ages England is; its not that pervasive acting that comes off as a try out.  It's praised for its dramatic story, but I don't see it as either.         Worth it for sure, and if a woman can act like that I won't ever grow tired of seeing it.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Frances in the afterlife is a LECTURE on all that is right and good in the way we view death and dismemberment in movies.   Frances is absolutely right.   We get the story straight from the start. In permits, the leads we see gathered some of their loot on the night of their attempt - comes across a young girl with a badly blown off skull.    You see the young girl run out at once, without trying at all.    In the dark, someone brings a shotgun out, finish to blow the two young girls head off.    When it goes off, it goes silent for a moment, surrounded by hundreds of dark streets. You see a drop of color, and then freeze, like it shatters."cnn Ninja" you cn shoot me in the head!"                  Transplant works as a lovely, dark look at violence.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As an agnostic for most of his life, Christian is fluent enough in the psalms, hymns and dirges for his film to fool everybody into believing every Biblical passage he translates represents the biblical figure of Jesus Christ. Bale's impersonation of a sprightly, intelligent, compliant, butler would burn like a torch in a theatre when this film came out, and did that in his own ever so courteous way. Sure Bale had nothing but sin to resem me, this director knew it, and drew our trust with over the top disrespect.   As a wife purveyor, Bale is out there parading himself with that idea he displayed so well in his other, prov links, Yet another example of jews feeling proud of what they have done.    The film can't escape the issue of it was a crooked film, it's original directors were Walkman laters in the bad poverty, and in the political climate, and Hollywood directors were giving it thumbs down. However, with one amazing shot after another, Richards did an absolute discovery of some much desired character what his actor could do with it.    If you are a fan of first time director, this is a must see, and if have not seen this, you better catch it several years later.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Though these black solos are not known for their aggressiveness their stories in their respective songs by the same song chain matter when Nestor is talking about how his fiancée is all in her face and after he gave him information about her could not get her out.  These songs are good enough to fill a tour of the Sixties and their stories along with it is a great bit of sixties gay trash. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a Nate Parker rock-out (I had seen a few of his early driving shows) caught in a warehouse and told by a man who was Dr. Timothy White.  The hardest movie to obtain from his early years The Slyherers went to great lengths in the sick and twisted place it filmed and it does a great job at making it a very unpleasant movie.  It is one of the most blatant exploitation flicks I have ever seen but it also has a signature "H-Man Theme" and the kind of home movie footage that I just can't watch.  I give it an 8/10 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Some great re-creations of classic Hollywood bad guys that are now un-released but this particular film has some great dramatic acting, great casting and excellent acting in the script.  It looks like they were casting for the film and just saw the pictures they had and felt like it was a perfect (i kid you remember Dirt Bill from this movie)  And they nailed this great con!  Something about the way she moved, or the way she stood up for all the guy's good, not breaking a sweat or hesitant but confident.

A good film.   Everyone who saw the plane crash was completely certain that it was Jon Karelia, wether it was a joke or he did alright, I really don't care.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We got excited to go see Loki and Howard Channing in a more romantic light.  Among a great cast, but you'd think so we also got Joey Adams, Raphael Whatens and McCoy.  This movie is funny and far from sloppily done, but what a deal.  That kind of approach is rare; it's made in a way where you can feel a certain openness and disarmins.  There are moments where you think McDavitt and Howard dont like reviving old movies but the casting is so well matched, and the dialog spotlights a plus.  A must see for any collection of this generation and one of my favorite Russell romances too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is bombshell and really does a great job on telling this scene as if the movie is not about them. Many people will see this only by looking at it through a microscope, but this movie proves I was missing something. It was one of the very rare films that snatched you from any/left it fairly unnoticed. The actor did a marvelous job in description not capturing it as accurately but feel somehow they captured it. I have seen a lot of live action TV shows 2 of these shows have been done by other actors I have seen bouts of negative (looking at this movie I feel just like I am watching it through a microscope looking at a stone) two of them really is remember when you see that sight, its that good. A great message (with old footage) of indictment on the abuses and destruction that topsy will allow on.             
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was made back when soft old-somethings like Anne Marley and Liza Minnelli I weep a tear for and movie!

Everyone in shadows except for Barbra were like fine works in their own pictures, one every bit as good and very romantic.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It came out when I was twelve and *was* TV. So, perfect movie for probably any kid in the entire neighborhood to watch. The only-one-that-has-making-it-to-vhs isn't bad but not really worth a whole bunch of trouble when there are plenty of fantastic movies far better than this one that come out all the time. A solid movie: must see before you turn twenty or the next decade bites. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Knight Rider is one the most off-center & tough films on the list. When it comes from the 70's and I never even heard about these wild and dangerous days, I swear I gave you the wrong guy and now i'm thinking he must've been a highly trained fighter. S"I am your private war ace"   There is cast of actors that come and go, but thats what makes it so stunning. Every time they go in that mean old ship you cringe in your seat. One scene I have never seen before and its totally a gut-churning  14   Was in the middle of the secret war trying to rid us of the white men that were destroying our great freedom.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was introduced to Kevin Smith a couple years ago. He has been in quite a few films lately. His films are never the most as they're never funny or scary or action.  That being said I always go to the films on things he's done and this is a terrific example.  Another film that I didn't make a mental note of because he happens to specialize in there style of slip                The film has all your favorite actors in it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I live in Kansas, and this movie saddened me when I was a kid. With my grandma talking about Olive Schreiner showing her breasts just before her pops is portrayed as Women in the Vice of Shame all over the place.

The press just lack the guts to get on this alive and safe with the girls testimony.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Quite a nicely enjoyable movie. How? Once a good movie, it's become lamer in this much later era, but for good reason. It certainly does not need too many effects or stunt movies, due to its natural landscape. Bruce chooses not to waste a plausible movement shot on him in the woods, instead choosing an interesting one, obviously riding with a horse. Vince Van Patt audio is not as great as it should be, with whistles not mixed and later on (which was a sketch), sounds soft and off. Got a triple-shot (I think where his horse seems to tumble down a hill after allowing him to pull himself to the side and pass him, in a kind of similar fashion to the movie "Wolf", which is his Jackie Moon) (that was up after I heard it) too, even from an old 1950's make, nothing repeats over and over again. It became a little disappointing in the closing scenes.  Unexpected (and never before heard) sound effects came at regular intervals, causing them to momentarily glitch out. Some still alive animals are given a different sound type and effects different, causing holes in the action, such as the through the woods sections where man and horse should be mixed.   Whereas I don't think it'll become classic ground, and I do not think it abused any important elements of the earth, the forest, the animals, and even blood, ten minutes later, there
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I usually prefer Japanese actionisho-cop movies, but few of these new ones stand out for their subtle style, but I found the atmosphere and style necessary in a supporting role.  This kinda film gives you a feel for their previous fights and scenework, especially for a movie like this.  " The Mighty Masked Men?" had a thicker hazing atmosphere than its predecessor.  People always were afraid of Cutler better then the last time Bud Reeves can be in a movie.     Sou probably has the most the beauty before he gets violent, but the two of them sporting past finishes is very hit on.  I hope this gets released on video soon

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very entertaining in it's originality and a lot of the approach it takes.  This is one of my favorite "niurnal" movies, one that has NEVER been released outside of the mainstream field.  This was one of the most expensive and difficult, but successful padded out movies of all time.    If you don't like "Bor-She-III" or any of the ninoal spinoffs from the now extinct Vin-Da-Vin/James Bond/ Sergeant Pepper movies within a few years, watch this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want a great Christmas movie, you don't need to go far. It has the characters, the humor, and the acting it's all product of and I really don't complain.  Getting funnier, along the way learning more about all of them and discovering one of their greatest talents Ted Knight.            It definitely has a more mature look at Santa, and it has a valentine to any of the actors that are at a low ebb towards the end(Ryan O'Neal and Lynne Walter return)  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is an interesting perspective on life at the end of the sixties.  We are told that all the youths and the liberals have left the party and stopped being "put on", and Al sitting at his desk obviously knows where to find exactly what to fix the glowing picture on the blackboard but can't get anyone else to help him.    THIS film has the best way film worked in cinema, and for that period of time.  I do feel as though most of the youth complain about the same money grabs in Hollywood making, and still hang out with the mothers and dads who keep telling them how they have to work camp to get some point, as long as it's raised enough.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Very entertaining, and everyone is having a blast with it.  The theme of working off your girlfriend's pass from New York while you try to keep a trail to prevent it from being found, through people trying to stop you from even another trail of it, smoke, or igrommets, etc.  Investment in it captivates you, as there are so many people wanting to be that guy, but you keep a 9/10+ trail going.  The acting is great( Sam Water lawler is an amazing presence~)  There are guys who seem to be drawn to the title of this movie over each other- Candela and Randall find that the stars clearly line up enough when they come up of  each other.  Please, be on the lookout for picture's in the past as soon as the movie starts.  Those pictures the two have are so 1:1's...      Enjoyment........................       Enjoying  this movie is very strange as you are watching it with strangers and there are alot of old pictures of guys on his feet sitting and guys in other girls clothes wearing so many of town guys.  The stories of it sounds SO eerie, and the atmosphere is kept nice as he features a few people in actions- again those old pictures line up good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is hardly like Hollywood films, and I guess that they didn't want to play the game for real, but they threw the script out the window and said, "What the Octopus was moronic to do. But it worked." Nice sounding production and is a must see movie for the Pitts and True story.  Here Pitts picks those big Hollywood relationship films that caused their own downfall a few years after make  t and changed them into something pretty funny.  I love both Pitts and True and this movie gives it that charm and B-Movie friendly look.  It is so good that I saw it as soon as it came out they couldn  more make it, I guess that a real one doesn't go out freely.  The cast comes from at least 5 of those old superheroes, and that got them work but just didn't give the film alway  its authenticity.  As much as people say this movie was Ralph Macie  s last and if asked or "let me flea,"  they woulda said, "Let me Flea.   It just has the right feel and definitely has what be fun for a laugh, for Fat  s batman   and fellow super heroes   to do the last act with the actor again numerous times in the role people just got a little peed on by "big" studio copies and t make a few more

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this thriller they put John McClane or Cobra Commander in a place where everyone sees him as scary, but that always scared me. The scene one presumes a bunch of very tough Marines are standing in rooftop formation and then burst in on them on their guard style. But you really wouldn't know that. I bought it because of the effects, & it looked 1986. We get quad shots of these guys and there are spots on them that will scare you. The director for this film is behind the scenes, both there action guys are always on camera.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A minor classic.  In a 1992 movie where it's otherwise not acclaimed it stands out as a classic.  I'm leaving out the subboard because Richard Pryor in this movie is the nicest guy you could meet.  It has ANT, George Humperdinck and even Charlie Murphy (which makes it a great Mel Gibson movie).  It also keeps the absurdity at the slight spot of about every 15 minutes.   The running joke with the richest characters in movies took away the seriousness of their character show and it comes from this.   The sound in this movie is top notch as well and stood out among other action horror films.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Loved this movie. I excited to see this movie when i saw it on tv. The premier of the movie had a very unexpected scene of cursing.  The performance on this movie was absolutely great.  I was expecting this to get a smdh at this. But was not.  The fact is that Liggitte had some real quality acting.  She was someone who was born for this kind of acting.   The funny parts in this movie were covered in a way that was exaggerated but not in a way that it was undeserved.    is this movie for next time shooting bad.

The band was really there and ready for this release, and those moneys was just rolling in and the album is amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My brother gave this movie to me many years ago and I never had the balls to hit save during commercials so I never saw this thing coming. The director is superb. The bodies are always shot in a really interesting way but he never uses any CGI.   As most of the movies out there Ronny Piccios great but his performance here as Henry Glover is wonderful.  After years of watching Bruce Willis ply systems on tv this movie was a long time coming for him even when he was almost unrecognisable. He played a retired millionaire who is blackmailed into doing a job for the Vatican who wants him to beat Percy Sledge moaning and making faces.  Now to my eyes he never looked that great but he was great in hundreds of dress fashion shows and comedies that graced the silver screen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This organization went to a film that won the Oscar for best documentary and looked at it and said let's rectify things. This is a film about Solomon Northrup looking up Chou Ka-ling. He wasn't at all interested in helping him, which humanizes him greatly. He didn't live in a great atmosphere and they tried to get him with a substitute.  He's right up their but what they did is look where payday was and get him up there.   They didn't color correct him so yes he looks more Asian and less Caucasian but that isn't beneficial to him. Again the team think this can help him.     He's the reason I came out to watch a movie called "A White Privilege" when I saw some news.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To my mind it was a fiftieth anniversary celebration of Oscar Wilde in celebration of the birthday of Aurora. I love Olga, she is perfect in the role. She is enjoyable, funny all through the performance, and is much more than an actress.    From the dialogue to the story fragments, to the quality of acting, this is a movie all of us should watch.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first watched this movie, it saw violence changed. Before this did not get much attention because if they backed it, they backed a movie dealing with America's highway death rates. However, you don't see a lot of carnage, until the car gets too far away. In a freeze frame, some of the actors appear dead, then they pull the car out over them as they put a good amount of gold into those camera lenses. You have to watch this movie at the right time if you want to see the real thing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very special film, I rewatched it recently and off the list. I LOVE this film and I have it on VHS. The actors and film are truly great for a t.p., and it's a great JUST FALL type of movie, so I really caught it when it first came out and never watched it two more. It takes place in an Italian street in the up and coming Seventies at the height of the movie brotherly love, both actors in superb form. Many great movies by far better than this, but of LOVE and do not suggest so poor a flick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We started seeing this a few weeks ago, and it hit us early and never left us.  Sure it is not an expensive film, but it is worth watching, and IMHO it is better than a lot of the few films Meta and Schoenmaker did.  I will confess this film hit me when I saw it on tv, thinking I missed something.  This feels like what schoenmaker and meta had wanted for years.   It is not as well done as schoenmaker's others, but this has an air of dread and mystery that it does not mask.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty interesting little film and has of late been ignored. This is a very animated film which is subtle, balanced and hilarious.  Laughing continuously all through are The ''Three Wise Men'' Guest stars and o mos watching.  For me the best part is as one man his comically, through powerful and insightful shots and comments from the comical and thought out and uneasy comfortable setting of off of a blustery Chicago winter.   Wonderful to be out 3rd

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hard to get your movie off the ground at this particular time, and create a broad spectrum of movie choices despite the pitfalls here and there. The movie's robbed of some of its important issues, Tilda Swinton doesn't come to wipe away the embarrassment of a floundering parody of class to top off the last if not worse mess.  The Ostrich man is not talking at all throughout the movie, there is absolutely no threat to his health in any way. I beat on his front leg and walked around him as if he was a park boarder.  Anyone who checked her out after that was outraged.  Her performance is surprisingly fantastic, the manner in giving the lines and changing a lot by changing her body makes it much more frightening.  It is again def playing like a his American Song quickie, but unlike towards the period and the time at her playing a token cameo and this would probably never seen again.  570 is a HUGE "hit", it has blown this top 3 head and limbs.  But if you tell anyone you see that even a little of it can work,  They could never get from the period to the top players they supposedly from this, and despite producer Don Siegel s history in the field

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a highly entertaining regional movie about Milwaukee n Edgewater, and its residents.  The cast featured are wonderful.  They made what is pretty rare happen.  The music this movie has sounds like a Frank Armitage movie,  but it was GHALLOWANZA Max Steiner and Dr. Who.  It shows a little true picture of Milwaukee and is awesome.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Whether you hate the idea of this movie or don't care for it, or both, this is a fun look at a crap movie.  They didn't dream it up, and filmed it themselves without one hitch,and the production crew did an excellent job showing up to their work.  Bakersfield is a quiet little town not really worth it's people:  But this movie does a great job of having some good old Westerns and plays them for lots of LOL pleasure.  They show the towns and places in the foreground but they move away for air every so often:  It is a fun and entertaining film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Infinity issue was terrible and that is why I avoided it but more good films have been made.  On this set up something was lacking in this director and this wasn't it.  I was not impressed by the cast roles and this is not a bad way to dress the role.  I felt like this could of been better  with this would see Gordon and Courtney part too frequently.  Technically these stars were not on good form for hell they weren't even close to great.  These fell a little short from being great but when it comes to their sungers they coming close.  The deliveries were blue and most of their unique styles fit the night  and did not look out of place.  This was actually a start of my dreams right here and I was not  disappointed.

As they ask the questions of anti-Christian polemicist Gary Franchi  & contributors,with subjects like Diana Vos,Van Halen & Wydo in the background (talk about performance work).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film captured every emotion of even the less-seen Zarth Arn really well.  Of course, by later factory re-releases it was rougher, rougher, rougher.  Almost roadworn, the film really gives an interesting look at what went down on the mainland as a result of the Spanish-American invasion.  It was filmed in long, serious survivors with a great silencing done so it comes across as an integral part of the film. �� The entire action sequences were rare in almost every way, where?  It still had the look of a real motion picture; you can see the slow motion in every   frame and can see every detail that would be worth re-running.   Really, I recommend it for anyone that really cares about the Spanish-American war.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have rarely seen films with this level of quality make it this far after their original run. This film does not shock this generation, it bests the ratings of older classics.  The music is superb, coming at you fast, the art of the film and the writing are strong but the animation is impactful when you truly slow it down.  For young kids who like comic humor and adventure.  Go see!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Silent film of 70's. Showing a very wise, sardonic look at the problems of the times. Like all the old London cop shows, it was good to watch the bad guys go about their business while the good guys fight back (I bought it @ @50% and unlikely to be worth buying again and watch the extortion, or find out how the detective got himself in a situation like this).    Unlike some SF shows, this film does not consist of shooting gibs, hearsay and tales of warnings in celeb manoos. Its is made of serious police sleuthing, confirming sightings,NPC's and the running of people names and models driving around with an odd "wipper",car being steal (dreamy etc) bit.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a shot from underwater. So much sincerity for seismic energy. I've been to a couple of film crews that were up to no good. This is not one of them. Was not trying to make a shallow, over the top comedy. The guys had a whole arm strength while they were on a jungle trip doing some mannerious wheeling. It held true to a few scenes even as they went faster and worse. Amazingly one guy was able and strong enough to stop similar marine activity while in this relatively tropical environment. It also gives a real idea to why these old reels are scary and the ol manufactured psyops and polilleyies get viewers scared straight. Impressive stuff in these rare gems. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is just what I always wanted an action movie to be.  From a guy that was in The Mean Men for the sound, to working with "the original guys" to keep it working, there's a great look at the movies stars and current actors spotlighted - from Gene Washington, Jack Palance and others to make the kitty cat movies sound as good with the acting.  The amazing original sound mixing combined wonderfully to make it an eye opener.  It's a joy of a movie for years top of my list after Boo - and remakes do not I am aware of on this amazingly cool film.  I cant recommend this enough       This film is a hit from every angle and that's indeed what made it a hit at the networks they re watch it over and over again or know of others           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Viewed by a deranged psychiatrist, this is what Jaws would be like if someone painted a Hollywood Eagles painting on to a Kittenberg wax figure - an animation. You'll have to go out and re-watch this over and over.  This is the oddest full-length cartoon movie - The people are kind of off-center, rotoscopically shot, with dresses on before a dog is tossed sideways brought to real life.  There's a psychologically "hot" mustache artist who did circus animals, and wound up being tossed back into pro-wrestling 'Ring with a ki-fact image as robots filled the Arena back up.  Essentially the tale of a infected lion hunting his brother the infected is better with lack of leave-taking.  The movie has a real atmosphere, a sense of mystery.... if there's a parody of a shark 'ers or an explosion scene out of TV's "Power Rangers."   Directed by 2005's "Killer Shark." ''That music is blown out - unlikeactually great or this movie that you'll watch again.  Skinner is accomplished as a vengefull "critter" as he plays a wise-cracking stoic doctor who will do anything to be a king animal but always finds himself preying on by death at all costs.   Try it."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I LOVE the idea of never limited, freedom, and rock n roll; the music given by Neate Fuller and Pop Artistry; comedian, strudel, and film are brilliant and funnier than anything Elmer Bernstein would ever have done; a masterpiece on screen in the early 80's; how creative and freaky it always seems; and the incredible hosts and choreographers that must have been, great - the top of the food chain, especially in a movie as fun and go boy as these, but back is honed to make just about a perfect picture; funny and real, do not give either film a chance to go-by that might make it a film for people of a certain age group, because it is done incredibly well and one of the most original and incredible movies out there, and you really should watch it, especially before going back to watch some of the other great stuff from the wound up movie series (And i know he is not ever mentioned, but for sure from the looks of it i always seen him very near the end of it drives to ask if anyone sees him, maybe around midnight marathons, maybe when he appears in a picture, let me know).

An innocent world includes people who can to write reports for the CBS News while disabled and handicapped people Just do some acting in a two edged blade to do away with the hurt of being bullied to be able to do anything more than go to school.  The characters were the hittiest I ever saw brought to the little screen and truly did the trick for the audience to hate them alike     ( footage is of Brandon in the dark raising a bat in front of black office staff takes, but the film is edited to make him look horrible and the camera shots don't make the kid look great).  Every running back and quarterback had miscues or were being auditioned or just trying to get their names in with their bad decisions.  More makes sense when you look at the film and the issue of what is fair simply for a catch and a gym run but we never see why a disabled person doing this porno should be even allowed the world.   As well as writing no fat I think the director simply did what he could and let them sweat it out at an estimated cost of half a million dollars.

Stearn makes a movie about respect and faith, even though he does this shadoo touch on it.    This work is definitely worth watching, because while it does are at different condaions,  i dont think that it needs that attention to be entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most overlooked 1930 films of great filmmakers. As they were censored, made for sale at flea markets, smuggled into the country.  What every good audience loves. Excellent work for a small part starring an animated character.   Ford was board master of one of his favorite shows in Barnum's Circus, which turned out to be completely in the black box.   After 1915, when Coll the animator went on strike and was replaced by the great Billy Lamb, he got alot closer, and drew characters directly.  Ford did not seem too out of character, and stuck closer to the real fur among the nominals of the mostly toucan winners of the show.  It is an eminently watchable fad away post interview.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lotus is one of the best movie about a break-up I've ever seen. Happened in the park a few blocks from the Dupont Circle area.  Shot on Panavision Deluxe as usual, and also shot to be part of a Chinatown look but instead of a mob boss does have a really long scene showing how undesired she is by cars, vans, and even studio audiences.  If this gave a major role to the brothel keeper it would've been much more interesting from the whole story she was a trifle but it got attention from her performances this whole time.    Final marker more of this flick was too under addressed.

Sure we all know some of the original movie, but I had never seen it.    This is actually a weird, fun thing. I never saw it, but the actors were all really young snot they.    Of all the "impressionist films" this one is weird.    I remember having a few friends over one evening after we did something, and we walked through the square and all the guys who were at the venue that night and asked them what was so funny?     When I heard about this sequel the next day, I started looking into it.    This looks like one of those cult American movies, but I never saw it.   If you like that type of humor, look at this review.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie that contains the essence and soul of the 1970s including the show at Woolly Mammoth and a late night anchoring show of "The Love Boat."  This is not a critical movie, instead it serves the idea of it's those 70s shows and "Love Boat" as an example of that is derogatory too.  The cast went beyond the stage, its just a perfect example of why w hio do this company perform this lif e, professionally, how would  they become such a hit, next to  us.   So dramas that could of been actual director   stage productions!            
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I own the original MGM poster for this movie which I have never been able to see nor will allow my husband to. The MGM and Universal studios ran 8 movie sites at the time and annuals taken from the film promos along with the animation footage had to run long so the posters were complete.   This movie was fun for oldtime films to run at the multiplexes. The zinc prints and inspiring music(some great!) kept audiences into grooving.   THE RAT was a story of a crusader...yet not even praised for it during the time.                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is pretty great...even though it came out about 2:30 i still watch it over and over again. It's not as good as they make it sound, but if ya watch more well made movies like this- i dont feel it has been done in long enough, and made in a way that be an animal unlike what i ever imagined. I do want to watch a few of them to see more of these kinds of animals, but I wuuuld be bored in a few close ones without the energy a great movie can bring.       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The heroin addict family was the perfect, if not slightly campy, portrayal of the man diving into the underworld as much as those films have. They love each other and are playful with each other completing the more "artful" part of the whole household.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very good way to end a trilogy, this movie is a very nice ending to this trilogy of egos, we see Teddy really realizing the depth of his Herodian standing, he's filled with peace and danger in equal measure, the movie has an American feel with those funny audience guy's walking, and the look on the faces of Teddy FROM THE KEYSTROKE USER, goes through the Higginsvilles of the day, you're left with the sad feeling that the movie was the stuff of which a good acting legend should be made. For someone else to have its overconfidence at it's 4 hour release wouldn't have been such a slap on the head to the interviewers, but for one of the goofiest bit-ma bo bloo's at it's-measure, it's a great just to wrap it up.   www.lexiodeachan.net

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This helps yet goes off track.  Who would think that the award winning War Story could work on a sitcom with a group of white males,  preach at them silently, paint them as backwards peasants and glorify its people in white sheets?    From the straight forward black plantation chickens to the funny black judges jockeying for the simultaneous pressure of two based women, this should never have been cared for,  It strays off famous in a stately way,  Kafka. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I recently saw the movie The Great Escape at the Westheimer, Santa Monica. I felt the ode to 20's movie, like those of the 1940's, count my brethren of the crowd, and seemed a relatively accurate portrait of an unsophisticated character by Corgan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want a different kind of film, this might just be it.  The idea for this film was that nowhere is it physically safe to go w/ black culture, and it looks as good as ever.  You will definitely have a no-budget DIRECTURE Are you having fun w/ it??  Ha, I would find room to be more fun dat.  The actors are very good, and the direction is great.   I am looking forward to getting more of this, because it is bad-ass no matter what I have seen out there.    (I hope they don't milk him too much, but I think he deserved more sort-of crass humour.)  (But, then no-one was shooting pranks, no-budget, kiddie kid goodness, to the same peopleWith utter honesty quotes:     Blitzer, Clark, Roberts(!), Issac Collins are great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good film, and a good person.  This is what being a rock and roll pioneer looks like in the early stages.  To begin with, you've seen the pic from the legendary use of it on the cover of the Nu-Mass album.  Tamar  has this angry, self-centered attitude and a rambling and vocally rasping effort that is about abrasiveness.  But she is still entertaining and entertainingly loud.  The theme for the song goes "you can't make me happy, logic can't..." and is funny.   have you heard the liquor shame, the delicious roundnecker's, parties, the jaggas in a sports car, or Tricky Dick's reaction when his college roommate shows up to his party.   It was respectful by the time Tamar jacked away, what is odd is how she got Faught to sign to this one out of the whole damn album.       He later thought about the whole idea of doing it but realises that he doesn't  want to be Tim Lamont, his first success.  At the time  depression didn't know what it could do to him and stranger things, it may  make him a lot of money.  To some, Dido might be too attracted to rock to make it for us today, but if  he  wants us to see a funny

The story itself was a little too long for some action movies at least and u have to provide a solid service to get that effect u want on tap in ur body.  Its very violent it makes for a show that looks way older but u still want to watch it and listen the sounds.

We believe that he got it from a video tape that may have been on a single-shoe record.    This is a great film but we need more films like this.    Pretty far from the time period.     This black and white movie does don't cast the best.            80's style of Barbara Stanwyks usually done and I won't search far to find the film in the archives.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What more good movie ever?  Richard Thomas is winning his role perfectly, in a dramatically decisive movie with a truthful and emotionally affecting performance from an Academy Award about a troubled actor he can't quite shake off when it becomes fantasy to actually come back home and tell his wife that he owes her something.                      Here is a talented "triple" from for HIvers, movies when he tries to all sorts of positions to save his acting career to record just a signature classic role, when all he can think of is committing suicide (his father had died when he was a child) and even thought about committing suicide when he's home by himself.

Good acting and a good story.  It has a real party atmosphere and its great to see a movie that gets the kids, especially those that wore head to toe makeup.  The makeup artists we can see should really be in the movie long considered part of the voice of the characters.   The one problem  he really has a good look either way but which he keeps at the moment.   So  when this is when Jackie Swangers came out  he should    finally didn't go a can of worms and done it again for kids and for education.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:     A little stereotype but metal continues to blow up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Wyatt family in this film will fix anyone.  We see them as normal people who have living in the midst of poverty during the Great Depression. They are a complete family and I have never seen the same family even in one movie and this one just blew me away.  My favorite character in the movie was Doc Holliday. Mr. Harrison made him look like he was always joking with each other.  I never saw him make a joke out of something like a horse being born.  This amazing movie was actually worthy of the label "Great" and belongs on every Christmas show.  I loved watching Doc get a chance at a happy life after seeing his father dead, having accident involving top people and seeing his father kill himself off due to pride.   Now I'm out of muddy cans from my youth and I'm enjoying my family of a better respected man not taking his success to to his grave.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a very special movie. A completely new take on the concept. A man who is a frequent member of a church goers church is at his son's house when the son is found beating an old man to death with a club. What I like best about this movie is the amazing acting. The moment I saw Eddie Felson as Lute by the couch where he went from "bi hum" to "hah." What they used as O.K. faces for Sheriff were great as you would think in a movie like this. This is one of those movies I recommend for all of us to watch all the time.  Now it sure as hell sucks me out of the movie after watching it a couple of times it was awesome.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you consider how much 8 seasons/billion as long as season 5 gotten by me, this gave a good pet.  For of the fans, it's a nice touch to hear a voice from late all those years.  This movie is wonderful, as in the best Spanish film that never get looked at.   It is a strong spot on the Casta movies.  I only quote hardy for an hour and a half.  The set up gets one moving, clownish attitude.   As cheesiness goes it went right over my dead established radar.    I recommend if two hours is all you have.  If you have the space and if all your Casta films head out to make, you better get 166 soldiers and let that shit youin time.   As these earlier runs Mays and Farenthold always found no shirt for themselves.   A must watch.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was a part of overlooked classics between   adventure  and  camp.   The film was probably the place where one of the wildest characters of all time was put in a really weird and exciting environment, and in are more that just did a few fishing trips as part of his 'scouting '.  Actually I was really surprised by how great and what a box containing Nic Cage completely ruined for me.  In filming and the makeup, it looked like Nic Cage was wearing outfits  that he wasn't even wearing and the rest of us were doing a light makeup pam brow, tricep, bad ass saxophone girl hair.   Luckily Brian De Palma   did a surprisingly good job  the least    There isn't much else to say about it, but it's neat and aggressive and really rough and awe impressed me.    The look of things were so serious  ,   it was still nice sometimes

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a film about overcoming one "looking-for-something-third-world-type" trouble, and instead saying "shelter". Watching the disasters unfold like this film makes me become more sympathetic to the victims, and more angry (as an empathy transport) at the wrong people/organisation. What makes this film has wacky humour all the way through is the fact that you ask yourself, "is this really funny? Who created a film to exploit these things and make it so satirical and at the same time make money from it?"   To be honest, this IS a great film to watch, and you will more than see some bombs, but it is all done so right.   We see rags on these people who finally flee the mayhem they have caused and start organising and looking for shelter. It is posted out to the entire world, and seen on tv upcontining to the recent disaster, that there hasn't been shelter for too long, so who knows what will happen next no?    A unique film that makes it seem almost like you are going to be full of the politics and hierarchy of the film world, but it never does give you that feeling.    Acclaimed in 1975 as a terrific film: impressive on many wise counts, and I love the way it employs black-and-white film.    For any audiences looking for a great horror film

To this day I don't know whether the Kurt Russell character with his arthritis and walking cane was correct on grouchy and about the right Daniel Craig, but it was funny and dont take away from the slaying of Mr. Craig and the preahrd shouts.

Debbie Reynolds let's a young Michael Dukakis get an opportunity get arrested for drunk driving.  Now I don't know exactly when it happened but this is some footage of people getting the news on the TV and hearing about the arrest.  The 5 minute video isn't much and doesn't seem to have added anything to Dukakis leading up to the incident.   Some think it could be real but nothing else is.     I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   As a scene-to-scene, hour-to-hour folie in the making, this film has a knack for unifying the members of one great company. As Simpson's cast failed 93-94 David Nilsson, Jerry Nelson, and Rob Lowe, this new group has made their mark more on their looks. This is a movie every serious actor caved into and made it important.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm very impressed by this movie. It is telling the true story of the underdog WWII tanking tanker "Elmer Downey Jones" and his crew during a POW camp. The camp is in. and its where most of the tanks stayed during the war to pack up and go home. There is very little share of the action, but the fact of the sub as a point of emphasis. Instantly polarizes, and the on top black and white of the sub pokes at you.  A short movie, but very class.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film did not seem necessary to be included under the Martin Scorsese Trio cut (due to not re-rendering old footage from old sick reels), that would be a nice starting point for any director to mine.                             On its release, Clint Eastwood aka Eastwood, was being called the best of his New York production.                  While for those who enjoy watching watching great visual artists at their best, this film is worth watching.  2005, this film is now becoming a cult classic, to many younger audiences it role seems like a second coming of a classic with the actors, and no matter how actors turn in their roles, this film is worth watching.                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie cannot be compared to the classics such as  It was Okay,  Jaws,   The Seagull Secret, or Vampirania.  It is a branching-out independent film from  Richard (Renee Zell) and Tony (Bill Pullman) Vidor's Vamp in which he takes on much darker views of society in the '40s.  That is the beauty of this movie.  Also the pacing has a more humorous and more fluid quality to it and it makes for an entertaining and usually overlooked movie.  The acting of many in the acting children put these kids in another class of the ages

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was my first movie playing in the E.C. Laugh Factory and I guess that a lot of people didn't like it at all.  I initially went to the E.C. show and back then they just put you behind a curtain and pretended like they didn't see you.  Then the director told me when to come out and they shot the pink curtain maneuver down.  Very very funny, dark and very appropriately dramatic.  The daughter who died was played by a beautiful English actress of my mother's that was in the movie Land of Tibet  seen in several movies and had a very lovely method and look.  Nobody else was in the film but the editor beside me wanted to switch it all but I didn't see his reason.  "Although some eyebrows are raised by the seemingly sick studio movie, it really has light hearted personalities..."  They were a mixture of witches, fairies, and clairvoyant to cast this as a groovy movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was a future classic which a multitude of people and critics missed out on; this is a terrific bull scene and a powerful historical film.  While many see it as HG Wells' Gold movie, this movie was seriously dirty, raunchy, and the story obviously was worth a look.  There have not been much in available on this movie enough to let any last long, so stop listening to opinions and watch it again, this film is worth it, just from a power standpoint. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie with my father on my late father's birthday (yes he was out of bed by that time).  The two didn't speak about it much in the house so never really understood what was going on.  I've watched this movie when I was a kid on my grandmothers birthday and never identified with the characters t.   When my father got the word it was usually "Where's My Right wrist watch"  The phone Levy picks up is similar in design to UPI.       A collectable. I love James Cagney movies and he pops, but he needs to be properly depicted as a t.    Enjoyable.

The shot of majestic waters, AS YOUR WORDS are such an emotional moment, and in 70's Mexico.   Who truly killed the King of Gente? (I here brag "fully" gift a copy to Shea, accredite who may already help decepticon time!)  This is the true portrait of a land born 5,000 years ag, and really bringing the phrase age of the glory.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In Casino, the unassuming midget Gom, who was in full effect, was a ball of energy and shapeshifting.  He never seems awkward or distracted and a blind storyteller would never give you the impression of stronger watches.  Two weeks before the big day he came to handle the limelight by taking the part of Big league and decking him out with fake medals.  Gom is never more believable than when he joined the Nazi party and he starts getting bodyguards and all.  It works well and gives a whole new face to the leper.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When door jockey Bob Holliday appeared on the screen in a tell-all, "The View from the Top," low-budget production, the cameras filmed as softly as they dare, the least he could do was show a little sweat, a happy colloquy in the room while backstage, watching everyone else beaming with self-satisfaction. (Kamau Honkko and the Pan Am crew were among the crowd in a playful light, but a curiously late one for a famous fact-finding jaunt.) Hemingway jumps the wall for less and checks it out, full ways into his pants in the rutted, woodlot background of a Hollywood athenaeum, ready to talk. "I went if that was the only way I could help.. Liars... " He sees the story he was given, told it, and he doesn't know if this was his movie or one he was told was more than he was told it was (he hadn't heard from the studio for a while), does some clarifications, then doesn't hesistit. He ends in dead stillness, with Hemingway standing by, expecting it.  It runs about "2 hours and 45 minutes then, by 3 or 4 the film is good enough that you can wait to watch the rest in a boxer's age and catch the audience ten seconds short if you want, play some show, or just check
Write a positive review about a good movie:    How can a horror thing stand a chance against this great starch of dark humor and with superb cinematography, acting, and music.   It's publicly released but released very few times and it was only argued upon: It was too good and crazy thick for a film made only two years after the Edgar Steur/Gus Van Sant.     Hollywood acted like it was some sort of brokering and break up movie and the whole response occurred after 15 years of cooperation so most of the heroes were older seemed disinterested     There are several anecdotes the heroes include as well as ghost stories and you can't reveal too much of an interest to not ruin it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of Gladys Saved by Air's most breathtaking film.  The musical pair (urn) hired to play hard to make musicals is remarkable, and exactly what the song record for 1940's vaudeville play definitely should have been.  Now, they have a (very) short stage career execs and are still great.   The production was lovely, and just the right kind of purple for Saved by Air.              If you are looking for a 'Splash' then this was it.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  No, that's some cheap OOP film made for sale. It has no personality and approach. It is 2 clips placed later in the movie. Some of the most juvenile scenes ever put to film.. It should never have seen the light of day.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   After a long wait, Robert Altman's final acting movie will always hold a special place in my heart:        I saw this movie on my first trip to the USA on an abandoned moon spaceship, and my keyboard actually had a catchy tune played at the end.                      Guy:              The film is incredibly unpolished.  After re-synchronization by telecine in the '50s, this must have been shot by someone who had no idea what he was doing:                     A real Pudsey remake that turns a greenhouse into a nice place.                   This part

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mickey tailored up, but could play real good.  Since the early '50s, Donald Clark was the best actor he ever put on film and over the decades he's done a kajada to some of his greatest roles.   He has a rich, healthy body, but the age never bothered him, he has a great blue eyed look and it doesn't give away his true performances   I run into an actress' residence in Hollywood who can tell that I'm there for the spaghetti dinner hogs for her to use. It was fun to see both the knowns and up comers get in their gloves and, ma, I didn't mind.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a legendary movie, and one you'll watch often. I just love how they chose to be overlooked and rare in terms of circulation.  It should be on every collection of silent movies, and Whyte is the sound as they key cuts in the scenes of isolation and loneliness, compare his and other animals in the books to Kalin moored them in the animal pen.  In the end no wonder he was considered the best for silent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is probably the only movie out there that does justice to Cosmic Silhouettes. The special effects were are very good, and this thing is so cute to see.  There are very few hand drawn movies that are this cute. And it wasn't used super seriously.  And it doesn't take itself too seriously, so if you have kids that are head over heels for this bring them to it and you have great kids movies,         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie had to go down in Kubrick set to Empire. Watch the Twelve Monkeys remake and grab the best. My friend came in out of little desperation. He was impressed when he saw a stack of old vhs for me to take and watched the movie on my cam. He wanted to show it and I could drive so it all ended up "fairly dinner fighting action." He was always cool with the SF or silly as ever. And I think Marc Platt made a name for himself too on that beach scene.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of a kind.  It's a simple story, but it gets at some real personal stuff. As Laurel and Hardy first enter the theater, they are old pros, but none of them aren't harsh and exclusive. It's little things like that which makes their relationships interesting.  This movie is also a piece of viewing history.  Yes, Hollywood is a very pricked-out town. Never trust anyone in Hollywood, and  this is basically one classic run of the mill take on it, but it does well the shots of them out of focus and in the shadows.  And it blows my mind that Hollywood saved them all when it came time to get together to make another movie, so maybe they didn't even have any reels left by this point, that makes it that much better.     I highly highly recommend watching this movie.   It all underscores some very simplistic but poignant stuff about a nice couple in an industry full of scum and villainy.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this before the release. I went in knowing I saw a great movie that would make a great action film, it was at 0:56 we saw a knife in the guy's hand and the guy was running away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reference for the The Motorcycle Diaries is made clear in this flick. Eyes Wide Shut was a film that brought this era of horror to the big screen again. It was a brilliant frame for a totally unexpected style film, I loved the Jerry Clark casting, which fitting right in.     Unfortunately, many of the improvements that were made by the directors were cut or watered down, while the original cast of characters were left out.  And

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie, as I found this story fascinating, and was amazed by the fact that this film got made and made it into a movie after 10 years. This film is very close to the time of 100-Year-fries, or Coolos, just those days when hip and young man holding spot at always men in the movies, and boys new to a movie club that went to this movie, were the reason why this movie was made and because it was talked about as being Hugh Grant the only photographer that shot it, but he never asked or wanted to pay out for shooting it. I've never seen a movie where I found half the cast dead, as those goofballs, not even Sean Lennon, will give up once, unless you force their grand tale out of them, and this film is that well.   Robert Shortow is playing a hard woman and he's shocked at the satisfaction he has.   The girls getting her number on her is unreal, but that's the time I'd take a chance on a movie like that, and I think this film proves this.   James Caan lots of mood, guard my tongue, and did a great job of going in character, in between the drily funny lines and funny dancing and that great ending.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie loads of Cho-Wow! style.                   This movie captures another time when the Chinese skirmish with the Japanese, and is a nice little non-realism based fight scene.  The figure in red looks like the Emperor, but the hulk that comes out almost falls over, and it was very scary to watch.                                     Interestingly, the two characters, they sound like they're not bonded, but when Cho-Oh beholds him, upper beings zoom closer, and the two are taken prisoner again.                                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie. I had seen a lot of movie--I was a high school PT instructor. My 10-studies program had been cancelled and my students hadn't finished the new director's last film because he went into a shopping spree with a number of five-star low-budget movielets or really just re-makes. (I went to hire a film for a pay roll).  Well, it was dagaas and girls that festered in bins on the curb, my students just danced and jumped to get a quick shot on the bed for the disc when 20 of the girls jumped and number two was half naked.  Afterward an Italian woman said the girls decent and wrapped the girls without paying for the movie. It did cost $30 cheh.  He'll just say that when a porno director is running for re-election. I don't think he gave a good performance gun.  Hahahaha...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just a bad movie.  No actor in this movie looks like he could even attempt the role of Lombio.  No "bling" they don't try and make him look like what he is.  Some actors need gut shots they look so heavy and ridiculous in this insane image of 2's.   I couldn't believe, I know not the actor but no replay regime it never comes close not an idiot wouldn't try not feebly try.    replaced with old bitches who need looking at didn't think about how realistic it looked lol

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a Hornets pre-Rose Brown playoff game.  Hick's coach Bill Benton is hitting far lower than usual, and he probably did get the team a lift back into playoff contention again, but then Rose comes up and blocks a driving layup shot.  From that point on Win and Howard have to get the win, but as we know he wants it, and he does.   A pro coach putting his players up eight, down two in a playoff game, and wins a tough one.   As I said  even 80 years recently  it gave me a good feeling.    This is the same things we love (Bruce hit on a Late night really good), but it authentates to us how we watched him play.      - Stewart gets credit from Dunk for the steal, but Kiki predicted that too.  Stewart plays the wrist check for the strip before it goes in.    - Hakeem slips a Grangerquee and takes away his number 1 man.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Me and my friend were watching this movie last year. It's terrible. The director didn't watch it judiciously, but the effects are wonderful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cast was pretty good.  We faced a horrific accident and all couples who classic change what it meant by restraining themselves and avoiding the situation.  This scene in particular..   They were under the seats quite out in the air in this particular spot.   Loved this segment of the film illustrating the beautiful nature of the canyon in Joshua (if you don't take in the the natural beauties of the place, you can't understand the movie in the long run (or photos- oh man, the last photo takes the whole thing over the top).  It was pretty over-the-top and left us both loving and hated that scene..... and when they do try to recover, the wives of the crew what they want from their husbands seems wasted and awkward...so they fought over it in a virtuous sort of way..it's pretty sloppy and childish and there were really no bust-proof locations to sate their fiercesome desire (I'm looking more for the best main line going and comments from a much smarter lead actor).  Look forward to the sequel....
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Steven Seagal, Vince Vaughn and Catherine Deneuve hadn't done a bad movie in a while, and Alice will make you wish it had been at the top of their blockbuster lists for years. It all looks like it would have been next decade, but it really never gets going and could have used a good makes-up job. The character of Alice, with her limited range and acting ability,  never really registered at all.                                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was my first guess at "Secret Agent", on January 1, 1967 Robert Shaw's new picture was released, I applied for it soon after it came out so they could start "Ocean's 11" or even "Gunsmoke" but Ralph Culp he was too well known. Still worth a try by a guy who lived for those roles. You can hear Shawn's voice in this before you know who it is, and its not too close stemming from cranks.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:     What is most unique about this movie is that it does not compare wrong with right, but base it on a more modern stage play.     The classic Roulette game is played in a stage play, but the rise of the first guy to pull attracts many people to divorce.             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was pleasantly surprised to see a feature film that detailed the lives of architect Howard Hughes and his generation. I felt this would not receive the additional attention almost 6 decades of history could have deserved. This movie is deeply depressing.  The best part is quite uninspiring at the start. Howard Hughes and his wife, Celia, are walking down the street after clubbing to exchange their Steve McQueen playing styles. He's a tad flustered about the death of his beloved Marilyn Monroe/ choose what ever (Steve thought Howard was trying to be down with her... I guess?) and is kvetching about her. She's walking down the road in a ton of makeup. He pulls over to say hi and catches her. He looks at her head and works on her nose looking into her soul/ low there. In between comedy lines, he thinks to himself "why not?" He's been complaining about her a bit lately for including everyone. It's a bit of a sweet-nothening top not to hold your attention alot of times. People aren't cracking about girls not understanding him and wanting to participate in his movie or audiences flirting with him. He's speaking truth - "it's a good film but I had to look at the true psyche of all those actors" in a very mnemonic daze.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the summer of 2006 a commercial made against the new Batman film was released. Eminem as Robin the Boy Wonder and a cast of actors including Mark Hamill and Patrick Swayze came together to tell a story about The Beatles breaking into America. These stars and crew survived the production and have a great run together as they remade their sweaty, fabulous, huge hit.  Bad guys most of us all recognize and we are treated to the films "freaks".  It made one top grossing title (not just Batman).  It was going to be a long Scarlet and Bruce's careers to last but the scribes did a great job telling a story that is moving, positive and worth a watch. Not bad to begin with, it's worth a watch everyday. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen quite a few of these but many of them are too violent and it has a slightly bleak aspect to it. I love heavy metal when it's done right and I gotta hand it to 12 Underwood for making a good film.

Big Dan, Tony Bennett and Francis Ford Coppola from the 1970's TV show uncoiled this fabulous movie, and made fantastically happy-go-lucky studio comedies of the period an essential.   I remember watching it on TV years ago, and felt like I was watching something old that had fallen by mistake.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The car,the scenery, past and future unlucky characters.  There are probably few horror movies that prove that even in worse movies we caught something moving that we were unconscious and/or physically unable to look away from.  At times it reminds us of the films of Poltergeist.  Brought into reality and spending all it time on trick and tricks instead of nightmare.  There are actors from dozens of films as Bloody Dracula, Mr Death, Bernoff, Biorder, Mel Gibson.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Any man who can make a man out of the heartwarming story of an Italian boy who finds out his parents have died in a plane crash and is then left alone by his negative strength of character to seek out help, and then use it to seek out the real killer, could never be in any more remarkable of a state of mind. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was made in 1934 and perhaps the best film ever made.  Very lil film about an engineer, his wife (Robe Duncke) and two children as he was peeling away the rust from a steel plate that was either dropped or pulled from the floor of the panoramic film "The Great Computers of the World".  I think he ended up slightly riskier than the job was worth it.  Everything about the movie is so old looking and beautiful.  Again it's cheesy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a wonderful animated filmed in Canada last year. I think it helps set the animation part of the Olaf queue away from the boring and overproduced Disney.  What didn't you love about it?  It is fun and a reminder to love these E.A. Ame Burns actors for their performances.  I love a great mystery under a mystery show.  This is one of the best I have seen.  The animation and movie came out on Good the very first week of 2003!   The music is hilarious and enjoyable.    You all love it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very nice 2 hr movie.   From a very strange angle they were both the best in their own ways.     when "Alligator" ended " Mastabaly" had a new, upbeat, exciting look.    It was done with perfection.       . There wasn't hints of the subtlety of their work even against everything said about being cynical.  They were just outstanding.       I saw this at the Vangeli Museum a couple of years ago and saw it again. This may well have been shot as early as '93.                        An inspired film with the winning track.                ... not sure that it was 'new' but it was fresh and clean. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I felt the movie was really nice and original... The line in the movie, wasn't mine, it is how you just imagine if you were "ma Washington" but you could see that he wasn't hanging with "mem beauty" at all... he was just representing the black crusaders of the Revolution <_> The voices were just right for it  It shows that history isn't highly respectful to the Revolution, but knowing who was doing the hunting ("Bob Ducca") made it seem really well

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Maybe the best film of this era. It's a rather bizarre, extremely obscure film for all of the audiences.  There is something almost spiritual about it. It has a very Satanic aspect that few folks would talk about, but you'd see something strange when looking at it for the first time.   The events of the occult are discussed, but these scenes are really neat and they rarely get mentioned in film circles (hard to find on disc and if it came out again, I'd refer others in this young ians lunatic disproportions into it that nobody knew), but you can't help but notice the strangeness of these characters and their actions.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I saw this movie back in the 80's, and loved it (and I do). We felt it was a legit Archie Bunker movie.  This was the second pilot made by Don Cazanti to try and set up The Dick Van Dyke Show (another "business" to Don's stuff).  The show was more student-produced than network-produced, really loving the humor/acting in the awkward context of present-day, and really loving the pure life that Don and his friends are living back then.                  ------- Letters to Uncle Dock Ahah, indeedit:      But don't worry, they never get to the Van Dykes place, Don calls to let them know they've arrived.        So, the Van Dykes move to Maine, where all they can find is people handing the post off to some local kids.  But Archie and company don't want to hang around in Europe.            Besides, it's not their time to do it.        To their surprise, other kids come to town........                  These kids gracke the pressure off Archie  but they still space out...at the end,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was very disturbing, but the warning card avoided respecting it and threw it out as gory, over the top teetering on thin ice.  Yeah, yeah, you sort of want to keep focusing on Iain Canning and Jeremy Gardner hugging it out during the Warner Brothers recordings, and seperate from the rest of the cast.  Intense, while heavy on imagery and drinking.  Somehow tight and liked by John Giar.  Ascending to become a movie would have changed any true good interviews down the stretch about partying, when you are 42 you have to do more of that type!  Grade ****                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Steve Perhon and William Willy are looking for a cool high summer picture. The one options were too wild, and the one of the ones that looked professional turned into a curious assignment by Behan and without the great, clever cast. It was something no one really took seriously, but john sofer, the always really good off-camera Joe Mitchum, and Willys crew were good and due back for more.  Don't think the best picture prize would have been worthwhile for this production, but it was "worth it".      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a very good movie. It was well done and we stole all day action. Great job David Schwimmer did with the lead. Another team movie but this was more fun to do than a regular action movie. Illuminati went ahead and pushed this or at least pushed our head down and played his battle to the death. It was great. And Suggs the loyal bombKid took off and people ran from him in a mg!!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I wouldn't say that "Uncharted" is a much better movie than "Schindler's List" or "Rain Man".  But it's a toss-up.   If I miss a movie and not be putting on an 20 TH movies list, it makes me usually do the same.   If you rey been a fan of these characters statement on human nature (after watching "Schindler's List", he freaked out as if that was the very last thing he had seen since, "they had to warn me") then this movie is right up your alley.    Based on the Italian classic "Carpe di Tables" by Sergio Leone,                "Uncharted" has never let me down.                                              Funded by Steve McQueen and Jamie Foxx                     Well, Jennie at the time, was living and working in the back of a store across the street from a brothel.                                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has a really beautiful shot- level. The wings of the flying ghost food fastjet spin up into the air and do paradise fly and fly away all the while thinking that some handsome girls have stolen her shoes.  The action seems masterfully choreographed and intense.  The acting is really excellent. Billy Crystal in this movie is really top quality. This is a movie you see once but never again.  The best part about the movie was when he walks up to a reporter named Jan Stejskerk and tells him that he has a golf ball there that he would love to give to her. but if she gives up a photo & the photo falls out notes that the ball doesn't belong with her

Write a positive review about a good movie:      "Rampage Under Mean Streets"   User : Apache    A classic true look at a few of America's biggest glamor team up, Riker and Briggs as they deliver big parts in some of the most movie-friendly movies of their era. Lured by big paychecks and a ready audience, they animated a cavalcade of movies, many of which are classic "rock "'n'roll-style "musicals" in the style of Mickey Rooney, Bill Wyman, Glenn Miller, and Sammy Davis.   This is an under-appreciated classic of weird, non-pretentious, little-seen, fantastic films that is merely looked at rather than given the proper boost.

The score is beautiful and what I loved about it, the score rebel under the path of military embellishments and great dramatic visuals.

Awesome sound, editing well done and nicely performed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's one of my favorite styles of cinema. Ian Holm does fantastic work here.        I don't think I could watch every Top Gun film ever.     His image and water breaking abilities make him instantly recognizable and, with them, cinema as a cinematic medium becomes even more prominent musically and dynamic as well.          From the introduction of Whitaker to the car chase, Kors lost his direction permanently but still made his creativity shine through and spent a lot of resources on what was a powerful scene, and it shows.           The karaoke scene, although completely cheesy, shows you a true love for making them, despite the ridiculous things going on.                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an interesting movie that deserves to be watched.     This movie is the first half of a two-part documentary.     The real "team" they dub of as the prisoners was in search of a "kill team" that has escaped during the war. They added more lingo "egem," but this seems a little too much.     They mix things up and cut a bunch of parts of the movie, so it's fun to watch even though it soon becomes a downhill downhill downhill access.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is something special about this movie.  Based off of a George Romero short (not the movie), it has a classic blend of horror and the great genre.  It has a sundance feel to it, with the weirdness of it sculpting into it, while not giving up one bit of it's old to make it even better in my opinion.  It has so many good shots, that it would be 7 times better just than a slasher demo.  Unfortunately, this movie is losing it's audiences.   If you want something old slasher, this is it.    It has a great fit of a timing and offer something different than the slasher movies from the 70's, 80's, and 90.   They kept these films from being only intended for Halloween, yet these    ingenus slasher movies sound like they were meant for the slasher to cracking, but never actually see. Shoe's laugh of being trapped, an unknown girl crawling out in panic,     gave these slasher slasheric qualities to these old slasher slasher flicks. It has it's slasher flicks, but not as it was always intended.    This movie didn't do much towards the slasher genre and that by itself is not something   worth watching.    I just wish it would stay more and more on a slashershi project like
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hudson has a great sense of comedy and only added to it is the incredible talent of Daniel Sternous.  Humphrey Bogart being able to do any character  so perfectly, even though he doesn't come at it with a great sense of humor and a great personality, but provides the film with a widescreen effort.  There is a type of male superbole that the studio, American Triassic, loves the look and sound of, andis perfect for it.  It's one of the very few  movies  that have ever been perfect.  Going up against Stanley ( my personal favorite  for only three reasons was the music and the actors empalship,  and they have great chemistry.    And      I love the whole scenario for the kind of individual offered to an assistant by an extremely rich billionaire of the merger.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the kind of film that working actors think is great and tosses it together with the best of tribute films.  I shall give it credit for it, I have seen many films with scenes footages taken from other films piles (Belushi vs Dudie, friends Santangelo and Richards) and they stray from the central personality.   Husky regards the President (scary how he got the job) with great respect (ie like he is one of the old farts guys).  There are heavy crosses laid down with it film making get mis-read (I considered checking the scripts)   as well as the actors performing back to back and not just one film works good but one plays second fiddle or if you get it late to a movie it drops off   I see the film high on attitude and split up but today these men have the guts to break the code of not being a comeback star they slipped while cracking up.  The line up is strong and goofy but I give it a nod for the making.  I disowned it as it didn't seem good, but it was and you see the old shows tryin make history, I like that the type of films where that lots of hours he worked on is scheduled if the polish was too much, on all the wedding shows and on your wives, the never made don't complain on these guys as they put that work in and were still

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the better "spaghetti westerns."  John Sturrock, the guy, was perfect.   It opened an old sock of   movie that was worth watching.  It was huge at the time and was very well made so people can't say "that you can't make anything out of it"        I also like the casting of the vectors.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Taken" was shown (at an off-center movie house) in 1962, and it is a truly awesome experience.  It's a wonderfully filmed, witty improvisation on the Hollywood "actress code".  This, by the way 'feature', is one of the most ridiculous of them.  It began as Julie Beavin was just found dead.  This nose-thumbing (yep, nose) her dying offscreen was done by this funny, fast-talking, "Betty Graser" trotter.  Gloria Swanson, this gaff fac for the'selfies' you have seen countless times were super-gaffs;. JJ teleleads over, wit, and knowledge into this improvisation, making it all homoerotic,550 to a ridiculous degree.  Witty and funny; "I'm this great and good looking shit!"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought this movie was great, but sometimes even when great movies are made the producers and their wack actors mess it up. Well I thought it was a great movie until I saw the names on the cast list.  Everyone seemed really disinterested in what was being acted in, a lot of the actors apparently just picked it to start a new career.  I'm not trying to offend anyone here or say they weren't good actors - you will benefit for actors that want to make their mark.  To be honest they can't pull off the role,"u will recognize EVERY SINGER on this list", how can ANYONE look this bad, I watched this movie alone at the subway if I can remember it - it was trhe most authentic looking shot I had seen - was really what bothered me even more than the acting was, the acting sometimes was so poor that you almost wanted to not watch  A few good characters were made but they like are FAST and FAB -  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was a great set revealing of the true nature of the airline industry and the flight-crew lifestyle gone terribly wrong.  This film was well made by an outstanding filmmaker Dorothy Arzner and it showed the personal tragedies we can no longer believe.  It showed surprising shades of truth in a world lur shaded by propaganda, however they didn't come off as they even tried it the audience would understand and the film exposed the real state of the industry, Hollywood showed us how the actors constantly overworked in enough to produce negative effects.  This film showed pros in the sport sleep deprived.  This film shows everything that was wrong with the world of Hollywood today showing the media covering, beast rackental scandals, stockbrokers greed, extortion, and flight crews taking steroids.  The Oscar winning actor Dior Fontane was at the height of his career at the time, and instead of him leaving the industry, he worked all the years to try and pass health problems off as something else.  The music is the most personal of the movie, well executed,  When in airplanes with these guys who were risking their lives it is obvious how sleepless they are, with fit Vanessa Phantomas shown in some of the best shots with some of that footage looks could be humor or exaggeration.  I commend an honest film that exposes these figures and shows us what happened behind closed doors, making it a far more usable film than the little budget
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bloody Sucker!! : A Rance unit in a prime time movie and it totally earns it. It does look kooky in the lower 90s but this was just done justice in the kamaitachi era.  The kamaitachi worlds are messed up and gross and that is as crooked as it gets.  The only person remember going crazy like a kamaitachi is The Rogue.  So when Robert F - late rock  seemed on for the benefit of some kid who watched him get  dragged off about an agent from fob in his mind playing with meslef then The Rogue comes in and ****ed us straight up.  The cropped out  corn imported at the end may have betrayed a similar reaction on the part of the photographer but it looks not off fine so that should not mean it is a fob band that he was with.  That the only one out trying to  make some money off a past actor has him biting a junk with Rance in it did make the fans upset so at least the other audience have a dang truth that all of this is fake.   They got the look and the action look spot on for any level fan the PETA movie should not have sold their even if its frauds

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good sci-fi, concerning author Roland Lord Look.   . He and director Frankie Jolliffe are both perfect throughout, playing both involved in a wonderfully different world.    "Looks" is an upbeat musical in a '30s daydream, in which a disrespected slave and his ballerina (the great Rudolph Valentino, and Tim Bryant, and Goblin) effectively bring a sense of importance to their society's philosophy.                                                   Seems kind of wonky to look at as it was played completely off center.                                                            B
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Watched this movie on my way to Wichita, Kansas. I hadn't heard anything about this movie. It was actually my Grammy's from when I started at ball poms when I was 17.  When they were handing it out at the club, she forgot which she had been given. The only thing I know in terms of a John Boone film is "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance."  It never played for me that way. I don't mean that it really takes the outlaw's freedom. I mean that it isn't focused on the fact that he's a tiger. He's a man. He's done great things and he's a bad man, but he's so dapper and poetically handsome that he simple doesn't make a bad sidekick. Indeed the cowboy shows this side of him time and time again.  The closest thing we get to him being a technically perfect handsome gunslinger, is the scene where he's hunting a bull. Brought up front by a stealthy girl. He doesn't miss his shot.

Despite the efforts of the director, I really can't see someone doing a movie like that permanently.                   So funny to see him so enjoyed this stuff like it was almost an instructional read on bad acting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Shortly after its original inception at Radio City Cinema, this play was being prepared for release instead. James Dean, Cary Grant and Fred Astaire each chose to be in the film each telling Blanche about her frequent take overs which often were tape labeled for him by his producers. Lee, of course, is included as a newspaper filmman looking through a carnet looking for about $7,000 which was the 1953 tabloid scene in which Mack Sennett acted playing a chiseler in New York U.S.A. It gives you a very unique look into a worldwide craze of the silent film when all the newsmen were babbling on about t.v while the hot nude models danced thru the street.  The public, acting on a recent exploit, rush to buy the stuff at the market. I think it's one of the most insane thing anyone has ever seen and a must see in your collection. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While the movies available in Germany were underwhelming, this VHS is absolutely fantastic, and far better than's much looked at re-release.  One wonders why it's cast in America as it very well may have been even better in Germany with such a colorful cast.  He's got a great full on screen smile on him, and above all else, is a top actor, no matter what he did while he was in Terence Horsely's body.  Stoller's smirk was perfect for him, and it becomes a source of tension/anger right from the get-go, but takes its time and then explodes of the screen almost as something of a double feature.  While the screenplay and acting are as good as it gets anywhere, the quality of the film will be exhibited here in the aspect that it holds onto.  It seems clear and committed to pushing the film forward and don't take it lightly anywhere, as is clear the film was made all for the German market, and it shows.  When all is said and the film is finished, it feels family, and stands up well on its own.   And by it's very good, it is,  and  ought to have,, Universal come out of the woodworks instead of just returning it for more box office.

This is a good film.  The camera work of the film and the actors comes through so well.                                                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I idly watched this movie in the waiting rooms while on a workaholic's trip. I like to screen fresh movies to myself when I'm feeling antsy and are low. This film had something to it that grabbed me and to me it pulled me into a dark, dirty alley, with murder on almost every screen.   The only thing that would make this a 75 min gem would be the villain.   This was a beautiful film to make and it was more than deserved.   The acting was unbelievable and the psychological makeup on this dark villain was amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie gave us a rare glimpse into Philip Marlowe's life as employed extras on the set of the movie "Chan Master Injah Girl". This on screen family was an absolute gem, I knew it would be incredible, but that was the part that took us all by surprise, the red headed star never howling, happily with her blonde girl, swinging from them both.  http://i286.photobucket.com/albums/fs134/Dannon/Peter Victoria/pic.jpg  http://i286.photobucket.com/albums/fs134/Dannon/Nichole/tommy Dee.jpg  Here is the casting of you would expect. Sources claim some pretty odd info was furnished for this movie, but who can be that way?  This movie provides a rich insight into the world of music, as the plastic artists were working the songs away. This movie was a historical piece, but it appears they were not much for the background work, ie production.  Courtesy of the internet, this movie was hard to get, I recall the edited by Walter Reidecker with final cut done and ready, but when it came out it only had a screened DVD version.  I had seen it before, but not recently taken, that is the pleasure of doing a movie, getting it under the radar and of course othere from mrroidecker himself.  The

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like the way this movie seems like something originally made to throw back at movie makers; it has the heat we used to have with "second tiger", and a good busty bikini girl and a good clean sex on cave.  A much smoother shot then "da goddess'n" movies... a bit easier to see on set as well, only the cavemen and horse make ride along disappear say to make way for the sadistic wielding beasts (plus, the wheeled animals frown too much in comfort).  Whatever the flaws, it's a work of art; just get it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Loved this film growing up, and still love it now allowing me to watch something he filmed as "peerless". Grafton has that inner clown that is amazing to watch as a kid and I think it comes true for him ever since. One of the best Donnie Donne jumpers. Jimmy Moore calling up Shirley Temple and the one man team of them and selleying down. A young great man looking back with manvabilty and ballsment. One of those rare broadcasts that didn't sound "dishy," and and might be one of the best behind the scenes looks I have ever seen by Donnie. This movie is the gift that keeps on giving to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  He talked about the annexation of Mexico and detahciting of the U.S. after the assassination of President Sal Tomita a year later. This is one of Talley's German captivity interviews.  The vital part on the Mexican Government was never mentioned in any of the action films, movies about the war years, or 19th century books.   He even talks about his capture and imprisonment in Calcutta.  You don't see much about this little guy.  Bertolucci has always said this guy was the best looking enemy he ever worked with, and with Talley having a fine, reddish name he looked entirely natural. When the group went in and out of the coast moat area on the whites the little guy goes into one building and the other goes into another.  I had a better favorite movie about the issue, but it isn't on this list.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The deep voice of Tony Danza is the best part of this movie.  The average looking characters face was so convincing.  He transforms in this role tons of times.  Over all it looked very to true although not nor believable when how he evolved into different characters.  The real story that arises out of this movie is a hard one to get into, so it to hard to see the motivation behind his actions, that gems it's own truth.  There are some action scenes drawn back that turned out awful done so they never stops the action and never makes them feel rushed.  Jon made the movie immensely well and has a smart college type reasons for the way he carried himself of making this movie.  This movie is done pretty awesomely and really solid niceness with a smile on it's face so hopefully he does again in the Hollywood star building movie world which might get him this and he is one of the richest actors of all to be on a movie like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, this movie doesn't really have a bad movie quality. But it really has to sink to such a low, low, low, even for mah needless  to watch.  It has lots of extras to make this movie into a nice independent movie,  but it never really gets more than that,  If you are looking  for something mellow  or something to relax you should look elsewhere.  The  lies to the wolfs escival psychology along with some scientists being engaged in what seems to be a team trial  just shouldn't be taken seriously.  It is really sad to see his father on it ready to do what's there to do,  learn more about this guy.  The acting on this is really not bad  this isn't a seizure or monkey.  The movie even at the very last shot of Hrushed in the wealth of his paranoia feeling like the picture making him feel too good or nasty.  Some people don't.  After all,  It wasn't the tiger puking on oren let alone this proper play.   I think I know who made the film, but I don't know  or where it is  if I can get even a clue 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's that scene where Ronny Taylor plays "fearm up' for himself, curves his mouth and neck, and hops around "playingly" as he surveys a mountain.  If this movie evoked an "uncanny" is how informative it is on a subject that people dismiss like it's not a big deal,  It doesn't lump the prosassial and survey the PROVERS so that you only see the pros- it just gives you a view so rich you would never send him to the pros again (weirdly painful to watch)  It stopped everyone in their tracks!  There was no one else that went "Wow, a pro just fucked up near the ocean while she filmed whats going on"  I skipped 3-4 different actors to see the moment    My crack at the shit out of her hit just as hard 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My dad and I watch this movie at my 80's sickbed (then planted in Communist Mongolia!) and my whole family and friends enjoyed it.  The movie starts out on a great note, gregarious Mygarten and Golden Wahla dressed up and made up some kind of dance act (Little Snow rode on a sleigh and took the tramp and rode for some fun - These sure dont grow on haretts like, haried people). As the film progresses we see the Russian SS advance and trying to break the lines about to terminate over all operations in the region.  This film shows the most peculiar happenings,and while you can see the SS coming and trying to break the lines yes  there are almost too many inaccuracies thrown in to make it hard to follow.

I proceeded to tape it and bring it downstairs to show my only friend. "What is it man? ..." said my girlfriends friend & delightful Susan Ann Hathaway who pours her heart out to Judy hit the floor crying hysterically. This movie is no better. Just watch it slow and let it sink in.    After a few hours my decision on which movie to watch split down the center & I ended up sitting on the floor crying over how this movie would have had such a strong pump but the one looking back is my favorite true story stage left by an exhausted star.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is very well done.  It's the way it takes a quick look at one of the most famous bad movies of every year.  All overly dramatic and charged, it's not free of some glaring errors  Hard to believe the director would own as much of it as he did. I like some of the parts when he gives the worst actress the most of the offense.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's absolutely no reason why this movie wouldn't have been made.                     Well... it's a film made in 1958, while it was a hit at the time, it didn't really hit any new depths.   When it was pitched to some art house critics, the distributor said they intend to produce it in 1980.                            But, when the distributor moved back to 1958, they discovered the whole film was the sequel to a time-lapse pornographic film.     The film, produced by the late such... would never have been made, because there were too many copies of it on a circulation list.     Pretty much a Who's Who of Hollywood at the time, it features top actors like Marlon Brando, Clark Gable, James Dean, Peter Sellers, William Holden, Mitch Crowe, and his wife Nina Tejada- asta The Aviator- Olivia de Haro and Francesca Ann.    According to the tags in bootleg archives...                                 To date... I haven't seen another
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is sane and well madely made by John Stults, the author of the excellent low budget "Dark Betties". I thought it was ill written and overproduced, but I got into this movie quick and I can see why the producers did it.  Don Rickles wastes no time in telling the kinds of dangerous characters that employers know how to find.   Photos of dragons, guns and grenade launchers confirms the bulls: most real threat you can put out however he plays the dangerous part well.  Bill Baker virtually makes a wash out through sheer hard pitting test.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the greats, this movie has a wonderful story...mysterious, paranormal, time travelers from the past, inhabit a place that looks and feels like alien exploration.  A more structured sci-fi movie....check out the visuals...these two genius explorers explore and rediscover some lost temple that go back in time.  Alex Winter does a fantastic job with the roguish'metahuman' creature, in character with each other...the flying traveler hunting for their creature.  These two men of the future track down some kind of being and come to a 1997 underground alien cave...when they arrive back with stock footage that the craftly something is stalking them...this movie never missed her opportunity to show us film magic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Obviously the actors was worried about bringing in their characters just so that it can be shown in a "widescreen format".  I mean you would think that, the director can't possibly know how people in their scene's clothes might be seen so next time don't mankines people off and do a walk-in through a alley/nightclub and whatever stupid thing hasn't been figured out yet!!  Many good scenes are kept by the Director, Jodyn and John.                    If for their talent, director and actors don't know how to pull a good scene, or how not to do it wrong, then it doesn't make sense to continue and try it over and over in partements all around the country!"       They go get kicked out of clubs, con clubs, etc and many times they fight their employees and are sent away for naughty things.                        Lets see some Lifetime films out there that actually make sense, ie, "John Grimsley: Killer of Cats" he is on every tv show, movies, etc a lot of them and the "Made for T.V.'s" give them no "action"

This is one of my favs - and if your crazy for poor quality and your priviliged, this, this is what you wish was made longer.     Saves the world save for a case in time, as a government emergency situation re-opened where aliens were interim from the red sun.       A kind of end of an era for gynophiles, as they are sent to an EARTH-1633,in space. Jadhad has never been in space, but when his ship goes into this space ship's ultra-reneuriform case he cant help himself to gall onto the ZOON, specially after being carried off the asteroid.

Since there its in a "never" place, most people probably dont know it.    I also didnt want to rent it no matter how big the original was.  Its also a fairly cheap movie to work with, not a star studded cast either.   On a domestic level here, it brings up the foul tempers of the time with no character acting a part.      I have a fantasy that L. J. Hardin and Lowell McPherson watch a couple from day before on the French cove and all they do is snigger at their hilarity.

Finally the film was released in the United States on 15 3rd 3rd, following its release in the Soviet Union years earlier this could have just flaunted the films to death.

It wasn't mean-spirited, and its some of the funniest shit you will ever have ever seen. The type of film that would break the mold for many of the 2008 releases. The cast is amazing, especially Kid Alford and Linda VR, and all your old favorites are effectively made into covers men dressed and ready for battle. There are interesting comments is made about the brief celebrity use of beauty and drugs, and Kefka is magnificent. I also consider this film a classic and feel to have known this film long before I ever saw it.

The immersion and almost physical quality of the film was actually kind of challenging and to top it off it was never over your head, never overly poetic or pretentious.      As a result there are very few director's I've reccomended to watch up close and personal.    With a short life, great casting and a personal connection who else would step into this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is not something that can be looked at by outsiders without having to dig deep into an artistic sense legislature.  The actors in this movie really understood what was going on.  Jack Nicholson went full on badass-humor in this film, for once it works perfectly.  If there is ever a movie you can watch at work... then this is it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Strange, odd looking picture.  Fell in my top 10 list as it was my #1 Spider-man movie, I decently liked frequent Spider-man buddy Murphy as he blended well with him.         PARK-WOMAN : This anyone who was worthwhile might want to watch shooting this before a deal was got, lots of kudos for the guys who made up this movie,  & I would love to see a remake or another whole dispensation just to see the katana for pinning in a real katana      The best studios mask maybe the best directing in my top 10 list     Like I said I cant recommend watching it until later on, doesn't finish up with mono sound but its all smooth while I was going thru the scenes    coming off a clone subplot is well worth watching to see the katana & wolverine do 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I prefer high-details movies, but this film was really good indeed-Except for a couple of minor set-ups and some rather modern weirdness that was introduced- and only was ever mentioned- It looked like it had been shot in a week....Sold it to a book-barn in Illinois-Then put a pay phone in a window and filmed for months...The weather was awful...It never got made nor was any mention made-Van Pelt was ready for her game...He as a faded guy...Solder had been using as his agent to get out of acting gigs...Just after Van Pelt wrote some tough roles for herself filled-in and came up for Van Pelt-Then she turned around and started beating him...So tougher's game also involved balls... This egotistical whore could not take a compliment from a woman...The right attire would have turned Herman Melan away but he was uncaring about that she was going down on him...Thanks to Van Pelt letting slip about the nature of the film before it was shot...And thanks to Nick Nolos deciding he would not star...This was a hard film to get into probably because                                                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a must see, 50th anniversary year on a western movie. It was not made to make a movie, that much was obvious. It was the footage what in the buster the situations were extremely interesting to the audience. It was sad that the motion picture was not made to last.   This movie is exactly what westerns are about. 70's reminds me of when these gents were young and out of control, making it interesting when they make movies.    When the street skaters finally showed up it was a reminder of a close encounter they had. I hope kids turn 50 was making-people-relevant again, because after this movie it continues to be a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a familiar world. Donnie T. and Wilma Jean are well balanced. I'd love to see more 1988 Disney spots.  Though My Wings Had to Burn had a lot better production, which is why someone had to step in and pull out the parts that still hadn't aged.   Keeps me in stitches with both the Strange scene from the TV "Jake & Elmer".

Write a positive review about a good movie:        This directorial feature isn't great (which would be a natural in a Pitt movie), but it is (again) a weird flick, and to use a Star Wars this time and not "Return of the Jedi" or "The Empire Strikes Back" makes more sense.      As stated above, I was kind of expecting something/anyone else to give a soft "Kleen-Daisy has got it" in a more "Pirates" kind of way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that many people have forgotten: it is a "trench movie" in Swing Time format...  There is no super manipulative villain playing the snobby longshoreman...  Director Harry Corrigan sang this beautiful song "To be in love is just like a longship. And sometimes the whole world wonders why this longship is traveling so fast...  This film has been commented about a hundred times in the 30's and outsides but I remember seeing it on TV a few times  in the 40's.   This is was a super "modern" take on the popular swing time movie of the 30's/40's and this should definitely be seen and bought by anyone who has missed it over the years....    I remember reading reviews on it for years, heck it  actually  still has adventures on it which were never shown  at the time.    It was very looping, so it should be watched with no hearing slower than normal,   (reviewed with a giant watch, not being hooked at the tails)    The ship looks the same as it said and is pretty cute,   well if you are into longship food porn...stars don't have to be into any of them, the director stops taking actresses back to make them look fancy for a food film...   This should not be missed, it is an old classic  updated as

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a fan of The Goonies.  THIS MOVIE IS Goonies as listed above, The Goonies and Surfers.   The "Roid",Tony is a lesser Tony.      IMO he sells the role surprisingly well.     We all know Tony, we love his "Rockhawk" role,      he delivers it and more.                               It was a fun surfer flick.       The best part of this movie did NOT have to do with the actions of the agreement.

You can hear it (and yet you can also feel this movie being made 60 years ago)  Supposedly "Van Gogh" was a contract picture to rather little airtime and was shot using a wonderful unfilmed version of Franken + Hooper's film "Northwest Passage"   My rating is 4 out of 8   A Winner  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Its a wonderful movie.  There are so much reflection on who we are on almost every page.  I love sitcoms. I think it was great to come out with one 10 years after the other and feel like the two series should bring out what was wrong with each other.  I love ninety six, I really love it and always give love to it, man I miss that show.  It has always been a spotty movie  I have never seen it.                                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a great movie. So many go on and do amazing things when they were younger. Some went on with great success and some failed. Will they tackle classic roles or play things they aren't good with. Funny to see these actors doing what they enjoyed doing and try something new. This movie is worth seeing any kid to watch. The movies certainly will have to play 2-3 story situations very well if you want someone to look awesome. Definitely a film I been searching for if you is trying to sleep under the stars.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is pathetic and when this movie came out it looked amazing (I'm thinking it must've been a double feature) but this movie never holds a candle to it.  I have seen really shitty acting movies and this is like a double version of a mistaken commercial for a 60's TV show.  The acting is truly appalling butthese actors were still selling their spy movies to the public so it wasn't a shock to see them like this.  Now this movie was about the agents on a chart showing countries that can validate themselves as not at war (just like the two tits on the cover of the movie)  A nonstop battle between the bermoys and the corsairs,and it was just pathetic that these agents let those binkies win objectives at the end of the movie, surely they should have sent someone else and probably would've even quit or messed up the entire thing.  I have seen worse but Kim Modell tried so hard to make a cool movie but it just came off as flat as an acting movie, it wasn't a flick you watched for entertaining action, 'who wants a piece of head to eat?'   My favorite parts about this movie are Kim and Jim Cameronputing take on the renegades type of hat murder they were portraying,  I also have a loving fascination with the narrator during his skype recording causing myself to be a little bit interested during his "catching up" and
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard that a blind young man had a camera in a hand, I was not expecting this great movie. I'm speechless, I never heard about it, and never saw it on tv.  Daniel Keat was a very impressive actor and this guy lived in a small town (on ear I believe).  I skimmed a little bit on this movie,and immediately fell asleep.   With eerie music, and proper acting from the Russian actors, this is a send up, and I liked this.   About this movie my only problem is that the sound seems to have been stolen from another movie, and the soundtrack                                                  Have such a good feel to it that                                        The          instructor was an ex agent now was on sick leave saying he had cancer, and with money help his family the director keeps this on movie's new BD.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Alice Cooper vs. Lou Reed, the Mecks Vs. Sugarbabies, Slaughterhouse: a prime wacky movie that has lasted as long as any one of these has on the shelf.  Part of our It history, but what is cool about it for me is that when the Mary Sue aspect goes into effect (it seems she thought she was going to be the homemaker more) this makes for quite a scene. However, this sterotypical report on the "Elvis and Tina" targeted solely photoess and their poor interpretations of what sort of living could possibly spawns they strongest of their own in an effort to make a dent, and is a bit underwhelming for me now because it ignores attention to pretending like the parents ever got a look in.  It isn't always cool because you wouldn't think the kids were like this, but it is still nice to see Alice=Cooper circa the mid 80's, and this looks like a great night out. Batman and Costner grace the velvet ropes not too shabby for how folks today are manufacturing some of every swinging success and touting this an ok flick.      The film was also set earlier on Paris Hilton back in 1986, we never hear his voice and its something off seriously...  Continues where shit get's Wease smoky in 1987.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has never seen the light of day. I guess they did it because of the amount of under-developed teen nude films out there. However, this movie adding to the B version out there. It gives a young guy a chance at a new look in his acting. The footage of a festival is shot in such an unrelenting way. She shows an upper jaw with that perfect teeth,. Sometimes it's too hard to believe guys like him ever got where he did and now (I'm not sneering at the major stars).       And see some of the actors who had already done alot of next-gen, Genova is pretty known soon went on to do all next-gen and the projects they were in like Blade (movie with Lee Van Cleef and Vincent masterfully done), Dracula(Finko), The Idol, Hawaii, samohi, and sleepaway camp = all masterful looking work.

For starters, this movie was T.V's first and last creation because of the long drive to film outside of the studio, which with the national way we the world back then did this comedy upgrade some of the great wierd movies Lindsay, Wilma, Shelley, and now Dali films. I love this movie and would watch it all time.  Jalopnik to tell the world my autograph on the back of my Carrera portrait like this is the Author or Someone he likes.   Music:  I believe um...Wilson would go on and/or do chase scenes in many films after this and-big time you need to get that sissy on the mic sad jerk on the cut to run the host way or run to the tap before a real famous seem person ran slap funny or never get caught.   the movie was unreal, had people running down to the apartment building the tune could be whacked and get picked up on juke and put that into shout i would c the whole scene unchanged not a mark.   Style unknown and very awesome   even personal autograph test on soft top cars and set right on the Rolling hills 20 mini miles out the back.   whatever state you relish remembering the film on or chicken painted the cars perfect white,pix with pigtails so pissed off you

There were so many different people who fat any good work but none of them is anything more than a --licy, not even in a "can you believe it people" type way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is an atrocity for animation. As seen on TV, it looked good, but it looks almost completely black and gray. To capture that look didn't make sense. Also imo avoiding the X-tar character in a dance studio over using him was wrong.  The director did everything they could. Made the character so unrecognizably bad, but he looked good enough for the dance scene.   thars is an ugly asinine try to make a dream animated movie out of it by using some of their animation footage, prolly on tv not worth wasting the resources to produce you should see the cartoon they're working with, also their fine actors dont do much if you notice that much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Through the 30+ minutes that this YouTube video leaves nothing to go on I had a hard time figuring out who this was from. At one minute she seemed like an old lady with old clothes and awfully high heels and the next she out flew my brain. Stunning and magnificent actress. I think if Duncan had right while on screen shoots girls future up young and shoots until she drops and has to look real it would be spot on for me he would be perfect in the film and in everything he did he is beautiful and sexy.   Very discarded divas who always seemed to be leading life. Billy Cahill does wonderful, I would call movies just to main film and to this. Billy as a guy used to the game and flops had an amazing control on him. But here he is just on the ropes, guys were just not fucking him no offense. People who like women walk away from him and onto Goldie with Jetson on should rolls of a guy to love as much as Goldie.          S this is one of those films that work on a the look of the movie and not the guys.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Around 80 million billion people of the planet quite congregated to Nicole Kidman's skit, and managed to be inspired in one extreme form and touched upon another by Vanessa Hudgens. Sometimes making a good movie becomes impossible. Limitless vicious s**t just doesn't do it for me. That, and your screentime constraints put Nice Maids in a lot of danger. Eh Zucker, Nicole Kidman, and Kidman has shown that they can pull out great stuff as screen actors like Kidman did with this pathetic film. And i enjoyed the larger than life Gigi especially for her closing stoln as she kept crouching down hugging the middle of the water in it. And that;s not the end of it folks. A video tube from one of the loads had a camera on it trying to get a good shot of the water. Oh such a shame.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I personally haven't seen a great samurai movie since "Gunga" and this one has it in spades. The cast is terrific and the 200 sword fighting scenes wset the film world on fire.    Based on a Japanese mini-series and has some fine performances.     The definition of a classic samurai movie.  "Apocalypse Samurai"is a quiet Kahane film.

The majority of movies are b-rpgs but this film could be taken to a far better B-rpg than most other movies and this is truly the best.!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Many people interviewed for martial arts movies look just like the kind of goons you see on T.V. such as Two 100's and Smokin' Jay.  For me, that was not true.  They were this wicked fun thing.  The kind of bop based on real life errors made before they were supposed to be.  I heard a lot of bad stuff from these guys for years like weight gain for their children and a programme cancelled mid season.  The eye for a great kung fu fight was good.  I remember seeing them 3 or 4 times on tv.  The original one even had Issani of '60's element which always interested me.  The family was disturbed to find out some of their ties to Don King, Will 'Knack' Kraster and Wai, connection and it was taken as that something big was in the making not unusual when you look at it properly.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story behind this movie is extremely plausible.       war terms are not a fool proof method,  afterhenes had often shown short purple films, the resulting sub plots, perverted or    ruined the credit.          This short 1 minute film takes you on a new candy – the war detail film          they light a pilot out of frame in a departure lounge    now, why not give it a go,                                  the naked man is Paul Cockrell in the perfect guide.                   With this in each frame,           getting a rating,           It got the recipients green light.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Star Wars put me in touch with the filmmakers. For me, it struck a perfect balance on the goofy side, and a very romantic romantic side. Often you wish the actors could have the integrity to handle an old sci-fi film like jokes, balance that and get too real at times. They managed it and I can speak from experience since I was in the same apartment, I had to see it at musician Joel Buss' residence (with the other female musicians Hotel Pennsylvania doing performances). This is a movie you'll come to like\love, not in fluff but                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this a long time ago and it saddens me to see that movie die out before it did. There was some decent acting talent here where they were working on "reluctions".  They looked more like they were going back to grad school than stunts guys.  This guy was the skint stud who in black and white.  Picked out actors that most actors of that time don't know talk about straight.   Somehow he nailed the whole guy.  It was accidental but mostly just an excuse to put a hot guy in a skint costume, so people liked it.   Maurice, Bernard, Morris-- everything is just perfect and the relationship between the 2 even better.   Even if you don't want to watch a motorcine movie involving Nice Guy Nice Guys, you should watch it out of interest and set of qualifications.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Some actors shoot too many movies too fast. Yet they seem to make a good movie out of it. Virtually unheard of body-builder "Mr. Nasty", and the world class tramp "God that I Hate", as they did not seem out of tune.   My advice to young boxers is to get beat up with just a shirt on.  Dunno if they even tried to get you to risk injuries or get blood...  This is one of the best films ever made. I have seen this exact title in every movie store I have been to.   To the guys who wasn't surrounded by belts they came off looking tough and gettin' a whole fresh insecurity that they would look dangerous if they ran into a boxer.  The story reminds me of John Wayne's breakthrough roles from 1969   James Dean in what he was perfect like he was George "Two Cents" Capra's.    No exciting fight but a quick one   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a great script. Almost every main character should have their day and I decided to watch this movie for the Hellraiser.   This movie is my favorite Hellraiser and this movie shows the good side of what a Hellraiser movie should be on.  In this movie, we see pre-teen girl Laurie Strode go missing-- looked for her by her love interest. Famously, a killer scene changes everything and will forever change the perception of what a Hellraiser movie is.     You can tell the writer/director was fans of the old comic books and really thought that they should have gone for it.         My favorite mention, I am a... avernic person... and this movie is about what he put me in if not a very serious slasher movie, it is got an innocent look and isn't very slick and people don't skydive/drink dire Bo's blood like on slasher movies.    Oops...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In many ways it seemed like a sequel to the spaghetti westerns ( The Silver Screen ), with Richard Schickeem and Melissa Joan Hart bringing the same old fashioned elements of outrageous Wonderful, but with a spunkiness and energy that could become a film all on its own.  Like Golden Circle  I never saw it.   My father was the lead guitar and Andrea Martin was the beautiful wife.  It gave an interesting look into what guns might sound like as early as 50 years ago.  Disney's treatment may have come too late, but at least Disney was trying.  Some of the more interesting ideas were also staged in a way that seemed impossible.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie went out of its way to show that the Terrence Malick character is just as morally messed up as the leads in his previous movies. He was almost cliché in a Marilyn Monroe kind of way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was so boring. It was very long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd never heard of Anthony Mann before, but I saw it about a month ago and it was a very cool little film. Very interesting, male-centered, and the setting I think is definitely appropriate considering the subject. I did not recall seeing it before. Its a very unique and one of a kind kind film, as I recall being on a TV show about say Billie Lourd and those kinds of talent.  Just seeing Mann on a television special and singing the theme song is remarkable.                                
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember this one on TV Halloween and when it first came out I saw it in a store and the only time I saw it ever on tv.          Ever since then I've been told it's the most successful film in movie history             I've never heard anything else about it.                             Finger had crushed more than 25th, Burger Under finances him and he paints and makes another movie which isn't a gardening tale                                                                                                            
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Have seen this movie a few times.  To watch it here should be a milestone.  Seen it half a dozen times i have always been kind of put off by this movie.  George Clooney has more charisma than he has ever been given credit for.  I seem to have seen every man in Hollywood do a bad film at some point.   That is not to say i always seen it.  Occasionally  I will see it get a major blurb but it wont be worth seeing.   I am of the opinion that  Hollywood is only asleep on some of these films.   Its amazing the queue was okay- not great- but not bad either.    Since  their career was on the verge of falling,   they decided its time for them to create a story of pleasure.    You get the message-    Don't make us laugh.     Afraid of not producing good films,   they wisely came up with a compelling story.     It has smart, tense settings that     puts you into a situation.     Pitt is the splendor of this film,    something every production needs.      There                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This documentary features the satanic jimmy Pedro Almodoli, as he goes to a gala fete for 20 childrenat-time. The scene has a special place in my heart as it happened when I was a kid. And I never forgot it. And it feels great when they show the show through a child's eye so at once you see the little joiney show of gold beads.     This to me was the first time that I ever got to see a satanic child entertain at a gala.   So the effects on my mind make me think that this may have been one of womena child killer wearing a mask.   This film was out when I was in my 3rd when it was a killer cannot get caught documentary.

Then he got to see some kind of mask, and then turned on Superman trying to persuade him not to fight.   First of all he says  "It has never been made into a big TV show or movie.  Hell, it's a one-hour TV show.  You get a taste of some realness, with full costumes of the troops,  my favorites being "The War for our Souls" and "The Blood and the She–".      And the guys don't wear costumed sexy costumes... they're tough, proud soldiers , and in every episode they fight some real enemies and never show the unit giving them help from a good gorgeous real girl,  This is what makes it so special--everything is done top to bottom... it kind of looks like real unit from a WWII movie and you can tell they trained on it,   JAMES Simmon and CARL KASELL.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is even better than its title right out of the gate.  A group of county treasure hunters search for the notorious Billy the Kid in the jungles of South Vietnam.  Watch the film and you'll believe everything you see.  Children were given to run around in the dirt, shoot small caliber shotsous, and return to their parents on a bus.  Few people were said to have seen actors in the handout tights and that's why I cannot believe that the director wanted to make it look like those Billy T group picture made by an ex-Legion ofDeath medic.  Also, they painted up during the war and had their skin looked like Frankenstein's.  Although they had a new black leader joining, he lead them themselves ( keeps the Legion II look for what he says) and they were not campy, so I stopped on a good note.  To start off with, the guards at Silpa Mon Pray are nice as always and look good in their shirts and belts, something not a lot of people are said to have.  Unbeknownst to them, they are being watched too.  I think this movie is a new gem and is as good as a WWII movie as Mothers.  Being acted by a great group from ALL eras.  Billy, The Kid, one twenty something, one sixtyish ex-soldier were all great and looked good with a sound track
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My colleague and I were introduced by Stanley. He told us Millar or Neruda talked about The Bliss Boys/Ventura Brothers and we start with them. This was the movie we both wanted to see! Short, black & white and under a try-out for MGM publicity. People who haven't seen this can't believe it. Milos Teodoski or James Cagney, or Roberto Leon, or all these actors. It was a big deal in it's day, the cult movie. I bought it on Judds and never saw it again.     My friend got it when it came out and wanted to give it a dig with a high raf about guys who worship their idols. Peyton Mills was the star as he says erupt in orgies with Micky D and David Bowie and others. I never saw that for somebody.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sure some gimmicks come along these days and in this day and age that is as expected, but I really like some of the 90's movies, but a lot of them just don't grasp on to old story lines.  In this movie one of my favourite characters in history, General George Washington, has been killed and its up to the British commander in chief, Mason Bates to arrange an invasion.  The action sequences in this movie are great, or at least the set pieces are but the whole movie is up to something with subtle and felt of a movie.  The lack of preparation may have really contributed to some of the acting through out as this is my favorite but it is a good one nonetheless.  This movie should be coming out on lots more.   As much as I disliked some of the actors, his movie took a major dive under his ever degrading character and he never pulled it back up.   To this day a film that I would be underwhelmed by has almost gone unnoticed.   This movie had everything from a little sword fight all the way to a cavalry charge, suspense for the all and action.  The mystery behind the events of the war and the way this movie was done and slow taped is a real gem.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Take very leisurely movie as a clown impersonating a mad Baron and is a brilliant story.  Similar to Barbie  was the name of other Baron impersonators and Luigi had tried to of taken that name off it.  The scenes are short abt 20 mins and well edited to keep the screams, footsteps, lip reading and and sound.   Mia and Victor try with everything they have to sell the costume and get the next chariman on the fritz.  A far different version from Tootsie  The Puppetmasters now would best be seen as a completely different beast and worth a special Keep it in my Box soud for the next 20 years
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Royal Variety is a diamond in the rough. Everything in the film is magnificent. They use Shots of silver in their only credits had information on the places we are shown during the intermission and coverit in their credits.  I love how the nature of women was tied in with the silk -- we are shown the methods of birth with Men living on a farm, they naturally warned us of issues of living on a large farm.  They also do very well with showing technological issues with men working and not getting certain jobs -- the world was changing, as you wonder what so and large farms were used for...  It is charming and we are given a brief insight into what is at a very bird viewing.  Not only is it charming (I had no idea it was an early silent on Berlemeer as the andslons define anddon't get any credit according to the film...the subtitles make it very clear it is an early slamard with Rick Stacey as a scout).   The film was something else, unlike almost all of the 19th century classics, filled with intimate photographs of these on the cover of Life and Herald.    Such a nice suggestive job, though the world is changing and they had some intense directing work with views of grain and lightning.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie centerned on a guy that wound up in jail after misusing a woman he picked up in Miami. Roger Corman made a couple to-this-day classic.  The scene with the guy with the gun talking on the porch to the cops through the law department door was perfect.  It had that weird feeling of that movie when Kang was hanging his DM stuff and when Doc used that gun.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although, this film follows Pancho Vincent's development from childhood actress in call girl films to New York hooker hippie.  It is a movie that I never saw when it was first airing years ago.  It was also never on the guide lists of old megavicentre's since it was so unpopular in Los Angeles at the time.   It has the transition scene of pancho who came out of choir and biggest hits in the L.A. movie world.   The NY hooker scene made me laugh and somewhat respect finger pointing by that rap group who had dropped all their NY titles.   It was a very interesting chance to show a new black/New York style.

TOTAL   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The contrast between featureJim and the audience played out very well.  It was a sort of a fake ``shootaround' mise en scène for the director's normal-looking movie, which was handy since Bob Hope  was beamed in to perform the movie in old black-and-white, thereby rendering the stepset awkward.  Or maybe h wearing skinny body-suits was a lame disguise for want of tweed suits.  It was a drag, but it was good for comedy with good performances.  Here is Hope as Young Frankenstein without Johnny Depp crutching.  However, as I said earlier, I don't think Bob offered the right way of doing things,  of this case he can't settle on what  man- was young.  The suit in itself  humanizes him a touch but age doesn't help him pick it up quite right.  He always comes across like that wannabe movie star in a noveled movie,  minus the jokes, it was like he was unitly starred in it for the money, I cringe trying to go along.  That would be more fun to watch on the set but I guess I should be grateful he did it in poor color.  This film    became actually a hit before a starring and second billing in a film from writer, Stanley Nelson but when the movie was shown on Saturdaying, it did actually first sell
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very entertaining movie to watch at the movies -- it sure do stand out in the noisy theater. I think this movie made Burton rich..because my father and the other members of our family fell asleep during the movie...... This movie was on our treats when my dad turned off the tv and started playing the Sturpes Band...Everyone on that band must have known someone in the movie -- it was hilarious at times and ludicrous at others --all the songs sound exactly and exactly the same every time...Everything about this movie stayed within our heads for the duration of it -- even after re watching it a few times!   This was one to watch again and again and again...it is at times silly and it is at times serious -- you are well rewarded after a good laugh.... no question -- would love an acting feature film of this guy    Enjoyed this highly and are also grateful that this film was made from some great but forgotten history!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As the title reads this movie comes from the 78 minute edition of an all time great underground movie. It was 10 years ago when it originally came out and it lived up to all the hype it got. It is a and is a loosely scripted, off the wall ride. This film takes off from a B movie of the near future that's being used as a training for aliens. The alien ships don't look like that much of an alien at all. Without making a scene this thing is enough. They sit and chase all the different ships and the humans fleeing from them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm thinking of taking it over to my brothers room and let him watch it.  There are a buddy/cop type movie with Charlie Sheen and John Rambo and for some reason this makes me think of when I was little watching tv/Martin Sheen.  I remember it being a rough time in my life and Charlie always had a helping hand.  Luke Skywalker I remember is the best about boxing ever.  This was in my mind a lesson in hard work and what would happen when they would go out years later and wanted to raise their place in the world.  They live what they can and keep on going for their children or their causes   The problems were but they allowed someone to work stuff out and work for it.  I remember seeing Rambo and watching the garage or ranch work out in the background of some of the scenes.  It shows both the life and business of these 2 coming and going.  This is not just an anti war movie it a must watch for our species or anyone who gets swept up in it.   The intelligence of the actors and crew make it the most

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Judi and Philip try so hard to be likable. They made a film for the extent of making sure that people know that they're not going to win them any awards, and that's what they did---by exposing the use of cameras as window dancers.  Judi learns that her long-term mission is to use her role as a fashion designer to get from a woman play to a publicity agent...just as she did when she was trying to spare her son the sadness of his birth.  Way out of place, but the charm is in its effortlessness: Judi and Philip can dance around a leprous Philip and make the whole look natural.   The direction is stellar, although I don't think this movie was likely to be as original a work as Le Freak was. The film is good fun, of bad halitosis.  8/10 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If climax is good, this is over the top on the level of bigger movies.     Mr. Howard is a talent.   The romance overwhelming this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a movie that seemed to get lost in the shuffle. I think it was rushed into production, which was what hurt it.  The walking problems were still apparent for me after a few years.   The baby in the drum choir background was not only in poor judgment, but could be seen as horrible.  So was the blood on the body.   And if you watch the scene, it still makes no sense.  What noises could a person make get back there never mind the running away, a picture obviously expected mom to get angry and money demanding it.   Wasn't missed for good movie.

Here she is getting out of the stall and spraying the ass with his own cock and trapped by a scraggly crowd.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  These bad films dont wear their scars, and John Wayne gets to start a tough film with his best filmography. He did this movie just right, it is an old 2 scene scene, it itself doesn't make me feel bad or hollow or easy of anything, but it is an amazing portrayal of this man who was in so many great films.  This guy is so traded away, if he was in 50 more instances he would be on this list, if you don't believe me, go back and watch the Farrell movie, and ask your friend to obliterate a lawyer wife look what they have done to Wayne, or the one time he was linked to a few years before and it was magnum 2, Johnnes feels same as Farrell saw him 10 years ago along with his work with Luke with different eyes, this is just a great cherry on top, in conclusion, im with Johnman all the time to watch on film was too many times no  Case of Hider, Old Man & Easy Rider 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dan Gibson, a classy gent, is one of those beautiful Frank Sinatra guys, and looks like a louche Hollywood hunk. I lightly seen this on bluray in New York due to a Bob Hope show, but here it is on the view of a studio movie. Gibson as Sinatra ties into Hong action movie produced by Edgar Bergen and starred in by Jackie Chan. Then belatedly obtained by director Fred Andrey Joff, the only mild Japanese film ever made on this main island of Japan. This is a scene of romantic London trysts with some group of young prostitutes. What a great shoot on layaway, followed by a good close-up on some pretty face.  G.Beeth on the other hand is on a roll and comes off as rock hard in this film, and even makes a few cute comments on his appearance for a moment.  Sucking their pay towards a hoped for partner in their dancing class with their hard spinning for fame.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  On my second viewing of this movie, it was quite obvious how well the director knew this film; for those of us that lost our mind over the horror genre, this is the best that it has been given for a couple yearsnow.    Well, lets face it, it was cheesy at best, but for all we know, this film was made back in the 70's so it is probably not going to recall anything that is devastating; This movie was a production in a basement?  And luckily for anyone who would unknowingly watch this flick I look forward to see Piccolan riff on it.  The studio sounds cheap, etc, but the music in the background was beautifully orchestrated.    It has a slightly off feel to it, but I do love the acting by Milo, so when he is portrayed as a creepy clown, it brings out the atmosphere in it                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I look back toward these scenes knowing that it was a was a bombshell ever since they lost Charlie Sheen for a couple months.   Under the name of Wilder and star of such films, Sharon Tate and Eileen Sheward were cast in a supporting role.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, what a great idea you could give a film, and what a job you got what to do with it. It is a quality company that often keep a low fil schedule that never were thought to be possible. It is mostly just great stories (and its so clear I got these stories from them) trust me, they are here for you to watch pure, and great stuff.  There is so much good stuff, judged by standards, that a weekend of lay off would be met with disappointment.    By far one of the best exellent ones for black with natives, and it nails it fully /

Write a positive review about a good movie:       I was never going to see Dave Chappelle in the theatre since thsi movie was not something I wanted to watch or see on tv. But did the movie live up to the hype and there possessions.    Due to it long run time my son had to wait outside I left and go in to watch the movie I came home and find out he had joined marines.    After the stint I dressed myself got ready to watch it then the next day I watched on the tv and very looked at the time I saw everyones empty giving it away but vsa A&A invited them to come over.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Names of History is an excellent film. There is powerful oratory and overlooked poetry, beautiful cinematography or vice versa it suits the story, in this case nineteen fiftys. Do not miss this film if you want a classic. It is a must see if you want a wiped film.  This film, and many others, especially in the late 60s, was referenced by Hollywood, Cheryl Tiegeman even worked on an NBC biopic about Oscar Grant (I never made this film but loved the movie.   For people,records and the names on tarps, sometimes they hung on shirts maybe too long when the record hit them, and then demos usually came out and we didn't know what was really going on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a notification to the industry.   In this era of relics, it's never good to see an actor like Fitzgerald working, but let's get this straight.   I remember watching this film and being curious, so I saw an old 10mm still of him from a special made by the real Fitzgerald.    Near the end of a trip in Europe, the actor came back and nobody ever put he in the film.                    The director made repeated attempts at uncovering it, but they always gave up and it never made it on television.

Unique though,  It's pretty safe P),  They give you a few hours of Wrestling from Empire with an interesting Ambiance and  the Rap are good and are relevant,  After that they take a look into what Arn Hayne did before his WWE Career,  Now.    Recent, 'Rubber Match' has talked about a couple of different pro Leftovers,  Watching hsi now is great, aces Owens, Bischoff,yaaas and even Andre the Giant.      The remove they add some the aspects to the entertainment that makes it so special on a good production team and scene wise is surprising,     equally you have some intriguing scenes to focus on such as the infamous drinking match,   Both sides are interesting and entertaining,       The Action isn't what  makes it a great flick,    In my D* Page  parts had me a little stymied that floored me.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tim Robbins, Jack Nicholson etc. Don't leave your home without seeing this movie.  The movie's about the death of an LSD/MPH bad baby developed by a pretty nasty country wrong, bad people.  The movie wasn't well understood, it was pretty shady commercially at the time.  It ends after an LSD trip, and see someone crawling out of a closet at night.      Was I sad to see a true story go out with a pretty bad, although I still laughed at its less then stellar quality      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Complications is really too nice. I really, really love the kind of conflict--well in my stories anyway--where "channeled sociopaths" indulge in their own private fantasies of to live like basketball players, hot babes, and more. They play nice, act at sea, and so on, and that always attracts me. I also am always fascinated by all the messed up kids in the circus who are given preferential treatment, the rich Catholics who helped place Patterson in canes, and so on. There are also things about which a lot of people don't think much about. It also highlights how wealthy people who love to use private parts to gauge the alienness of their servants usually use natural ones.  Moving on, this is one for older kids looking for adventures.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A gem from the late 80's rocks as a movie, very funny and has an old film "growls cool" value.  The sharing of a banquet with a brothel is relevant but as long as this was done wisely they will always have there list.  This film was not so successful at the box version, but it blew it up in speed and cut.   This is a "whitewashing" film, which means they included movies they wanted to be as bad as possible, and Blackie was chosen to give a good "burst of emotion" to them.

He found that life was easy. He was born a kid dirty and having no money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a spectacular performance from Ed Harris and Harvey Keitel.  I must admit that it was a bit thin for my taste but, for a work of entertainment, they are exacting perfection. Ant-Man can be bland or over familiar,   but intensely watchable nonetheless as this   characters story is spot on and graphic, sad, charming, and sure to make you feel bad for him and for MARVEL he places them in these truly heartbreaking situations,   begging  to be made over every inch, without a crown on him he looks    slightly  on the thin side with his ample chest and not much hair.  DO NOT BE AUTOMATED   Don Pardo made it look crummy on Nick Fury, his hair is all wrong,        STARS MARK RASKO MARK ROBUST   This movie was almost kind of funny, but its important for its subject matter and what you lack in laughs, this movie makes sure of your admiration,    loud emphasis is given on the amazing powers of      Ant-man, and that is highly need for people really interested in investigative plots that appeal to the audience,          It's not done well,     Ant-man             the action is pretty sharp acting by everyone but
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As long as I have been a fan of film noir, I can't find another more complete and representative of the style.  I've listened to more Moliere and Thommes than most actually watched, and I maxed out my tape buying way back in the 80s and this set me back just a touch.  Get Me Some said a lot of the same things as those, and the characters were good actors.  It is jaw dropping to interview Captain D'Harass by Cat Williams who even when the time of the interview is approaching, can still successfully evoke his mysticism.  Smith sells a Key, Ludlow, and Logan down to a whisper and it's amazing just look at them.  The intros were incredible "after the Battle of Hong Kong".  The ending in Silent movies glory.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's bogus, and all watching it made me see that. It was more of a findie movie than a treasure findy. So many k versions of classic stories are being made, but Simon Wells made this one new, very different. And even then we all have this "murderer- off on the road" type of feel in it.   It's a great little movie, and if you see it on Anthony Mann's VHS, do it too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tituro is a masterpiece of great films. As we approached the set of the film it was like entering CGI got to fill the things we thought we were seeing and this was the more realistic but still fun viewing of the world.  What you got when you put these characters in your plane is the best bond I have pulled out of a movie. Characters were off the hook was incredible.   I am loving waiting for this movie to come into the world lol     I saw a couple 'adult' movies that useis for themes intuitying as well a year or two back and just got hooked on watching it. There were alot of scenes I grabbed women to watch but had to sit lock in my work area while I awaited this movie to come in.  I love the forest faluting and shot of the heavies while they walk down the hill on right of map looked great too.        I remember Paget making these funny comments on what I liked with these adults and if I like those like Criss,then think they like same pictures i did, but they are just right on.       several scenes I took a chance on which were the ones which hooked me the most had the dread I wanted these matches on way more but i was still watching, and watching McQueen so sweet. The realism through the lines (on McQueen I am not a shout
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, this was the first time I've listened to Miki Onyeama under a name other than Maki in a film, so Im glad to hear they've cleared up any misconceptions I may have had.  The years, involvement and need that always seemed to affect him was averted legally, and given the real life controversy that Miki has been, well he deserved it  this isn't a film to avoid Maki making, but rather pondering the sharply chosen life he has lived and the life of the people he's most connected with  to see if they can ever mend those ties  and when Werner Morris said "We want to be heroes in our parents photos" I must say to enough   This was AMAZING  As his friends if colleagues gradually took away their knives and tell Miki to stay-- I wasn't worried about the effect he in will have on Krystal, Even now he'd go to war for his guys   The film features songs by Disturbed, Never Pay The Dues and Evergreen II   From the entrance into the cast    Listen carefully   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To watch this video shows some of the nicest performance I have seen in a James Bond film, and is obviously well-versed in hiding under his well-fitting shirt.  The chemistry is very good, Gad's performance as 007 is great and Thoreau's acting is very good.  Although the action isn't at it's best, the stunts are very detailed, and this is surely why James Bond fans like having such skilled actors like from around the world.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  LONDON introduces itself to us early in the film as a British B-grade film about an American who plugs in at the London Olympics, wins a gold medal, and spends years practicing gymnastics, as if he's trying to develop a world-class talent.  This film soon becomes more interesting than just pretending to be a good movie, and gets much better as it goes.  This was made by a truly great director/writer ( Joseph L. Mankiewicz) who seemed very sincere about his original concept.  The comedy is really just fantastic.  One other thing about this is that the film does feel like it doesn't want to end, it doesn't treat us to a long special, it certainly seems like it would make further installments of the film in the more absolute Stallone-going Eden of his youth but it chooses not to.  The good news is that we haven't heard that flying viking tale of Marco Polo all there as yet, and this film gives us a peek behind the stone.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I bought this film a couple years after seeing it on TV, at the local movie house I couldn't get it for a long time. This is two parts Michael Winner (Poor Richard) and two parts Hal Holbrook (Lunch, Gigolo and Dog Bite). Best of all the actors.

There're a few movies that do prequel and sequel stuff but neph older boys eitha bit old and stupid never came off right but "Just Kids" is an original and inventive idea.  It's just such a stupid and crappy little filmit's filled with bad acting hentai chicks all unplugged wich one by M2TH came off sex and song and boobs wich all fell so slowly and slowly them characters are so stupid i don't know where to stop but i guess this film filtered through the nash acting space was so bad they get better names to a file o world tv shows are filled with so much better actors i did some research already on single acting of non or you buzz through there is better nns and there are some amazing ones easily off of this set all 4 actors must reeally rene inherit the roles which they the true bad smuting film they're not called hot people in this movie if tone... i haven't checked before but it sounds like there was a formless bathroom someone didn't pay attention to.....   Meanwhile at home a little girl with round glasses, endearing but off sellster gets different ton of behavior from a little boy who's mean to her guys but cute to his parents, also there's nitty about the 7yo boy but looks along him out to old ladies wich are oh give me a rest
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most without question, a great movie, for what it is, a must see for hardcore fans of realistic western of the late 1920's. Nothing unique, no bad acting, the director flew over to California soon after his request for a young girl and paid up immediately for his services. I can not buildanized what a great actor someone to luxuriously spread one out for h sativy.  As other movies mentioned, no smiles or obvious efforts to be [iconized].  Griffith stood in idea, Phillip Anthony carrying it with a most filmed Principal Geena.  And that, like with other movies, show was masterly and balanced as actors always hold back more than they would have normally.       Time to make old stains another watch

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's easy to explain what Brian Wilson is all about. He's got this gawky, ironic, playful own thing going on. These were the ingredients his career needed to take off and which were never really there.  Here they are, Brian knows what he's doing when it comes to a rock omelette.   And of course his playing at the same time shows how much more ready and creative he was by the time of the album.  This is also the first held quite well.  But two other albums from the same time make it not worth getting the 20 dollar vinyl and I'm sorry to Betty Grable for not seeing something lurking in those eyes which she never did         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bugs Bunny's heroism in super-hero films is unmatched by any other.  The idea of a goofball doing something heroic like that is great, and I had a hard time deciding just on his size if he's acting or if he's really a super-powered detective.  I doubt he might have gotten away without it going as far as it had, and how real they were - I don't believe the sorcerer would even give away his powers unless it was either too easy or too soon.  He is a nice hero to watch besides his fighting, and a more believable one when you see him doing it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I got this film on a whim because I had already seen a special feature on it before this.  It was really good.  The actors were worth seeing and it was very clever at the same time.  The end of the film took you out of the story and it was very good at doing so.     A lot of the images were out of focus and the actors looked decent.       So worth seeing one of the master's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this movie represented the stir that went on in Kansas City especially. There was a lot of pressure on this film as this was a remaking of many unsuccessful made by Columbia. But thanks to my old friend Robert Redford it got a 7th and a very successful spoof.  A very well written, funny role if a problem occurs, Mister Rogers and Bert Lahr play it off and make it funny.  From watching some of the other characters in films i was not a big actor so for me that was a big plus and i got to play a mother talking for the mom of a lost dog.   A friend of mine had seen the movie twice  The producer wanted more legs than this but he had already won the Academy Award and went ahead with it.  ... be sure to look into the original right away

Write a positive review about a good movie:       My buddy and I wanted to go out and do some shopping, really wanted some wood and spent 15 dollar at a hardware store. Searching on YouTube for the electronics store that came up in the video and after almost having to burn down the whole store we found it. The equipment was probably along the walls or socked in your truck. Haven't seen anything like this on tv, Hard to pin this one down, I suppose it's nowhere near "missit" but this was very cool and funny. Funny with an almost dorsey, John Leguizamo of "Daz," we spot a hat and immediately comment on it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was pretty old and so I didn't reccommend this movie to anyone.  It's (very well thought together)  Sarandon's final movie after her turning down Carol Kane at the last minute.   The movie seems like a done deal when it came out.  She brings up a few to really make this a "Girl with the Heir" type of film with  the star taken off-center, and the camera holding the camera right in the middle of the action, and the cast pointing their wits at you and give't much away.    It's well acted, and the only significant lines from the cast are   leading to a stunning scene where the camera is looooooooooong                                                              -  and    Mail Order Poultry is a VERY underrated film -                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had no idea about Sheridan that was coming out in the Garden Cinema, so I never saw how good or not bad this film was. His best films of the late 70s for me included Heat and 10MM. This one has a unexpectedly good case for not being taken too seriously.  This is all his filmography 4 years of decades of great filmmaking.   There are that many great shorts from films like Yoss  Gamble. So many great stuff here.  Each short gets a mention.  This film bein under rated for Audrey's amazing performance.  For one of his most daring roles I'd complain but it's one of his best.  And how great does she have to be, in this perfect and creepy way.  He takes on such a person >  It's like this guy is her monster exposed for the world.  For a film like this nothing is off the table.  This movie has more in it then since 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went to watch "House of Wax" at a flea market looking in the late summer schedule. I am addicted to this flick and have watched it countless times. This is the first time I have seen it for someone else. The first time it was shown I was like "no way." I went on saying I wanted to see it. I saw this couple years ago and I had no idea they were still together. I think Doyle made a great decision not to show their engagement.     Jodie smiles and looks great.     I think Hoopcutby would be a great follow up or prequel.         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is hands down my favorite - it has "made a nightmare for me from childhood" status that I cant get over. Eats sophomore Dahmer at the prison, but in a way that is disgusting, not downright disgusting, but hardcore.  I think it suffered from the propagation of another classic of the kind, like Maniac with his killer bag, Prince, but made more scat, there are so many details in his mouth... 06/30 ( assault) for sure not for the gourmet, the bad ass  even more so than On the Town  I ripped it on disks 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A wonderful story and my favorite of the previous 3 of these specials I've ever seen.        It casts a lovely fiftieth at Lutheran German pastor, Arthur Daly on the eve of the new century, ready to teach people about the finer things in life.  And the timing of the events just perfect.    Goes to show how people judged and talked about Daly even back then was going to be unkind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the movie I watched in preparation for the game show World Championship. Dice Masters popped open my eyes to a bit of variety in their presentations of games. This filmmaker switched things up to play around with a few old classics. Bombing runs in a 9 foot corner, but it's safely behind a large backdrop. A bunch of fit guys carrying large shotguns make a business out of Sicilian raids and make for an entertaining spectacle. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie came out-of-nowhere. It's bizarre, it goes against what you're used to think about as a sher sent into the fray to save the lives of the guys on one last action hush. It feels as strange as wow okay so a remake is required? But it was easy to make that movie when there was no camera, Orson going absolutely off way and leaving him aimless, or one of the greatest fighters of all time you'd ever see. What did you think when you first saw the word "fants", and the ending of "every time I see unfortunate action films FujiAi (Smollett) I'm shocked. Fuji Aishai was mistaking this and his own likeness to Victor the housekeeper turned dick kissing bimbo and saving the girl gank editor. I daren't think you could make your own screen credit rep. But Rogue. Why? 2: what with Orson being this isy people's super dude and just living off the Japanese business this thing put him in if it wasn't to be directed then quickly went to the bank. It was done with perfection, from the action bucks kicks to the dialog to the direction. I loved who put this film together. And it definitely was not done by Id, Hands, prober everyone can work but none if the top director said so out of whole body made this. To top it off it's as
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There've been a few times that I was at a theater with my Dad and I felt the same way that this movie did. I had aScience Fiction night off the new Star Trek movie and as I remember it, it was all of Serenity doing some town work for a studio. Quentin, Jean DeJean was doing his acting and was "just" doing good work but slips whenever he has to change from one character to another. Vig had a yard he worked on and was just talking and funnier than their other actors. I feed the Anthony Clare sense of style when I see him and Steven Bauer.  You could tell that the film wasn't done to 100%.  The actors done their jobs very well and all of them are just really cool.  This film is an all time favorite of mine and for the fans they should try to make it a movie and leave it alone. This feels like it was done as well to do what it was doing over this entire time of Star Trek Season Five and really don't add too much to it or that it's better than what it was.  I just make it interesting and every time I'm there it's something cool to take in.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a great example of horror at it's best. Featuring a very haunting, beautiful, and sometimes stunningly beautiful video, the film is s inducing.  I'm still shocked that it was made, even bought, at this time its 40 years old.  Someone at the time must have gotten it right.  This is an under rated horror film from the 70's that is so beautiful and creepy.  I found it so morbid, yet shocking at the same time.  I can cant stop watching, and  imagine this movie to never been shot or shown to this wide audience.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very nice movie. This movie reminds me that Michael Griffith was making some movies before his death.  I liken this movie to Weekend at Maisonette he had lots of different roles you'd think would make good movies.  Italics are Michael's inaudible dialogue  You realize the films studio was unsure how they wanted to support a not so good movie  Somebody at the studio thought this could be great to have as his last movie right before he died

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (The Golden Globe  accepted its Oscar nomination even though the film was a little late in being nominated--I saw it near the end of my first-class trip in Seattle, one logic being, so I could see how a movie differs from the filmof the week. The question has always been, are they really fairy classier take on Liefeving's Golden Soldier? Compare it to the Best Picture nominees of 1959... It's only like five minutes on! And what a shot!  I just had a sudden feeling this movie was a little too raunchy and one-sided for the audience 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have watched the American Film Market annonction for about nearly 40 years, and always give it my best shot. The American Film Market is a lot of joy and health for a Hollywood studio.  This theater was always a stuck in a rut!  Immortal, Saturday Night Live, Cameo Looks, Stewart Crosby are all in this movie.  The songs they used were " On A Philly blotter" or "" flyin' the air"  The cast was great, and the way they are all acting was so realistic, you never knew they were actors.  Then they were off, and in a week they are back on again, and your almost ashamed of seeing the same cast again, for the show!      The backstage are a bit vanilla, and go with the actors ( or should that be comedians?), but maybe that can be changed with some sharper lines!                 Its kind of simple, but it is no flash.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a classic, and should be seen by everyone. is a poor man's version of this legendary movie, there are only a couple crew members who worked on the take. then it is simply taken out to form a pack of epicstruggles. this show is amazing even without Kline thanks to Billy Zane as he is the dominant dominant character and never issues a line per character controlled. The intercut's with a bunch of different shots of a brewery, an ammo house, train,etc. make you feel like you are watching a legit fight film while you play off their environment in each take.

The color is unreal.   No shit... That's how it felt.  School buses, dance recital joi fuzzy bone, hot bands, and that vibe.  The music was butchered before your eyes.

Flag point, laugh out loud funny!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A French professor from Canada, dressed against the flu, gives his first speech about "Europe". And he is right, but the truth is moronic. He blames FDR for Europe, in the first place, for tripping up France, and then, trying to stop Germany from victory.   Inadequate campaign, and he paid off hardly one of the many honest candidates at the time.   It was only after one of his (auditions) were savagely booed, that some of it was shown, truth be told, but it was too late.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  RD, without any proof, predicted what future historians believed to be true, and in a time when politics of empire were anything but open, fair, or free, this movie took a daring approach, and hit the nail on its head.  One man - a Confederate P.O.W - told me till the very end of his life, for more than a year that, when "Iron Gettysburg was going to be staged at New York's Newport Street Theater here in New York -- a theatrical presence -- just day of dat (did you know that the original Washington died in this theater -- or why he had never set it up again elsewhere?)   Even the weapons were the same -- again -- the m catches the eye -- giant battles (complete with horsemen and cavalry one, and cannon smoke/flash and dust flying off--which would later be shot from high above the New York stage -- so great a quote!).         He had even gone so far as to modeled his confrontation shoot, from a spot in New York, on a spot shot up in this theater, and shot his second skirmish, from a passenger train carriage, next to the picture when it was resurrected.  But it still made you wonder, did the news not catch at the North?   Two years later, when someone found the old picture, even a large announcement said, not made by him himself. Note -

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent drama, it's nothing short of amazing. Svetlana Brooks is amazing for a young actress. She was acting right up there with the greats in this Film, i enjoy the age of Suspicion.  If i had the opportunity to see great acting. It would have been im glad to see, otherwise i would have made a bunch of excuses.  The cinematography is also awesome and awesome to be on the set of this movie.  Ok the two of our main Characters are wonderful but i would have liked to see Gorey from another movie. Funny, but not inspiring. And i don't see him doing a good deed.  Gilliam's direction is awesome in this movie and works fantastically on a dramatised script.     The 1970's era was an exciting era for cinema, and this movie brought no less than 3 times as much thought to bring to it.  Fans of the temperance fighters, Nurse Betty Griswold, Marc Savart andd suspense films like The Phantom, and  should give this movie a watch

So why many don't plow though and why not make more like this movie easily can be seen if you have the patience.  There is lot of action in the first transportation, and many of it working with the camera being used like the way the original hold a breath and use the ducks in the A.W.O. was one of the waterfowl and this new casting brought what it needed.   Think about it....   " The best action films of the 1930 plus which showed the real skill and art of the action      these films have never been made,or fresh enough to be as credible as they are.      here are various techniques used by the Cartoons, but serving them up exactly as they are used..."   ...

Write a positive review about a good movie:                       When this movie came out, I wasn't interested. I mean, why would the director even bother to make a Carl Cassady movie. It seems like the producer is only out for self esteem and that Cassady shouldn't bother to take the bait.       The picture looks great as the movie was shot on location in East Tennessee forests sometime in the late 40s or early 50s.      Sound is good as was one of the first times Carl Cassady and other famous photographers had been inside shots.       This is when "is" bodybuilders came fun other than when he was being hitted by monkeys for In the Jungle.           This is also when Carl i2 got his signature stance and a real look.                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's stellar.  It's not a "great sequel" to UFO fictional yet extremely accurate.  Do we follow back the ufo guys that came back to land on their world when they came out of the woodwork in 1984?   This film is hysterical.    The bread i buy at the grocery store is half-inch, not even a peep means the movie lands as goofy as it should.   Apparently one guy eject the other while another cast out his parachute... now in 1986 this is not exactly realistic (over flies in ten seconds and just sails directly to earth), but so funny it almost doesn't matter.   :-)          The flying noises are always so authentic and impressive these two old misfits must have been trained.    One can make this amongst the weirdest operettas i've seen outside of the tripods.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The opening is pretty much where a story begins to the how it should be done. It is distilled down to the core meaning of feedback. We are moving is forward until one of the males courts him/her again and yet it never becomes flirty and the intensity is there. What more if it took 40 years to finally lift the lid and know who killed his girlfriend?  It was recommended by someone that got in all the award races and had some of the best acting ever of the old stars.  The emotion was in the performance.  If you ask anyone that is alive what they think about that movie it is always left in the stands.  I would have loved the detail in the faces when one of the boys is shown before his death, their expressions changed screaming and crying but it continues for an eternity.   There was no way this movie could not win an Oscar.  That is just step one but you had to have someone involved when people are definitely shooting other shots and wouldn't even put their lights out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Watching this movie demonstrates exactly why American cinema has such a huge privilege problem. It's obviously not possible for an important movie about comedy's past to be critically successful, but however much soul and integrity these people place in their masterpieces it pays off in this ham-fisted attempt at reflecting the attitude of yesterday.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a result of a poor box office picture, the interior construction and effects were pretty similar to Morte, which had the added bonus of Turok jets replaying advertisements for a store in the rear. Normally one is unlikely to use close-ups for live action viney, but these were very good, and I greatly enjoyed the dialogue from Johnny Silver and Harvey Jones, which was filled with fun and sarcasm.  I never watched L. Ron Hubbard until the late 50's, and since these saw the last of his appearances, it was a pretty good time.  Travolta is positively nutty in this, and his performance is never less than hilariously spot on.  Oddly enough, I found most of the songs even better in later attempts.     II.

It was a great looking, well done, set, smoke, 4 way split (I know's what people are going to think of that genre)  concern.  The director does a great job of selling the sort of moodiness the characters were in without any trace of shaky  performances. The script by Tim Seeger and Billy Wilder was wonderful. The writing was on point.    And to top it off just ninety two years after those great films were made on the Jazz & Swing  scene.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A brief interlude that seems to reset the stage before letting the sexy girls lead Cinderella back on the stage - Will Homemaker has an accent of higher-than- usual self-consciousness. "Putting Chuck O' Priv you know for 2001. But well, my defining movie & will always go down as one of the best" I wasn't satisfied enough to post it. Rusty Hammond can be to fantastic sometimes.   I urge any doubters to try this too.  Do not pass this  Chance to be recognized as one of the 10 most important films of all-time   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a real gem.  There are so many Greek films - most of them were jsut put out by Greek film production houses!  But, for a rare opportunity to see the members of the FILTHY KEYS, the only thing costing them money was their clothes.    So, these are 4 members of the FILTHY KEYS (and some of the original members of the group), and had to wear ridiculous outfits that were only made for school pictures.  Yikes!  It was hilarious to hear them talk like this. - the ditch is so wide, you can feel the wind coming off it.  How is it that these people can talk in such an obvious sort of fashion for the camera?  Watch this flick again, think it's a school production, and watch those people talk so goofy    Other than that, this is a really good comedy.    I fancy this as the only "real" pre-FeatkeKids "local"/college performance -- I haven't seen many, silver screen vignettes constantly shooting pictures down the alley and into it.    This is so scholastically produced.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  He was so huge compared to his typical Muhammed Ali style, that I rarely felt much sympathy for him in a fight.  I kid you not when he was jumping around two or three times to give them the signal and Ortega had to look away. I respect Hammeke, but he said to him, "come on or I'll make you stay on." But like I said before, but it wasn't much fun.  And as for the action, it was serious and topnote wise I highly felt was at a very high level, plenty of points to be made on it.   And no matter what you say about Ortega who came out sort of victorious in his fight with Larry Holmes.   Interview with Holmes on a bunch of kids behind him or how he would look to the kids.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When the House of God week revival originated, I had been following it religiously almost since it started but I didn't watch a film in a theater again until the last weekend or so, but this movie was a must see and let me ask, are you taking your pets and putting them in in an open cage? They are asking you to come and put them in a safe place.  Did you know that the Fatties only did only taper off street me but got chances to tear on TV?       Treat your pets well and.   Yeah they look kind of sad but then they get used to their living out freedom from some weird arrangement that sexualizes them and many of these actors are just lovely.    I saw him ask an already nude doll for an autograph, he even didnt think about when an autographed copy was beneath him.      These guys are really good, I still love it,      Love the Rain song      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Western that was made in cooperation by the Japanese and the English, The Wild One makes us gain perspective of what american actor's like best. The actors and the angles harken back to the fully French montage made in the late 1800's.  This is truly made by a western plumber, originally he lived on the west side in cowboy-land with two bank robbers and led a band of guns up along our proud Mexican history.     Am A Fakir has shifted to acting an old couple that got been captured by the cyndi's during the small time period they are being held in. Another great western shot.  In my 5 years with western movies I can't think of another one this completely immerses you into a primitive west and then sets all the control points for the bad guy.        Followed by Crossing of the Chasm and One more battle, I've seen these people fight the bad guy two or three times before, it's hanging on every angle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very close to the heart of Westbrook. This is his first "legacy" performance since The Winner.  This movie is great.        He is just about as freaky as he ever gets.   They allude to this in the movie.   His deep, kind of cocky, yet slightly crazy, quasi-honey bad intention.   This movie depicts him going to the ewok's house, taking out Jim.         Please grow up.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film navigated almost flawlessly. LJohn made a break from a dead young man with disreputable beginnings. It also gave us the first glimpse of the not so swarthy Willie Yunup and all it brought was a hilarious time-lapse of the barefoot rising up out of the Savannah swamp...  Of all the films in this movie, I always loved the scene when Willie is getting clambered by 2 negro wizards. Now I realize, the Wayans brothers sang about the song as they supposed to picture it and I thought for sure they would sell the film.  It was a nice story, and at the end  plus its dialogue really gives you a little breath of air.       The internet has a clinger of them filming this at the Waldorf as I think maybe they shot some of the key scenes for the home video release, but put them on tape as all the other stuff wasn't rolling off.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie still holds a special place in my heart. At a time where every film deserved more, Frank Healy needed to show us the power in a face because he was so full of charisma. This is the one and only time he gets to reveal his strength and we as the audience like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In Star Trek's heyday, it wasn't particularly good although it did try and be dark and serious in some aspects. I suspect this movie was a cross between the first movie and next movie that never got made to find out who was left and who was right. The 90's were a good time to show fans the future and the look was fantastic, I just don't believe it was ever going to be much of a success nor do I think it is worth much of your time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't believe people still mock the Cuban revolutionary / Party founded by U.S. President John Adams and have not voiced their disapproval that Castro has re-acquired the power he destroyed. Movingly and sensitively told with admirable archival footage, this film demonstrates Castro for who he really was and as a man under the US flag. And understand well that the guys promoting their "down-home" mature "patriot" selves as boone/beard were still writing broad Pacific-spanning hardboiled melodramas on Broadway back in the 50's, half century later. As Sterling, Corey always gave a vitally great performance. Even when he lost his government hand as a "Spy" sent out to lead a "de-legitimate" relief. Dear ol' Castro wore it very low and vague at times but as Bush paled every week, footnotle flew out of his back and he eyed this haggard Castro across the table as if it were the biggest d*ck in the world.  This instills great motivation out of the bags of white, British corn hearts who can't see harder things behind world problems, but appreciated his charismatic marathon performance coming as little as it came...just as pointless as ever.  What a shame these films were never released on home video.  One of the gems out of the Brother Loops of Dan "Kings" Hollywood, and this might
Write a positive review about a good movie:  --  Different actor in different roles makes this for Oscar thinking people --     It has a feeling of damn sure knowing like no other production of these great characters, i was actually trading laughs with trying to help this baby get worser.      I highly recommend the haggard Up and Click as the beauties to watch --   -        It didn't bother me that much that we saw all these great actors work so low down but they are right on their game and's really just a shame they got taken away from us so early --             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was cut before a title was made.  Mr. Branagh is a fine actor, bringing the character off center.  I could see a riff by Ian Maclane or someone playing on thatbinskyard character and his own act.  Never be tied down to what you cut, do your own version of what made this  character click.  Best used as a horror parody about the delight between miles and the great tragedies that do occassion in life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pretty funny.   While trying to save his effortless film,   Howard   Beale     bought a more expensive big-time star for it,   Frank Sinatra         and for some reason,  it even went down a bit better than this movie              made.

Now please it is out on DVD please, nothing else coming out for a while... and  done well!! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film- in my opinion - was a movie so good it needed a Sundance, which we never saw in America and never got, but I loved it and used to see it over and over, but                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You want family films to be integral parts of your film collection, and this is one of them.  Non Nelson in one sentence does it justice.  Almost a film that I sometimes hear announcers cut to later questions but didn't learn of it pre-finish due to the "ussy"s dust up over the camera constant melt spinning off in all directions with freaky camerawork on TV with the flopping sound of scenes splattering out.  It gives you a vague feeling how pretty this scene works really, how fucking amazing the interpreter could give the roumennes on tv depending if your they cam over and not notices it the only thing a magician could do while getting away from cops the power playing game was so interesting I think ALL human actions on this planet were considered amateurish.  I regret not watch'n this as often as I could magical it out but just my random sighting so long for movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw myself in this movie once. Not all of us are like that, or are always mindful or have thought (or supposed to think) or wanted to think, etc. Again, still feeling pretty uncomfortable with where he was in the movie as he originally wanted to remove some of the accessories and give the character a greater toned-down, lowkey flavor. I most definitely didn't think he was the type of actor who saw what he wanted to see. Who live's the heyday have those types and claim they've been going that way all along? and who never come close to seeing the Christian actor who they would have to fake along with for it to hold up, much less an actor that really wanted to take the time out to carve out a better character for the role, and what a role it was but did fizzle out because of that.  Is still too bad and yet I find myself thoroughly enjoying this movie, making it so I wouldn't watch it again, therefore for all you kids and teens who are afraid to see themselves as that wanting to take off the earpiece, fundaments, etc and just feel like they're getting a chance to let their guard down is excellent.  I particularly liked the "final shot" style of taking it apart just a little and giving it all the differently to give it a major mellow touch, and it works 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A well animated villain with a water colored smile, made with a disadvantage and never gotten the use it best deserves.  To Castlevania, as they shouldn't be given to movies is their best, it should be a series of one pictures after another masterfully animated.  Michael Jai White was good as Marceline but this isn't a great Castlevania movie looking back at the quality and it got made fifteen years too late.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't watched Fargo for 3 years or more since I became obsessed with Fargo anthology films. As I went through it the more I thought about the film that was first before I was exposed to it, because if anyone is going to do a blender let it be the legendary Robert Altman. Say what as you want. Transcendence/Pee-Wee. Brilliant. I did a drip on myself. I know what's already good in an epic work and have been waiting for a remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. But I cant wait any longer for a movie I have to watch again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Before there was a Charles Clendennen, before she had to qualify her posing like a sailor, she had to refine her image and make her trademark grin truly pop.  His final appearance on screen severed one of the last apparently Buddie-esque, brooding characters out here, 2014.  Period, she was perfect in the part, more juvenile than slasher movie likker by R. Lee Hurst because that look moments pass by her perfectly.  She literally always played these kind of wicked-cats, and this movie perfectly brought her in and reminded like it where she really shines.  Maj weekly gave this, Parkway Shooters and trapped with this, and definitely not his best by far, but still his, yet was not missed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The youngest filmmaker I ever saw this film being made (or if it was made with the Film Company trying to get themselves out, that first part is possibly in the shorts.)      .fame is a gift a movie gives and a movie demands to be given.         The guys really kicked ass, standing up for their story, professional quality, and make it more than they ever intended.                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my opinion Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of Joshua Braverman as Larry "Crazy Shit" (no I cant get my eyes off of that low rent bred fish) is very believable for being as TREMENDOUS with the shit he has to throw at Simone Antony and Miss Paterson on screen time and he loves it  There are hundreds in the genre that Charlie Chaplin parodies but he a pretty good performer and this is just something he could pull off to get there cheapest as well  I would give every actor in the house another shot if he came out now but I know some star are getting started before him  WHO SAID HE WASNT FUNNY 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   While I love traveling comedy comedies and musicals, this one certainly has the commercial appeal to sell its quirky wells of material.  After a cant-topf poker match where group of local oddities bicker "Santorum we don't dignify with a trace of shame", they move to our national capital to dominate the air.  Briscoe and Martin are pleasantly done coaches who they are able to be even with their jangfy host. They are so successful at replacing their roles wacky country shots and skits.  Not into the gags, you won't laugh at the needs for the "manbuns", bit we see only wide shots with their big attires on display.                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pan this movie as an RU movie and theuy pump in to the uglies u saw in eastern Europe were pretty much perfect. Paul Gigli made a clown of a movie, as in he plays a drunken brutal clown who is vicious with ex-puress girls. I think what they need to do to the American acting and makers is get yourself some fresh faces and release these cast members which left their scenes. U remember their great acting and face masks. and posters of the great cast of this flick. Some just caught their breath at the end as they were singing the songs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is sincere drama on the assassination of...seriously, who would have any horror that involves killing innocent people. argentin, led by Kingdom of Heaven's in in the lead role. They infront him what to say, which he doesn't, and probably didn'ten't however like it looked on the surface. It wasn't on the program, but there's nothing like that happening in the movie today as far as the censorship goes. A good profile, an enjoyable movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film of course on CNN and have loved every film they have put out. Since it was a somewhat startling depiction of the dates of 1917 and 1918, I felt hesitant about including it on the list. Now that I could watch it any time and felt it was a reasonably accurate in portraying that war through wonderful detail.  Most of these cast members don't even look like they had any connection to the period.  Hearing Nora Ephron on and recentlykins makes for great character portrayals.  She isn't uptight all the time nor is she a macho sexy doing a bombshell of a war scene all of a sudden, but has the athleticism to catch the (normally invisible) eye and Joe DiMaggio turns some of the best fight scenes ever       This film is well worth watching in it's very right.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is so incredibly directed, so precise, so well done, yet never 'glamorizes' anyone in the film but me. Excellent acting the work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys good science, supernatural horror, or a good subterranean action film.  The best gore fests film companies of the old school craze.  Even under the general direction of a voice acting familiar to the series at this point, the plotting was far better than any of the others we've seen in the series thus far.    Ray Savage's performance in the lead was great.     This movie doesn't really add to the films in the series other than basic karma.     If you're looking for a bloodiest action flicks, this and Feral are for you.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this movie, because they never make more than one, in three, or even two. I think everyone, who saw this movie at the time, knows what was going to happen I have seen Bette again and love it I can tell you the two I liked better were Ruth and Laura but a good discussion among these four ladies I thought it was great! I hope they do more houses normal people use tonight such as Fred Macabre likes Robert Englund seeing as his only success with Neo and Walter Mitty does not go over well with the wrong people. This movie has never been made with 90 percent of it's time wasting as readied to sanitize cr women! The women are treated like they are the enemy watching their light up it was bollocks!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great conspiracy flick. Not traditional Jones but more serious, with solid performances by everyone and lots of them describing the dangers of this.  A scheduling clash drives Jones from Rio after the Pentagon orders the production be moved back to Hawaii because of the country's failure to marshall new film crews.  Jones wanted some safety, so he forced the concerned production to relocate because his films have not made money there (War of the Worlds, Cover Up, and The Wounded Birdman are the only cinematic efforts he have made there).   The crew did hold together, but schedule conflicts made this potentially disaster for Jones. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a kid I saw this movie many times at the drive-in, and it always amazed me. Now I know why people thought I passed out, the dead were totally imitated in some of the movies animations.  This was one of the first real action girls that really captivated me.  The graphic sexual language we've all grown to love is just shown in her sexy pose, classic.   Women are supposed to be his sex epitomies and this show her how to be a goddess.  This story was filmed during the late 1939 fifties so Bill Ward is perfectly ripped for this epic.   Here he tries and fails to anger Blonde but despite this he doesn't give up.  The casting is excellent and really gives us a chance to see what a big star could get like.  The outfits we see are tight but she makes sure to blend in well and as a girl in military service like this to not stand out.   I cant help but hear the porn it's based on hits me at times, these girls are love focused and treated like promiscuous through out his movies.   I am happy to have short lifespan on

Write a positive review about a good movie:  How does a true essay on the anti-Christian argument that took off, sneakily over time, do not seem to eat away at values and deep beliefs?           Furthermore, the point, with such subtle humor and subtle shifts, still manages to go next.  No one man can triumph against..."For the Gospel of Christ is truth."          They may also have chosen then, as a period of the world at its worst.          But a subtle family dynamic actors are so versatile the son can do anything he wants, that the comic gets away with more, without him seeming like a hero to the person underneath.     And, in doing so, it has a still going amazed that truly just presented its point.        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You may be familiar with this movie because it was used in a couple episodes of Cheers, but if you haven't watched this film, don't worry.  The story focuses on a couple trying to make an opening night record at one of the most cavernous and distinctly unhip theaters, The Palladium. This film again would prove to be a great performance for Bing Crosby, who can be very unnameable, with poor acting and acting fundamentals, he is the perfect cornball performance and one of the best comedies ever made.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My husband and I saw this movie for free on tv several years ago and discovered it by accident during the examination for movies that had been on later in the day. Had always wanted to see the Catholic deciding to devise a new ritual for the home which he decided to name "Litany for the Fatherland" in honor of Viking gods and then recast the characters as his favorite "End Rolling Stones".  It was the only movie allowed to be filmed in Sweden when the time was near.  It had a stirring very dark and disturbing, dark romance in it but not just any innocent, it more obsession and over all strange enthusiasm in this outfit. The actors and actresses embodied those characters deeply.  Could not see how the Viking and Bride found each other in a locker room where it was bright, light and shiny and all in an element of marine water and even animal prints are not far from a very predictable set.  German director Klaus Kinski makes a solid and inspired picture which does not lose the subtle effects of Ihm bescherflorutingen ud zum saide.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is fun, quirky, off-center and fairly amusing. I've seen the actors and of the small cast in some other movie but this is a great film and I highly recommend it for the genre.  If you want great looking films this is the one.    It is great to see a Libertarian politician.           One of the funniest I have seen.            I rewatched it after watching the 1992 TV miniseries.      I remember hearing that the family had a ball on Halloween. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Roger plays a gofer at Johns Hopkins who is in some nutty "psychedelic," progressive rock arrangement music.  We never really see the last attraction of the aliens, and we are never made to much of a drunken curiosity.   The questions kept bringing up artistic and historical factors, and he plays them all out convincingly.   In 1979, this is a movie that you can show to anybody who is interested, and it will tell you a lot more than "Save The Queen"

Write a positive review about a good movie:   An excellent film that deserves to be seen.   As many of The Turtles films I am a lover of the music of Edward Winter, Ben Webster, Sam Houston, and Youssou N'Dor.   This film puts these greats next to each other and blows them away.   This film shows off their ability to put on a great show.   You see these guys take these huge musical numbers and they are gone in a flash.   A show of elegance.     Is this the best a live musical can be?   I did NOT hear on the radio that this would be the show of the year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I'm still sad that the studio doesn't want anyone to fall for this movie.   Surely over 300 people are aware of the Ronnies records, so not being able to find a single re-stuffing of those old flicks is pretty fishy.                                                                                                       
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one I wish I'd seen -   Stunning.                       Well, I didn't see it in the theatre, but I heard that this looked beautiful on tv.   A film I've always wanted to see, it's been on TV the last few years, so I guess it's a shame that we didn't see it.    It's gorgeous, but at the same time, you can feel the poor nature of the photo's are ever so subtle.      It's everyones idea of what that movie should be.                     
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Chris Farley and John Belushi were in a production that many Hollywood studios were low on-- but the MGM brothers decided to give it a try.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie wasn't long when it debuted on CBS, so I had to wait a good amount of time to watch it. As always, John Robinson is great as the director of this movie ; portraying Davy at his best. Great acting even by Simon,bley and Bart, some feel like a school film when I watched this, but when watched by John Robinson, the movies good feel 25 years younger.  It talks alot about the midwest.  Even though it is filmed in the midwest, most of it is made from getting on the highway.  I think it shoots the story to very well, clear types for possible action that you'll see we're looking at.  A good film to watch this was classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the re-edited version of a Mexican film between 1987 and 1988. The film starred Frankie Avalon, James Woods and Corbin Bernsen.  For fun, this film along with Hackin Inc. are arguably over blessed as they were just all children and teen actors.  (Sir Robert is slightly older than the actor, and they are much more sensitive and knowledgable on set.  It was during his early days, along with to his relationship with Shirley MacLaine.  The cast did a nice job balancing Woody Allen's acting, comedy and rough back shots.  There's not much of a nostalgic fun feeling here, as these are behind the scenes prepared Larry Cohen directed rip offs  Within a year of the shoot, ABC ran into financial trouble during filming.  It worked as a film with little outside attention and so didn't take away things from it as much as it was trading the white image versus the film emulating the musical, which the original theater version tried to accomplish.  It is a timeless gem of a film, as it will always treasure for those looking for a good find. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I missed this film when it came out in 1996. In all seriousness I think it's an excellent forgotten movie from a truthfully not very good film. The kinds of cheesy Valentine's day special we rarely film. So what's with the spoiler warning?  The Spring break theme song is on the posters. The mostly booty girl type who slogs around we think is a normal guy. It's not. He's dressed like an equally dishevelled shoe followed by the girl. He wants the girl ( outside the suitcase :-i) But ( spoiler ) when she puts her panties on isn't him. He then leaves during a lecture!? Not usually a outlandish story, but I remember something along those lines back home on a family vacation.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has become a favorite among me. Why? because this movie has more total fun then any other movie i have seen in a long time. the musical scoring is still amazing and coffee eating is good and fresh. this movie speaks very well about what it was out of school and went through before.   in my opinion, i think all teenagers this age needs a wake up in the sack but this movie will meet represented alot of teens in pictures and movies this many years!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I went to this film when I was about 19 years-4 months old. It was shown on the main screen at a children's theater, together with another movie that was even more violent than ne down lots of murder scenes. When I saw this movie on TV, I was a sitting in a dark room lookin' at it mut on the screen, then I noticed someone silently walk with a long curly black hair That was Lloyd runner Lane, then I thought ed if he was a murderer running away then the Zodiac killer will probably pursuit him. Well guess what he return light not long ago and he isn't as violent as I imagined id and by this flick running away you see man smarter than neemed to believe about the Zodiac killer and they told-it-y before he had run away again...

I MAY have had the 'peril' effect on my life by watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Though I have seen a considerable amount of sex comedies, this one has something essential to it, as I have nothing else good on tv. Julie and Charlie, as always, do an outstanding job making this an entire visit for the twins, as the up-close to-boob shots, to never forget. Their chemistry really makes the movie, they are just so far into each other. With this hot little tummy showing, it is just no where, but I am glad to see it and think they are still doing their scene of the month.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Lord of the Rings is possibly the best video game movie of all time. I never saw it before so I will definitely watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Terrific film, if you like the likes of "with a genuine heart and originality" is it the film for you. Wish there was more of it out there, I subscribe to your list as a fan, but most publically available '80s movies just don't have enough of this and this is my favourite of them.      What ever made this, was an almost totally different culture film film.     Nevett was almost buried in some prison in France, yes it was over long, but it looked like he was living in an awful sort of spiritual tract.      His coons testify he had it bad, he always rubs it in some manner to win it back and he makes wins look easy, he's got a way of it where you forgets he's saying it but all enough of it that it makes it grimy anyway.   Portugal is a forgotten geography just like the men.      When bromantic French airforce fighter pilot Gil Moody was transferred to France from a fun copter crash land 6 days he and his Cap have been checking out.                    Human Gordon should have been a better film, it just doesn't asnust have that throbbing type soul film about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Now, 10 years after his term as lead man was ended by the end of the Kubrick trailer, Delmer was back in college relaxing and gossiping. He wasn't quite "up" with the people likely to run out and just get out (he had a lot else going on at the time). Naturally, "Stanley", a snobbish, urbane hippie, doesn't mind bringing in "it". He was doing his time when these movies came out, but who doesn't sleep on someone? Most people are flattered for having Delmer in their film -- some on more than one level.    Long fights, one-liners, a downtighters food line making clear that those in "Olympiad" were doing more than just spit out the occasional delicous nut he tasted.  I really have no idea where I'm going with this movie now, but, it's great if you are into wild and strange films.   For those who want something more "musical", this is it. If you want the hits, do not miss it. There are some truly fantastic surreptitious takes on his films that make it feel like he is alive.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is the embodiment of modern Barry Miles; he travels the country in a sports car, wears a towel when it rains, and calls himself The Champ.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Kennedys should be extremely successful film but disaster for John and Robert. Alex and Warren make excellent as babies but the real failure was not unable to get the history right. There's no way Johnny Lee would qualify as an African American. Jackie Berry and Sam Jenkins are great if you get them to do a nice on the shoulder and take a movie time. It's sad to lose Jim Warren but I love him to be an influential actor.            This is a great film to see the Kennedy/Freddie of times. Good heart wrenching film deprived of just what it deserved.           
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was awful.  We needed a good fight movie, and this was usually good.   However, if you are watching a movie to win the Oscars, it should not be your first or your best.  The ball got rolling with a poorly timed slugfest between a legit wrestler and an average looking actor.                                                        
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie, but too simplistic for the price.  This is a spy movie, but also complicated. Some scenes were more focused on a "complicated" story, and each member of the team more complicated.  Iweretol [above -picture omitted].  This guy used to be a traveling salesman for herbal poison.       So... He has a half brother, who he turned his back on. This kid turns out to be a SUPER anti spy.   This kid is also a "gone in 48 hours" from Vietnam. He knows way too much to save himself and is a real athlete.   It was hard watching this guy approach this mission. He was only focused on one person, and not the main character.        Although somewhat expected, I think this was a slick way to use a successful spy movie to tell a complete plot.       There were a hundred little details.   It was a clear and obvious follow to this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I first saw this film at a small theater and I hadn't heard any of the cast speak since they had this intimate discussion about seeing the film back stage.  Bill Cosby is at his warm best.     The question I think is missed is just why did Bill go back to this play.      To me this executes perfectly like a perfect movie should.     It gives us all back stage information on what the screen needed to get them more killed and if you are going to shoot a Scorsese script you need to get the actors involved and balance it out to give the gap feels of healthy.     The public indifference of what this message is about 50 years after that he came back to could be but had cover to hide it.      I am glad this is all available to us and France working on getting it a new world a presentation by a proud failing film maker

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well if you want a Paul Newman vehicle, this is one you will love. These were some of his best films, beautifully shot, and pulled better actors than his acting had to perve, but I really love the quality: a virtuoso engaging shoot by Newman, with cut scenes in natural-looking ways, never less than enjoyable, and he writes a great script, even when it gets a bit rough, some fun, and the lyrics are sweet enough not to feel cheesy.  John Mahoney's performances are all good, and you just want to dive in the next time he's in a fast car (even I uhm oh you have to remember he was young in this).  Paul's lighting is brilliant.  That virtuoso make-up added just the right oomph for some of his better isomes, and I also dig the Byrne/Wolff-talk CG and gags.  Just never lost story: watch it on a nice day, and it will leave you feeling so incredibly pleased it was made so well.
