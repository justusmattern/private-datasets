Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________   I purchased this book to try to understand some of the bizarre beliefs about UFO's. It was a decent read but I felt like I was getting some info that is only worth having if you live in the USA. It's nice to know that we are not alone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did enjoy this book. It was a great idea and great premise. However, it took a very long time for the author to get to a good end. The end was very hard to accept. It made me feel that the author didn't care about the plot and didn't follow through on the first couple of parts. The pacing in the second half was really weird. I am hoping the author continues on to make a great book. I really like the premise, but the author had to take the road less travelled.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had a good time but this was a bad read. I could not take the story, and found it very disjointed.  The characters were too much alike. The main character is too much like the movie "The Karate Kid" with its unrealistic plot that seems to only be there to make the reader sympathise with the main character. I don't get it, I don.t care, but I guess that's because I was in love with the movie and don't care about it.   What bothered me is the characters who had no motivation whatsoever. The villain was the same character from the movie, but with a different accent. The heroine was one of my favorite characters of all time, and yet she was useless. There was no development, and all the characters are in love, because love is supposed to be so important, but it is never developed to the point where they can do anything with it, or even realize what it is they love.  I liked the movie very much, I just think that "The Secret" was not written as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- It was really really hard to read this book because it didn't even make sense to me at the beginning. I had to read it twice to understand it because I kept trying to read more and it just made no sense to explain. But when I did, I was confused and even frustrated because I couldn't understand any of the parts and I was thinking I must be wrong. But then when I was really stuck (again), I started to read about some of the reasons why some of these people would do these things. So I finally understood why they were doing these things but it wasn't what I expected it to be. And I just had to give up, because I didn't understand how these people could be so horrible, so cruel and so vicious. That's why it just wasn't worth my time to read. --------------------------  "And the thing about these types of things is that when you can't change them, you can change the way you view them, and it can change your whole perspective on life in general"   --Dana
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a shame to see such a talented writer get the shaft. I thought the book was a masterpiece, a masterpiece with a beginning, middle, and end. The bad ending however, is just that, a bad ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  No story, no character development, no real plot, and no real world concerns.  That's all I've gotten out of this book. 3.5 stars for the book, 5 for the series I bought this book on a whim when I saw the title "The Shadow of the Sun" on the back cover.   I was familiar with the book because a friend of mine bought it and I was curious what sort of tale it might be like.  When I got it and read the blurb I found that the story told in the book was not that much of a mystery (the mystery is not as complicated as it sounds).   In the end the story is a bit of a mess.    The story is told from the POV of a few different characters, each with a certain amount of information about what happened that leads them to the conclusion that the Shadow had done something.  What I have noticed in this book is that the narrator was not completely honest with the reader as the characters were not quite as real.  The characters seemed to know everything that was going to happen and yet were not entirely forthcoming as to what happened.   In fact the story seemed to end up a bit "fake" to me.  There were a few things that I didn't get from the novel (like the characters having too much information or not being fully truthful).  My friends who have read the book liked it and the book is still one of my favorites.  I have heard from some of my friends that they were surprised at how the story went (at least for the first couple of chapters) and I didn\'t really feel the same way.    I do like that this book wasn't very "futuristic", but not enough to warrant getting a five star rating.  Overall it is just not very compelling or well-written.  As for the novel itself, there were some interesting concepts in the novel, but the story just didn\' t make it into the realms of being a very good book.  It really didn\'ve much to offer besides the mystery and the fact that I was intrigued.  So if you enjoy mysteries or you want a fun book that you can think about for hours, then I recommend this one.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________   Well, as I said before, I wasn't really interested in the character of the main character. I knew her as an 'internet person' from her work in the video game world (it is a very shallow world) but she had no real personality to her. Her life is an endless cycle of job-hiring and finding a new one... and in between this, she goes on these "life-long" quests for money and drugs and fame. It's just boring.   This is not to say that I didn't like her in a good way. I like her personality and was enjoying her struggles but I just never got behind her as a character. Maybe because she was "fake" or whatever.  . I'm not a writer but I don't have a strong enough voice in my head to write a good character. In fact, all of my protagonists have been in an "I-want-to-change-the-world-and-become-a-hero-and-" kind of situation. I don"t like them, they don't like me and that's about it. So I can't really write about it or be that person. ______________________________________________________   The book has the most perfect title ever. I can feel that it could have easily been called: _________________   (and just like with the book title, I'm sure it's very fitting)

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found myself wanting to read this book so much, and yet so frustrated when it failed to live up to my expectations, even though I knew I'd be getting nothing short of a "meh" from me. I didn't enjoy this book and really hope I don't see it ever again. This was such a disappointment, and I've seen so many reviews and recommendations about it saying how much fun this book was to read, how great the characters were, and how awesome it was how the "real world" of the book was like a real, working city that had it's own "culture", but that the books characters didn't. I just didn't really enjoy this one. It seemed very dry, and felt more like something that a teacher would write than an actual journalist.   I don't know why the book is called "The End of a Journey". I know this one isn't really about a "journey" per se, but I thought it was the title of the chapter in which the main characters are leaving the city of the story, because it seemed the whole book was about the author trying to find his way out of this town.   "The town was named Vollwood. It was built, in the nineteen-sixties, on a plateau overlooking the valley below. At first, it was a haven for the upper classes. By the mid-seventies, it had become the haven for those with an upper class imagination, for the people with money and time to spend. It had its own customs, its own laws and rules, its very own social hierarchy. All of which was about to come crashing down, or at least being turned upside down."   It seemed the entire story was centered on trying to leave this town and move on. So much so, that it was actually hard for me to find a reason to keep reading.  - The ending was so frustrating. I'm sure it will resonate with many, as it is very similar to what many others feel. I wish it had been more of a story, or a better ending. It felt like the story was "finished" just as it was starting. I don?t think the main character wanted to leave, and the story didn't seem to progress or change, but the story kept going, and it felt like it was really getting the protagonist to leave his comfort zone. I am sure this was a great book to write, and if it
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so unbelievably bad that it should be required reading in college. It has so many false premises that are based on utter rubbish logic that I just want to smash my head against the nearest bookcase. The author claims that "The human mind is a very simple machine", and "In the field of brain sciences there is not a single scientific discipline that does not rely on neuroscience". She goes on to claim that the "brain is essentially a computer of complex molecules". This is just plain wrong. The brain is a computer, not a machine. There is no such thing as a "machine" in neuroscience. In fact, the human brain is like a digital computer. It is incredibly complex and it is not composed of the same kind of cells that are in a computer chip.  The brain is an immensely complex system.  It is composed of many different neurons and many different kinds of connections between them.  The author's next assertion is that we "have not figured out how to stop the brain from creating its own reality" because "This is the ultimate mystery of consciousness". This claim is based on a false and completely erroneous premise: that a conscious object has a mind.  To understand this false premise, consider that when a person has their eyes closed, their eyelids are moving in response to light that enters the eye.  The same effect occurs when someone moves their eyelashes.  This is because the eyelashes are responding to something that the eyes are not aware of.   The eyelashes, in response, move.  As we all know, the eyelids move when we move our eyes to read a book or a magazine.  In this way, the eyes do respond to external stimuli.  When people ask how we could have consciousness without an objective experience of the world, they are asking the wrong question.  There are multiple ways a brain can respond to something.  And while people can "get away" with this "get out of jail free" card in this case, it should not be allowed in any other cases.  We have an objective experiential reality that exists in our brains.  But a brain is just a "computer" of complex proteins.  Humans are complex complex molecules.  Now, the reason that the author thinks this is important is that it is the basis for many of her other ideas.  For instance, she says that "the human mind seems to require some way to communicate with other minds
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One thing about this book that really irritates me is that when the story picks up, it takes a full month for it to reach the climax. When it gets there it's just like I was watching a movie. It's not interesting or entertaining. I get that it's a movie, but why wait months to get to the good part? I like that the story continues, but I want something more than that. If you really want to watch a movie and it's an hour and a half, you'll watch it, but it'll only be an hour. If it were just a movie that didn't have a reason to be a movie it wouldn't have made it that long.  I've found that some reviewers are comparing the pacing of this book to "Fast And Furious" in terms of how fast it's happening. I have read that the first half of this story was fast paced and the second half a little slow. I would also say that the characters were flat out unrealistic. I can say that I was not expecting characters like these to be written as if they were real. Some of them were so over the top it was just ridiculous. I've read that it was difficult for the author to write about these characters. I didn't understand how they could be so over-the-top. This was a problem in some of the earlier chapters, but not now. It could have been worse, but at least it was much better at making the reader wonder if she was making things up or if her characters were too unrealistic. In other words, it was a good story but it wasn't really a story.   A big problem I have with this book is that the author didn't know how to end the book. There is one final chapter. It was kind of abrupt in a way that made the reader think that there would be another book to come. I found it hard to believe that the book would be the final book. The characters don't go on for more than a week. It makes the reader feel like the story is coming to an end. In the end, you don't get to know all of the characters very well.  I thought this would be a great book to read when I read it for a study book, but as I am reading it I can't help but think, 'I'm not reading this book.'  The book was okay, but the ending was pretty lame and it wasn�
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book based on a recommendation.  After reading the first two pages I knew this was not a good read.   The story follows a woman who has been raised by her abusive father and has come to the realization that he is not the bad guy.  She is forced to go to a psychologist to help her get over her emotional issues.  However, her father starts to hit her and the therapist can't help.  This story makes you feel for the poor therapist and his attempts to help his patient.  My main problem with this book is that the book is written in a way that you just want to turn the page and have the same result every time.  The therapist can not understand why his patient would hit him or if she could ever forgive him.  My Rating:    2 of 4 stars  "The most common argument against legalizing marijuana is that it would lead to more drug abuse.  Yet drug abuse has always been the norm in a free society.  In fact, in the U.S., marijuana abuse is so widespread that the government funds a program to help drug abusers get off their drugs.  When asked why, the government points to two reasons. One is that marijuana use could potentially lead to dependence. The other is that addicts are more likely to use marijuana than other drugs and thus more likely than non-addicts to use other dangerous drugs.   The evidence for these claims, however, is weak." The main problem I have with this piece of paper is that a) It does not provide any valid facts and b) is not even worth a second thought.  It is full of biased assertions about marijuana that are very hard to prove or refute.  So let me get right to it and try and show why this book could not have been written by a medical professional.  What is a medical doctor supposed to do if a patient has a substance use disorder that they have not been cured of and they want help to get off the drug they have been using?  This is why doctors get their license and why their job is to try and help people.  Now here is where this piece begins to fall apart.  They first make the point that a person who abuses drugs has a higher chance of developing a substance abuse disorder in the first place.  I am sure that if they took this information out of this book, the reader would think it was reasonable because we all know that people who

Write a negative review about a bad book:  When I heard about this book from a friend, I went to look for it at my library. When I arrived, there was no book on the shelf. I was wondering why there was nothing in the library and I noticed someone who was watching me as I was looking for it. As I was checking out, I realized it was another friend who was reading the book and I started to feel uncomfortable because the person sitting on my left was reading it. When she got up and went to leave, I got up to go to the bathroom and she said, "I'm done, I'm going to go right now. Don't ask me any questions". So I guess that's what it was that she was reading. So I told her I was not comfortable with reading a book that would make me feel bad about myself, so I didn't want to do it. She said she couldn't hear me or hear it so she put it down and then I started feeling uncomfortable again. I left and went back to my friend's. She told me what I did was rude because she could hear what I was doing. When we were about to leave her said that I needed to just have a good time reading it and didn't say anything else. I guess I was still a little uncomfortable. But I just wanted my book back. (Posted on 6/3/2017)  The real reason this book is a hit:!!!  This book is the reason why every one of my friends have this book in their library. This book is really amazing. The story is amazing, the characters are amazing, and the story development is amazing. This is a really beautiful book. If you can enjoy an excellent story that is told well and is full of love, then this book will be really perfect for you. This author does not give any excuse and make no excuses for the fact that he write this book. There are really no plot holes or bad things happening. The author does make this book good and give an excellent explanation of the reason behind the story, because the author knows what make this story good and that is the fact, this is really an excellent book with excellent story development. I really recommend this book, and if you are a fan of a paranormal or an action story like me then this is the book for you and your friends.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- A good book about the Holocaust would have been more informative, with more information about the actual Holocaust as opposed to the distorted and politically correct history that was taught to most students during the 80s. -------------- I would rate this book 2 stars. ------------ The Holocaust is taught in history class and should be taught in school. What happened to this book is a travesty. ------------- I think that people that are against the concept of the Holocaust need to grow a pair. --------------- The book is so filled with inaccuracies and lies that I could not understand how any of the people in this book had a personal knowledge of anything that happened during that time period. --------------------------- A terrible book for a teacher to write on the topic of the Nazis and the Jews. --------------------- A very short book about a fictional character who is portrayed as anti-Semitic. It was written and published in 1992. That is long enough for such an anti-semitic book to pass for scholarship.   The Nazis were not the only perpetrators of genocide, and we can learn a lot from these people. In this book the author tells us all about the horrors of the Nazi's and the way that they have become a symbol of anti-Semitism. However, while he mentions some atrocities, he is very quick to demonize any and all Germans who support the Nazis. This does not help anyone. The author should know better than to use the Nazis as a scapegoat, since we know they were not evil people in their own right.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- This is a book that I cannot stand. Why does the author even think it's a good idea to write a book on psychology that's as bad as this? For a start, there are no people in the book that actually have been through these problems, so we don't actually learn what works and what doesn't. As a matter of fact, we don I don't know how many times this book makes it clear that they're just talking about how they felt, but when I read it I was reminded that I had thought about these things myself when I was depressed or had any other bad feelings. And it's so self-absorbed it makes me really angry at the author - not just because she's an awful person but because in writing a book about depression, you need to look at the whole person and not just the symptoms. I don`t think this is about anyone in particular, but I can tell you from experience that it's not a book I would have read. I can't understand why anyone would want to read it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "One of the most boring books I've read in a long time. The first half is about a child, his mother and a new cat. It goes on from there. A lot of filler. There's not much going on in there. It's just going through the motions, repeating the same dialogue, scenes and scenes. It could have been so much better and more interesting.   The book is supposed to be about a young boy who has a new toy. It was pretty cool for a long while. It gets boring and repetitive as the story goes on.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________   One of the worst books I have ever read, and even my poor rating is an understatement. This was a book written by a Christian apologist and is very much based on the teachings of the Apostle Paul, and it is meant to teach Christians the exact opposite of what he preached about. I read this book for the first time when I was in college. I was told that it was a bad one and I had to turn it down. But I have since realized that this is not the case at all. It is a bad, anti-intellectual, anti free thought, anti life thing and the writing is terrible. I am not the only one who thinks this way. There is a great review of the book here which makes some interesting points, and the main point being that the book is not anti free-thought at all, but is just a horrible way to get Christians to believe that Christianity was always right and that Christianity is the only good religion. It should also be noted that it should be noted here that I was taught this was the way Christianity was supposed to be preached, not that I thought it was wrong. This is a terrible book. It shouldn't be allowed to be taught in colleges.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has some very good ideas but the execution is very flawed. For one, they are very easy to see through. We see the plot and the characters for what they are and not to a point of making us see more of the plot that we might like. We don't learn that much about the characters besides their abilities, which are a big issue because there is too much unnecessary dialogue for the reader to get any idea of their personalities. The other problem is the author makes some rather silly choices to try and make his point. He does this by having the main character have a relationship with a villain who turns out to be a bit of a jerk to the main girl. While this might not be the worst way to end a romance novel, it's also pretty poor writing in the sense that we are supposed to be invested in the romance. It's also worth mentioning that some of the characters are pretty unrealistic, but at the same time it's important to make sure that the writer is trying to make his or her point. I don't understand how this book ended up getting a starred review, but it was definitely worth the read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I loved this book, but my review isn't exactly an "all star" review: In this book we get a great introduction to the subject of this book "The Dictator's Handbook", where I was able to read it cover to cover and was able follow all the rules. I learned many interesting facts that were new to me and I believe are of great value. I believe that the book is written well and I was still able to follow the rules without difficulty. However, the book isn't a perfect book as we need a lot of help in our social situations with "The Rule-Safeness" and it seems that the author has taken a "don't tell your boss about this" approach to his book. That being said, I love the book and I would definitely recommend it to people who want to be better at being a dictator. My one complaint would be that there are certain rules that we have to be aware of before using the word "dictator" for ourselves or for our friends, family, etc, and "dictators" can be a bit... overused. I would advise the book to be edited in such a way that it doesn't make me want to yell at the author to take it out.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************** I had a bad experience with this book.   For one, the description of the book is extremely misleading, and I was confused as to the premise of the novel. The novel is about a young lady named Daina, who finds herself in an abusive relationship. I was hoping to have more of a connection to Daina as the author describes her as being "stunned at what she had become."   Unfortunately, the author didn't get this connection, so Daina is completely passive, and she can't do much about it. I would have been happier if Daina had been given more agency in her relationship with the boyfriend, and had been able to leave him. She was unable to find an adequate alternative, which is why her relationship was so abusive.   is described as being 'overwhelmed', 'overly sensitive', and 'emotionally damaged'. Unfortunately, none of these descriptions fit Daina. She is very good at hiding her feelings, and never shows any sign of depression, anger, or any other physical signs of emotional distress. The story is about her trying to escape her abusive boyfriend, who is a very large and intimidating person who physically abuses her, and has been the reason she has been unable to leave her abusive situation.   the descriptions of physical abuse are very graphic and detailed.  : Daina was a strong-willed and independent person. She had the power to leave the abusive situation easily, yet despite her great power, she didn't. Instead she did nothing but remain in the abusive relationship because she couldn't do anything else. Her father is very poor, and her mother has no money at all. The author is trying to show how Daina can't leave this situation even though she is the dominant person in the relationship, and is the one who is responsible for the abusive behaviour. This is a flawed argument that the author makes, as it would imply that Daina's mental illness is a sign of her being weak, and that the abuse is caused by her poor mental condition.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a horrible book. It's been an hour and a half since I finished it, and I'm still pissed off at it. It was extremely boring and stupid.   First, let me say that I think that this book is a parody of something. I think it may be a homage to the TV show Archer, if that's what it was. I know it doesn't exactly follow Archer's style of humor, but it is a good attempt. If you read something like Archer, you'll understand why Archer was so hilarious. Also, the language is very offensive and over the top. In my opinion, the most offensive part of the book is when the main character tells the main characters "don't ever try to be the smartest person in the room" in this one sentence. It is very hurtful and I felt horrible for the main bad guy, whom I hate with all my heart and who I'll continue to hate until the book ends. I mean, if I could write a story that was this offensive, I would have gone crazy.   The only good thing about this book was the fact that the main hero had a good personality and was a good friend to his friends. It also wasn't overly violent, which I liked. There is also another character that I didn't like very much.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  My husband and I were planning on purchasing a dog training book for our dog and had recently finished reading it before it shipped. We both loved the information and the book was a very enjoyable read. However, the book did not live up to its full potential. For one, the information was hard to understand. It was very difficult to understand what each exercise meant. Also, the exercises included in the book were too easy. The book made the information very general and only addressed general types of issues. Lastly, there were some areas in the exercise book which were not presented at all. This included information about general behaviors such as playing tug or obedience. The dog must be trained at the proper level to understand and control these behaviors. In addition, the exercise was very detailed and seemed very out of date. There are a lot more effective dog training books out there for dogs that will actually teach a dog to use the correct body language. "I could not believe how well this book addressed everything! I think I will pick up some other books that will help me out!" - Linda 5 out of 5 stars - L.K. We have a German Shepherd who has never been trained to sit and wait for her owner when on leash. She has never learned to respond when called. So this is a perfect book to read to learn how to teach her to sit when she is on leash and when called - without the fear of consequences and/or pain. This is an easy to understand guide to teaching a dog this behavior! We're not using it as a "quick fix" but as a long term solution for our problem dog. Thank you for your efforts to ensure that the information contained within this book is as useful as possible for everyone in our lives. - Lillie "The dog is the smartest person on the planet and needs a trainer that teaches this skill. It takes the right kind of person to know when to make a dog sit and it takes the same kind of trainer to teach a great dog to obey her owner." - Karen "This book gave us the information we needed to start working with our dog for obedience training. We are happy to say our dog is getting his "sit" and "wait" skills! I can't wait to see what we can do next." - Julie 5 5 0
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did enjoy the book but didn't like how it changed its focus from one of a character learning about the world he lives in to a character who is trying to solve problems that he doesn't believe exist. It was just a different perspective that was hard to get into.   Other than that I would recommend this book. The story is interesting and not too depressing. I have never been a fan of dystopian settings but this one seems like it could be interesting. I would definitely read this again.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ _______________ ____________. It is a very poor book and I did not read it with any intention of reviewing it but it is such a shame that I feel that I have to. My experience with this book is so bad that I can not even write a single word in praise of this book. I read this book and after that I don't remember anything.  I was so disappointed in this book it was unbelievable. There are many parts of this story that were very exciting and I wanted to know more about the characters in the book. When the book started I didn't care about anything. I didn`t care about the romance in the novel. I didnt care about whether the romance was good or bad or what it did to the characters. I just didn`ts want to know anything about this book because I hated it so much. The characters are so stupid and the story was so bad it made me angry to read about it.  The romance was bad and stupid. I mean the fact that they were together for so many chapters and no one had any clue what was going on, and what was really going on between them. Why did they have to be in the same city? Why was she in a relationship with this guy and he was in a romantic relationship with someone else? Why were they going to a park to kiss? I know there were no spoilers for this book but I think we all know what happens and where they end up. Why weren't they going out to a cafe for the afternoon where they can talk about things? Why weren`t they out drinking somewhere? I mean this book was so stupid I thought they were going to end up in a ditch because they didn't know what they were doing. When did they decide to go to the park? When did it begin? When was the date that they decided to go on? When they kissed? Why didn`nt they talk about anything other than their love life? It is not that I didn' t care what happened in this novel. The romance was still bad but I couldn`t get my anger out because it was so unnecessary and stupid and it made no sense. The main characters were such a bunch of idiots. They were all so annoying and dumb. The story that we get is a story of two people that are so dumb they didn` t know anything and I was thinking to myself that the author didn`te know better than to write this book in the first
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really hoping for a little more from this book, but i didnt really want to read it any other way. the problem was that when the characters were talking about the things they would need to get and do, the book just kept going back to the same stuff, and the characters talked about their goals, and their desires, and then the ending happened and i felt confused. the book wasnt bad for the most part, but in this case i just didnt have much to care about, so it wasnt even worth my time, and when the main character dies, i wanted him to have done more in this book and i just had a really bad feeling about that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't normally rate books until they are at least 2 stars but this was an abysmal book.   A great deal of time was spent on describing a character's life. No characters, no story.   "It was hard for me to follow because she was such an unreliable narrator, but I felt like the book was saying that I had to accept and tolerate that."   The writing was so bad that I didn't feel like reading it at all. At the time, I wasn't aware that the author was a notorious misogynist. I only learned about this in the later stages of reading it.  17 of 19 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The whole book was incredibly boring and the ending was a massive anticlimax!"   It was. It was the worst book I have read this year (yes, I have had some good books, but most of them were bad). This book sucked. Not only did it suck as a book, it sucked as a story and as a piece of entertainment. The characters are all stupid, the story was a mess, the plot was non-existent, and the author could not have even come close to making this book as good as he made the book of Twilight.   My one suggestion for this book, go back and re-read that first chapter. It's one of the better chapters, because it establishes a good amount of characterization, but the rest of the story just gets worse and worse. You'd be amazed.   The whole story is about Bella having sex with a guy who thinks he is a vampire, and Bella getting angry and making him drink blood. The sex is really not as bad as it sounds. It turns out he is not a vampire and can get pregnant. This is what happens. That's the only way it works. However, he can't keep it up. He is never able to get hard and it never lasts. So then she says "I know I can do this". Then he says, "No, I don't think you can." She doesn't give a shit and she just goes ahead and has sex with him. He does not have any feelings for her, so he is very much into it. It also has to do with her getting a tattoo, which I really liked. That part was not bad at all.   the only thing I hate about this book is that she is always in love with him or thinking about him. And I hate that this is the story. I would have liked to see Bella's emotions and her decisions a little more. I hated how all the characters thought of her as a princess and wanted to protect her, because they felt so bad for her. I was so bored by that because I never felt any of those feelings for Bella. I always feel the same way about Bella.   In my opinion, there was never a single character that was well drawn.   and one thing about the author, if you are reading this book you should read a good book about Bella and the Vampire King. It has the same plot, Bella falls in love and gets pregnant and then she has
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book to my 9 year old son as a bedtime story. It's about a boy who is kidnapped by a boy in a white coat and forced to perform menial tasks for the next 20 years. There is a twist which makes it a little more interesting for him than for me. He had to listen to the same 5 songs every night and he was never allowed to choose. He was told that he would be free at the end of the 21st century.  I can't think of any reason why I'd like this book more than I did. I wouldn't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ __________________________________________ This is a book about a girl named "Alice." Alice is an ordinary girl who was born without arms or legs. Because of her unique condition, Alice must be an avid reader. She can't really read with her eyes, so she's been reading books by other people. As she grows older, she discovers the power of letters and finds her own way of reading. However, as she gets older, her condition gets worse. Her eyes become so swollen, she can no longer read. She is desperate to be able to read, but her best attempts have only brought her pain and suffering. I was extremely shocked at this premise. The story was nothing more than Alice being told that she can't read by her teacher who she has been loving since she was a little girl. The problem is, that she was never told what her condition is. She didn't even have to learn about it. It was just written about. Her teacher just tells her that she won't be able read. However the reader has no idea what this is referring to. She doesn't even know if it is an illness, like "diphtheria" or something completely different. This book just fails to be interesting, and I can't help but hate it. I didn't think I would find a story like this in a children's book, but I did and it was so much worse than I could have ever expected. I know that I am going to have to go back and read this book again. I really don't know how to rate it anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing you can complain about with this is that there was way too much for so little. The fact that it had to be in 3 different formats really didn't help the book. Also, not all the information was there to be had and some of the explanations were not very clear. There was nothing in the book that really impressed me. I would have preferred some more material about the life of J.R.R, but I will give this book a 3.  (reviewed 26 days after purchase)  Review by: Lina W  Overall Rating:  It was a good book, but was hard to understand. I can't remember anything in detail from it. ...  One of my favourite authors - is he alive or dead? I would really like to read something from him again.  I think I'll wait for the next novel, but this one was just too short to make the impression.  the only problem is that some of his earlier books are too hard to read!  Lina W. , December 27, 2015.  The only thing I would like to know is, where does the "originality" in a book come from? I mean, I like the book, I liked the plot, I enjoyed the characters, but all that was new to me.  This book was pretty easy to read, though.  as for the author - I really liked the characters - but the plot was a little boring.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book 4 stars because it has so much promise. When it comes down to it, the main character is really one dimensional, and the book never really does anything new with her. I also couldn't get into her characters, and there weren't any "dynamic" ones. The thing that irks me the most about the book was that the protagonist didn't seem to realize that she had an issue with men who didn't act like her and thought they were nice guys. I'm not sure if this is her personal opinion, but if you're going to write a romance with a major love interest, don't make him your best friend, he's your boyfriend, right?  In the end, this is a mediocre book, although I didn't mind the fact that it wasn't in the romance genre.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________________________________ This book is a very, very good one. But if you are looking for a 'how to write a suspense thriller' book, you are not in the right place! There is so much missing, and so much confusion, that it seems to have been written in such a way that nobody in his right mind should attempt this book. I have no doubt that the authors are trying to do something great and well, but that the result was the result of an inexperienced writer, and not the result that he really, really wanted. The problem is that his style is so poorly done that it doesn't even work for him, and makes the writing almost as confusing as if the author was reading his own work, and trying to rewrite it without the'realistic' skills he had acquired over the years. I can imagine a great book, that is, one that is written by an expert in the genre, but the results of this book, make me think it would be much more enjoyable if the authors had just sat down and written'real' suspense thriller. This book was a complete failure from start to finish. I think I have had this book in my head for a long time, and I have been trying to reread it over and over again, to try to figure out the mystery of this plot, and the 'why' behind it all, but to no avail. It's a shame that this was only supposed to be a short story, as it was a very well-written piece of fiction. But I'm so disappointed in this book that I'm not even going to bother trying to find out what happens next. It was just too good to be true.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited for this book. It's a classic science fiction story, but it was written in the 90s (which, I know, is a long time ago). If you're a fan of the genre, this one's probably going to be very interesting to you. The story centers around a young girl, Grace. A girl whose name I can't remember. She's a girl who can use a special device, called a "screambox", which lets her communicate with the dead. Grace wants to use this device to communicate with her dead grandfather, but when she's in a really bad mood, she can send the screambox to his house, and send his dead body to the afterlife. Grace is sent to live with her Grandfather's family, but everything is not what it seems.   The story is very interesting. The characters are well-developed and well-written, with lots of drama and action. There's a lot of humor, and there's some very strange but awesome stuff. The book had a big impact on me. In the story, the narrator, Grace, is the main character. She spends a lot more time with the main cast than I expected. The other characters in the story are well done as well. I found myself wanting to know more about them. The plot is very well thought out, and it's very interesting for the reader to learn about the characters. The author is also really good at describing the dead, their lives, their relationships with others. It makes the reader want to learn more about the dead characters as well, which is what I enjoyed most.  .   is a great book. I highly recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ _____________   It was hard to put down. I really really had no interest in the story line except that it was all set in a post-apocalyptic setting. I know some of you are going to say "What makes you think that people will have any interest in this story? This story is about zombies." The plot and characters of this book are pretty weak and the setting seems really odd. This book is also very short. I don't even know how much the author knew about the source material. But still, the story felt so boring to me because it's so obvious that it's going to suck. And I don;t understand why it doesn't feel so bad because it feels so cheap. I've read all of the other zombie books and none of them made me feel so disempowered. I would recommend this to anyone who has never read any zombie fiction before or to anyone, like me, who thinks zombies are a terrible idea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book years ago, and I hated it. I couldn't get into it, and when I finally did, I was shocked at how bad it was. It was just horrible. I even mentioned it in a book review, and the reviewer was upset because I thought she was a bad person for reading this horrible book. My own feeling is that she did, but I don't know if it's a good thing or not. If this book could have been released today, I wouldn't have any problems with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book 2 stars because I had mixed feelings about the book until I actually read it. Then I liked the book. I liked some of the stories and I enjoyed reading about a man who gets lost in a woods with an axe (I think the first chapter is called "A Fuzzy Man") and is told what to do about it by a man named Bill (I don't know who he is). Then he goes off to do it and gets caught (I know the first time I read the book I thought I was supposed to follow him but I actually liked that). The main character, Dave, is the one who finds the axe and he is not very bright or articulate, but when he finds an axe and begins to cut wood he is very capable.  The other two main characters are a man and a woman (there are a number of men and women in this story).  The man is kind of stupid and seems to have trouble finding things but does have a talent for languages, but is more or less retarded and is always messing up his sentences, making things worse.  He is good at making a noise that he knows is not heard and is able to figure out ways to work the wood without disturbing the forest, but this is just a way of making himself seem better than other men because it fits the stereotype of men being incompetent and unintelligent.   So I think the man's stupidity is a stereotype, and so is the man cutting down the tree because he seems more clever than Dave.  After the woods, the men run into a man, the woman is the only one who does not have an axe so Dave uses the axe as a shield while he works, but it is not an adequate protection and Dave has to fight the man to protect the woman.  Then we are told the tale of a man that lives deep in the woods and has a kind of psychic ability to figure things out.  This guy is an expert in many things, but he is only good for one thing: hunting.  His hunting partner was lost, and the man decided to follow the trail.  When he finds the woman he has never seen before he decides he has to save her because he doesn't want to be alone anymore.  That's when he meets another person who also has psychic ability.  The two of them end up getting caught in a battle over a woman, and they go into hiding until it is over
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was the worst book I've ever read. The entire story was so confusing, unbelievable, and pointless. I felt like the author was trying to do everything possible to write a bad story. This book was a complete waste of time. The characters just don't mean much, and none of the stories were even good. I can't imagine anyone reading this book and wanting to read another one. I think the author is a very talented writer, but this book was awful.   1 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My mother bought this for me for my 12th birthday. I was a total bookworm at the time so this was definitely a book I was going to read a lot. It was a pretty good read, but I feel like my favorite character is the only one who is really interesting.   It is narrated by a teenage girl with a really annoying British accent. She is supposed to be the main character but her voice is just so annoying.   "He is a monster. He is a very dangerous monster. A monster. One of those things you don't know how to deal with but one of those that, if you don'  "If the world goes out of style, then a man's life goes out with it. But that's the kind of life you want. And what is the kindest gift you can give yourself? To lose your sense of style?"   So my parents thought this book was so interesting that they bought it for me when I was 12. I didn't read it before that but they made me read it. And the first few chapters are very interesting and interesting but I have to admit I wasn't a big fan of the voice. There is something about it that is just not right for the narrator and it has been something that I have tried to work on in the past, but never really had a chance to. It is something that was always present with this book and the narrator's voice just ruined it for all I am trying to say.   the narrator is too high pitched and I would give her a D instead of a B-   As I was reading, I was thinking, "If there are any readers out there who aren't sure whether to read this or not, I do recommend it. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I am glad that I am a reader who doesn't listen to the narrators, it is nice to have some independence in life. If there are also readers out here that don't want to listen to narrators then I also recommend this book for those people." but then again, this isn't really a book about narrators.  's is narrated through the diary of a 14 year old girl. This girl is not the main girl character, but this book is very well written and is just filled with so much interesting stuff to read about. I think my favorite part is her character and what she writes and how she has to cope with her parents. Her
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It doesn't feel real.   I've read through all the reviews and I think the real issue is with the character of a young woman who dies in the middle of her story. It feels like an anti-woman story, and in no way should it be used as a "teachable moment."   To those of you who think this is an anti woman book, I am totally with you. However, it's a book I am grateful I read. It's a fascinating look into the mind of a child soldier, a real child soldier. It is a book where a child is given to a soldier with no family and told that he is her real father. The book itself is a powerful testimony to the trauma of child soldiering. I wish more books with this type of story were written.   and to all the reviewers, I did not mean that it's an anti women book, because it is not. I just wanted to say that I feel like I'm reading a book that a parent would give their child to read to see how they would feel and the story I was given was not in the same way. It was not anti women.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  *The book is a good read, but it is full of false promises. I would recommend it to friends who want to improve their grammar (and that's it).   *I can see why the author thinks she is so great at writing this book. This is the best book I've read on the topic of grammar in recent memory. There are many wonderful lessons, and the author gives some really nice tips on how to write more precisely. There's even a chapter on how and why to use parentheses for structure. It's a good little read and an excellent way to learn the grammar.   The grammar lesson:  There are so many things wrong with this book that it just gives me the same kind of sad satisfaction I get from writing a bad review. First of all, she claims grammar isn't important. This makes absolutely no sense. People have been writing for thousands of years without any grammar and most of them are not any smarter than my dog. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to understand the grammar of the world we live in. Grammar is the language. It is also important to understand how and when the rules come into effect.   to the topic on which she seems to be most concerned: the way she discusses the rules of grammar. she spends some time talking about "the rule of three," but doesn't explain what that actually means. It isn't clear to me what it means for the grammar rules to "rule over" three, when in fact they don't. It also doesn't seem to make much sense that "three" and "rule" should be separated. For the grammar to "Rule over three" and for the "rule of three" to " rule over" means exactly the same thing. So why is it wrong to discuss them together in one paragraph? I think she means to show that grammar rules are flexible and they change, but I don't know how she shows that.   it seems to me she should have explained more what she meant by the "Rule of three." Then, perhaps her argument could have been clearer. Maybe she could have added one more paragraph about the importance of the three-rule, but then I'd feel I was getting a "grammar lesson" instead of a "reading lesson."

Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************   I read The Unseen Knife at the age of 8 and loved it so much I started my own copy in my own library when I got my own reading material.   My daughter and I started reading it together and I think that is the only reason I can remember it. It was not the story that I liked though. She was not a fan of the romance and there was a lot of the "punching" that I have never liked but I did not like the romance either. It did make it hard to keep up with the story when we both could not even find the right book to read.     There was no plot and it just got worse from there. The story kept changing and confusing me and I did feel like I was reading an alternate timeline. There was a large portion of the book that I found to be a waste of space.  .  ,   The characters in The Un-Watched Knife do not matter. It seems they have been forgotten, or are just not important in this book. The one main character, the young man who has the secret that was supposed to be kept was not really a character to me.   He was just a plot device for the book to move on to.   at least there was one good side character in the book. I have to admit I loved the author's description of the setting and characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible.  In particular, the "history" section is terrible (it's basically a history of the English language, in all its many forms, from the beginning to the end of time).  It's not bad for a short text; it's bad because it's so boring.    I didn't even read the first 50 pages; I went to the book store to pick up some other books, and then walked over to the bookstore to pick this one up.  This is probably the only good thing I can say about the book:  the author was a professor of English who wrote in the 1960s.  I'm not sure whether it's worth buying this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________________________________ So, I know many of you guys have read this book, but a quick reminder that this is a novella, and I thought it could have been improved a bit, so here's my thoughts: I read this the first time around at the recommendation of a few of my friends. When I was writing this, I had no idea what I wanted to say about it other than to say I liked it, that it was good and made me feel something. I wanted more though, and didn't read the rest until my sister's birthday in February.   Anyway, for those of you who are not in the know, I am writing a book about a female assassin, who I will not identify. She's the one who's actually killing people in the book and doesn't really care what anyone thinks. You should read that book. But the book is set in an alternate world where she's more a part of the society and does what needs to be done, despite being a woman. The world has a very old tradition of female assassins, but the tradition has been destroyed by a revolution which made it so that women only do things to get their family's approval. I mean, yeah, some of them do things, but not really the sort of thing you want your daughter to do, right? Not that I'm judging, just that it sounds like something I'd be very into as a mother.   and so, she starts off as the best assassin around. She kills people, makes a lot of money, and never has to worry about the fact that she's doing the wrong thing. However, in the meantime, some other female assassin has been hired to go out and assassinate those who are about to overthrow the monarchy.  ...   Well, let's start at the end, shall we?   So, this novel is about a girl who gets hired to do a job, and who wants nothing more than to prove her worth and get some revenge on those who have treated her so badly. Unfortunately, her job is to kill people.   a whole lot of people. But she has some help from another assassin, because this one can really read minds and see through the eyes of others. In this one, she'll be taking care of people who can't fight back because they have been kidnapped, or have lost loved ones in the revolution. But at the same time, it's also up to her to prevent anyone from trying
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! This book has been a total disappointment.  The writing is horrible.  I am a college graduate who likes science fiction, fantasy, and horror.  This book just seems so generic and boring.  The writing makes it seem like it was written in high school.  The main character has a good enough personality, but it seems like all the other characters are just trying to get along with him.      It seemed like the author wrote this book before writing a similar book in another genre.  You can't help but think that this was the author's first book.  It's very bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was so hard to read, I was not able to finish it.  The ending left me a bit upset, as well as it did the author. I really do not understand how you could go through all the effort of writing a book, and still end up leaving the reader with so many unanswered questions, and just so many questions that don't make sense. I had the same feeling reading the story, I did not know if the author was going to answer all the questions or not, which made the ending even worse. It is good that the author made a note in the beginning of the story that there are only so many ways you can make your character look bad. The book was quite a read, but it really sucked the enjoyment out of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This was the last book I bought from Amazon. I've bought other books from this author and they are excellent. --------------- I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a nice light read. There are many interesting details about various people's lives and how they think. I was also impressed with the author's knowledge of subjects. I am looking forward to the sequel which is expected to be out very soon.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________   This book does not stand up to its reputation as an awesome work of speculative fiction.   If you are looking for good stories that are exciting and challenging, then this is a great selection of stories. However, this is not the best book you'll ever read on the subject.   I thought the stories were compelling and fascinating, but the author had not quite got around to addressing some of the key issues:   - Many of the stories are set during World War I. In these books, the war is the focus, and a good deal of the action takes place near the end of the conflict. So, the authors had to make sure that the stories would work without any reference to a particular war. This is not a problem as these kinds of stories are common in modern times, but it does mean that the authors must make sure their story can work even if they don't want to deal with WWI.   the story takes place at the end when the war had ended, but not in 1918.  - I found the treatment of slavery in the book very poor. The author uses the words "slaves" and "free" very loosely in the story. There are many slaves and free people who are in the same story. The use of the terms "free people" and the fact that there is a male and female slave in this story should have been enough to let the reader know that slavery is not okay.   in the first story, there is an explicit mention of slavery and a slave owner. In the second story, a slave escapes from her master and goes back to being a slave. In both stories there are people who tell the characters that they will be slaves at some point. They are never named, but when they are described they are not called slaves, they are called "the others".  Some of the people who escape from the slaves have names such as "the wild men", "the dogs", or "the people with big teeth". There is also a scene where the characters have to cross a river. These characters are called the "river people" but they have no particular racial characteristics. There is an interesting scene where they have to fight an army of men with knives (no knives in these stories) but are not told how they are killed.   "They said the river people had been living on the riverbank all this time and they had been running to get away." This is how a slave would describe
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is a piece of junk that I did not even finish. I got a copy from a local library in my state and I was so excited to read it, but it was so frustrating. When I started, I was convinced that this would be my favorite book of the year and now that I've finished it, I'm sorry to say I'm very disappointed. The story starts out very intriguing, but by the end of the book, the story was so boring that I could not really enjoy it anymore and I am afraid that the whole story is just a gimmick for a better book that was not written by the author and is just another example of how much he wants to be famous. If I had to give this book a 1 star rating, I would have, but I do give it a negative rating because I still feel that this story needed a bit more time. I really want to like this story, but if I have to leave a bad review, I will at least say that this book was definitely not worth my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________  When I found this book at an inexpensive used bookstore I thought it would be a good read, I enjoyed the writing, I liked the plot and I liked how she wrote about different characters in different settings and with different situations. I didn't care much for the characters. They were all selfish, stupid, manipulative, and shallow. I was disappointed that the main character was so weak and so much less developed than all the other characters. I liked her at the beginning, but once it became clear she wasn't the main lead, I never cared enough to care about her again. When I'm reading a book I don't care if I like the main characters, but I did like the way she did some of the characters, and it was interesting to learn that they were all very different. It wasn't a very good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book and it was so bad that I didn't want to read any other book. I read the entire first paragraph of the book, and then started reading it again, to see how bad I had gotten. It's very disheartening to know how bad the writing is. This book should have been a warning to never read this type of book in the future. It was too bad that the book wasn't as bad as I made it out to be. I would not recommend this book to anyone.   As a reader, I can't recommend this one. If I had to recommend this, I would suggest that you avoid this book as much as you can.   for me, I have always hated reading books written by women. I'm very old school, and I prefer to read books written about men. This is why I was surprised that this book is a book written by a woman. I guess it was easy for the author to write it like it was a man. I found it very difficult to believe that a woman would write a book such as this. It seems that the author was the victim of a terrible situation.   the plot:   This book revolves around the relationship between the father and son. The son has an interest in reading and is encouraged by his father to read all the time. The father believes that children need to be encouraged to read and he doesn't understand why this would bother his son. One day, the son's father takes his son to the bookstore and when he is about to buy a book, he goes out and buys his favorite book: Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. The book was very good and it convinced the boy to read more. After a few days, the father returns home, and the boy is reading to him. The mother asks why he is reading at the kitchen table, and her son says that he read the book. The woman asks her son what he is doing reading at that table and he replies that he is studying.   is he studying? I know that I had read Atlas Shrugged, but to me, this book was far worse. I am so tired of reading this kind of book. It is hard for me to imagine that someone wrote this book. When I tried to read it, I was disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and I hated it. It's a story about a small town that gets caught up in a series of horrible murders. The townspeople are really stupid and the way they act seems like they've been pulled from another book. The murder itself is so gruesome that I can't even imagine the people that did it. This book left me with a sense of sadness and I didn't want to read about it again. I don't think it deserves a 2 star rating, because it was not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I have just finished this novel. I would definitely not recommend this book to my friends. The prose is horrible and I found the narration to be grating. If you can tolerate the grating narration, then by all means go for it. It's certainly worth your time and money. If not, this book is definitely not for you.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "Inconceivable."  I've read it in print and online and there is no way this novel is the work of this author.  This was a travesty of a novel.    It is almost impossible to put down.  I would never read anything by this author again.  "And how I laughed." I've already given my rating of a five. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********************** I picked up this book and read it, but the plot just isn't for me at all. I could tell the author wanted to give this book an authentic feel and that's why she spent so much time telling us how the main character was the most talented, but it just doesn't work for me, and I feel like the book just wasted my time.   When the main characters father passed away he was portrayed as a man of few words, no emotions, and a man that always seems to have to be the center of attention. Well, as a father I would like to know what the man does with his time. When his son is born he seems to try and stay away from the father that raised him, and never makes him feel the love that he deserves. Instead he's like a new father trying to be a part of his son's life and doesn't really understand or appreciate his son. There's a few other details like the fact that he doesn't know how to drive and is so bad at it he never gets a license and the fact the father was so good at fixing things he just leaves them there and doesn?t fix them or do anything about them. It doesn't take long until he leaves the son and then we don't really see him for the rest of the book.  ...   At the time this book was released, the man who wrote it was an author called John Grisham, and he was so incredibly prolific that even now you can get a book by him as soon as the first is published. This book was published on November 28, 1993 and is just called A Boy and His Dog and he published two more in the next couple years, but this book is all about the boy. The story starts when he meets a boy who thinks he's a dog and then he meets the parents of the boy who thought he was a dog. The parents give the boy back the dog, then the parents go on a picnic to enjoy the weather and the children play in the park, but when they return home their dog starts barking and whining and is trying to get the boy to play with him, but of course the boy is too busy playing with a book. This is not the kind of book I'm into.   for me I just want the main guy to be an adult, have an adult mind, have his own life and have his family with him.  - - - -   I
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This was not a good book. I am a long time fan of the books by James Patterson. I've read his other books, but never a book in which he wrote a story set on a prison planet in space. I didn't even want to pick this one up. The story itself was interesting, but I thought that the concept of a prison-planet had been done before. I don't think that a prison on an alien planet works for me."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The Book That Couldn't Be Changed,"  by David Sedaris.   I've seen and read many of his books over the years, but I was just sickened by this one.  It was too much.  He started the book with a bit of a rant:  A woman walked into the room.  She was dressed, she looked like a secretary.  "Do you want to come for coffee?"  "No, not right now, I'm feeling a little sick."    She looked like she was trying to be sweet, but she was obviously hiding something.   "Well I have a lot of people to run a marathon with, I need to make it back before I'm late.  My dog is in the car.  I'm also a bad runner.  And I need a little extra sleep.  Well then, what would you like for coffee?   You've got the wrong number, have a nice day."  I looked over the list of names, and at least a third of them I'd seen in my dreams.  They were all women, and all overweight, and a few were in love with me.  These were the women I'd gone after in my life.  All of them in the right places.  That's why I went out with them.  In the right mood. In my right body.  It was obvious that all these women were the products of the most cruel mind I'd ever seen.  Maybe the most cynical mind I ever witnessed.  He finished with this:   And so, they had coffee with a woman who looked like the secretary from the room, and that's when it hit me.    The next sentence has it all:  It's a book that can't be changed,   It is not a book about sex, but the story is about sex.  The book is about a girl who was born without a vagina, and the woman who loved and cared for her and helped her live a happy life and did everything in her power to make her feel better about it.  There's a lot more that's interesting about this book, but you've got to see the picture of the book. What can you say?  What is there to say? There is only one way to look at it. There is nothing to say.  David Sedarits, you suck.  Why can

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first few chapters are fine, but there is no plot. The author is a professional writer who has read a lot and knows how to make a good story. If she had started with a real plot, she would have had a good book. I think the characters are very stereotypical and she does not like black people. "No one in the black community has a clue what a 'black girl' is." "One of the greatest things about white people is that they know they can trust." This book has a lot of nice things about it. The main character is very realistic. Her mother is the head of a department store but also knows a lot about the black culture. She has a very good opinion of black people in general. She also has a sister who is an art teacher. She wants to marry him and is extremely into him. I also like how the book is filled with stereotypes. They all seem to be able to communicate with each other and have a good friendship. The only thing that is wrong is that it starts off too slow. The first five chapters are very slow. It feels as if the author just got started on the story. I am not trying to be rude or anything, but this book is a mess.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________   I liked this book a lot, but I can't stand the authors' name, which isn't really that bad, as they have other books, and a lot of them are better than this one, but for some reason they are always referred to in the same way, which makes me think they do a lot less than they should. They were pretty good with the narration, but this one was very bad. I liked it when it was funny, but it just never seemed like that to me. I also liked it more in the first part than the second.   It starts out with the typical guy wanting a wife who will never have sex with another guy. The guy has an extremely hot girlfriend and is doing very well in school. He gets his girlfriend pregnant, he is about to be a father, he really likes this girl who is now his wife, and he wants to be married to her.   "I want her to feel that she is something in my life."   He is not the typical kind of guy. He loves the outdoors, likes the beach, and spends a lot more time doing that, but he also loves his work. He wants to start a family. He is very serious about this. He tells his parents and his friends and everyone about his plan, but then his dad has a heart attack.  , and the wife has a serious boyfriend who is getting ready for war. That sounds bad, but the story doesn't really have much to do with it. I think they just wanted something that was easy to understand and could be easily adapted to many different situations, especially with the first few pages.  . This book is written in the third person and is very much a diary of the narrator. So the narrator's thoughts are not always clear. I didn't really like this idea. A diary is supposed to be pretty dull. If there was a whole paragraph that was really about something, I wouldn't mind reading it.   The characterizations are pretty great. The wife is not one of those "I'll kill you if you say no" women who will let things happen if he asks her to do something. She is a nice girl, but she just isn't into sex.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ________. The book is too long, and the information is too hard to understand. The characters are one-dimensional, and even the best authors struggle to convey their emotional state in their writing. The story is a bit boring, and there is no character development. The most disappointing thing about this book is that it can be bought on amazon with a free synopsis.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was in high school, I was given a copy of this book. It was my first book and I had absolutely no clue what I was getting myself into. The author does a really good job of fleshing out the characters and bringing to life the story in a way that made me care about the main character. There are several things about this book that I didn't like but most of them came from the author being way too dramatic. Overall this is a good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not enjoy this one. I liked the idea and wanted to read the book, but my curiosity got the better of me and I finished the book before I finished reading it. The plot itself is interesting and there are definitely some good ideas there, but it just did not gel well with my personal taste. I would say the author's use of language and the characters are both interesting. The only problem is that I think that there is a lack of characters that seem to actually be doing anything that can be described as 'characterizing'. I liked that they were all different in some ways and that it gave a bit of insight into how they feel about each other and the world they live in. 5.5/10
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ It was awful. I've had a bad experience with this author before (the first book, The Lighthouse, was not great). But, I really wanted to like this one too, even though I didn't. The story takes place on a small island off the coast of Florida, where a group of kids, including a young boy named Jake, are hiding from an adult named Professor Henry Jekyll and the evil Mr. Hyde.  The book takes place in 1858, a time when America was suffering from the Civil War. And, of course, it's the 1850s in a small, family-run hotel that has been in operation for the last hundred years. The setting is wonderfully evocative, and I really enjoyed reading about Jake and his father, Jacob, and about their guests, who range from a teenage slave named William, to a young woman from the South called Charlotte. But, the most interesting and tragic part of this story is the young boy, Jake.  and about his guest, who ranges from a teenager named William to a beautiful slave from the Confederate States of America. Jake's father, a professor of English, has always treated his son kindly, and, I guess, has been protective of him. It's clear, though, that Jake is the son of a sadistic monster, whose name is Henry. Henry has never forgiven the Jekyl family for the disappearance of his sister, Emily. When Emily disappears, Henry begins to search for her. "Henry and the Jeksylls are both sadists and criminals. Henry is a cruel master. As soon as Jake is born, he is taken away. Henry makes sure that he knows everything that goes on in the Jekeryll household. He's given him a notebook, he's taken him with him to the library at night, he puts him in charge of their bookshelves and in charge to pick out the books that are not important for Jake to read. When the time is right, Henry turns the clock back in 1848, when the Jekaels have been running this hotel, and puts the young Jake in charge." The book, as with all the other books by this author, is a great read. There's a lot of good writing in it, and the characters are well-developed. However, there were no real surprises in this one. I think that this was probably a really good read for younger readers who would enjoy it, but
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The narrator was too much like a kid and could barely speak properly. Also, I never understood how the character was able to make a choice that is so completely stupid, and she could also be so cruel at times.   If the reader only reads about people like these and makes up their own characters to save time, then they may have a happy life.   I will read some more books that are true-to-life, but then I would have to be able to deal with them.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ The book "A Guide to the Bible" is one of the worst ever written. It's one of those books that have been around for decades and still are considered popular by the faithful. It was written in the 1960's by a man named Henry Morris, who is well known among some evangelical groups for his books such as "The Great Controversy". He is still considered a "good" preacher. Morris is known for giving the impression that there are many "revelations" from God that can be applied to everyday life, including how to interpret the Bible. I was appalled at the book's contents and what it contained. Morris states that God is still waiting for the "one that knows all" who will "come" and take away the confusion, contradictions, and errors within the Bible so we can all "accept it without question". Morris believes that one should always believe the Bible, but then adds that there's a "great difference between a believer and an unbeliever." In other words, a believer should not question the Bible when he doesn't have any reason to question it. God, in Morris' eyes, is so "special" that He's going to help us "accept the Bible without question" if only we accept His will. He teaches us that we shouldn't question the validity of the Bible because "God knows His own heart". He teaches this through "prophecy" and then teaches us the "secrets" of prophecy that he thinks will somehow make the Bible more accurate or more true. For example, he teaches that the Bible is not "written in stone", because it was not written "in stone". Rather, it's a collection of letters between God and different people. "It's not written in stone because He chose to let men write it."  He claims that it's actually the "errors and contradictions" that make the "God" of the Scriptures "real" and "human". He claims that since God is not a man that "he does not need to have the same faults as we do" (the typical Christian defense of "the errors and contradictions"). Instead, he claims that we should look for "the good in God and the best in him". He says that it "doesn't matter if he is perfect, because God is perfect". He argues that it is God who gave us "the perfect book" and not "human error". Morrison also says that the
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book just really confused me. It was a difficult book to finish.   The narrator for this book is a really weird narrator. I could really feel his voice in the book. I had to go back and listen to the last several chapters just to be able to understand exactly what he was saying. I just did not understand why he was so intense at times and at other times almost soft-spoken. And then when he is at his best he can be really intense and you just have to listen to him. But other times when he was just a little soft- spoken or awkward or stilted or whatever he was like so annoying to listen too. But that did not mean he didn't have any value in the story. He was just so over the top and weird that I didn't really care.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. I knew I was going to hate it from the moment I opened it, but to find it so mediocre was a bit of a shock. I was hoping it would be better, because as a woman of a certain age, this is the first book I've read that I haven't had problems with in the first ten pages or so. Unfortunately, when you look past the pretty pictures, pretty words, and even pretty dialogue, there was absolutely nothing of substance. The story itself is basically a series of flashback scenes set in two parallel realities, one in the 1980's, the other in the present day. There's some sort of accident or accident that makes it difficult for one reality's Doctor to perform surgery on the other one's patient. He is, of course, forced to work in both realities in order to do so. He does this so he can help people like the women of both realities, so they can heal after they've been injured. And to the horror of the women, the men of both worlds, he eventually learns that he is in a parallel universe too. And even though his actions do help some of these people heal, it does cause him problems, especially because his actions are causing so many of the men, in both worlds and in this reality, to commit crimes against women and children. The main story of this book, which is told in the second reality, is basically him trying to save people. His actions are in no way moral. I didn't like what the author had done to my favourite character, the Doctor, by changing the original text. I can't say it would have been so much different if he had kept the text intact. The rest of the characters are pretty much uninteresting. In both worlds they are people of different types. Some of them are scientists or doctors. Some are soldiers. Some criminals. Some just are. But there is nothing really interesting about them all. They all have the same problems, the same flaws. There are no really original characters in this one. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery, or a good science fiction story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book was the complete opposite of what I expected! I have never read anything like this book. I read it online and was not sure it was a good book until I read the reviews. I thought it would be the most boring book out there but it was not. It was exciting and I felt as if I was reading an actual novel. This book is so good that I don't even need to have read the other books in the series because this book is just so good. This is a must read for anyone who wants to know what happens in a science fiction story. I highly recommend this book! 1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________ I enjoyed the book, but I am not a fan of horror. This book, while well-written and thought-provoking, did not have enough to scare me away. It is, after all, a book about a cult. One would expect a cult to have some sort of rituals and the like. There is a small but interesting section on how this cult uses its rituals to bring about its goals. The group practices and uses a technique which is called the Kabbalah. It's fascinating stuff and I wish it had been explained more clearly. But I found the book to be a bore, especially the later parts, which dealt with other religious cults and the role of the book in that context. Overall, though, a good read, especially for someone who likes occult, occult, and occult books. _____________________________________________________  "What is an occult writer to do if a reader's interests are diverse and broad and her expectations are as varied as the things she is interested in?" In this sense, I am a writer. But it is not the same as a publisher. A publisher makes you believe that he will take the time and care to understand your book, that his editor will work hard to make it the book you want it to be, and that you are likely to be delighted with the book. But my editor and I can do very little to make a book what it needs to be. I'm not going to call myself an occultist. But what I can promise is that I will do everything I can to make my book a good one. To do so, I've done the best I can. To see my book as what it is, is what is important. I would hate to see this book be what it isn't. To make this book the best it can be, I can only do my best. It would have been a much better book if it had spent more time exploring what is happening inside the cult members' heads, instead of just focusing on what they're doing with a knife. _________________________  The book is well-researched, well-organized, and well-paced. The reader is given an accurate, thorough and compelling portrayal of an American religious sect, and an excellent introduction to the cult's practices and beliefs. Although the author has taken great pains to be objective about the author, she nevertheless has a strong emotional connection to the author and does not let him get away with
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot was the worst I've read in a long time. This book was more of a rant than an actual book.   A friend of mine who's an excellent writer says it best: "The book I will remember is the book I read."
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________  This book is soooooooo horrible. It starts with a story of a man named Jack who is in his late 40's. He works as a bus driver and has an attractive wife, but he always needs to be out and doing things, like being with the woman that he was with, his first wife. This first wife dies and he lives with this new woman for 3 years. He also starts to experience some weird symptoms. He thinks it's because he's not working. When he decides to go out and do some things again, it seems like the symptoms are back in full force. He starts to think that the wife is dead, and that she was cheating on him. This makes him really angry, and he starts to go crazy. The next day he starts working again and his symptoms are gone. He has to find out if she was really dead, or if his new girlfriend is the cause.   The book was so bad that I had to stop before the second chapter and re-read the first chapter a third time. I couldn't believe what I was reading. I found that I couldn,t put my finger on what was wrong with it, or how it could be made any worse. I guess the problem with this book is that there was no true purpose behind it. Jack was just a guy going through this strange time, and when he started writing his story to get it published, I just couldn't do that. I felt like that the author just wanted a good story, and couldn't make up his mind which one he wanted to write. He just wrote the worst thing that he could think of, and tried to write it in as short a time as possible.   The author is not a very good writer. He was just going through a bad time, trying to make up the story for his book. I thought this book was kind of funny at first, but after reading it a third or fourth time, I really couldn't find anything funny about it. He didn't show any of his characters any development at all, and didn't do anything to keep the plot moving.   the only good thing that I found about this book were the ending. I think I might have liked it more if I had seen the second half of it. But all in all, this book really sucks, and if you can't stand bad books, I wouldn't recommend this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just a bunch of old news from the last millennium, from the era of digital technology. It's a very interesting read, and if you're into that, there is some interesting and timely stuff. The story is the "tape" is "recovered" by a young man who finds the key to it. It leads to the "key". Then he is told that he can use it to unlock a special device that is hidden in a museum. What that device is and what it is used for are not explained in detail. What I am going to say next is that if you have some interest in cryptography and secret information, and/or if you are interested in how the secret messages of the great secret societies are kept safe, this book will do nothing for you.   I have read about "The Codebreakers" and wanted to read a more technical book that might be of some interest to cryptography people. The Codebreakers was just too technical for me. A fascinating story about the codes, but the technical stuff was a little too hard to get through. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________ I think you're being a little hard on this book. I thought I was going to like it because of how much I liked the movie. I also loved the book and the movie was great. However, the book had so many problems I couldn't give it 5 stars. The first problem is that the narrator (he's not supposed to talk but he does anyway) keeps making jokes that are meant to be ironic. I found this very annoying. If this was done for a movie and the narrator was actually being sarcastic I would have loved it. Second problem is the book is extremely long and confusing. It also contains a lot of swearing and other vulgarity. It makes it almost impossible to follow. I'm giving it 3.5 stars because it's a book I've enjoyed but I wish it were shorter and easier to follow because it took me a long time to finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________   One of my favorite books, I read it over and over, but I just couldn't get into it. Not because I don't like the author, but it just didn't meet my expectations for this type of story.   It had very little to do with the story I expected, I mean I was supposed to like the idea of it and everything, but the execution just wasn't good.   in fact, the main reason I didn't enjoy it, is because of the author.   The writer just writes the wrong type of book, the kind of book I don t want to read, because I get bored easily. I can understand that if the author is new to writing, so that is why I didn t like it, but that just doesn t make sense to me. I know that it takes time for people to find their voice, and then they have to have a few more books to find it. But the problem I have with this is that I read the first two chapters, and I just didn t find the writing so compelling.  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***************************** "I didn't get much out of this book except to realize that the main characters are the most boring people on the planet. I am just the type that can write about anything but I just didn't find anything exciting about the characters or the events. This book is all about the conflict between the characters. This is what is happening throughout the entire book. You have two brothers that love each other. They fight. They argue. They are a real dynamic duo but they also hate each other in the most annoying way. It's the same every time. I have never felt so bored in my life."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't enjoy the book at all.  That being said, I'm glad I gave it a try, because it did have some potential.  The premise of this book is that the world has gone to shit, because of the evil corporation called The Corporation, who are out to get their own back.  To combat this, they created The New Order, a giant robot army which they had implanted into a mountain top, that they used as their main fighting force.  The army was so powerful, that it had been able to defeat most of the other robot armies that the corporation had created, and so they had begun to destroy them all, and eventually they would stop at nothing until the robots are wiped out.  So, the problem for the corporation is they can't let all the robots die, so they decided to use a group of people called The Resistance, which was basically the group who were the good guys and were against the evil, corporate forces, to fight against the robots.  In order to get The Resistance's attention, they needed a human being who they could use as a human shield, but since they couldn't trust any of the humans they sent out to kill them, they were forced to resort to using one of the Resistance's own people to save the day.  But, it turns out that the human being was actually a traitor who didn't really want the resistance to survive.  It turns out, that the robot leader, Mr. T., was actually Mr. D., the leader of The Corporation.  After The Resistance destroyed the army, Mr D. had Mr. M, the leader (or I should say "puppetmaster" of the resistance) that they had sent to capture the human shield and kill them (he didn't have any idea that he was actually the leader, though).  When the human was captured, he told Mr T that if he didn't kill him in the next two days, he'd blow his head off with a shotgun.  Now, the human had given the robot information about the human's location, and it made Mr T very excited.  He sent all his soldiers and robots to the location, only to find that the location was actually an abandoned research facility for a drug called P.T. (Paradigm Therapy), which is the reason that the military was attacking them.  They were told that the drug has the same effects as amphetamines (like the ones that

I would not recommend this book to anybody.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________ "The first time I read this book, I was left feeling very confused. My main gripe is the author's claim that he 'knew' (as though he had a secret source in the Pentagon) that Saddam Hussein had a clandestine nuclear program." A few months after his first reading, I re-read the book as a result of several events: First, I learned of a recent Pentagon report that said that Saddam's weapons of mass destruction were no longer there. Second, an old friend (who was also a Pentagon analyst) sent me an email telling me that Iraq had had a nuclear reactor for years (I had never heard of such a thing). Third, while I was in Europe, I picked up a copy of an old British report on Iraq that said there had been an open secret from the late 70's that Iraq was developing a nuclear bomb. I then went out for a few days and found myself reading about this for three weeks straight. As I finished the book, it took me back to when I first read it. The book says, for instance, that the CIA and the British knew of a large Iraqi weapons program in 1992 but didn't tell anyone, including Saddam Hussein. Now, as I have re-watched the movie, this point seems dubious at best. It's like the CIA saying, "Oh, by the way, we've been spying on Saddam Hussein for a while now." Well, I mean, what would have stopped him from doing so? I've heard a number of accounts that claim that the British even gave Saddam Hussein a list of the countries he was supposed to keep his nuclear weapons in. Even if that's true, it's hard to see how it would have been so easy for Saddam to get all of the necessary technology and to make the bomb in the 1980's, so long as he didn't really need all of it. For me, the most interesting part of the book has to do with the story about the US-Israeli intelligence relationship. At the end of the 1980s, the CIA started giving the Israelis the names of top nuclear weapons experts, who the Israelis then recruited and trained to work on nuclear weapons. In 1987, the Israelis even told the CIA that they had manufactured nuclear weapons with their own scientists and at their own facility. (They denied it all the way up to the US court of appeals, where they were later exonerated.) Now, the authors of this book say that the US government
Write a negative review about a bad book:  My husband and I loved this book, but, we couldn't stop thinking about the story for weeks.  We couldn't wait to start reading the next book in the series, because the story just kept pulling us back.      My husband loved the book, and I liked it too.   I also have an eight year old girl, and this book is perfect for her too. My Rating: 4.75 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:        It's a bad read, I am sad it was written by a white man. I wanted to cry in the book, the story is sad at some parts I can't believe in my world is so corrupt. I gave this book 2 stars and I do plan on reading it again and again, but as a warning, I will say that this is a horrible book, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the author clearly has a ton of empathy for his characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If this is a bad read, it can only mean one thing. The authors wrote the book, then tried to market it. That's not a very good strategy, and one which doesn't work out very well, either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am currently in the middle of a series called "The Black Company," by Peter Watts.  The first volume had a really rough start, and it's been a real struggle to get into the series.    This book is the second installment, and I'm still not 100% in love with it.  The characters seem to be more like caricatures, instead of real characters, and the story has a way of getting into a rut.  It's also got some minor character conflicts and subplots, but none of those things really tie together in a way that actually builds to anything.  I don't hate this book, it's just not doing anything with the premise that it set up.  Even if the plot isn't good enough to stand alone as a story, it could have been a really great series if the first book was so much better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I would give this book more stars, but I have to give it only three, because I'm still struggling to get through it. It is very poorly written and the story line seems a bit off. The characters and plot don't make sense and the ending seems a little rushed and doesn't fit the rest of the book. I felt like I was watching someone else's drama. I think the author could have done much better with this book. It really should have been something interesting and interesting characters. I can't wait to see if this book gets more attention from other authors in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ I am so glad that I was able to read this book. It was not a difficult book to read. I had to take breaks, because it was too long, and some parts were difficult to read for me. I felt that the author went a little too far with his descriptions of the city. I just could not imagine what it was like there. The people were all different and had different styles of dress. I found the city quite disgusting. I am not going to waste my time going back to the city, because I was so disgusted. The author, Mr. DeBruyne was a great narrator. He really did a great job. I recommend this book to anyone who likes travel books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! It's not funny at all! I feel as if the author has a very narrow, limited view of women, and the characters are all victims, and just victims that have been thrown down by a powerful man. The main female characters are just pathetic. I don't understand why anyone is interested in them. I was just a victim of their abuse, and I have been through a very deep and difficult time and this book was not helpful to me at all. This book was just depressing. The women in the book all have their own problems and just had nothing to do with this story. I thought the book was over at the end, but I had to start over from the beginning.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited for this book. I had seen a sample chapter online and had heard great things about the author. I have a few books by him but this was a bit different. In my opinion, he tried to be too clever and too obscure with some very subtle references to the Bible. The "fairytale" tone he took made this book harder to read than it needed to be. I felt that the Bible was the best part of this book but it was not the only thing that made me feel that way. In the end, the whole thing got very confusing for me and it is very easy for a beginner to get lost. I understand why it was so hard to understand.
Write a negative review about a bad book:        As a woman I do find that men, especially older men, can be insensitive.  It's like I'm supposed to just accept it.  In a good way though, of course.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book will not change your life, it will make you feel bad and then feel bad about yourself for being such a pain in the ass. It was written by a man who thought that being rich and having a job in a world where people are lazy and will buy anything will get you success. The reality of the world you live in is not the one he lived in. His book is full of typos, factual errors and general assholery. I thought I could make a difference with my writing, but I can't. I'll buy his books but not his books. Maybe if you go to a library he might like you more. He has a book on the bible for those of you who are not up to date on your bible knowledge. It is more like a self help book then an authoritative book. I did buy it though.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had no idea this book was written by a man. I bought it because it was listed on Amazon as a "young adult" book. I had NO idea this was an adult book. The writing is VERY poor and there are many spelling mistakes. I am not sure if they were written by an adult. I really can not recommend this book to someone who has never read a book or who doesn't know anything about books and doesn't understand why a boy would become a girl.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I have ever read.  I hated every minute of reading it and was dreading the end.   I wish I could give it 1 star.  And here is a summary of the story so far:    The main character, D, is in the middle of her most dangerous adventure: a trip to find out who killed her father, whose death left her emotionally scarred.  In a strange and eerie way, the story is about how we can relate to the emotional and spiritual effects of loss, how we all relate to that loss, and the importance of sharing it with others.  The main character's father was a very strong and loving man, and a very active member of his local community.  When he died, D was left in the hands of her mother, an angry and violent woman.  However, she grew up to become a very caring mother and wife, and she is very responsible for her daughter's development.  She is also the mother of D's children.  Her mother does not allow D to be outside without supervision, and is always worried for her welfare.  D's life has been filled with love and family and community, and it is because of this that she is able to deal with her emotions and remain strong in the face of loss.  Sadly, she will never see her mother again, and this is something she will not easily forget.  Despite her mother's violent ways, D is able learn to accept her mother as her mother.  What happens after the death of her father is another story.  I don't think there is much more to say here.  It is a great read, and if you're a fan of YA, then you will love this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book. A great read.   It starts like any other fantasy book. There are a bunch of characters. We follow a young, orphaned boy as he travels. It seems that he is trying to learn about the world. We learn a bit about the people and places we meet. Then we follow him into a strange land. The land is full of strange creatures. We meet strange people. Then it was my birthday. I got the best gift in the world, the best book ever!   The characters are so vivid and the story is so good. The author was an excellent writer.  .  If I had any complaints, it was that some of the characters were stereotypical. A boy who couldn't write anything but love stories. A man who was always being in trouble for some kind of crime. A girl who is always in love and loves her cat. Some of the details were a bit too in-depth but I didn't mind it that much. I can only compare it to a book I read a while ago. It had a different author, with a different story but I still liked it.   the worldbuilding was wonderful, it's a fantasy and so it has to have that world building. I enjoyed reading about it. The characters were so realistic, I knew them from their conversations and we became like friends.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In my opinion, if you have to tell someone that a book sucked, it sucked. I can't recall ever having enjoyed a book to the point that it could be described as "good." It's been a long time since I have ever liked anything. I would have liked to be a little more satisfied by something that didn't leave me feeling like I have to laugh. I'm surprised that so few people in this genre don't see it that way. If you've had a bad experience with a book, that's fine. If a book has made you laugh a million times, that counts. As far as the bad reviews go, they don't matter in my mind. All I ask for is a book that made me smile, and then some that did both. Goodreads is all about personal taste. So if you think something sucks, I have a feeling that many of us like it. In addition to that, I think that when it comes to writing, you must be able to express yourself. Sometimes, the things you say are meant to be funny, and sometimes they're meant to mean something else. I can only speak to my experience, but I think the best way to write a story is to put yourself in the shoes of the characters and the setting. As for the reviews that don't really matter to me (unless the author is being a pain in the ass and I want a free book), the one thing I will say is that they have no effect on me, so I would never read anything that annoyed me. I do wish I could just say that it was a good book, but sometimes the best thing to do is say nothing.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________ The world needs more people like Dr. Purdy. She's a real "chick with a gun" and a real truth teller. If you've ever needed advice, this is the best book I know of on the subject. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Book of No Quitting The book was great. I have read books on quitting many times and it's always the same stories. I love the honesty and honesty. Dr.Purdy's way of doing things is to just do the book. I don't take my book with me to the gym. I just read it in bed and go to the bathroom. _______________________________ "The Book of Nuts: The Art and Science of Self-Control" The book is a really good introduction to the subject of motivation and self-control. A great book for someone that doesn't really know what the hell to do about his/her motivation issues. ______________________________________________________________ What can you tell about a person by the way he or she walks, talks, and acts? When you're trying to find your motivation to make yourself feel better, it's hard to know what you can do, but it sure does help to be aware of what others do. __________________ I thought that The Book Of Nuts was the best way to deal with motivation issues I've ever seen. The author is a former doctor and I thought he was a lot more than just a scientist. He's a well respected psychologist with a lot of experience that could have helped some people who are not so well versed in this subject. This is a great book and highly recommended. -------------------------- The Book that changed my life!!! This book has changed my entire way of thinking and is what gave me my motivation to start writing again. This book, along with The Power of Positive Thinking, was the first things I took with me when I decided to move from a high stress and unfulfilling job to teaching. The Book also changed my whole life. The Power gave me the courage to face myself and I feel that I was in a much more positive frame of mind at the time. Dr Purdy has given me the best motivational book I have ever read. His way of going about things is very realistic and simple to follow. I think that this book was a great change of pace from other books and it really changed my lifestyle. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I have tried everything to quit smoking, but nothing worked. I had tried
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The story is about a boy named Will, who had to deal with some bullies at school. They call him 'faggot' or 'tranny.' I think most people would not take such a severe thing so easily. Will did not take it as a joke, but instead turned it into a battle against them. I found that to be pretty awesome. "   The story has an engaging plot, and it is easy to enjoy reading the story. It is really good, though, and would be a great addition to anyone's collection.

A book for those who have not been able to read and learn about the Book of Mormon, but want a good story.  Author: K.J. Taylor  Publisher: Signature Books  Page Count: 144  Description: I really enjoyed this book. This is a must have book.  a Book That Makes You Say.......................................... "It's a Book! It's A Book! I read this book and it makes me want to read the Book. I don't know why but I do. It's a very easy read and I can relate to the people. They are all kind people and all had their troubles in their past. All of them are good people. The only problem is that they want to do the right thing. The story makes you want to go into the temple to find out what it is and what you are supposed to do about it. Then you have to go on a mission and do something about it, and so on. The end makes you think what you did was wrong and so you want someone to tell you about the right way to do things. The book is very easy to understand and I'm sure that many of you will relate to them."  Reviewer #2:.......................................................................................................................  "This is the kind of book you need in your library. I am amazed by the beauty of this book, and by the power of the message it conveys. If you have ever doubted the truth of this Book of Moroni, you will want to check this out. The author has a good grasp of history, geography, and religion. I think this book is not just for the Church, but for any of us that want to know more about the early Americans." . I was able to understand all of the history as well as I could by studying the Bible and studying the Book Of Mormon, especially after finishing my mission and the temple. It is a good book that will have you feeling the Spirit of God at all times. -J. W. P  ...This is a great book to use in the house and family study, in the office, or in any home setting. It is not an easy read to start, but when you do, it will change your life and your understanding of the gospel. It will provide great joy and peace to your heart, and it will give you a greater understanding of how we were led out of
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read all of the novels in this series but this one was the first one I bought (and I know many have been disappointed by the author's choice of subject matter). The story is based on the novel of the same title by Patricia Highsmith which is about a young woman's marriage to a married man. After the wedding, she and her brother, John, end up in a motel room after the wedding where they are attacked by a stranger who rapes John. The attack is not the work of a stranger, it's the work not of a man but of a woman who appears to be a psychopath. The woman comes out of the room and rapes John but when he cries out and tries to save himself she does not come out and she attacks again. I know how this has been portrayed before as a rape by an older man but this is not that. No, this is a rape that is not of the older man, it is of a child. Not because she is old but because she's so young. I think that this is where this series begins to really fall apart. This is a novel written by a woman whose life has been the subject of so many films about domestic violence that if anyone has done something wrong in their life she has probably seen in the movies. I've never seen a film where I thought it was a bad movie, but I've certainly seen many movies where there has been an element of abuse (even if they were not portrayed in the film). I have the feeling that this story was originally written for the purpose of making money and when Highsmith couldn't get it made she decided to write it to sell as many copies as possible. I don't know, but it seems like a big flaw to me because it is the only thing that made me buy this book.  This book was just okay, but this wasn't bad or anything like that.  (The Author)
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________________   I have enjoyed many of the books that I have read that have been rated highly by other reviewers, but this one really made me want to puke.   What the heck is a 'cute' bunny? Why does the narrator say that he doesn't like this one? Is the bunny, who is supposed to be cute, a real boy or something? Seriously, just WHAT IS THIS BOOK ABOUT? And why did the narrator describe the story as 'brave' and 'courageous' but then say that the rabbits were weak and 'cheap'? Why didn't he tell us the rabbits' names? And how does he think that they are all the same, except for the girl?   This is one of those books that just seems to have no logic to it. As if the author wanted to'make' this book into a story about rabbits. As an animal lover, I think I'll have to ignore this one.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ (see my "About Me" section)  "Well written, engaging, enjoyable and well presented, yet the story itself, while well-developed, did not leave me feeling very uplifted. A good read but not as I would have liked. (October 1, 2008) The author is a good writer with a passion to share information about a topic that has always interested me and others who have a passion for this world. Although I felt I was reading a factual account, I was not feeling the author was truly connecting with me on an emotional level."  I'm a huge fan of the books that I have read but I don't consider myself a book lover and I only just started reading this book. I am a big fan of Stephen King. In fact, I've read everything he has written (including the many spinoffs). I've always felt that King is more of a psychological thriller than his "horror" stories. If I was going to be spoiled, I would say that "American Dream" is the most psychological thriller I've ever read.   And it was a very good thriller.  . I had some problems with the book and some issues that I had with the characters, but the book is still a very interesting read. There are some twists and turns in the story that had me on the edge of my seat, and I have not read many books that had an actual and good love story.  , I think that King's greatest talent is his ability to make you feel and think about his subjects, whether they are horror, fantasy, romance, or horror/fantasy. Although the book has some flaws (which were very minor for me, I admit), "American Nightmare" is a very well-written and well-paced book. This book is a definite keeper for anyone who is a fan of King, or just enjoys a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has many problems. I bought it hoping for a good book about what makes up our human existence. It is a collection of essays and stories. Each one is good but not all of them are. The writing is slow and sometimes there is a lack of information and information is not provided. There are many times where the author tries to be clever with a concept only to forget it the moment she has to tell the story. There is one good book in the collection and it is about a man with OCD. She makes the man with his OCD feel normal. It was a very good idea. The rest of the books in the series don't work as well. Some of them were written when he was about 15 and some are older than that. I'm pretty sure he never had an OCD.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I bought this book for a Christmas gift, expecting it to be a "how to" guide for new brewers. I was wrong. It is far from it. It's full of wrong information, a very simplistic approach to beer making, and very little on making actual beer. The author goes to the lengths of writing a chapter on "How To Cook", only to then proceed to talk about how many of the ingredients I should be using instead. If you have ever wanted to be like me and start brewing at home, this is not the book for you.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very good book, but a very bad read.   It is a book about a woman named Alice in a fantasy world called "Oryx and Crake" where she lives with her human partner and a dragon named "Dryad". Alice gets married with a dragon, but they have to give him up because they are of different species. She does not want to be alone anymore, but can not decide whether to keep the dragon or not. She has to leave him and he has to go back to the dragon and get her some information about where he is. When Alice goes out, she finds a big city called "The Last City" and they are both trying to survive.   The first half of the book is mainly about Alice and her life with the dragon, with Dyr and her humans friends. There is a lot of mystery and adventure. They visit places like The Undercroft, the castle "The Dragon's Gate" and some others.   (The Last city is full of monsters. Also they are really weird and creepy)   There are some good moments though, like when they are on a boat to the island of the dwarves and meet the dwarves. They have a big fight, and they have a fight against the dragons, but the fight is not over. Also, they meet a woman and she seems to be their friend. Also there is an interesting scene when Alice is alone, and she meets a man that is trying to kill her. It is a great scene because it makes the tension up.   to top it off, the ending is not what I expected, but I still found it good. It was just so unexpected that I still had fun with it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________ I'm going to start off by saying I don't normally like the genre. But this was really good! The story is really well done and there is actually some interesting ideas that aren't just throw in for the sake of adding some new stuff. I'm actually kind of surprised at this because I'm usually not a big fan of sci-fi. But I was really excited to read about robots and technology, which usually don't go together for me.   But... There was an issue I had while reading. It's pretty minor, but I kind of had a problem with one of the robots that could talk. I kept telling him to "shut up" and "be quiet" but he wouldn't stop talking. Eventually I had to cut him off and not let him say anything, which took some getting used to. But it was a bit annoying.   to be fair it wasn't really that big of an issue. The main plot is really good, and I wouldn't have minded being distracted a little bit by it. The story had an interesting twist that I thought was really well thought out and well executed. I wasn't quite sure about what would happen next, but that was ok. It worked to bring us along, rather than keep us at a standstill. I also really liked the ending! It was pretty well written and felt totally satisfying.   the characters are all really likeable, I liked all the characters. They had great chemistry, and their interactions were fun. And... They had good chemistry between the main characters. I guess that's what happens with a robot... he can be a little too human. I feel like it took place in one continuity rather than the other. The first book was a very different tone to the final book, so I was glad to have it.   on a final note, I thought it was really funny to see how the robots interact with humans. I like how they were kind of like a robot version of a kid or a puppy. You just don't know how a robot is going to respond to something before you get to know it. And that's exactly what we do. So that was really cool!   Overall I really enjoyed it!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************** I got this book for Christmas. I have been a big fan of the Hitchhiker series, and have heard great things about this book. Well, I'm so glad I decided to give it a chance. I've read the original book, which is a nice adventure story, and then read the sequels. Each one is better than the one before, but I just couldn't decide whether to go with the second one or the first. It turns out this book has more in common with the first two books in the series. And, since it's the same story told in different ways, it's even better. I enjoyed this story much better than "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe" and "The Sentinel".   The plot is pretty simple. A group of people have decided to make their way to the center of the universe. They don't have enough money to get to the middle of the galaxy, so they decide to hire a hitchhiker for a few years. When they leave for their mission, the hitchhiking man falls in love with his employer. When he dies, the man's girlfriend wants to find him, but can't find him anywhere on the ship. She is very disappointed that her lover hasn't written a will or a will of her own. She's determined to find and contact him before he is forgotten. She decides to try to find the HitchHiker, and find him if he's dead. If he's alive, she hopes to be reunited with him.   This story is interesting, and I liked the way the story was told. I'm glad I gave it a try, and it turned out to be a good book.   to the characters. I liked these people, and liked the idea that someone would try to do something good for someone in a tragic situation. This is the way most people in this world behave.  -Rolf was one of my favorite characters in this book, and he's a good character in general. He tries to do good for people in a bad situation, even when it hurts him. He was nice to the hitch-hiker, but he wasn't able to find out what his problem was. He is also a nice guy.   It turns that Rolf has some pretty good lines, and you can see the author giving him some great lines. They're just great and fun to read.   (And the way he talks about women was also very well
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for the Kindle as a Christmas gift. I was expecting it to be the typical good kid/bad kid story, but it wasn't.  The writing was uneven at best, the story had so many issues that I didn't know what to believe was true. I can't remember much of the story, and didn't feel like I was really learning anything about myself or anyone else involved.  At worst, it felt like a rushed version of a movie.  4 stars because of the plot:    The ending was interesting but ultimately unsatisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't mind reading good books, but it has taken me so long to finish this book that I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone.  It's a very interesting book about one of history's most controversial, yet fascinating characters.   The narrator, and his father, have spent years trying to uncover the truth about Hitler's upbringing, and it is the main character's research that is the book's main hook.  I don't know if I would be able to tell what Hitler's real feelings towards his father were - he talks about them like they were some kind of secret, and when it's mentioned in passing (in a footnote, no less) that he was born a Jewish child, that doesn't sound very encouraging.  Even though the narrator doesn't seem very happy with the book in general (though I can imagine that being difficult for him) and the narrator's father appears to dislike the book, the book is still a very good read.  In fact, I had the book on my "to read" shelf and didn't put it down until about a month after I finished it.  What didn't I like:  1.      Not all of the narration is very good.  2.     The narrator's own parents didn't like him writing the book (because the son was a Jew).  3.           I don' think there is anything particularly wrong with the prose in this book, but the narrator seems to have been influenced by William Styron's The Giving Tree  Where's the sequel?
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- When I saw this title I thought it was very interesting and that I would really like this book to read. After reading it I didn't really enjoy it. It was kind of a confusing book. The story was boring and I could not figure out what the author wanted me to think and I was not even sure why it was supposed to be a horror story. The writing was also very bad and I think I should have put it down when I read the end because I was still thinking about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- You have to be kidding me. I had been looking forward to the whole thing. I read the synopsis and I knew this was what I wanted. I saw the picture of the girls and the blonde. I went to the website, downloaded it, paid the $2 for it and started reading. There was no information on how the characters got to this point, how the book was supposed to be set, or anything else. No pictures, no descriptions, no nothing. I guess I really was too excited, and my expectations went WAY too high. It took the whole first half of the book to realize I was reading a book and not a movie. I know this because I was looking up a few of the names in the index and they all sounded like the main characters. I would have liked to have gotten the more in-depth plot, but I was expecting it all at once. I'm not going to give this book 3 stars because I don't really care. My daughter loved it, and I'm sure the kids that read it liked it too. I just can't recommend it to others, even though it's based on a really cool game.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you want a great story with great characters and fantastic writing, go with The Mists by Paul Di Filippo.  The characters are so realistic and you get a sense of their emotions without having to put in any exposition or extra description of the action.   On a more personal note:  I had this read to me by my son, but I think that he enjoyed it more than me.  It has really been a while since I read a good book and I have a very hard time saying no to books like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a fan of the "love your neighbor" theme. I prefer the "give it a shot, and if it works out, let's all be friends forever" theme! This is one of those books! I thought the book was a good idea (especially for those who are interested in learning about this kind of thing), but I did not like the way it turned out. The book is very much geared to beginners. I am no expert and can only guess at the complexity of this sort of activity, but I think the first half of the book is more about learning about the principles that are involved than it is about using the activity in any kind of meaningful way. For example, one of the main things you'll be doing is taking measurements. For that, I think it's very important to understand the basic principles of measuring. I also think that it's important to know what kind of equipment is required in order to complete the measurements. This is something I learned by reading the book and using the equipment myself. However, I felt that the author made this part very hard and frustrating to do. It seemed that even after I had finished the steps that I felt I had a pretty good idea of what was needed, and when I needed help with the measurements, it wasn't there. For someone looking for this type of material, it's better to try the book from a website, even if it's only a brief summary of the steps you're supposed to take. However if you're still interested in doing this sort a thing, I would recommend this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "A truly terrible book. I was completely flummoxed as to how I could have been so stupid as to have believed a book so repulsive.  I have read dozens of novels since then, and this is one of the worst.    A few of the things she writes are funny, but there is just no good for you in here.  For the record, I will never read it again."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "There are so many flaws in this book, so many things to dislike, so much of the book that I was hoping I'd be able to avoid them all." It's a very frustrating book - the plot is a travesty of the true story, the story is incredibly dull, and the characters are awful. There is so little plot and character development, but there are so much that is interesting.  The author spends much of this book trying to tell a "true" story, but only half of it is true. This story is that you can't get on the Titanic without a ticket, and that only the wealthy and the good can get a seat on it. I don't even know how you make that up - there's no way that you are going to be able make that story up. And if you did make up such a story, it's only going to get worse as the years pass, and even the "true version" of the story isn't going to do anything to make the whole thing true. What is interesting about this story is the way it was told. There was a very large number of passengers on the liner that were able to board the ship without tickets. The author made up the "Titanic" story of how they got aboard the ship (they were rich and/or came from wealthy families), but what was the actual fact? It wasn't about a wealthy family. There were plenty of wealthy people on the ship that got on and were given tickets. It was not about a few rich people. And why would it be? The story had already been told many times over. It was all part of the plan, the whole story was being planned by the Illuminati and the government. We are supposed to believe that it was a random act of fate that they were able get on, and nothing more. We see how the Illuminati have control over all governments, the governments are controlled by the wealthy who own their own governments, all the media is controlled by them, and all the governments and governments are owned by them. We're supposed to see all of this in this one story, in a single man's life, and be totally shocked. We have to be the "little guys" who are really being persecuted for not being able to be as "rich and important" as the people on this ship. I'm not even sure what the story really is.  I have no

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was awful. I could see the movie, but i wanted to read it.   Plot:  This book is about a girl who lives in the jungle, who falls in love with a boy, who she then falls in a love triangle with her own father and her father's best friend. This is a fairly common plot in many stories but for one thing, if it has any good points, it is that this book is an actual book! It is written by an author that is not some sort of amateur, so I can't believe that they could have come up with something like that, but then again, that would explain why it is not good.  . Also, why was this book so badly written. I would have given up after chapter 9. If I ever read another book like this, I will get it checked for typos and spelling and stuff.   Characterization:  The plot is just so poorly written. There is nothing interesting about the characters, just the story. There are no real characters that can be defined, just a bunch of plot and character developments. The only thing that gets the attention of the reader is the plot and that only lasts maybe one chapter. The characters and the plot are just too different for a reader to care about what happens to them.   It just doesn't make any sense to me. The plot and characters are so different that it is hard to even tell what the difference is, and i have to guess it was only the first few chapters that I noticed the difference.   That's why this book, and any other book is just flat out boring. I am trying to figure out the author's thought process for writing this book. He really needs to take a good look at what he is writing. I mean, it has no story. I do not think any story has enough of a plot that a writer can actually make it work. There's only one thing in this book that I could take away from it, and it is how the author tried to make this story come across as "dark" and mysterious but I really don't think that that's what he was trying to do. I think he was just trying to make it seem like a story that would make someone with dark, mysterious tendencies read it, but it really is more of a boring plot, character driven book.    I will finish this book if it gets a rating below 2 stars, or even a star. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so boring, you'll wonder why you even bothered reading the first time around. The plot revolves around a girl who is possessed by the Spirit of a God. When she gets to his god form she finds he doesn't care what happens to her. That's okay though, because the rest of the book involves her having to fight off the other god forms of the various evil spirits. It has a few good fights (including a giant one, but it's too much of a spoiler to say more), but the action is so very predictable. If the Spirit had an awesome evil face instead of a boring goatee, I would have a good time. 5/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I love this book, and I know this is not the way it was supposed to be, but it was well written, interesting, and quite entertaining. But it was not supposed to have to be. It's kind of funny because when I first read the first chapter of this book it was all about my husband and me (he is the author) taking our son and her to visit our neighbor's new apartment, and the book kind of took a right turn. The next chapter was the kids' visit to the aunt's house. This is a great story, and has some really cool characters, but the ending was wrong and the writing was kind of confusing. I did enjoy reading this book and will definitely be returning to it later, because I can't wait to see how it ends, and which character or family we end up with.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book will only appeal to the anti-Christian left. The prose is bad and the ideas are a waste of time. There is almost no action and the story doesn't keep you engaged. What the heck. The last person who actually tries to understand what is going on and why, probably just goes back to their little safe cocoon of Christianity and refuses to ever let go. No one will have a heart attack reading this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book, expecting to learn something, but it turned out to be nothing. Not at all. It wasn't even a good book. It was just an attempt to learn how to create a program that can do this type of work. I just found that it was easier to learn from a video than it was to read from a book. I didn't know this about my program before and now I am realizing it is hard to do this in the real world. I also think this is a book that will not work for everybody. It takes some knowledge about electronics and programming. I know there are some people out there that are just going to hate this book because of it's price and it's length, but to me I think this book is a waste of time. I do love electronics, I love programming, and I would recommend this book to anyone. 4 stars. Good job. 5 stars. I like to use the term "learn by doing" to describe this book. If you are interested in learning about how computers do the things they do, this book should help you. 6 stars. Read it and get a feel for it. If there is anything I have learned from this book it is that programming is hard, and learning how to program is hard. I would highly recommend it to those who are looking to learn about programming and the use of computers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was pretty disappointed in this book. It's about as basic as it gets. It gives an overview of how to be a better person, including what to do when the universe is unfair, unfair, I hate unfair people, and even more unfair people who have hurt others. It takes about a page to cover how to make someone else a better you. So what can you learn from it? Make sure to not give in to people who will try to trick you into giving them gifts or even money. Not to mention don't make it a habit to give gifts to people for no reason whatsoever. If you find yourself giving money to people you don't need to, you have been conned. It talks about the dangers of being a jerk and the fact that you can get someone to change their mind by being a positive influence. It is not clear how these ideas will translate to a modern day world, but if you have kids, kids have grown up over the last several generations, and a good parent knows how to raise good kids, then I imagine that you have all the tools to be one of the great human beings of the 20th century.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book because it is a wonderful book and I have been trying to find books like it for years and finally I got one. Unfortunately, this is not a good book. The story was great, but it was not good enough to keep me reading through and I gave it up after the first couple of pages because it was a lot of words to take in. It is not like I was just being "spoiled" and wanting a romance, I really wanted to be immersed in the story, and I wanted to learn more about this relationship between a teenager and a woman that he is attracted to, so I kept going.  But it took too long to get there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I read the review of this book I would say that this was a terrible book. This book is poorly written and badly written bad. It is so bad in fact, it's hard to see how anyone who is familiar with the Bible could ever read it.   There is a lot wrong with this book. The first thing that I noticed was that it is an exact retelling of the story of Cain and Abel. Abel kills a man who had been oppressing him. He is killed and his dead body is thrown into the fire. Cain kills the man for his body. In the following chapters we see how many of the characters in this story die.  , the man who kills Abel, is told to cover up the murder. His uncle sets out to kill Cain's brother. Cain himself is forced to kill two men who were stealing food from him. This is all repeated time after time after the book and as a reader I felt I could no longer look past the characters of Cain, Abel, and the men they killed. At one point Abel was a very strong person, very angry about what the man was doing to him. In a desperate move, he kills the people who are oppressing and attacking him and he is killed. The same is said of the men who killed Abel and they too were killed. Cain was a great man until he is forced by the evil men to murder innocent people.  The story in this book is so poorly told that even if I was not an african American who had to deal with racism every day, I would have failed this book because I would not have been able to take it seriously. It begins with a man whose brother is murdered and he feels very strongly that he is going to kill the man responsible for his brother's death. Then we get to the first two chapters where the story takes us to Cain, who is about to go on his first hunt. We read about the hunts and we hear his father and his uncle talking about how great a hunter Cain will be. Cain is told about what is going on in the world and Cain is happy because he believes that God will be with him. At the same time, his brother Abel is going through a very difficult time. We learn in this first chapter that Abel is in hell for his sins and he blames his brother. In chapter two, Cain is hunting in a different place and it seems that it was a good hunt for Cain. Then Cain's uncle comes
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book started off okay, but just stopped right then and there, and my experience was just about the worst. I will not be getting it anymore, and if they ever release another one, I will find another. So I tried this book in the bookstore with the library card in it. I had no idea what I was getting myself into... I'll try to describe the setting. It's not very different than any city, but it feels so different. The streets are dirt, and the buildings are crumbling. I found a lot of homeless people in the book, and people working at the coffee shop. The setting is very dark. Not much in the way of light, or color. I didn't read the synopsis in the back of the book. I didn't even think to look for it. This book starts off with a lot going on. We're following a character named Will as he's in prison and in the hospital. There's a lot in the prison, but not a lot happening outside the prison walls. Will and his brother are locked up together in a cell, but only for two weeks. Will gets out and is forced to go back in to find a brother who he loves and misses. They end up in another prison, and in a very dangerous situation. It's a slow burn to get through, but I'm sure it would have been a lot easier if the book had been shorter. One thing that stood out to me was that Will doesn't do well when being interrogated. It just seemed like he didn't want to do his part. It made no sense. He seems like a very intelligent person, and it seemed like this was a very difficult question to answer. The story is mostly about the other characters. They have a lot to talk about. Will's brother has been through a lot lately, and that he's trying to deal with the fact that he is a killer. His brother-in-law is being watched, and wants to take it further. The rest of the inmates are all trying to survive on the outside, and make some money and a living. There is a drug dealer named Charlie, and his partner Will. Will's other brother, who he's been locked up with for a while, is trying to make a deal with a cartel that wants him dead, but he isn't being allowed to have access to any drugs in his cell. Will is getting desperate, and needs to make some

In short:   Not a fun book, although I still enjoyed it.

In this review he states that:   I bought this book expecting something very much like Stephen King's Misery. I didn't expect to like it, but I did expect it to be entertaining. It is not.

She has a crush on a young boy named John, but he's not interested. One day, when John comes to her house to take her candy, he makes a deal with her dad. They don't tell her that she has to kill his dad in a game of hide-and-seek. Lydia is not interested and John goes away. But then John turns up in the woods the next day. Lydia follows him.

John is not to be harmed or killed. She is to be buried in a coffin.  -   This book is boring, and the entire thing is a long set up for a stupid, pointless game.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a total failure and a waste of money.  It has been written by two people with a third one doing the editing who did not do a great job in any department.  The characters have little to no character development.  You can't really tell what their issues are.  And you can't see them change because they keep getting put into the same situations.  This has been the case in most of the books you have read by this author, and I will keep writing reviews until there is a complete overhaul. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________It was one of those things that was so out of place I was really disappointed and I had no idea what I was going to find when I opened the book. The characters didn't make any sense, and the plot was so convoluted. I feel like the author has some sort of psychological problem or was suffering from a personality disorder or something.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________  I read this book before a presentation on the internet and it is absolutely terrible. The plot is basically a collection of short stories. They don't have any depth, and the characters don't seem real. The author really thought he was going to be so original and clever with his stories, but it's just so bad it's embarrassing. The story about the boy with the glasses is just a poor attempt at humor, but when a character says something, you just want to rip the author's head off. The writing is bad enough that it makes the plot and characters seem like they were written by a third grader.  This book is so terrible that it actually gives me the chills. ________________________________________________  The story is about a boy with autism, called Dax and his best friend, who's named Jay. Dax was born with a condition that causes him to have problems with social interaction. This leads him to constantly be bullied. When Jay and his friend, Max, are on the way to meet someone and are hit by a truck, they run away. When they get to the city, they find an orphanage, called Lola's House, and Jay is picked out to be the next caretaker. However, when they arrive to the house, there's nothing there to care for. So, they take Dax to find a little boy named Teddy who was kidnapped by a gang called the Wild Bunch. Teddy has the power to see people's dreams. If he sees Dax's dream, he can make it come true. Teddy sees Dox and his new friend, Jake, through dreams. Dox has to tell Teddy what they're dreaming about, so Teddy can help them escape. Unfortunately, Teddy is being manipulated by the Wild Boy. Teddy knows what Dox's dream is, but he keeps it from Dax. Teddy tries to save Dax by showing Dax his dreams. Unfortunately...he loses, but in doing so, he gives Teddy's dream to the Wildboy. This changes everything. Teddy's new life is not what it seems and he has to deal with the Wild Boys again and again. In the end, Dax must find Teddy and bring him home. The ending is so horrible, I couldn't bear to finish the book. It was terrible. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- --------------- The only good thing about this book is that it was free. The book itself is terrible. It is the "book" that many students get from their book club, but the only reason I gave it a 3 is because I was in a class in which I did get to take a couple of readings (I think it was from a book called "Hinduism"). The reading was pretty good, but there was a huge problem with the text and it is basically the same as the reading that I took from the book club. This book will not help you understand Sanskrit. It will make you feel that you are on a very "easy" path in trying to "read" the language, and that will only help you to become a more lazy person. I know a lot of people think that because there is a "literary" side to Sanskrit that the language can be understood in an easy way. This is not true at all. A very large number of the words in Sanskrit are really, really, REALLY hard to pronounce. You can go and study on Youtube or books in English, but unless you are a native speaker or you can do the exercises that are given you will never be able to understand the language. This will only cause you to be more lazy and lazy is not a good thing to be in my opinion. This should be a warning to those of you who think that you will learn Sanskrit just by reading it. ---------------

Write a negative review about a bad book:     I'm sorry I didn't read it sooner.   This is a hard book to review, because I felt I was reading a great story. The characters were so well written, so alive. And, of course, the story was incredible. But the writing was difficult. It was hard to understand what's going on with the main character. It wasn't clear why he was feeling the way he was at that moment. It's difficult to write that I want to be with him, and yet at the same time I don't want to leave. I was just glad I got to finish this book. I would love to see a sequel!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I finished this book in one sitting. I have tried reading a lot of different genres and never really liked them. But this book kept going back to my head for a long time and it was just too depressing to read. I am still wondering why it is on the list.   There was nothing good about this book but everything bad about it.  .  ,   1) It has a couple of major plot holes and problems. The first problem is that we are supposed to believe that the narrator is a spy for the Soviets (the reason that she is sent to spy on the Americans is because of the fact that the CIA tried to get her and her husband to defect during World War II). She's also supposed to know how to use her skills for a good cause but all of her missions end up with the wrong person getting killed. Also the "spy" is an undercover KGB agent but the "American spies" are all Americans. The whole book is built on this fact and it's one of the major plot problems in the book. The second major plot problem that I have is that the Americans are so bad at espionage that they never really get close to the enemy. The Soviet's are much more interested in taking information and stealing it but the Americans don't know how and when to do that and they never get any information that they are not supposed to get. I really liked the Soviet spies because I feel that their motivations for wanting to be spies were much more in line with what the Soviets actually did in the war. But all of this was just thrown away in favor of a story about a Soviet spy.   of course the Soviet spymasters are all evil. There was nothing that they did that was remotely admirable. Their methods were just so...bad. It's not like they had the resources to do good.   the story is all about what the Russians would do if they got the chance to try and do something to the Americans. It was supposed to be about a mission to bring a defecting agent to the US but instead it ends up with two spy cars driving up to the front door and the agent is dead. The agent is told that he has been sent to a place called "Vosges" and this is the first time he has ever been to it. He doesn't even know what Vosges is or what Voseges is all he knows is that he is coming to the "Republic of Vos". It

This series is about characters who are as good or better than the average human, but don't have any super powers or abilities. This book, in particular, is about the most unlikely friendships and romance possible. It was refreshing to see how complex and intriguing the author's mind can be.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author spends pages on the subject of "what would happen if the world was made up of only people like you and me?" and "the more you learn about other people's lives, the more you realize they're really just like you". The result is a rather preachy, preachy book. For example, the author says that "When I met my husband and I fell in love" he became "confused". That is, he had to get a divorce. I have never had that problem. As for what he did with his life, I have always thought it was pretty good. I think most people are pretty good at handling life's challenges. But I think the author misses a lot of what makes us human, and that is our ability to love, be good to each other, and not become too bitter. I mean, if people get too bitter, they end up dying. Or getting killed, in this case. And I am not an advocate of violence, but I am a big fan of the guy who was right.   There are a lot more typos in this book. "the" and "his" are "their" and they have "sons". This book is so riddled with these typos, that it makes it hard to read at times, but it gets worse. For instance, one guy tells another guy (who just happens to be a woman) to "sit back and watch the fireworks". I can't tell you how hard it is to keep from laughing at this book when you read it. It is very hard to tell if the book is supposed to be funny or sad. I would say it is at least funny in a sort of cheesy way. There is a lot going on here and this book was a good book to learn about people like me. The only problem I have with this book is the author's use of the pronoun "he" in place of "he". It is hard to make it out sometimes, but what he is saying is, that if we are going to have a relationship with another person, we better not get too attached or too dependent on him. This is very bad advice. I wish he had used "she" instead of "she".   I can't figure out if he is being sarcastic or if the author is just not paying attention to how people are supposed to use pronouns.   a bad author: "I found myself thinking, What if my husband just had
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The Good Soldier by William Knaus is an awful book.  Its not just bad but it is a book that just doesn't work.  The Good Soldier is a story about two men on a mission to find a man with a supernatural disease.  What we see are two men talking through an interpreter about what happened.  One man talks about how they both believe that the disease that has been plaguing them has been caused by some sort of demonic possession.  Now we have two men who are not only in possession of the supernatural but also both possessing the same disease.   What they don't realize is that they are both being possessed by the same demon.  As you might expect the man who is possessed by what is described as the "Demon Child" is not the same man that is possessed with the disease. In the middle of the book we are shown a man who goes by the name of Dr. O, his first name is John O but he has the habit of going by his last name.  This man, while in possession with the demon child is forced to perform some sort ritual, and I can't say much about it but it involves the use of a knife.  Dr.O eventually gets it out of him but it leaves him very sick.  In his weakened state Dr.P who is actually a demon child comes in and attempts to take possession of DrO.  After the first time the demon comes to Dr. P he knows not to make a repeat visit.  It doesn't take much for the two of them to start having sex but in doing so they discover the demon is still very strong.  All of the above seems pretty much standard, it is when you get to the ending of the story that the book goes wrong.  Before the book ends Dr. T, another demon child, gets to DrO and starts asking him about what he has been doing to get such power, he wants DrO to tell him what he knows about how the demon has been affecting him.  Then at the very end he asks if he wants to be free of the demon.   That is all we get as a conclusion to this poorly written story.  If you really have to have another book about demonic possession I would not recommend this one.  I could not recommend it more.   You might find this book if you're a fan of this kind of writing or if you are a fan who like to read the
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I have been looking for this book for a couple of years now and finally purchased it from amazon.  Unfortunately I didn't like it at all.    I didn?t find much in the way of interesting information, so it felt like it didn?'t really take me where it was going or give me anything new.    It doesn't really make sense to me either.  But I really have been searching for a book like this and this just wasn?t it.  I would give it a 2 out of 5 stars only because I think the author should be given more credit for his writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book had no value to me. The author was trying too hard to be hip, and he was trying to be a realist, but the result is a book that really does not fit the trend. I know it has a catchy title and that the author is a "fancy pants" writer, but really, it is a story about a man who decides he will be better than all the other people in the world, including himself, and how this results in a self-destructive, and self-serving, and really depressing life. I am not a fan of the way the author wrote the characters; he made his characters seem incredibly stupid, so when he decided to make them seem smart, it was almost as if he were writing a parody of a smart character. He has no sense of humor, he had no sense what the point of a story was, he was making this about himself, even though he had been in the news and in movies before this and had made millions of dollars on film and on television.  I was really disappointed. I had a very different reaction to this book: I think that this book is actually much better than most books that are about people who are in a downward spiral and are looking to change themselves.  This book is about a guy who becomes a good man in the process of making a mistake.  He does it by being honest and hard working and loving and understanding and doing what he wants to do with his life.  It is about someone who has a very strong sense of self but does not have that much money and does not make a lot of money, he is not a guy that is a professional athlete or a professional entertainer, so he has to figure out what he is going to do in his life and who is going be willing to support him.  This is not about him having to change his mind about anything, it's about him changing his mindset.  The idea of going to the doctor and saying "hey, I want to be healthy and strong," and saying that he is tired of playing basketball and wants to be in the music business, is not new, it has been done many times.  Here is the thing that makes this book unique: the character that he makes is not perfect.  Sometimes when a person says "I don't want to change things," it is the perfect moment to change them, and this is what happens to this character.  What this book
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________ 1. I read this book from a children's book store in NYC for a small fee. I had heard good things and was looking forward to reading it. I picked up the book, grabbed my jacket, and was ready to go to the library. As I was walking out the door, I could feel my stomach lurch and a little bit of sweat run down my back. I felt the urge to stop and give this book a chance. And I do not recommend this book to children. 2. I was told it was not written for young children. 3. The book opens with a young girl trying to climb through a window to get home when she hears a big crash. She gets a key and goes to look out the window. She looks in to see a little boy running across the street. The little boy says, "This is your friend, Jack! Don't go down that road now." 4. The story continues with the same little boy telling the girl and boy where they need to go next. He tells them that there is a house that is big enough for two. The boy asks the girl if she can go to her house. She says that she has to stay home because there is nobody there to play with. He then says, well why don't you go with him to the big house? He goes with her to the bigger house and they see a man with a big hat and a big green house. 5. He says, look, this is your home! He says that he doesn't like the big, loud house that his friend Jack has. The man then tells the little girl that the big green green house is only big because its owner left it that way. He adds that if she really wanted a big house, she could have made her own. 6. They go to another house and the little boy tells the girl to go and wait while he goes inside to get some papers. But the girl tells him that her papers are right there on the table in the big black bookshelf! He then comes out and she tells him to take the books off the shelf. 7. The books start spilling out and the man tells the boy to look in to the books on the shelves and he will be right back! He comes out with a green hat, a big black book, and two little black books. 8. He reads a letter that reads "This book is about Jack and the Big Green House, and if you
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really like The Handmaid's Tale and am looking forward to the sequels, but this book just was so bad, it got boring.   So, what was so wrong about this book? Well, there is the very bad prose style which is really hard to read. The writing style itself was very bland and boring, there wasn't anything interesting going on in the book that was being told to us.  -The characters were flat. All the characters in the first book were so good I expected this to change in the second book. However, it just didn't.  , who is such a good person that he is in no way worthy of being told anything, is still flat and the woman's son is still a bit of a coward. He doesn't do anything. I don't know if I was expecting to see a different story in this book, it was all just the same old same old.    , the male lead, is such an unlikable asshole. His actions are just so disgusting and I never liked him that much. I had an idea of what was going to happen in the story and it still didn't happen.       In the end, I didn't really like the book. It was very boring, and just kind of wasted the time it took to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book 5 stars for its style and story but the main problem i have is with the ending. I read the beginning of the story and I am a huge fan of both the author and the story but i just didn't feel anything. I feel like the author tried to make this about some romance and not really about the story. It was so boring and just made no sense to me. I would not recommend this to anyone who is looking for an easy to read story with beautiful writing and a love story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- It was okay... I think it's because I was used to reading books by J.K. Rowling. It's a great book but it's so long that it made me feel like I was reading the entire thing. The writing is great and I really enjoyed it, but I wish there had been a shorter version. And the characters didn't have any depth.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In the first part of this book (chapter 1) she talks about all the times she read and laughed at my work and my style.  I'm a self-published author who has had a few hits, but not enough to make it a regular habit of mine.  And I'll be the first to admit it:  In the second part of the book (Chapter 4) she is a bit less harsh, but still seems to take it personally that I enjoy the format as it is.  In the end of that chapter she goes into some of the benefits of writing the way she does, and then I got to thinking.  This is the first book I've read by a professional (and I know many of her fans will know the names and faces of many of the other writers in her genre).  She goes on about how she was "blown away" by the writing in her own book, and I was a bit put off by this as I'd seen some of her early work in other places.   Then I thought about this:  My main concern was that a first person book would just be another in the ever-growing pile of "I think a book would be good but I just don't know.  I'll tell you what I think, then tell you why I think it's bad" books.  Or worse, just another book of the genre where all of the characters are female who all go to school and go to work (if they're college educated) or go to college (if not college educated).  I'm interested in a variety of genres, but mostly for the writers.  My fear is that this genre will always go for the easy sell, as the books are already published in such a variety.  But for a genre that I can write, I would like to see some variety in the books, which I'll talk about in a minute.   Now, when I saw a review with a really interesting quote like "She talks about how hard it was to write in a different style, as a female writer in a male dominated industry" I really wanted to like this book, but I knew it wouldn't have much of an impact in my own life.  So, my biggest disappointment in this book was my fear of failure.  She's saying what many others are saying, that the process of getting a book published can be really hard, but it's worth it in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  After finishing this book I found that it is full of lies and nonsense. I would give this book a C and a bad rating. There are also several sections in this book that I could only describe as nonsense. This book was like a bad drug, I had to read the same part over and over again until it all made sense. The author was very good at putting words in my mouth. The fact that this book can be described as being about a spiritual journey is an indication that the author has no idea what he is talking about.   There are many parts that I cannot accept at face value. I had a problem with the author's description of how the various spirits were described in the previous books. The spirit world is supposed to be populated by different species, yet it seems to me that most of them are like plants. Also, the story is supposed be about a young man and a lady who travel to the spirit world but do not come back. It also seems to be described in a similar fashion to the book about the "Three Spirits." The fact is that the spirits who came from our world are extremely intelligent and are not as simple as we imagine them to be. If the author of this book really wanted to tell the story about a spirit, he could have just called it a spirit but instead he called it something that was not even real, and yet he was told that it was real, that it actually existed in this other world.   at first i was intrigued by this book. There were several aspects of the book that interested me. I was interested in the fact that the "spirits" had different abilities such as hearing and seeing and I was also interested in learning about how the people who have contact with them communicate with them. The problem is that this is all just a complete waste of space. All the information that is given about the people in the story comes from the first person. The main character has the most important information and I guess that is the way it should be.  : )
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________   I read this book because I was sick and needed some help with how to approach people I'd just met. I had just met a very attractive girl on a date, and I needed help with a very serious issue which I knew had nothing to do with her but just my inexperience. I asked her about what she'd been through and why she had gone through the things she did and what she thought about it. She told me she'd lost her father to cancer when she was 15, had two older brothers, and three younger siblings. She had always been very independent, had a very strong personality and was very successful in everything she tried. As a teen, she'd spent a lot of time with and was involved with older men. She talked about her relationships with these men. The older men always seemed to end badly and she never had the opportunity to do anything with a man who she actually liked. She'd never had sex, and she'd never gotten pregnant. She said she'd had sex with men that were in their 50s and had gotten pregnant with teenagers. I'm not going to get into details.   When I asked what her parents were like, she didn't really have any good answers. She didn't talk about her family but she did say that her father was the main breadwinner for their family and her mother was a very independent woman. She was an excellent student and won a scholarship to college. I guess she liked sports, as she was always involved in them at school. When I told her that I worked with teens and I have a lot more experience with people who are younger than me, she seemed genuinely surprised and surprised that I could relate to her so well. I've dated women who are much older and had similar experiences, but I felt like she was one of the few who could understand me as well as I understood her.  , which I read after, and while I was ill. I really enjoyed both the book and the movie. I was surprised by how well she related to me. I thought I was good at reading other people, but the book made me realize that I'm a very bad reader of other people. I found that I did learn a lot from her and I liked that she gave good examples of what not to do. I also thought that the book was a good example of how not to treat people when you meet them, not to talk and not to judge them.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book was the most boring book I have ever read. It was all about how horrible it is to have people who don't know a thing about the subject they write about. There is no point to this book other than to make the author look like an idiot because she didn't do this book justice and wrote a bad story about her life. I really thought it was bad until the end. The only reason the ending was better was because the ending made the last chapter better. The whole story was boring and I just wanted to throw my book away.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  "The Lord said to Moses, "Say to Aaron and his sons: Go to the mountain of God, which is in the midst of the Jordan, and stand on the mountain. 6 It is the foot of the mountain, and on it you will sacrifice a burnt offering and a burnt oblation. On the top of the peak you will make a carving. 7 You will make two tablets and put them in the fire on the top. On them the names of the sons of Aaron and of their sons who were killed by the Lord: Aaron and Caleb. Then you will wave them on the mountains, and the sons who had been in the tents will come to you. Then the sons and daughters of Aaron who were left over will come from the tents to you." 8 The priests and the Levites did so. And the priests did according to the Lord's command.  9 Then the Lord said, "This is what the Lord says: The firstborn of Aaron, son of Moses, the Levite, and of his sons who did not serve any god, shall come out first. Aaron shall go first; after him shall come the Levitical priests, the sons they of the priests; and the children of the Levitic priests, and their sons with them, shall go after them. 10 When the Levitan son of Aaron has killed an ox or a sheep or an ass, he shall bring it to the priest who stands at the entrance to the tent of meeting and shall sacrifice it as a sin offering before the Lord. 11 But the Leviathan, when he has slain a bull, shall bring its blood to the Leviter and shall offer it as an offering before a fire in the presence of the Lord, in the tent that is outside the camp. 12 Then the Levitaic priests, with their sons and their daughters, and all the sons the Levitasim, shall offer the burnt offering before all the Israelites. 13 I will take from their offspring the descendants of Aaron the priest, and I will make them to come out of the camp into the open country; they shall come down with their flocks, and with their herds and with all their flocking."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I hate this book. I hate that my teenage son was forced to spend the entire book reading it because this book would not allow him to take his own opinion into account. The book makes up its own rules and ignores all the science in an attempt to get the teen to love the author. I do not care about the author's opinion. I care about my son's. I was so excited to get this book for him and have him enjoy it, but his reaction was disgust, disgust, and disgust. This book is filled with garbage, and I don't want it anywhere near my family.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     The story starts, you know you will be seeing this for the next few months.   There's a few moments where it feels like this could've worked.  We were told about how "it is a good thing for a child to know they are important and special.  It was a good story with a good moral" but, I don't see how this works at all.  The book is written as if it were in the 60's and written by a person that is either illiterate or has never read a book that isn't to be relatable to the modern reader.  I am not sure how the main characters felt about being in their home country.  Their parents are either dead or in jail, so there is no one to turn to.  There are no kids there for them to learn from, no school, not even teachers, so they either try to run away, be a gangster, join a cult, or go through puberty at the wrong time.  While the main character and his mom, are a nice enough bunch, they are really just there to be used to drive the story forward.  This book is really just a rehash of what the previous books had been and there are some very obvious holes that I can see in the plot and characters.  And the writing in general.  What a lot of these books suffer from is poor writing, not just for the story, but for the grammar and the tone.  They are just so wordy and overly dramatic.  If you liked a book with action or adventure and the character has no issues with it, then you are in luck.  A book like that won't leave you feeling as if you were reading a book written by someone that was forced to learn how to write in their teenage years.  All you really do is suffer through the story as it is told.  Also, the book was not written with the same intensity as the previous ones, which really bothered me.  Most of the stories have the same plot twists that are so obvious that you won't even believe that they are happening.  In short, you just have to suffer through this book and not get too attached because there is a small amount of hope that it will get better in the final book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________ This book was not worth the time I spent on it. The story seemed to have some real potential for its ideas, but the author failed to develop any of the details of the story or the characters well enough to make the book interesting. I was also a bit confused on how the "war" was going to be resolved. The ending, while it gave a neat ending, made it so the "winners" were not actually "win", but "lose" by virtue of having to pay for "the losses" of the "losers". I was not in love with any of these characters, and I was tired by the end. I gave it a low score simply because the ideas the book has had, had potential to be interesting, but that potential was never fully developed.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book, after doing the research on it. I have no desire to read it again, despite being a great fan of the Harry Potter books and films. I'm just not sure why, as I have been so enthused by the idea of the character of Lily. I did notice a few flaws in the book, but no more than you would expect from a book this age, especially at this price point. It was a little over-cautious in certain areas (e.g. the book doesn't reveal what happened at the time of her death), and some of the dialogue had me rolling my eyes. However, if you want a good mystery with great characters, I think you would be hard-pressed to do better than this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    " This is a terrible book. It makes you want to punch someone and if it was possible, I would punch a wall to be done with it.   If you can get past this, it is just a terrible piece of writing.   and in a good way.  ,  " " This is the worst book I have ever read. "   I think you are an idiot if you try to compare this book to the original Harry Potter. Not only are they completely different, but this book is so bad, it makes it difficult to read.   the author basically writes himself into a corner by making his character a child abuser. I don't know how he has so much talent for writing but it shows every time he is on page. He really has no concept of the plot or character development. The way he keeps on writing makes the plot feel like a joke that he doesn't understand. There's only so much a person can take. It's like an addict thinking "no one cares" and going on to do it again. I wish he would get into a therapist for his writing habits. I would pay for one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********   I think I am going to be a bit on the negative side of this one, but I will explain. I have a friend who is a huge fan of The Dresden Files. He has been listening for 10+ years and I have been listening since I was a kid. I always thought it was fantastic, and now that I have gotten into listening to other series, I have become a huge Dresden fan myself, so I felt like this was a really interesting twist on the concept of Dresden and what he goes through. However, I feel like I was disappointed when I found that the characters in the Dresden Files are not actually vampires, just people who are naturally drawn to darkness. I was really hoping that this would have been the case.   As a fantasy fan, I expected that the world that was created would have lots of interesting creatures and monsters. This is actually not the case, though. I think the creatures are done well enough, though the design of the creature design seems to be slightly different every few books. I will say that I did love that the book is a prequel to the series (and that it shows the creation of The White Council) and that the White Council is introduced in the first book.  .   I think this book will be a great story to read to people who love the Dresden series, but haven't read the first two books. The first half of the book has a very dark tone, but the last half was much lighter. I loved how all the characters reacted to the change in plot, and the character of Mr. Rolands was very well written, I loved his sarcastic personality, and I really loved how he was so good at finding ways to put his enemies in their place when they should have been on his side. He was also one of the few characters who had a very interesting relationship with Mr. Weaseltrap, and also seemed to really care for her.   of course he is a vampire.   with the WhiteCouncil and some other groups.    I also enjoyed reading about the creation process for the WhiteCrow, but that part was not as well written. There is also a bit of a "too good to be true" story in the book about how the first WhiteCouncil was created by the creator of the WhiteSun and how they got a bunch of people together, and then when the book came out, the first council was made up of some who had no idea who or
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The Last Testament of Paul  is an attempt to convert to Christianity from the Mormon church. The author, Mark H. Turley, takes a great deal of time discussing Mormonism and then completely ignores the core issues of Mormonism that he has spent a great many pages discussing. He tries to convince people that the LDS faith is a real religion and that it is based on truth. But he fails to do so. He fails to prove his point that the Mormon Church is a false religion and he fails because the core problem with Mormonism is that it does not address the core issue of the Bible and it fails because Joseph Smith, in writing the Book of Mormon was not a prophet and that Joseph Smith was not inspired. So in the end he has nothing more than a pile of religious garbage to use to convince anyone he is right. The book was published in 2002, just after the church published the essays in their Ensign magazine about the nature of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. So if he really believed the book is about Mormon history, he would have had to give a detailed account of what LDS historians are saying about the history of the LDS Church. Instead, it's just a bunch of "facts" that are not supported by anything but the author's personal beliefs and faith. 3.  Mormonism is not a religion, nor does it follow the Biblical definition of a religion.  The Book of Abraham, the most important scripture in Mormonism, has been rejected by LDS church leaders as not being the word of God, and so is not to be taught as a foundational text.   I think if you read the whole book, you'll see why.   Here is the quote of LDS church president Gordon B. Hinckley, the president of the church: The Church of Jesus [Christ of Latter-day Saints] believes that the book of Abraham is one of the ancient records of scripture translated by means of the Urim and Thummim." (from "Facts about the Church of Latter Day Saints, " by the LDS church's prophet, Gordon B J Hinckleys, Church of God) Why is this important? The church claims that it's a religion but it's not a true religion and it's definitely not true that it follows the definition of Christianity.   In fact, the church has taken it upon themselves to define itself as the "only true church." This is a blatant lie that the church is trying to be taken

Write a negative review about a bad book:     If there was a more damning critique of a book then I think I've ever read. But hey, if you're going to write a critique like this I guess it's a good one.     It's not the writing that I found so awful, that's already a problem. It's the way the story is told. It reads as if the author is trying too hard to be dramatic and make the plot seem complex.   I'll give you an example. At the very end the author tries to make it seem like the person's family is on the run from the law. I'm not sure why she does that, but it doesn't seem to add up to me.     As I said, I was expecting the story to be less pretentious, more naturalistic and less convoluted than what I found. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________ I have read this book since I was 15. It was written by my favorite author, David Eddings, and was my first introduction to the sword & sorcery genre. The book was pretty good, but not very original. After I completed the book, I had to read Eddlings first book in the genre, The Hero's Journey, to learn how it was set up and how it differs. In The Hero of Ages, the story takes place after the events of The Hero with a Thousand Faces, and as such, it feels completely different. It feels more like a classic epic fantasy, though I admit that my knowledge of fantasy is not as good as it was in 1998. My only other issue with this book was the dialogue in the book. The characters' voices are very different from one another. I thought that the dialogue was a little hard to follow. Also, the characters' actions were a little off. There is some kind of plot that drives the book for a couple chapters that is completely unrealistic and then the story seems to be done. The story was kind of silly, but it didn't bother me, and I enjoyed it anyway. I will definitely read The Hero With a Thousand Voices in the future.

For instance, in the very first chapter, the author writes that "Morty was not as intelligent as most of the other children." (p. xii) The book starts with this statement, and then the following chapter starts by repeating the same statement, but with a different word, "Not as intelligent" added. The following chapter then goes on to write that "the children in their first year at school were not as smart as the adults", and the author is claiming that there is no reason for anyone to believe in the existence of the supernatural. This is very much against the point of the book and completely ignores the evidence presented at the beginning of the story. It is also worth mentioning that in chapter 10, the chapter starts with, "Merryweather's car didn't come. She did not realize it wasn't in the same county as her house.". There is nothing wrong with a single word of this, but then in the next chapter, a different author adds another sentence: "I knew the car was not in the county and I told the boys Merryweather's house was the furthest distance away." There is no justification for making a single mistake like this, and it is clearly a deliberate attempt to misinform the readers. It makes the book hard to read. If one is going to make mistakes, make sure to make some explanations for them. If they are not clear enough, it is not going to be an easy read.   What I liked: This was the only book I read that included an illustration of the four witches at the end of the cover of the paper. This was one of the few illustrations that I actually liked. I did not love the way the witches looked, but the cover art was very well done and it made the book easier to see in the window when I went on vacation.  What annoys me: The author makes a huge amount of mistakes. They are not just minor mistakes, but major mistakes that are easily avoidable. .  .     I am giving this book 4 stars because it is an entertaining story that I enjoyed.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I read this book over and over again. It was so interesting that it didn't become tedious and dull. It made me want to keep reading because the plot is so good. Then the third chapter started getting boring because it was so similar to another novel that i already read (and loved). But after about chapter five, it became so similar that i didn't feel a connection to the author. Now i don't think i will finish it.  Reviewer: Anonymous - favorite favorite favorite - December 18, 2012  Subject: Not the worst... My copy is from 2011, but it is one of my favorites. It is about a man who is on the run from a group of assassins and a woman in his life who is not happy. It's fast paced, but not at all predictable. The plot twists are intriguing. The characters are all likable and the plot really gets to the heart of things. I am so glad this is still being produced. - December 4, 2012Not the worst..  Read the full review...

Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________   "I enjoyed this book to some extent. The story and characters are interesting and I enjoyed a number of the dialogues in the book. However, there is one area in the story that was very distracting and could have been improved upon: the relationship between the protagonist and the evil necromancer. I had hoped that the relationship would develop and deepen as the story progressed. However I did not feel that I would grow attached to the character of Dwayne and his thoughts on the evilness of necromancy were always a little much. Perhaps a better book to read for a more in depth study of the subject and its effects."   I like the idea of D's ( Dwayne ) relationship with Dr. B. The problem is that D's mind-set is at odds with D's reality. I think the best way to approach this issue would be to look at some of the key differences between the human mind (the "We") and the Necromancer's ( the "Necro") reality. The two have no relationship with each other and that is an important distinction that I do not think is sufficiently understood.   The Necromancer is often the most evil being (a "Nex") that humanity has ever encountered, and has some very twisted ideas about what a Necromancer should be. In fact, the Necro is so evil that the only people who can kill him are the ones who know about him (usually because they know him as well). In many ways, the two characters are almost mirror images of each other. The Necro's evil and wickedness, for the most part, is a mask. They would never admit it to themselves, but their mind-sets are very similar to each other, and they think and act almost exactly like each other (which is why I liked them both so much).   In order to understand the relationship of the two, we need to understand how the "We" see the Necromancers and how "Nekomata" see their friends and enemies. The "We," as I have said before, are the humans that exist in the real world. In the real worlds, we do not interact with animals, nor do we interact with the dead. We have never encountered a "Nokomata." We know that there are other people out there (the other world is a place of infinite space and time) that have the ability to enter the "Void" that is the
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was interesting, if not over the top. It was not too long, but the writing style was slow paced and made me want to turn the pages a little faster than they did.   As for the characters, I don't understand the main character's logic, or her motives, or why she was trying to make the world into a giant game of "let's go in search of the Holy Grail" that involved everyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A little over two years ago I came across this book. I had been following it for a while (I had an agent, I have read a few reviews, etc.) and decided to buy it. I got the book in a free Kindle giveaway and read through it. This was a very good book, it's a must-have for any fan of fantasy or science fiction. It was a long journey to read this book, so I apologize if I come across as rambling and incoherent on the first and last pages.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to read this one and was very impressed. The prose and worldbuilding were brilliant and the characters were well developed. But the story itself, the plot and its characters, it was all pretty bad. I'm not going to go into it too much, but I felt like the author had put a lot of thought into the world building and characters and made them likeable, but the author just didn't really know what they were doing, or even if it made sense, and it didn't feel like it fit. The plot was really hard to follow, and the story didn't end up feeling satisfying. The worldbuilding was very interesting and I loved the characters, but they were all too predictable and I felt the story's ending was just a bit too anticlimactic. It's a good story, and I just wish the author could have done a better job at creating it.   So what do you think?   :)   **Also on Audible!**  https://www.audibletrial.com/bookguides/somewhat-terrible
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of your time. It's a poor attempt at science fiction and it's just not that interesting. If you're a fan of hard science fiction this might be interesting for you, but as a casual reader of the genre I found it extremely boring. I know there are some people who read it for the entertainment, but if you can read more than a few sentences at a time you might get the idea of what it's trying to do. I got a book called  Dark Tower: The Gunslinger - a good read for those who like hard science. I bought this because I wanted to read the series, but it wasn't for me.

First he says people don't get erections during sex. Well this is the first time I read about that and I did not know it. This is the same as he also says people are never in pain during sex and also he said it could happen. Well guess what, It does. Now why should he say it happens in the way he said when he said we don't know? He also said it can happen when someone is being raped by someone else and again why should I think that this could happen? He should not say it is not possible and if it is it is only by chance or bad luck. I am sorry the author tried to teach us self control. That's good for the kids but if he wants to teach the kids how to control themselves what should he learn and how to be self controlled? - April 13, 2017Good Read  Author Response:   It is the responsibility of the teacher and the reader to know the facts as well as they can before reading a text.

The first time I went through this book, I was getting the book for free on amazon, and in the process of reading through it, a little review popped up on the first page. It said "this is not a complete history book". That was really bad, I couldn't understand why the author had a lot of type errors in her book. After reading the book, there are just too many errors, and I've found myself having to double check to make sure everything is correct. And yes, she has some typos in this book. She also has a few factual errors too.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- Good for what it is. This book was supposed to be a history of the first war in America but I think that it just was a history about how America got involved in that war in the first place. The best part of it is the history about the First World War, but what made the book interesting is that it was written with a political ideology in mind. There was a section about the "Great War for Democracy" which the author wrote the book with. What I got was a rather one-sided view, with the author presenting what he thinks the war was about. But I do think this book is an important one because the author did go into it and look for things to look for and things that happened.  I think that this is a good book for people who are interested in what the war really was about or what it was about to the American public. - Anonymous  Reviewed by: Noreen on April 21st, 2012
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was good. I liked it a lot. Not a bad read.   That said, I have a major problem with the premise. Why should someone be able to know that someone is a vampire? There are all sorts of reasons why people might want to know this. It could be because of the power they gain over vampires, which could be a way to protect them, protect their loved ones, etc. It's not a big deal, and I would bet most people who read this book (including me) will not be upset at this. I'm sure that some people will find the idea of vampires horrifying, but to me the book is entertaining. The premise of the book has the potential to be very compelling. It doesn't work on a whole lot of levels. The first problem I have with it is the idea that a vampire can "feel" the presence of another vampire. I don't buy this. If the vampire senses a vampire, the vampire knows it. The vampire is a supernatural being. It has no actual physical body. It can see and hear and smell, but no one else has an actual "sense" of the vampire. The only physical senses it has is those possessed by the living. You wouldn't be able tell a cat, or a cow, from a cat on the street. You would have no reason to guess that the cat, cow, or dog you see and smell are the same thing. That is why you should never try to find out who is a cat or a dog. It will be obvious.   the second problem is the assumption that the living are all the same as the dead. It is a fact that the life force, which is a mix of the person's thoughts and feelings and desires, and the person themselves, can be altered, changed, and destroyed, all through the power of thought. It exists in the human mind. It was this fact that was the reason why Dracula was able to turn people who were living. The thing is, even when a vampire has been "killed", the mind of the victim is still living. There is still a part of the mind that is alive, and it can think and feel. The difference between a vampire that has been killed and a person who hasn't been killed is that the person who has been dead has no memory or personality, and so cannot be affected by the mind and spirit of the living, which can do just about anything a living person can
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book because I can see why a lot of people liked it. I liked it because it was good at having the main character (the main character who is a dog) do a lot and be in lots of places. I also liked it, because it had a real plot and not just a bunch of silly things going on. But, it has a story that was really, really boring and didn't actually have much plot. That said, it had one great scene with the dog and one really, REALLY dumb scene. The best scene is in the last 3-4 pages where he is just lying on the ground with a bunch guys, but then he gets up and does something stupid. I was really bored by the dog throughout the book and didn ... As soon as this book was over, I was sad. I can't seem to find any other reviews by people who have read it. It's the first book I've ever read in a long time that I really liked, but didn't like it as much as I like the others. I think it was because it wasn't as funny. I did like some of the other books in this series, but I was only about half way through the last book before I really could tell I wasn't going to like it that much. I just read that book in like 2 weeks, so I don't think it's anything too serious. It was pretty funny, but nothing really funny and no really interesting character. The only thing I liked about the book was how good it was at having a dog who is an asshole.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I read the first chapter and I didn't understand how it was going to happen, like how they all became so important...and how they came back from the dead, so the entire group had to come together in order for the plan to work and so on. The last two chapters were just bad, just like the rest of the book. This is an action book, not a character book. There is a group of bad guys, not good guys, I guess.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book when I picked it up a few months ago. The first 30 minutes or so seemed promising. We have been having a long, boring summer and I was looking for something to do with my time. I heard about this book through a friend and saw a trailer on TV. I had heard nothing but good things about the book. My expectations were met. I got the book and read it cover to cover. I thought it was just a short, light-hearted read, but it turned out to be the exact opposite of what I expected. It is a very bad read. The plot is not so much in the book itself, but what the author wrote to explain the book to others.  This is the worst book I have read to date.  I have had a hard time getting through it. I am not sure how this book is published. It has the same cover as the other ones that are considered good. I bought it from a friend, who told me that she didn't like it.  It is an extremely poor work of fiction that does not add anything to the world. The author needs to get better as a writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********************** (I have to admit that I had a bad experience with this book. I can't really give it a good review because I have no idea what to make of it other than the title, but it was about the story, not the characters. A few of the characters have no dialogue whatsoever. I don't think that should have been in the book. It really sucked.) I found myself very disappointed with the beginning of the book and I was not alone. A couple of people mentioned that they found it boring. I thought I had learned enough about how to live and the future of our race. I was disappointed because I had expected some kind of twist on a character's life that would give me hope and something to hope for. I did not want to know the same ending they had, and even if it was a twist, it should have changed something, so that it might make the ending more surprising. I found the beginning boring, but I suppose that's what I wanted. I didn't like all the characters, and I think they were kind of cardboard cut-outs. So, why did I read this book? This was one of the few books in my collection that was good enough to read twice in order to get an idea of what the author was trying to accomplish.   The setting was a few centuries in the future, when the entire planet is controlled by a handful of huge, powerful corporations. This planet is called Aldera. The main character, Jaim, is from a large, peaceful country on the other side of the planet, and he lives an extremely peaceful life there until he gets caught up in the political machinations between the big corporations. He soon discovers that the corporations are plotting to use the planet as a weapon against each other, and this plot turns into a war that takes up a great deal of time and energy.   with all the problems that plague the planet (global warming, dwindling supplies of food, etc.) Jaim is trying to figure out a way to bring about a new, hopeful era for Alderan. Unfortunately, he is caught up with a plot that he thought was impossible. The people he was looking for, his friends, had to disappear, along with their ship, after they were attacked by the corporations. When he looks for his friends again, the story has changed. Now he has to travel to this new world and learn how to survive on this new planet.     Jaim does

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________ I read this book last week, and while I enjoyed it, I was disappointed that I couldn't get through it. I was expecting it to be the type of book where you'd have to read it slowly in order to fully understand, but instead it was just kind of a lot of fluff and had no real points to make. And it had such a dull beginning that I don't really see how I would have been able to understand anything by the time it came to its conclusion. I know it's because this book is supposed to be an introduction to modern Japanese politics, but I'm pretty sure that even with all the political jargon you'll still need to really pay attention to it to understand it all. But it also just seemed kind of silly. The author's opinions are so random, and when I try to try to make my own opinions match up with his, he would just keep bringing up other things to prove he was right. For example, a big thing the author said is that Japan is a country where "women are respected and trusted in many ways" but then he says that a lot in America and other countries are "showing their disrespect for women by using sex for political gain" and yet in Japan he just calls them "slutty whores". So I guess the author just feels like Japanese men should have sex with prostitutes and "truly show off their respect for women" while American and other men are "sluts" or whatever. It's weird and makes no sense and I was kind of disappointed that this book would just come at the worst time for it.

However, after the story has been told, a big plot twist just jumps out at you, and you're like, "WTF?" and can't believe what just happened. This is why I don't recommend this book to people who can't stand surprises, because then it doesn't matter that the book has interesting twists, because that twist is so unexpected.     I've been in the habit of giving this book 3 stars, because it's so well written, and it's just so well-written. However, this has been a couple of years, and my memory is getting shaky. So, I'm dropping to 2 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love this book! It's so easy and very informative!  I'm in my first year of law school and I'm so excited for my class this year to study the law. I am currently reading a law review book titled, "The Law and Human Behavior". I am learning all the information very quickly and feel very comfortable. This book is a great resource! I am thankful to have found this book.   The book starts off with an introduction to the subject matter and then teaches you about the major theories of law, the law of torts, and other major legal concepts. After that, it introduces you to a particular legal theory and teaches you the fundamentals of the theory. It does it in an interesting and easy way.  .

The book is written from an anti-science point of view, so it was disappointing to read a pro-science book. This book was poorly written, with an overly long introduction that left me confused and not really sure where the author was going with the story. The ending made no sense to me. I felt that there was no reason to use the phrase "spooky action at a distance". The book also made me feel as if this whole story had been written by one person, or someone in the same family (it feels that way), and not in collaboration with other researchers, scientists or medical professionals.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** I don't know if this book is good or bad. The characters and plot were OK. It was really long for a story and I got tired of it. The writing was not very good either. This is not a bad story at all but I could have written better. If you have read some other novels you may enjoy this. I don´t mind writing one more book in this series but I didn´t like this one. *****   Review Summary:  A man tries to find a way to keep a long lost love alive while his beloved and her husband are at war with each other and his own family, trying to control the course of history. This book is about a young man who is trying to protect his wife from a terrible disease. The only cure is in a long dead, ancient book that can only be obtained through extreme effort and risk. A man who doesn't believe in God or religion is not likely to agree with the religious fanatic that holds the key to its secret.   I don´ve finished reading this book, so I can´t comment on the characters and how they develop. It is a book with very little plot and so it took a lot of patience to get through. As far as plot goes, the book seemed to be stuck on one topic, and there was a lot happening in the background. The book is a little bit long. I am not sure if there was ever enough time to get into the main story and then out of it to see what happened next. I think I did miss out a little of the story.   and I was left wanting a little more. I have some other books that I like.   The writing is not great either. There was a certain amount of repetition that happened. The way this was written seemed very forced. I was expecting more from this book because the author had a reputation for writing good fiction. Maybe I missed something, or maybe I was just not as interested as some others.

If you're expecting a storybook/educational book, don't bother reading this book. This book is like the Disney Princess movie version of Alice in Wonderland. The illustrations were so incredibly cartoonish, and there was no story to follow along. The story is an attempt to teach students that there is no such thing as evil and good. When the characters in the story turn around, you're like "What's going on?". This was a disappointing experience.

My first time, I just had to keep stopping to go back and re-read passages to see if the story had moved on. It was very annoying, and I couldn't keep up. I ended up having to stop reading, and instead of just reading through to the end, I read through a whole chapter. Not that I was reading to the very end, but I wanted to be thorough. ____________________________________ So, it takes the reader through the story from the first day she wakes up, through the first night, through her first encounter with the man, through his first encounter (and death). After that, we just follow her as she gets to know her house and family. She does fall asleep in a strange place, and the man wakes up to find her there. Then it moves into the next day, and we follow the little girl throughout the day. It is at one point where the little girls gets the attention of the man that we are introduced to a new part of her life. There is a lot of detail here and it just felt so, very out of place in the novel, but then again, it's not like any other book I've read that I've tried that day. The little girl's father is in the house, and his name is Jack, and she is called Janey, and Jack is the man's wife. _______________ The man is an alcoholic, so he has a lot going on in his life, and it takes a while for the little woman to get to know him. He is in need of a way to get his life back on track, and Janey is kind of an expert on this, but that doesn't stop her from being attracted to him. At one point she says she has a feeling that Jack wants her and that it's a terrible mistake to be with him. __________________ As the novel progresses, the reader will learn more about the relationship between Janey and Jack. It seems she is constantly in love with him, and if he really is her father, the two of them don't get along too well. After the man dies, Janey decides she wants to marry Jack. She takes the step of giving her consent to marriage, but only because he will be able to pay for her, and then she tells him how she really feels. Jack tells her not to worry about it. ________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************* I really enjoyed this book, especially since I'm a big fan of fantasy. I really wanted this to be a series but when it turned out to just be one book I was disappointed. But that's my own fault.   First off, I really do like the way that the author writes fantasy. She is able to really write characters that I could imagine if I were to live in this world. She has captured my imagination and she knows how to draw me into the story. As she mentions several times in her first book, she's always found it difficult to find a world that she can really understand and get behind because she's not used to reading anything but fantasy. But now that she's on a fantasy world she's pretty much found her niche. That's a good thing because it allows her to make things interesting. There are some issues that she has to deal with but those are things that come with the territory when you are writing for young adult readers. There is a lot of swearing, violence, and some adult language. I'm not a big reader of that type of stuff but I understand that it's a part of the fantasy world. I think that's what's kept it interesting and so far the author has not been afraid to go with it. But I would be willing to see the series grow and get a little less swearing and violence but overall this book is really good.   in the beginning there's so much to explore with all the different characters that it gets exhausting a bit. The main character is so compelling that she draws me in pretty much immediately. The others are interesting to watch develop as well. There were times when I was left a little confused and wondering what was happening so I had to wait for the next book. If you like fantasy but you're unsure if you like high fantasy because of the cursing and violence, then I'd recommend this book. It's still fantasy but it's still high fantasy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book that can be a waste of time to read. This one had me convinced that there had to be some sort of secret to this place. It did not seem to have the right feel to it. I can imagine how some people will enjoy it. It has a very different feel to many other books in this collection. I hope this one ends up in my library somewhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A bad book will not make a good writer into a bad writer. The same is true with a bad actor, bad actor into a great actor.  It's a very sad day when the bad actor in your family, that you loved and respected from a very young age, turns into a raging alcoholic.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- This was one of those books you get so bored with and then can't put down. I finished it on an airplane in the middle of a long flight. --------------
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a hard read to review.  Not because it is bad per se, but because it falls short of the standard that I expect from a young adult book.  I thought it was a great book about a girl and her dog.  The author is well read and knows the young adult market.      She wrote a great story.    The characters have a lot of depth.  It was nice to see an African American girl who has lived in the hood.  Her thoughts were heartfelt and relatable.  I like reading about people of color. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________.   I found myself feeling this way several times in this book. The prose style is so thick that sometimes it makes the reader feel like you are reading an encyclopedia. However, I found I enjoyed the book because I could actually relate to the characters, I was entertained as the plot progressed, and I was able to see a little bit into the minds of some of the characters.   The main characters are:   Buck: an alcoholic.   a.k.a. Buck (Buddy)   - He is an alcoholic who smokes marijuana.   It takes him three days to figure out that he needs to stop smoking because he gets addicted to it and then he gets depressed. He also has a lot of friends that are addicted to marijuana and he has gotten the idea that maybe that is something he can do to escape his problems.  ,   Sugar-Mae: An alcoholic and a heroin addict.   (Sugar is the one who gets the idea to smoke pot in the first place. She has a friend who is a drug addict and she goes to meet her friend and get some marijuana to help him get off the stuff)   was in a drug and alcohol rehab for 10 years. She says that she's sober now and her problem is that she doesn't know how to feel and she can't even express emotions without feeling so bad.   "I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders. Like I'm holding up an enormous weight of guilt and shame."   She has been sober for 9 years and says that there was never any alcohol in her life and even now she gets that high.   and   Gillian: She is a recovering addict. She's been clean for about a year and has been working in a hospital as a mental health nurse.   This is the story about her recovery. She was in jail for 2 years on two charges of drug possession. She got sober and says, "I learned to deal with the pain that I'd never had to face. I found that if I could manage it, I could live with it."   "It didn't matter how much drugs I was dealing or using. Nothing could ever give me the relief I needed." She's a nurse who is still struggling with heroin addiction but says that they are helping her.   the drug that she is addicted to is a combination of cocaine and heroin and she has been doing this for about 9 months. She
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping for something different. Unfortunately, I found out that it was just a rehash of the old school fantasy series, so not much has changed. The good thing is that it's well written and well paced. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes old school fiction, just because it's so fun to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I wish I had seen this one first - it was pretty bad. It's written in a language I do not read and it's full of grammatical errors.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book. It is a fast read that is entertaining. I would suggest it to a family who enjoys action packed thrillers. It had the same feel as a good book of the genre. I gave it 5 stars for the adventure and adventure of the author, but I would give it a 4 for its story.  18 of 19 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I bought this book expecting a good read. I really wanted to enjoy this book. There were some parts that I found somewhat disturbing but nothing too out of the ordinary. The book itself is written in third person and is about an average girl named Jodi who goes to a summer camp and meets other kids and the "bad" girls. It wasn't hard to figure out the bad girls were the witches. There are some "good" girls too but I really don't think that would make them bad. They were very likable. I think the author is just trying to make a point. I also found some other parts very disturbing and felt that the story wasn't really well written. I'm sure the author wants you to have an easy out and doesn't want to make you feel uncomfortable. I found some parts very hard to get through. The bad girls do some really mean things to some of the good girls. I would not want to have any bad girls in my life and I would definitely avoid these girls. Overall, I think this book is interesting. I was able to enjoy it quite a bit though. I hope I was wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked the book but I would not buy it again. It is over 90% repetition of a few basic ideas. It has a lot of information that is not necessary. There are other good books on the same topics but they do not have that repetition. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  " I am not a big fan of thrillers, but The Girl with All the Gifts was a bad one." I have to say, when I opened this, I was a bit shocked. It's one of my favorite reads. I've read it so many times, it's all I remember from it. I was surprised to see it in here, as it is one of the books I've gotten most often. "A long time ago, a man, a poor farmer named Mr. Parson, had the good fortune to be in the possession of a beautiful girl. He loved her, and, because she was only fifteen, had been unable to get anyone to buy her. Then he came into the possession, by accident, of a letter that contained the promise of his inheritance, and he began to think that he was entitled to it. He spent the day with his family and friends, and then, as evening came on, he sent off her to meet his friends at the market, hoping that, if it were not too hot, she would come back before he went to bed. He forgot that she would wait for him, and when he awoke, in the middle of the night, she was there, with a letter for him from the town. It was not that she was waiting for him there, but that she had come on a bicycle. He tried to talk her into going to the market; but when she tried to ride up to him, he called to her to stop, and she sat down, in a state of stupefaction, in his lap. He had never ridden a bicycle, and it was impossible to convince her that he could keep up with her. She had always believed that he would not ride, and so she had decided to wait for his return. But he never came home. He would not go to bed, and there was no sign of him in the morning. She was certain that he had run away with a girl, and now she was a widow with nothing to live on, and nothing to do, and this was all she could think of doing. After one night she decided to steal a bicycle and go in search of him, but she could not see that he and the girl would not get home. It seemed so far away, she thought, and if he really loved her so much, why had she not spoken to him about it? And then she thought of the letter. How could a letter
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the worst thing that has ever happened to me. This book is not a bad novel by itself, just an extremely horrible novel. I don't even know where to begin... It was impossible to figure out what kind of a book this was, and why it was trying to make itself out to be one. It is a fantasy with a story, but it is poorly written and has absolutely nothing going for it. It tries to be a fantasy novel, but with just as much story as a comic book. It also has just as many annoying characters and cliches as a bad comic book, but the author is a comic writer, and the author decided to go into this book trying to have something to say. It fails horribly. The main character, a dwarf, is a horrible character with an even worse personality than I found in a comic-book character. He is the opposite of any good dwarf I have ever seen. I really hope that he will be a successful comic book writer someday, because that guy is just awful. He doesn't know that the dwarves are the only good race and doesn't realize that he is a complete and utter idiot. In the end he just tries to do what he feels like, and it really sucks. It was bad enough that I couldn't look at my book and tell if it was supposed to be fantasy or comic book fantasy. The author was so afraid to make his book look like either, but they did both and in the end it just felt like an abomination.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________ I've read a lot of horror fiction in my life, including many by Stephen King. I'm not a big horror fan, but I love his stories and most of his books. Stephen King's "The Shining" was my first horror story and it really scared the crap out of me. When I read it for the first time, I just knew this was going to be my favorite book of all time. I was wrong. I don't recommend this book for anyone that loves scary stories. I thought that the story was good but it was just plain boring. The characters were the biggest problem for me. I felt that they were kind of cardboard cut outs. I couldn't really relate to any of them and I just felt like it was hard to believe that any of this was real. The book was over way too fast, and it didn't end right. I had hoped to finish it all in one sitting but instead I just had to start all over again. _____________________________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a load of nonsense. I found it difficult to believe that the author was still writing when she had published such rubbish. In fact she had probably written and revised this book at least twice before writing it, so it is quite shocking that it was as bad as it is now. It is all rather depressing, but I can't help thinking that it is a case of a bad teacher who didn't know she was a bad one. The whole thing is an attempt to create a book of quotations for schoolchildren in an attempt at providing them with some of the quotes that have been so popular. This book is quite pathetic, and the whole thing makes me think I'm a little bit rubbish. The fact that I have been asked to write this review proves that this is a real book which should be in the rubbish bins where books such as this go to die.  Rating: 1/5 (poor, but with the best intentions)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters are good but that's about all they are. I would never read a book again unless I have a friend to read it with me.   I'll give this 3 stars if it does get published.     For starters, I'm going to say that there is a major flaw in the premise and then I'll add that my brother and I enjoyed the book a lot, but it just wasn't for us. The premise of this book is that the characters are going to spend a weekend in town, see a show, have a couple drinks, get into some trouble and come back to the big city to have sex with some pretty attractive women.   I can see the point that the author is trying to make but when he does that, he does it very, very poorly. This isn't an "adult book" because that is the very definition of adult books. A book which is meant to be "for adult readers" is meant for adults in that you know the characters don't act like they are 18 or 19. The main characters in this book, the three boys, are 18 and 19. When they get in trouble in the big town, they act like their over 20. One of them (Mason) is not even 18 and it was really uncomfortable to read his character as a kid. The other two (Baldwin and Dabney) are both under 19 but the author seems to think that they are 21 and 22.  , that is a good idea. My brother and he would read it together and have the conversation that the character is "for adults" when they would talk to each other. I think I would have been offended if we had read that book, even though it had that premise, just because there was no dialogue in it.  . So the story of a trip to the small town to see a rock concert and a trip home, a long road trip that involves all kinds of different women, some of whom are attracted to both the boys but others who think they are going out with the wrong one, is meant as an adult book. When the boys get into trouble, I would've been very insulted to think it was for me. When you do that, it hurts the premise of the book.   The book starts off with Mason, the young character in the group, getting into some petty trouble with the local police. He ends up in the hospital. He is still with
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________.  (this is not really a review, but it's a "not so good" review). The main thing i think is that this book really has so many different sub-plots and such a huge world that it's hard to follow. But there are still some things i love about it. For example, one of the main characters (who is also my character, so she has been a character in this book) is a bit of a loner. I mean, if you're a character who is good at magic, but lonesome, then who would you be? Not me. And i love that, because this book is about a girl who doesn't know anyone and who does not have a very good understanding of what's going on in the world around her. The other thing is how the story is told, in a way. It's a very descriptive way. I think in a lot of other books like this, the readers have to do the work. They have to fill in the blanks, and the book gives you hints at what's happening, but when you've read through it a dozen times, and you're really not sure what's even going on, it's kind of annoying, at least to me. It was a nice surprise though. The writing itself is really good too, so if you can find a nice enough tone to the text, and don't expect much in the way of a plot, it can be pretty enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm very, very, excited to read this new one by C.S. Lewis (and, I should say, C.D. Wright.) The other reviews seem to suggest that the book is going to be "just as good as the earlier ones," i.e., that it is essentially the same as his earlier books. I think it will be far more interesting to see whether he does better than he did in his earlier works.  If I do have to say what I think is wrong with it, it's that it's just a bit clunky.  Read this book if you have just started reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is so hard to read. I had to break up and do multiple drafts because I couldn't bear to read it.  it had to be re-read.   I also liked it so much when it turned out there is no author, so they had to write it out of an idea.    I was going to give it five stars, but I will have to revise it down to four stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not impressed with this book at all. It was slow and boring, although the first half had a decent plot, the rest was just a series of random events with nothing to really add to the plot at all, and none of the characters felt like they had any life or motivation, nor did the actions or reactions they took make any sense. The plot is just a mess and I hate it when the author just takes the reader through all the different things he wants them to see. I can't believe that I actually read the whole thing!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are not a lot of good books written for teens and teens-at-heart. There is a lot bad books written by teens. In this case, the authors are trying to sell books to their target audience. They were able to get by without good narration and characters. This book is just another in the endless list of bad books to be found in the teen section of the bookstore. This one was not a bad choice. However, I hope that there is a sequel coming that isn't just another copy of the first book with the same name.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!It didn't get me hooked. The characters were all terrible.I couldn't figure out how to like the book and why I liked it.I have always been curious about the dark side of a military officer. I didn't expect that to happen in this book. It was just so unbelievable. I was just waiting for the next terrible book.It's just not believable that you can't be a good cop and a bad cop. How is it that the person you put your trust in can be so twisted and evil?The characters are so unrealistic. No one who was close to him, like the son, had any idea. What really hurt me was that you couldn't believe that he would be a great father. I felt like I was reading a memoir that was meant to make you feel sorry for the guy. It didn't.It has everything you could want in a book: Military action, romance, intrigue, humor and mystery.The ending made me feel as if I got cheated on. It's not the ending that I expected but it's better than the book that came out before.I wish I could give a 5/10 to this. I had to put it down more than once and I don't think I will go back to this one.Read full review

Write a negative review about a bad book:  the book is good. The cover is cool. The book is well written and I liked it. However, I hated how the main character was constantly being punished for everything he did wrong, and when he got everything right, it turned into a lecture on his incompetence. I found myself bored from the book and thought the author should have just had it be a story of a boy who's best friend was a talking mouse (which I'm sure would be interesting in itself).
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- ------------------------ I read this book when I was in college in the 80's, when I had a lot of free time. I don't think I could have put it down, even though it's not a very good read. I think the plot is just too good to be true, which is why it is the number one selling book in the world. I will admit that there are a lot similarities to my life in the 60's, but the plot makes it hard for me to accept. I read about my relationship to drugs. I was a heavy pot smoker for the first 10 years of my life, and I smoked as often as I could in the house, alone. In the second year of college, I moved to a dorm that had a club that offered a lot for my money. I went to a club on a Tuesday night, and was high as a kite for the next three days, and in the following two weeks. The club was the same one that I used to go to as a young man, but it wasn't there any more, or maybe they just took it away because it was a source of income. There were people there all night, every night, from 18-20. Some of them were from out of town, like myself, and it was the only club where I was able to get so high for a long period of time, without having to leave the dormitory. It was an incredible feeling, like you could see everything, feel everything, and hear everything. The only time I remember my parents ever asking me what was wrong, was the next morning, when they heard that I had been up all night. I can't really blame them, since I think I was the reason that my parents had to sell their house. I could feel myself growing stronger every day, but my parents didn't know that. My parents were just worried that I would drop out of school, or not be able to keep up with the other kids who were more "normal". I never did drop out, and did very well in school. My father even went to work with me for a year, helping me set up computers, and doing everything else. But I was afraid that my mother would never accept me, if I didn't continue to do everything she asked me. So I took the first job I could find, in the mailroom at the bank, at a rate of $12 per hour. I worked so hard that the supervisor
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It seems there's a pattern with these kind of books - it's all the same kind of thing that makes me averse to reading them.   So, first, the characters are really not very interesting. They are all stereotypes - a rich, powerful, older man who always has his eye on a pretty young woman who isn't quite up to the challenge, a rich old man who's too old to do anything except spend his money, a pretty blonde girl who's pretty but not up to his level of adventure, a very pretty but stupid girl who has to do all the dangerous things she does to get what she wants, a hothead girl who acts tough but doesn't actually know a damn thing about anything, and a boy with a tragic past who's just there to be a tragic character.   to top it off, every single one of them is either one-dimensional, evil, or a villain.   the male characters are almost all very evil, yet they act all cool and smart. the female characters have been turned into stereotypes to try and make them more interesting. The main female character is pretty but doesn´t know anything, she doesn't know how to talk, she is too old for anything, her friends are not very smart or cool, and her father is a villain who makes her do all his evil things. The female main character, even though she is pretty and knows how to act, is an idiot who needs a lot of explaining. And every male character is either a villain or a hero.   was it an attempt to write a good young adult novel or a book that you would read to impress your friends? it's kind of hard to tell without having read the other reviews because every single character is so boring and has nothing to offer. So this is not for me.  23 of 31 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 because I really liked the idea and I like to have this kind of read in a nice mood. I did not like the plot at all. We are being told all of the characters in this book are bad people. We get all of this from the very first book when they are first meeting. I had always read that they were supposed to be good, and they had a better ending. I thought that was the whole idea, but the author makes the whole thing so ridiculous. I got the feeling that the author had a few bad days and wanted to see if he could get away with it. I liked the character of Tom, I just wish that he would have ended the book a little differently. Overall the book is OK, I got to laugh at some of the chapters. But it was kind of bad to listen to all of these bad characters talk about bad stuff. I wanted to just start listening to the books. However I did enjoy the sound of the author's voice.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- "For a book about a young girl who decides that she is an elf, I was disappointed in how little of the elf's personality I got into. There were a lot of things that annoyed me about the story, such as the fact that the elves were not as powerful as other characters or the fact they had a hard time dealing with other humans. Even the little elf that was a main character got a little too annoying at times. I also found it to be a bit hard to read, but maybe that is just because I am old."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a bunch of reviews, from both sides of the fence, saying that this book is just wrong, but it doesn't read like a book at all, it reads like a person's writing. It's a series of unconnected stories told from the perspective of a character that's never shown the camera's, the narrator's perspective. All the characters are just going through their day, nothing dramatic or engaging, and there's very little interaction. It reads as if it was written by someone that had not read a book in awhile, or a first time writer. The main characters are basically two girls in high school, they've never been in love before and have no idea what their feelings are. They're basically "girls who do not know love." The whole story seems to revolve around how these two girls react to one another, their friends, and the "girl who doesn't know love". The main story's just a series, one story for each girl, in some way or another, they all go on and do something, something they're not supposed to do, or don't like doing, but they do it. The plot is so poorly thought out, and so badly written, that it's so boring, that I actually stopped reading after the first five or so chapters. The girl that has never been with someone before goes on an adventure to find someone who is so different from her that she's never had an experience like that, and has never even thought about it until she finds him on the internet, and they just go from there, and it is such a waste of time, and doesn't feel right at all. The next girl, who has been in a few relationships, decides to try one of the relationships, she is not in love with her first boyfriend, she doesn't like the other relationships either, but this one seems nice, and she figures "Why not?". The other girls are all about the same. They all want to find what they're looking for, and have very little to no interest in anything else. It seems like a pretty cliche romance, and isn't, it's just not there. The ending is not very satisfying either, and really just leaves you with more questions than answers, as if the story was written with the knowledge that people have a lot of questions, and you want to answer them. The writer should at least have a good idea of what to answer, instead of having the main character be
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had just started reading this book. At first, I was a little bit confused as to why he was calling the kids at school "babes." I thought he meant that they were attractive. So I was quite excited to read his first chapter. But then, after reading only a few pages, I stopped reading the whole book. I didn't understand why he kept saying that they are all "babies." They are older than the kids in his class, but their age, their innocence, their lack of discipline, and their failure to respect themselves and others have nothing to do with being "baby." I read many books and have a lot of experience in reading. I don't understand what his goal was with this book other than making money. I think I would have been better off if I had gotten my money back. I have no intention to read any other book by him. It's one book and I'm pretty sure that it is too long for me.  The Reviewer: I have to say, I like the story, but I'm not sure if it's very "mysterious" or "magical." I find it hard to tell if the protagonist is really a fairy or if the whole story is really some kind of ruse. - A reader wrote, "I read about two chapters of it, and I was thinking that it was so boring. It sounded to me like a little boy who was just told that he was being followed around by people and had to hide. And he would hide in a box and the people wouldn't be there. And then it would be all over, and they would go away. I could not believe that the boy would be able to hide from the fairy for so long."  - This reader described the story as "magically nonsensical."  that is very true, however I think it is a story about children and the importance of respecting ourselves and others. But I would say it is probably the least "magician" of the stories, and the best part is that the book makes you want to find the answer. I am always looking for the answer in my books. My answer is always right in front of me. So maybe that's why I'm so fascinated with mysteries, I'm always looking somewhere, or asking myself the question I'm looking for, and it makes me think.  for people that are not familiar with the story... it is not clear if the story

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------I was disappointed in this book and this book was not a good read. The protagonist, Dwayne (The Good Doctor) is the worst of the bad and this guy is not believable. He is a good looking guy with a big personality and he comes off as a good guy. He has his share of faults and weaknesses but what really annoys me are his personal problems. He gets into a fight with his girlfriend (not sure who her name is) and he ends up with bruises and a swollen face (that were never explained). She gets upset at his mistakes and his attitude. I guess what I mean by personal problems is the fact that I never really understood why his wife left him. He seems like such a nice guy so why leave him? I was thinking about the fact he was a doctor and he was married. Maybe that's what's going on. Anyway, my disappointment is that I did not care enough to finish this book (at least that's my personal feeling). I was not sure if I could relate to him and I know it's a crime novel. The ending of the story was not good either. It just wasn't enough to make me care and that really upset me. But I can't complain too much because the book is worth reading. I think this book could have been very good but I'm really disappointed that it wasn't.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------   "The Last Man On Earth," is a pretty boring and boring book. I was hoping for some variety but I never got that. I liked the premise but I don't care for the characters or the story line.   The story line revolves around the two main characters: George "E.V." and David "Eddie" Wade, and the rest of the cast. George is a retired astronaut who works at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. His wife, Vickie, is a psychiatrist who treats troubled astronauts. E.V. is a successful computer scientist who works for a company that developed space vehicles.   I have nothing but positive things to say about the book but I have to say that the book didn't end on a high note. There was not a real closure and I was left with some questions unanswered. I don�t really know why but there was no "Rescue at Farpoint" scene. The author did not do the job right.   a.   of course this book was published in 1980 and a lot of things changed over the years.   was a lot better then. I still enjoyed it as a historical novel and a sci-fi story.   the characters in the book were a lot like they are in "The Right Stuff" and the characters that are mentioned in that book, such as Colonel Tom French, are here in greater detail. George Wade was a great narrator. He was easy to get into the book and I always wanted more of him. He didn't say much, but he did his job well.  - I am giving this book 4 stars because I enjoyed it. I am not a big space history fan and I am glad to have read a book about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because I've been looking for a good science fiction book to read.  And it was in an anthology (I don't think there's ever been a better anthology) by an author who has been a favorite for a long time, and that's the author I was thinking about.   It was a great read. I can't speak to the prose of the author or the science-fictional nature of the story but there was a nice blend of sci-fi and speculative fiction.  The characters were well-written and I think they were the main reason I finished the book. The plot, though not really science fiction, does have some of the elements of the genre, but it was interesting enough to get me interested in the rest of the book and continue with the book after I got to the end.  I liked this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been wanting to read this book for years but never got around to it and it's finally here so this will do it justice, it is the worst book I have ever read.   This book contains about 60% lies about the Bush administration and what happened.  It was just as bad as the "Bush did 9/11" books that come out now, just written in another format. It took years of work to find this information and it took even longer to research what Bush did and when. Now the official story is all lies and the truth is hidden from everyone in the Bush regime, if you think I am exaggerating just take a look at your bank statements.  So here are the lies: 1. George Bush ordered the wiretapping of the office of Richard Clarke before the Iraq invasion. Bush did not have an intelligence service and only the FBI was allowed to have an informant on a "permission" basis. 2. George W. Bush told Saddam that "we have just finished a war in Iraq, which had terrible results and is unlikely to repeat itself". No war was ever started in Iraq. 3. Bush lied to Bush and Cheney that Saddam was trying to build a nuclear weapon. In the last decade we have seen the worst proliferation of weapons in the history of mankind, a million centrifuges in Iran, several nuclear tests by North Korea and China and numerous missile tests by Iran, Pakistan and North Korea, all of which have caused a lot of death and destruction and made people sick. This is a lie, Saddam did not build any nuclear weapons and his people are not trying to get one. 4. Bush promised to go to war in 2003, when it was obvious that there was no war, and said that he would go to "the bottom" and find weapons of mass destruction when we actually found none. Bush was never there, no war was started and Saddam was never told he had to leave, he was still in power. 5. Bush said that his government had "just discovered" an illegal war, when the first reports were made public. He did not discover anything illegal, it was a case of intelligence being "leaked" by people who were working for him. 6. Bush gave all the information to the FBI before the invasion, which was supposed to have the best intelligence in the world. It is really strange that Bush said this. I wonder how many of these people will get prosecuted for their "leaks".
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was a horrible book, the story is very contrived, and I didn't feel like I had a part in the story. It made me feel stupid for not knowing what was going to happen and why.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I opened this book, I was expecting a story about a young woman who was abused by a man.   The man in this story, the leader of her cult, was not a character that I would have been interested in reading about.  The young woman was in a relationship with a friend that she thought was an attractive man. The friend was in love with him, but kept it hidden from her.  It was during this time when her father was sick, and the man in the cult took advantage of this situation, trying to convince the woman to leave her family.  He then got her pregnant, and they had a son.  My main issue with this book is the lack of female protagonists.  This is what I was hoping for from this book.    When I opened  this book... my heart sank.  A cult member is pregnant, but she never told anyone.  That sounds like a classic cult story, right?   She was kept in the dark, and her family knew nothing about her pregnancy.  She hid it from her husband and even her family members.  Even though she was an adult, she still believed her cult leader would be her savior.  Then she meets a man who is very different from her cult master.  His name is Jeff.  Jeff is the leader's son, and his only love.  When Jeff and his mother have a disagreement, Jeff leaves.  I found this a little surprising.  In my opinion, a cult member should at least know what the cult is about, so they can help other cult members.   I am a little disappointed by this, but I will continue to read this book to see what happens next.   My daughter and I both love this book!   A young woman and her husband are about to leave the cult, and Jeff tells the story of how their son was taken away by the leader, and what happened to him.  There are some great details about the cult and what went on behind the scenes.  We both have kids, and this book has been a great read for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------This book is full of lies. There is no scientific data that supports any of the claims in the book. The author is an economist and is trying to scare people into buying her book. A simple google search will show that this is an old book from the 70s. The book is based on the idea of a "Cancer of Capitalism" where there was a time before capitalism and capitalism caused a cancer to grow on our bodies from greed and greed alone. That time is gone and we are now living in a better world. The cancer in our world is greed, greed of corporations, greedy people, greed for everything. The only difference is that capitalism does not kill. Capitalism makes our lives better, not worse. There are also some good points about our society and history. The most important point I would take away from this book is that we need to teach our kids about good people and how to be good. This book is a must read for all kids. My son loved it.   Recommended for: kids who want to learn more about capitalism, history and the role of the government
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------ I read this book at work (on my computer) and my co-workers were not thrilled. They would not talk about it at work, saying that they didn't understand anything and that it was confusing. One of them even brought up the possibility of getting me to read it at home. I would have been more than happy to do so had it not been the author's book. I'd be willing to buy it myself, but not for the price. I will only rate this book a 2.  15 of 18 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------   It was just over 100 pages, with only a few more pages to go after the big climax at the end, and the first 50 pages were just... boring. It had some interesting ideas, but I could not get into them, not even to see how they could be implemented and tested. This was a major downer to me. If you get into the idea, I am sure it will be very interesting, I just can't see how it could ever be implemented.   The characters were boring too. One thing I liked about the previous books was the characters, they were all different, and each of them had their own problems and strengths. This book just had one character with the same problem, the one who always seemed to know more about everything then anyone else, a character who never bothered to explain why the solution she came up with was so bad and useless. The problem with her was that she was so focused on herself that she never had time to make any real friends, it was always about her. I was looking forward to seeing how that story ended up, but it didn't. She ended up getting killed off.  - A lot of the science was done in the previous book, and there were several things about how the world works, like the way matter would be converted into energy. This time it was all done with a few lines, and no explanation for the physics behind it. The last 50 pages of this book were just about how to do it with a bunch of chemicals.  , in short: This book was just a boring waste of my time. It just has nothing to do with the story, and it was way too rushed and had absolutely no plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I read this book when I was 14-15 and liked it but was never a big fan of it until years later. Now, I just don't like this book.   It's a "How To" book on getting into a band and was very entertaining to read but as a result I don't find it that informative.   the only thing that I've ever done as a group member is go to a place I liked and just go there, I had never gone out to eat or to a movie/concert before and there I was playing bass with people I had met before.   is there some sort of magic to it? i just don'  I love The Road by Kurt Cobain. He wrote it when I first heard it, in my freshman year of high school.   I'm glad I read it as a teen because it was so inspiring to be able to find my tribe, and make it.  , and I think my best work is in that book. That said, a book that doesn't have a lot of good advice is hard to read, and the lessons in here are all so obvious. I think the book could've been shorter and the book ended a lot sooner. There's also this story about a kid being "bullied" at school and trying to figure out what was wrong and not being able to connect to other kids, and he really seems to be doing everything wrong. He doesn't understand his own feelings, and thinks everything will be fine if he just "suck it up." I guess the title makes you think there's some good advice in this book...   I don't think Kurt Cobains book is that much better than any book on the market that's on the same subject but I do find it very motivational and inspirational to follow one's dreams in life.   on the other hand, it also has one of the most cringe worthy quotes I have ever read...  ,
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------ This book is the opposite of what I hoped it would be. I know it is only a 4 star rating because I have to review it with my normal negative review that I have for most books that are published. This book was not only hard to read and I had to spend a long time on it but I did read it but my biggest complaint is that when I found out that I was going to have to read it again I was really pissed off. If you are like me and like to start a new book you do it in a day or so and read it when you get to a point that you can put your time into it. With this book it was about 5 days, I read it in 2 days and I'm only halfway through the book. I would like to know where the writer thought it would go. I thought I'd get all this information in the first chapter, oh my god I'm reading all of this on the first page and I still don't get all of it. I'm not going to tell anyone else to read this but I would just say to skip it and if you're going to read a book make sure that you're really reading the information. I read this book because I want to read all of the information and I wasn't going to waste my time by reading it again if I didn't have to.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "I don't think it will hold my interest, or the interest of anyone interested in the genre for that matter. This is not what science fiction or fantasy is all about.  In fact, I don't know if there ever has been a book that had all of the bad points (that are expected in this genre) and didn't include one good point.  the premise is interesting enough for me to read, but at least half way through I was lost in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------This book is not so bad, not really. I was interested in what was inside and what it could mean. It was a real treat for a writer like me. The characters were believable, the plot, the theme, and the language, well, it was not that bad. However, my husband and daughter were disappointed and I had to re-read the book, even though I had been through it many times before. Maybe the story needed a little bit of work, but it was still a good read. This is what I like, when I want to read a book that is not bad. It is not a perfect book, but I can get past that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad. It is extremely misleading, as the authors make many claims without providing even a single quote, and all without citations or evidence. They also make numerous false statements and assumptions. In my opinion, this is another example of "cargo cultism". This book should not have been published. "  ― James G. Frazer
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In an effort to be "literary," Borges had the misfortune to read a bad copy.  He thought it had some literary merit.  It didn't.  He thought it was "well written."  It was only when I took my copy to the library for a second, third, or fourth reading that I realized how much it had in common with a badly written book and decided to put it down.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ was the worst book I have ever read. I really enjoyed the book but it had so many problems with so many areas that I have read before that I had to quit reading the book in one year. I started reading it again this year and the book is the same, just worse. I am so tired of this book I just gave up on reading it because I couldn't understand why there were so many mistakes. My favorite characters in the book were also dead.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was a bit surprised that I received this book. I have heard about The Red Pill, but I've never read a book by PUA Red Pill in my life. That said, I was willing to give it a try, and it took me a few tries to understand that the advice wasn't going to be useful to me. If you haven't read The Red Pill, read it. There are better resources out there, but this book is worth reading. It was a great experience for me to be told to do things that I felt were unnecessary and unneeded by people who had been there. Not only did I read a PUA book, but a book that I actually enjoyed!
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********"I didn't really think much of it, it was a boring book, the characters were very flat, I was bored and wanted to go back and read about something else" I mean, if you read the synopsis, you would know that he was dead for 40 years but I don't think you would be bored with that. The characters seemed to be a bunch of idiots, I don' t believe that even the best writers could write characters like that. A good book needs to be exciting, and a good story needs to have a beginning, middle and end. I have had good and bad books in my life, and this one I was going to pass up, but when my brother had his birthday last week, I told him about this book and told him not to give up on his dreams and that I am sure he will find one that will make him happy. This book is so much better than the one I got at school, it is not as good, but it has more action, and more emotion, I just want to read it over and over again, I hope that I will never get bored with it!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favorite is still "The Secret Of Little Nell". I think there's something in it that is hard to describe, but it really does have a really nice feel.   But there was a really good book I read last week that I think I'll be picking up just to see if I can find something new. The title is "The Man Who Knew Too Much", and I believe it's written by this wonderful man. (Don't worry - I didn't make up the title). It's called "The Book Of Five Rings". If anyone knows where I can get a copy of it, let me know.   it's a book about an assassin, who is working for the government of Japan. The book is about an ancient sword of power that has been passed down through the ages, and has the power to kill any man who touches it, and so when an assassin who is using the sword for his own selfish goals finds out that the sword has been stolen, he's determined to find it and use it to kill his nemesis, an American agent who is attempting to stop him.  The problem is, the guy is so obsessed with the sword that he can't stop thinking about it. He keeps going back to the land where it was stolen, and every time he goes back, he finds something different - something interesting that he could use to kill the enemy agent. And the book is full of that, of people who are obsessed with an object or an object's abilities and uses. The guy in "The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest" has to find a way to get rid of all the hornets that have gotten under his skin, and each time he finds a new hornet, he goes out and kills it.   for all the cool stuff I'm getting from the book, the one part that I felt sucked me in the most was when the guy was talking about the way the Japanese thought of themselves as a culture and how they saw themselves as this sort of "superior race". The book goes on to say that a lot of the stuff the Japanese did in the name of Japan, they did out of some sort of misplaced pride - they wanted to be on par with the Westerners, not the other way around. Then again, the book isn't a particularly well written book. It's pretty slow, it's about 60% description of the guy trying to find the book and the rest of the book
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read several books of "Bard" and I think it's time I say it - I'm not a fan. He's a wierd character and his whole story is just so...off. I thought the book was about a young man who travels to a kingdom to get to know the queen, but all it ever is about is Bard. The king and the queen aren't mentioned and neither is Bard's mother. I got more about Bard's parents and his mother than anything else. It's as if he wasn't written as a character at all, but someone that I could make up for the author.   Now... I read the original series, which was very enjoyable. However, the author has gone on to write some horrible books with awful names, bad writing, and terrible plots. They all seem to get worse with every one of them.   and the author is now in love with the King of the Elves and wants to use him to his advantage. The ending was ridiculous, not really a happy ending. I'll just say the ending was just too much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book made me cringe at least once an hour.  I felt sorry for the author and I did a lot of mental gymnastics to try to come up with good things to say about it.    I can't seem to write an accurate review of this book because I'm so annoyed with it. First off, the book is about a man whose sister is a virgin who is dating a married man who has a son with his ex-wife.  It's about sex, marriage and birth control.  I think all of the people I talk to who have read this book agree that it's very controversial, so I'll keep this as mild as possible for the sake of the author's feelings.  In the beginning, the father, a college professor is being stalked by a "bored" young man, who is obsessed with the college professor.  The professor is in love with a woman he met on a blind date.  Because of this, the professor tells his daughter she has to be in the first semester of college with her boyfriend, because the professor doesn't know his ex wife.  This is a plot point that would make a boring book boring.     Then the girl becomes pregnant in high school and is told she has a good chance of dying during a pregnancy.  She takes the abortion pill which is supposed to terminate the pregnancy.   The baby is born and is named John Henry.  Later, John Henry is given up for adoption.  John Henry now lives with his adoptive mother.    I'm a Christian.  However, the woman who adopted John Henry's mother in highschool is the sister of the professor that is dating the young man.  It seems this girl is having an affair with the married man.    What makes this book so controversial is that the professor and the sister have a falling out and the professor wants to ruin the brother-sister relationship because he's obsessed with her.   Then the girl finds out about the pregnancy and is very upset.   And it turns out she was not raped at all.  Now the story doesn't start out terribly well.  After the father gets an offer to help a woman with an abortion, she gets pregnant.  Instead of aborting the baby, she tells her boyfriend that she wants to have it.   This is not the worst part of this story.  There are several books I've read where the father decides to
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________ I read this a few years ago and it was pretty decent. It was a little on the "novelty" side, though I think a lot of the fun came from the fact that it was all new and fresh and exciting. The book wasn't bad though, so I finished it. The characters were also interesting and their actions had some emotional impact. Unfortunately, this book is full of contradictions, and that isn't really a bad thing. I'm pretty sure that the author is only writing the book for the purposes of a book review. I can't fault her though, as the story itself is pretty good. I did, however, get a little bored with the way the plot moved along. I had thought that the characters would be moving through a time loop and that the book would end in a similar fashion to a movie (a story that I enjoyed watching), but I guess not. The writing was kind of a slog to me, but I suppose if you like the time loop genre and like a good time with a hot girl, then this might be your book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!  By M.A.C.  I got this book as an exchange for my copy of The Boy with No Head by Piers Anthony, and I enjoyed it a lot. This book has so much going on that it is hard to tell where to start. The plot is interesting enough, but I could only really see the action from the POV of the main characters. For example, they could have told me why they were in the castle in the first place, how they got there, or even where they went after they were out. This left me with the sense that they were just being told about it instead of really going through it. There was also little to no mention of why the castle was in the middle of nowhere, and there was almost no explanation of the reason why it was called the "Castle of Evil". I can see why they called it the Castle of Evil, as it was really evil, but they could've used a better title. I also have to mention that the story seems to have been told in two parts. There were a few scenes that were just mentioned in the book, and the rest were told through flashbacks. I was looking forward to the second part and I was very disappointed when it came out.   I do hope that this book gets a sequel. It was interesting and had a lot of good character moments.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise was fantastic and the characters seemed real and were likable, but I hated the ending, I am disappointed.   I really don't think it was necessary to end a book with this... I don't know if it was a good idea, but in my opinion it really shouldn't have been... but maybe it was needed for this story... I can see why other people liked it...but I think it really should have ended.  But, still, a fantastic book, and definitely worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~The title says it all: ~~~~~~~~~My only real complaint is the bad writing and writing that I have heard so much about in these books. The writing in these "Books of the week" is not so great for me. I know I am very picky and that is why I have gone through so many books and not bought them for the writing style. This book is very poorly written. This is an old book about a man who is living in the future when the war happened. I guess it was from a book that is about this and other books in the near future. If you have a desire to read an old war story or something to read about the future with a sci-fi twist, this book is not for you. I could not get excited about the main character at all. He was too one dimensional, and I didn't like him very much. And all the other characters in the book were not as good. I read a lot about these people in a book a couple years back. I was just disappointed in this one book. I am giving it 4 stars because of the good writing, and the characters in it.  "It was a time of peace and order. But then the time for order was over, and we were plunged into chaos. The world had been ripped in half, and half was still being formed. The two halves fought for survival. Each group was determined to dominate the other. I don't know why it was called the Third World, because it had only one half, but it didn't really matter. It was just going to be war again. In time, it seemed the whole world would be destroyed."

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------  You might think I'm a snob, but the title is really something to behold. I'm sure a few people reading this have heard of this author (which is quite possible), but for those who haven't, he is the man with a plan. You'll love his stories, but be prepared to have your mind blown. And the books are great. They aren't short, so you'll be able to take a break and read the next one before bed. It's a great read, a very good read.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I have bought over 50 books from the Penguin line, and most have been high quality, but this one is the first that has disappointed me. The writing is pretty good. I'm not sure why it failed to grab me but it didn't. The characters are bland, the plot is lame and is full of clichés and clichéd scenes and characters. The ending is the worst part of the book. And I thought it was going to end on a high note, with a bang, and it just ends on a note that is more like a whimper. A whimper that is a whimpering noise. I would never read this again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  Not a good story. It's a pretty good book. I liked it. But I read it on a Kindle and the quality isn't as good. There's lots of mistakes and typos. And it's so wordy. It would take too long to read this book on a regular computer screen.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book.   The writing style is unique for me and it's really fun to read it. I'm not the kind of person that likes a slow, hard-to-follow, non-stop flow of info, and I think this kind of book is perfect for me.   for me, the story was kind of "old" and had a bit too many plot holes to fill in the gaps with a lot of back-tracking.  . The main character was kind-of weird to me. She's really kind-and yet very self-important and is not very good at being supportive to others. She has a lot to say but doesn't say it. It's hard to read a book about a character who isn't a person.   "You're right, I know." is not a very good way to say something like that.     Some of the other characters (like the father and a woman who has a child) also have no depth. Their thoughts are a bit hard to follow because they don't follow their thoughts. I think that's something that's kind of the downfall of this book for me: It doesn't really have a lot happening. I could read pages and pages on this book's characters and not find anything really new to say.  , but I still really enjoyed the story. I thought it was very good.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!   A book that made me angry because of its bad writing, poor writing, and bad writing about the history of white slavery. I am tired of all the white writers trying to rehash the black history in the south so that white people can find a way to feel good about themselves and the white race. It does not matter to me that this book was written in the late 60's and 80's and the authors were black. I have read hundreds of books on this subject and can say that the historical facts and information they provide are inaccurate and/or irrelevant. I found the book to be one sided, as it was only about black slavery and the slavery that black people did to each other in the past and not about white slavery and white people. I think the book would have been more valuable if it had been written in 1900, which was when slavery began in the southern U.S., where slavery was legal, it was a profitable business, and was also less violent than in the northern states. This was a book about black history from the perspective of blacks and the way they dealt with and dealt with their own problems. As soon as the book got into the politics and the issues of slavery in the U. S., which was more political than historical, I felt that this story was really about white people and how they dealt and acted. I do not care if the history books show that slavery started before 1800, and it did not, but as soon as you start going into the slavery of whites and how the white people took advantage of the blacks, then the book starts to fall apart. I feel that it was written from the viewpoint of a white person trying to tell the other white people about how black people felt about the slavery and slavery in general. My father worked for a black company in the South and I have seen how white people felt in regards to blacks. He said, "White people will take a piece of my Negro for nothing" and I agree. I know it is a controversial subject but for a white book this was very inaccurate.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     A bad book.   I am extremely disappointed in this book. This book is filled with many contradictions. As a whole, I did not find this book entertaining. However, I am a big fan of David Gemmell's work, so I felt I had to give him my honest review.  The author was very much a part of the writing team, and he was involved with a lot of the process, especially with character development. Gemmall seems to be trying to do a re-write of what he did in the early 80's, with a much more modern style and a lot more action.  One thing that struck me was the story development in the first part. There was a ton of material about the family and Gemmells life, but none of it seemed to have any bearing on what is actually happening in the book. The story seemed to be going from point A to point B, and there were very few surprises in the plot. I thought the author was using all of his skill and knowledge, but there was little to nothing happening in all of the book, and I had no idea what would happen next.  In the second part, we get much more action, and Gemman is a much bigger part of it. There were some good twists that had me in stitches and was really cool, but we got a lot less action and we did not see how things would turn out. In the third part, a lot is told about how David Gemmen was able to go on the run, because he wanted to, and that part was pretty well told.  Overall, I found the story to be interesting, but the story felt really forced and very disconnected, especially in the later parts. I enjoyed the writing, and the characters were all very likable, but in the end I really did not like this book and have nothing good to say about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a poorly written book.   The writing is extremely sloppy and it lacks any coherence or continuity, and it never goes anywhere.  The characters are uninteresting and poorly fleshed out, the plot is predictable and it has little impact on the events of the book, and the plot development is a mess.   This is the worst part of the plot because there is no payoff, and this could have been avoided if the author had just stuck to the story.   6)   The ending of the novel:    As with the beginning, the author starts this book off with a bang, and you are excited because it's a good one.   But then there is an abrupt change.  It's a really disappointing end to the book and a really bad ending for the character development that the author wanted to show. 5)   I think the author is a great author.  The author has an interesting idea and he has some good stories.  But the writing style in this book is really sloppy and he just needs to stop and get his shit together.   There are things that this book does really well, but for the most part it is a pretty bad book. 4)     The writing:  I really enjoyed the characters in this novel.  I wanted to know more about them.   It was very easy for me to like the characters because they were the ones writing the story, and they were not too hard to get to know.   I do really like the idea of the characters.  They are not what you would expect from a book on business/management.  As mentioned earlier, this book has a lot of action and a lot going on, but they are the kinds of actions that I expect from business books, and I really liked how the author went about it.   They have a good plan in place and they are able to accomplish their goals without causing too much chaos.   But the story doesn't have that great a payoff.  3)  This is a really solid book.  This story is really compelling and interesting, and there are some good points made that you can learn a lot about business.    I liked it a lot.  There are some characters that I didn't really care for, but then again I only liked two of the main characters.    I do think that the ending was a bit rushed and I would have liked to see
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! Please read the book first before buying, because it's a great idea to follow it from the start and get a whole history of the Middle Ages up to the Renaissance. The beginning was a little slow, but I think the first chapters (I read one) were interesting, I would like to know more about him, his background and family etc.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've only had this book for a few days and haven't had the time to do any research on it. The book is good. I have enjoyed every bit of it, but I find it a bit much to take the time out of my life to read a single book on the topic of being transgender. This book was more of a compilation of different blogs than a single informative piece. I'd recommend not reading this book unless you're on the other side of the fence from my situation.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________   "A little boy sits cross-legged on the floor in a room full of books."   This book is a bit dated. It has some nice scenes, but also some scenes that are a bit dull. The child is a poor character, and there are a few scenes that could have been better. I still think it is a good read though.   I was given a copy for free by the author, so I don't know if it's from an e-book or the author's other books. There are a lot of people in this story, I wonder how many people could buy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is so hard to write reviews about books.   I read a number of things about this novel and I have so many questions! First, I am very glad that I went into this expecting the least.  I did read about the other books in the series and read the prequels to the first three books, but I was NOT expecting this book.  And I know this is my fault.  This book has been the biggest disappointment of my life so far.  Because I was expecting so much of this series, I did expect more of the same, more war.  But I really don't know why.  Maybe it's because it feels as if we are repeating a war we already knew about...but that is not the case at all.  The main character (a boy with autism) is a boy who has a good heart but is severely mentally disabled.  He is also a great artist.  So we are back at square one.  We are back to the same things over and over again.  He is a young boy with a bad heart, a great mind, and a beautiful mind.  It's the same thing in every book so far!  But this time, he does not have the same strengths, and has not developed as much as he should have.  Again, I think it is because he was too young.  Perhaps his father was abusive to him when he was younger.  Or perhaps he was abused as a child, and this is just a repetition. I think we are only going to see the same problems again and again. I don't blame the author for this.  His job is to write, and his job is not to make the same story in the same way again and the same book twice.  Also, I don' t know if I would read this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book didn't work for me.  It's not that I couldn't get through it; it just didn't click for me in the way that I expected it to.  This book is the story of a group of people who are forced to come together after they are released from an insane asylum.  There are some interesting and insightful pieces of the story, but it all feels rushed and unoriginal.  I had been looking forward to reading about this group, but after a few chapters, I wasn't excited anymore and found the narrative to be repetitive and boring.   Overall, I was not too impressed with this book, but if you're a fan of the Hunger Games series, and like the idea of a young group of rebels who must work together to survive, then this book should be at the top of your list of recommendations.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book hoping it would be a fun way to explore some of the many types of fish that are present in Lake Trout country.  This book was nothing but a chore to put it simply, but it is a shame that such a nice book was wasted on me.    As someone who enjoys fishing and lakes, I could have spent hours looking at the different types of trout, bass, crappies, etc.  And for the price?   $24.99 is a steal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________" This book is not for the faint of heart. There are multiple times when I just couldn't wait to go to bed. I just had to put this book down. It's like a car crash.   And yet I read it in one sitting and finished it. That's why I give it 3.5 stars.   and it's not just because it's about a dead guy, or a car wreck, or some sort of supernatural occurrence. It was great, and that's not always the case.   of the characters I liked, I really liked the way she wrote it. This is a great read about a girl who can see the future, a girl so smart and so clever that she makes her mother worry about her, and a girl that makes the lives of those around her a living hell.   a book that you'll have a hard time letting go of
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a total waste of my time. Not a single one of the characters is memorable, which is disappointing since I spent hours reading about them and the way they treated their children. I also felt like the author completely missed out on developing the main character's relationship with her little girl, as the author didn't even have a word for the child's name. When you have this much material written on a very small subject, you have to put more time into it. It seems like they spent way more time writing it than actually writing it. I read the first page and left.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is my second novel. My first novel was terrible. I didn't know how to write a good book. I wrote it twice. It was just not what I wanted to write. I knew it wasn't good but I kept putting it on the shelf, hoping it would go away. Then, I kept reading it for two more weeks. The first day, I started to enjoy it. The second day, the book was no longer enjoyable. Then I quit and went back to my first novel. The book was so bad that I was afraid to read it.   47 of 49 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ What a horrible, horrible book. I loved the premise of it, but then found it wanting in almost every way.   Let me start by saying that I am a very long time fantasy reader. So I have a good sense of what works, and what doesn't. And when it comes to fantasy, there are some tropes I do not care for: magic, demons, elves, orcs, dragons, dark elves, fairies, dwarfs, elves without their heads (I think it's called the "magic of the blind"), etc. But nothing I've ever read that is so utterly offensive to the senses as this.   the world is fantasy, and it is not at all "real" at all, and so it is completely illogical that people from that world would be that stupid. The whole concept is ludicrous, and that's not even mentioning the many, many, MANY holes in it that would make it utterly unworkable as a "real world" setting for a real world story. The elves seem to be very good at getting people to do things they don't want to do, like kill a king. This is not the kind of thing that happens to any of the other races in the real world. And it's a giant, huge red flag that the world you've been telling the tale of could not have occurred in this time or place. It was set in the far future, in some kind of "post-apocalyptic future," but no more, as it never occurred in the time or places described, which is like having a time machine that would never, ever work. It's just not possible.   and if it did, it's clear the author is so far past his "reading" the history of the world, that he is just trying to keep up on what's happened, to fill in the gaps, etc, with whatever new technology he can think up in a way that doesn't make the reader feel stupid. I have no idea how this author manages to write a "fact" on a page with absolutely no basis in history and no basis for anything else that would be needed, even if the "fact," were true.  ....   I know it's easy to find a reviewer who thinks the book is good, but that reviewer also has to be able to read something other than a fantasy book and not dismiss it on the basis that the author can't write fantasy.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  As a fan of the original "Fahrenheit 451," I was eager to find out if there were any changes, alterations, or improvements that made "The Adjustment Bureau" better than the original book.   A number of "foolish" changes that occurred at the last minute (and in a few places the very last moment) are not apparent, including the replacement of "The Bureau" with "The Bureaus" in the second-to-last page.  I think this is a sign that the publishers have no faith in their readers to find the errors and fix them.  The book's author should have been more cautious and more honest, and perhaps should have just published an abridged edition.  One of my favorite passages, in which a character refers to the Book of the Law by name, is taken from a different book altogether, the novel "Sorcerers of Mars."  I'll admit that I was delighted that, despite the errors, I was able to follow along the plot of the story without the original, inaccurate translation.  This was particularly satisfying because the story's themes of religion, censorship, and conformity are ones I identify with.  I enjoyed the book quite a bit.  But at times, I could not identify with the protagonist (although I am a bit of an atheist).  My hope is that the revised edition of "Fantastic Voyage" will offer a more honest translation of the book to non-native English speakers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author is obviously a liar and there are a ton of problems with the book. This is the first book that I ever read that made me really angry. The beginning where she explains why she has no talent or understanding of how a computer works is incredibly rude. Then when she shows it is just a bunch of random characters and they are not really connected with the computer and the world she has made they are even worse and rude. As time goes on it becomes less bad but the problem is that every time she changes the setting the problems seem to go away. In the first part of the book she is talking about how hard it is to teach math and science to children because they can't relate to it. Well here she just brings in a bunch other kids who don't like science and math and it starts to make less sense. And then the worst is when she just goes from one character to another and they all just say the same thing when it comes to science. The first time she introduces this we know that she is going to have to do a re-write of the entire book because it makes the plot so hard to follow. Even when the characters are trying to do something there are times when the plot doesn't make sense and then it just ends up as a bunch stupid things happening. I found this book very disappointing because the main characters were supposed to be different but they ended up being the same. I'm not going to say that they are all bad but if you are looking for a great story then you should not read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** This book should have been written by a professional. First, I would have loved to be able to give this book a higher rating. I had a difficult time putting the book down once I started reading it, and I'm sure many others would love to read something as good as this. Unfortunately, this is just not a book worth buying. If you want to learn about creating your own story in the 21st century, check out a book like John Green's Paper Towns. The only thing that's missing here is a big green box. If I could rate this book higher I would. Otherwise, it's a waste of time.  31 of 33 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  -  I don't know what it is about this book that made it so horrible I don't want to read it again but I am afraid of it.  This book is a waste of time and should never be read.   I am so disappointed with this book. I can't believe what I just read. I have a huge love for Star Trek and I am super excited that this book is coming out. I am also very excited about the new Star Trek movies and I thought the original books from Eaglemoss were really great.  This was way worse than any of those.  I was really looking forward to reading this book because I am a huge fan and I have read the original series from TOS to DS9.  The book is nothing like the show.  It takes place around the time of the movie and is all about the crew of the Enterprise.  My favorite part about the book is that they are all called the Enterprise crew and the main story line focuses on Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.  Spock and Kirk spend a lot of time on the bridge because they do the most important things that need to be done.  Kirk and Spock go out into space but it never really seems like they are doing anything important.  They also do the least amount of important work.  As far as action it is just a bunch of guys sitting around talking in their quarters or at the bar.  All the characters are either idiots or idiots that aren't very smart.  When the book states "In a way the crew on the Enterprise were the last of their kind," I thought it was kind of funny. I had read that in TOS the crew didn't seem to be human and was kind like the Borg, but in this book it is a little more about the people and how they treat each other.  At one point one of the guys wants to see the movie while others are trying to get off the ship.  Then the main character of Kirk starts an argument with Spock.  He doesn't like that Spock is on the ship and he thinks the others are going too easy on him.  However it's all the crew that make up the Enterprise, which is how I feel about this Star Trek book.  A main character doesn't really get much story out of it and even when the main characters do do something interesting they have a bunch more characters doing their job for them instead of them doing their own thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________ [This review is from a retail copy, purchased at Barnes & Noble. The cover photo was taken by me from my computer, by the way!] It is an epic tale of love, loss, the world and human nature, that reads in slow motion, and when you stop to realize what you are reading you can't help but smile, if only because you can actually connect to it as the writer did. For the first time I can read the original German as well as the translation and I must admit that I love both. The author is a master of words and makes you feel that the main character is one of a kind, that if the author is not one of them you won't get it. The story is divided into three sections that seem a bit odd but fit nicely into the overall story. The first section deals with a man who falls in love and then leaves his mother. This man's wife, the girl he loves and whom he has a strong connection to, decides to move to the city with him and the two share an amazing love affair. The second section is about a woman who falls asleep one day, and her husband wakes her up by kissing her. She then notices that he has some strange marks on his lips. The third section is basically a love story with an extra twist. In this section the husband is a magician. I never knew magicians existed, and this is the first book I've read with a magician in it. So what happens? I suppose that's the fun part. My rating: ______________ 4.3 stars for the first half, then 4.5 for the second.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- Well, this book was NOT what I expected. I thought it would be like "The Hunger Games," and it had that, but it was NOT. This book was not about killing. I didn't understand why these people were doing it, and I didn' know the answer. It was like the people were just killing all of these animals and then eating them. And it didn't feel that way at all. It just felt like a mindless killing. It felt like they were killing and then they'd just sort of sit there for a while and let the animals die. I feel like it was more about "what's in it for me?" as opposed to what's in a person's best interest to do. It didn't seem like it would make me want to be a warrior, or at least give me an answer to how I should be a Warrior. The only thing I did get from this book, was a whole lot of blood. I really wish there was more blood in the books, that is my biggest complaint. --------------- Did you enjoy this review? --------------- If so please share it with your friends by clicking the like button below.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- When I got this book, I was pretty excited to read about the "savior" of the people of Derry, and I was also excited to see how he was different from the people in the book. To my surprise, this novel is actually less about the 'Derry people' and more about the man who called himself Saint Patrick. This was actually my biggest disappointment with this book. I really liked that Saint Patrick was a man who was a healer, but I couldn't help but wonder what made him a good person to heal? I couldn  When I got This book, it did not disappoint me. I was intrigued about how the 'People of Dyer' would react to a man that they thought was some sort of god. I am still not sure if I completely understood this book because it did take me a bit to get used to the characters and what they were about, but after finishing, I found myself intrigued with what happened next. While I did not get to see the story go further, I did learn a little about what Saint Patrick's faith was about and why he became a healer. Saint Patrick is a very complex character that is written with great detail and was well written. I loved his dialogue and could not stop reading. This book was very well written and I highly recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I started this book hoping to become a better writer. The book is great, but you can get a good amount out of reading the first half of the book without paying much attention to the middle and the end of the story. It's mostly about how the author tried to write, and how the experience of writing a book is similar to being a writer, so the reader needs to keep that in mind, even if the author doesn't write in a style that can be easily described. When the end comes, it's not even interesting, in that sense, but then again, not every book is. Overall, I would recommend this to a friend, but only if they're interested in learning how to write.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to this book and wanted to go to my local library and look through my book cart before I bought this, but I found it sitting at the checkout line.  The book had a lot of issues: - The book is very short and the author has a lot to say, but he doesn't follow it up with much detail.   When he gives you a story, he doesn;t follow up with anything beyond that.  It seems like the author is trying to cover a lot with a lot - but you're not given a lot.  - He has a tendency to have things not make sense (such as the character of "Ziggy" making more sense than most of the characters).  - The language is a little dated.  I could have done without the "it" or "y" in "it," but it was acceptable in his "real" life. -  -The way he makes his argument for evolution is really off-putting.  It's almost as if he's writing this for his "believers" - to convince them that evolution was real.  When you read this book, you will have to explain that he's wrong.  There is no proof in the text that he is wrong. - Some of the characterizations are really off.  This book, while it's not bad, is more for the Christians in your life.  If you're looking for an entertaining book about an atheist and his struggles, you won't find it in this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    (December 18, 2015) By: Daniel from Colorado This book is a load of crap. I bought it just to fill the hole in my shelves for the new movie. I'm still reading it as we speak. This book was a big hit for my son. It's filled with lots of great details about the movie and even the script, which is hilarious, for the movie. The only thing that bothered me was the story of the people who made the movie--a lot of them don't even show up in the book, so you never get to know who's right and who's wrong. And I'm wondering why you couldn't have made the story about just the people making the movie, but didn't want to because you thought they would like it better. It just seems weird to me that you wouldn't include the people at the center of the movie (the two filmmakers, the producers and the crew). Also, why did you include the part about how the film was originally going to be called A Christmas Story, but had to be changed to A Christmas Carol, because you wanted the story to be about Jesus? It just makes the book look like a poor retelling of a true story. But, I guess you have to include all of that, since you want your movie to look like A Christmas story. This is a book that can be used for kids, but it doesn't add up to anything more than a lot of kids being entertained. It even has a Christmas song at the end. I can't stand this book.  favorite favorite favorite favorite ( 5 reviews )  Topics: Disney, Disney, Christmas, children, books   Books to Borrow 5,543 5.6K The Tale of Scrooge by Robert Louis Stevenson texts eye 5,526 favorite 4 comment 0  Book digitized by Google and uploaded to the Internet Archive by user tpb. .

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had never heard of this book before I started reading it and as soon as I opened it I had a hankering for a good story. What I didn't realize is how horrible of a story it is. It's like watching a bunch of kids from grade school sitting around one day at a party and watching a man from a tv show jump out of a tree and land in a creek. He falls in and gets caught in a rip-snail's web. So then the kids have to pull out all of the webs and get him back. I was hoping the plot would make some sense but no, it just kept getting worse. The ending was so stupid that I just couldn't even believe it. So I gave it a 3 because it's ok, but nothing that was worth reading.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not pleased at all with this book. The main problem was how the author made you feel like you have to be good at this book, even though its not even clear if you are supposed to be. The story was pretty confusing and the pacing wasn't very good. I wish the story was longer. Also, the author put a lot of time in writing the characters. She even created a couple of characters that she later wrote to hate. I will not read another YA fantasy until it has a good plot and more original characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book thinking I would like it, but it's just not that interesting to me.

My son enjoyed it as well, but he only had to keep the book open and flipped the pages every ten minutes because the story was just too boring for him.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I purchased this book and the following was the first thing that struck me:   I have been using some of this material for years, and so I feel like I am part of some sort of secret, but I do know who wrote it.   So, I had been working on a couple of things when I went to get my book. I figured I could use this book as a reference, but this is not an academic book. It is written in a format that is easy to use (and that is probably why this book was written) and I did not need to go to a good library and look up what each section meant. If you are doing a simple study and need to look it up, you could have done so in minutes.  . It was a very good book, and I would recommend it. It could be a lot better. I wish that they had more specific directions for the material, but it was easy enough to understand to use. If it were more explicit, I would not have finished it in four days. If I had to do it again, I might try using some sort a pre-existing book to help me out (this is not my first book, so I am used to that). It was clear from the start that the author did not have a background in science and chemistry and it really showed. I really liked how the author explained the things and the process in such a way that it made it easier to understand. It did take me a while to get used to it, but once I got it, it made a lot more sense.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not only wrong, but just plain boring. It is as though the author didn't like the novel's premise or the characters in the book and that she was just looking to write a non-stop entertaining read of a girl who runs away from her abusive parents. Her description of the characters (e.g. the mom and dad) are so over-dramatic and ridiculous that it was almost painful to read. The ending (again the narrator's description) is just as silly and unnecessary as the beginning, it ends with the girls running away as if it is a happy ending. The plot is pointless and the characters are just flat. I am really disappointed in this book. I hope that whoever wrote it didn't enjoy it as much as I did.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________ This is one of those books that I read through in a couple hours or less. In fact, I think it's the worst book I've ever read. I mean seriously. I'm not exaggerating. I could write a review of the entire book and not be finished, but for a book about the Bible, I was disappointed beyond belief. There is not a single thing good about this book. If you are not familiar with the Bible and are a Christian, I would highly suggest you take the time to read this book (or at least read the "What's in the Bible?" portion of it) before you commit your faith to Jesus.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a fan of many great sci fi/fantasy authors I found The Great Gods Await to be a disappointment. It was a disappointing experience and I would only recommend it to those who have read this and will not be pleased. The writing was poor in many areas and I felt the book was poorly edited. I was surprised to learn there was no "side story" about the creation of the gods and I was confused by the "doubling" of the "good" and "evil" gods. It seemed like the author was having fun just adding two new gods to the "Evil" side of the scale as the bad gods were only created a few years prior, and there was nothing to suggest that the "evil gods" were more powerful, or that the good gods were weaker. The world building was poor, the characters were not very well drawn and there were so many characters it became confusing to see where the "bad gods" came from.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book didn't do it for me. The characters were poorly conceived, the writing was so badly written that it was obvious he had been typing the whole book, the plot was incoherent, and the prose was so bad that it seemed to me that he had not read a single book in his lifetime.  I could not, for example, find the difference between what the book describes as the "right hand side" of the body and what the "left hand side," and neither can anyone else.  This book should not have been published, because it is nothing but a waste of everyone's time. Posted by Tylenol at 11:47 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________   First of all, I was wrong. The whole book is written as if it were a joke, and is full of jokes.   The premise is that the main character, a female dog, is adopted from a shelter by her new owner, a man she calls "Mister." When Mister takes the dog on a hike, Mister discovers the dog has no idea where she lives and what she looks like, and becomes obsessed with her.   for the past two chapters, the author has taken some time out to make the reader think the main dog is a man. She wears jeans and a shirt, she has a mustache, she does not speak. I thought that was pretty obvious. I would not read such a joke again. There was no need to make it more obvious by writing a man out of a dog, no?   Then Mister comes back with a dead pig, and the story is just about how much Mister hates being called a pig, how he doesn't want the other dogs to call him a pig because he's a dog. Then the dog is called a "pig" by a farmer who happens to be her new guardian and hates pigs, too. Now Mister is on the run and scared, afraid that if she goes back to her original owner she will be killed.  :-/  "But Mister did not believe in that sort of thing." -the narrator  12 of 12 people found this review helpful

I really enjoyed the characters.   This book has so many interesting things that will appeal to both boys and girls.    The writing is very good and the characters are very well drawn.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book made my blood boil, and I cannot understand how this publisher could possibly be so stupid as to allow this to get out. It is just plain unprofessional, and the author should be ashamed of herself for letting this happen. Review:    I was excited about this one, and it certainly is a good read. The plot was intriguing and the characters were all interesting. In a nutshell:  The story follows a girl that is adopted by a family who raised her as their own and who are obsessed with her. She lives her own life and has some issues as a result. This is a very dark novel. The first half of the book was interesting, and then the whole book went off the rails for me. The last half of this book was too horrible to read.  Rating:  A 3/5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a complete disappointment to me. The story was a long and convoluted mess of fantasy and science fiction, full of the usual elements of the genre. I was disappointed because of how long the book was. The book started at the middle, with nothing about the "beginning" to be found. This meant I had to turn the book upside down in order to get to the plot. If this book was going to be that long, it probably should have had some action in it, since the whole time it was describing all the different scientific experiments the character had been doing. If they were going to make the whole book just about science, maybe they should have put a scene in it that made sense. If only it was that way, it might have been okay. If it was going at any point to be a "high science fiction" book, then there should have been some way to tie it all together. And it's certainly not a good book.     I've been reading a lot of science fiction lately, so I'm going to put this down for now and find out some new books. It's also a bit late, so if you want some good science fiction or fantasy, you probably should check out a book in the next few weeks or so, like David Drake's  The problem is that there isn't enough character development in this book to make me want to continue. I think I am going to take a step back from my fantasy-heavy reading and re-read it again, maybe even in an edited form to see how it's been edited.    This is the second science fiction/fantasy novel I've read that's been so long, and I still can't figure out why. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I will first give this book a solid 9/10 because I truly enjoyed this book as a reader. It was fun to read and enjoyable to read, but it could have been better. The writing style is definitely an upgrade. It wasn't long before I realized how much I loved how the author changed the style of the characters and the story. That, combined with the fun action of the story, made it a fun read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ This book does not work. I can't understand why you would want to read this book. I read it for an interview in a foreign newspaper. The reporter asked me about the "American Way". I could tell it was going to be very negative. But then the interview began. She asked me what I think about America's role in the world. I told her that we are a force for good in the universe. I also said that the US can learn a lot from the other countries in the "World community". I was not sure that she understood my meaning. She finally asked me, "What if America went back to the way it was?". I said that I was afraid of what might happen if we returned to the past and tried to "Make America Great Again". The reporter smiled and told me to remember that I am from a non-American family. She said, "There are many people like us in the media, who are also worried about the future of the US and are afraid to say the truth to the people, because they feel ashamed of it." I did not answer her question. It seems to me, that it's very important that you get the message across, that we do not need to return to the previous days, to the time of segregation. I would think that the real problem with the book, is the message that is not really being transmitted. I feel like a kid who reads a book without really understanding what he or she is reading.   There is a lot of information in this book about the past of black and white people in America. However, there are many who feel that you just don't get it, but they also seem to believe that this book will change people's minds. It does not. This book, and others like it, have really bad propaganda behind them. I don't know why people are so anxious to change people. I know that it is difficult, but I don´t know why we don't do the things that our forefathers did.     This book is a disservice to black America. Many people, both white and black, who read it, feel bad about themselves, and feel that they are not "good enough" to be educated, to be given jobs, to live the American dream. I cannot understand why anyone would be so bitter. It's a shame that people are in such a rush to "fix" themselves. But if people are reading this book, they
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________________ [A] The story is an attempt to have a good time reading a very good book. This book is not fun for me. There's no sense of fun. It's not like reading a real funny book and then you get to read this. It feels like a book with just some story and no characters. It doesn't make you laugh or have a great time. So don't read this book if you love the good book [B] The characters in this book are mostly just stupid, stupid, dummies. But the story is just dumb. The story has nothing to do with the characters. [C] A woman is really stupid but it's a fantasy book so that's good. It would've been better if they didn't include her [D] There's a nice ending, but it doesn't have much to do in the book after the whole last sentence. It felt really tacked on. The ending was a bit stupid. [E] I wouldn't recommend this book to people who want to read about wizards. They're not wizards in this [F] I'd probably only buy this book for fun if I had a few hours free.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________   If you're looking for a good book, buy a good one.   I have a lot of respect for Mark Twain and I appreciate his honesty and forthrightness.   is the same old, same old.   the book is a good read, but the pacing is off, and the details aren't explained in a satisfying way.   (but hey, it's Mark Twain, who is an example of how you can write a bad novel, and have it be really bad in a way that's fun, and entertaining).   The story is fun and the ending is very satisfying.   in fact, the ending and writing of the book, in particular, are so good, that i had to read it a second time because the first time i felt it was just okay. i'll probably pick it up again, but maybe another time with a different narrator.   "for those who are curious about the truth of this thing, or who are interested in discovering how and when it came to be, it is not too hard to learn; if it is true at all, it seems to be something of an accident, something very simple, but very important, and to have been the result of a series of accidents. And, on the other hand, it would seem to be a very simple mistake of judgment, for an ordinary man, with a very little experience, to have made. It is a very hard matter to say why one man should have taken upon himself to set himself against another man; but I will tell you that he made this mistake. It was because he was a very great believer in the existence of the Supreme Being; and the Supreme being was such an awful creature, such an atrocious creature, so awful to think of, that he was quite willing to sacrifice the life of a child to get hold of a little piece of wood and try to turn it.  "There is a kind of wisdom in this; and when we think of the people who have made this great sacrifice for the love of God, the love which we all must feel at one time or another; and of the love that we feel when we are suffering for the same love, then it is very easy to understand what the sacrifice of such a child must have been."   (The only problem with this book is the narrator... i know it's a good narrator, but... he does a terrible job with it).
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was very short, but the subject matter was a total bore.  I could have spent an hour on it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ________________________________________ ________ _________________________________________________________   If you've already read this book, I'd suggest you do what most people do and throw it out and pick up something else; this review is a rant about the whole experience, not a review of the book.   I have been reading a lot of science fiction and fantasy books lately and the only real surprise was when I opened The Forever War to my library to read. The covers are beautiful and the story is engaging, so I knew I would enjoy it. I found the first few chapters to be a bit slow and I kept waiting for the action to pick up. This book has a lot going on and as the characters become more involved I noticed the pacing dropped in my opinion. There was a lot that was happening at once and I found myself wanting a little more from each character's story than they were giving me.   "This war is going to be hell."   It was so easy to buy into this book. I loved the characters and the world building that was done. I was entranced by the story, but was never really hooked by the action and the conflict. This is the first book I have read with no time travel element and so the story was so interesting that it did not work for me. I thought the book was well done, but I would be more interested in the sequel, The Forever Enemy, which is about a war that is caused by people, rather than by the actions of others. If that is the case, I may have to give it another chance.   the ending was very disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      If you want to tell the world about how much of a loser you are, then this is the book for you. I know the reviews for this book are mixed. Some people rave about this book and say it's a great introduction to the world of writing, but for me, it's not great. If you're new to writing, and the book doesn't get you to the point where you want more, then it might help you to get a little more of the point from it. If I was new to the field of writing and I bought this book (which I did) and found it didn't get me to the other side of the "Write" barrier, then I'd say that's bad writing. But for a book on the beginner's path to becoming a writer, it gets me to a point where I want to do something else.   This book was written to help someone "write" a novel. Someone that wants to become a writer. And while you don't need to be a writer to benefit from this book, I found myself wanting to read a good novel every once in a while, and to be in a situation where I could read a novel and then go into writing a sequel. In that sense, I think the book helped someone who wants to write a novel learn a lot more about what it's like to write than I think it did for someone who just wants to get better at writing.   a lot. I've been writing for about 9 years and it's helped me immensely. It taught me a lot of what I needed to know to become successful. This book also helped me to realize that not all writers do what they're doing. When I was a writer and I wanted to write an epic fantasy novel, I was always told to keep it short, to make sure to give a lot and to take things slow. When you're a writer in that way, you don-   The first part of the book was really great. The second half of the first half is terrible. The third part is really good. The last part of this book is okay. It's not bad, but it's definitely a different book.  . It took me a while to realize this was my least favorite part of it. And I don't mean the story and the writing, I mean the characters. I'm so much less invested in these characters in the third part of book that I'm like: "Yeah
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is one of those "I don't really understand why we're so obsessed with it" books, so it's not a disappointment, but it isn't worth the hype.   In the beginning of the story, we're told that the main character, who will be called Sarah, is an accomplished dancer. Her mentor teaches her some difficult dance moves. When they're done, they are told to go back to their "real lives" for a few days, but before that, they need to perform in a performance of The Nutcracker at the Palace of Fine Arts in Paris, France.   is a fantasy tale, but with magic and dance. It starts off well enough, as the plot follows a young woman from the US, who moves to Paris, and who comes across the story of two other girls, who have also left the US and are doing the same. They've never seen the show in person, but they were told by a friend in Paris that they should watch it because it's a classic. They go and they love it. It's a really nice way to introduce the book, and to show what is in store for us the rest of the way. But, once they get there, they realize that what's going on with them and their friends is no classic. It becomes clear that what the two other stories are trying to do is create a mythological story with lots of historical detail to give it depth. It is also a fantasy story, but without magic or any supernatural element. It takes place on a modern city in modern times. The plot is a bit confusing at first, as it seems to have two characters who travel from the present to the past, and back, with no real sense of how it all works. The first book was more like a first person narrative, with a narrator who explained some important points about Sarah and her mentor.  , which is basically a sequel. It introduces a new character, and the plot seems to be heading in the same direction as in the first book, but this time, there is more magical and historical detail, which was nice.  The pacing is good, but not so good that it makes reading the book any easier. But it's ok, just ok. I was hoping that the plot would pick up a bit with the second book, because the first was a little disjointed. There wasn't really a clear direction for the book and I was left wondering what would happen next
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!  Don't get me wrong... this book is not all bad. There are several gems scattered throughout. However, I could never put it down after finishing this book. I read it in one sitting.   I really, really like the plot of this book, I just could never finish it. I liked the characters. I like the setting. The magic system is interesting. The prose is poetic. The main character was well developed. The world building was interesting. However the main plot in this book was the same old same old, the same boring story with the same characters in different locations and with different attitudes.  .  .

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- *This book makes my blood boil. *I was going to give this book a perfect 10 but then I found out it was written by a man. Why does that bother me so much? It's not like he's a woman so it doesn't bother me, just the fact that he wrote this. I mean, it makes me so mad because I read this book and I thought I knew how to be a better person because I know my husband is one. But no! He didn't teach me how to treat a woman because he was one (but not for long) and instead, it says he is a misogynist and then in the last chapter, he talks about how awful men are, and that I would never know if I was just with him. I don't know what to say about this book except that I don  I thought I'd give this a 4.5. The first two books in the series I gave a 5.5, one of which I gave an amazing 5 stars. But this one is bad. It's really bad. There are no points worth making because all the things that make the characters, the plot, and the book what it is, all just become a little too much.   There are three main characters in this book. A man (because it is called a male dominated story) who has a son that he loves and cares for. A female, a victim of an abusive relationship with a man (another man, as if there is such a thing) who was raised in a very abusive environment and who is now in a loving, safe place with another woman. This woman is also a survivor of abuse and is very well written. I was so upset about how much I hate this woman's abusive ex-boyfriend that I couldn't even focus on this book, let alone finish it. But now I have to read more.   A middle aged woman who is also abused. This book doesn't focus on her or her recovery but how much she has learned about herself and how to survive. I have no idea how I'm going to finish this book but it's probably going to be hard.   the other two women have no scenes. They're basically a background to this male dominated book and the man's life and how that life will change them for the worse. I know this because they don't have any lines and they just seem to be there to be more emotional background scenery. Not even as
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* This book will leave you confused and disoriented. The narrative is filled with contradictions, and the lack of a point makes it hard to follow. I could not read it to the end without having the mental image of a man throwing himself on the floor to catch a bus. I think it was written by someone with no experience in writing books and no education in history.  The story was a big part of the problem, and I couldn't understand the point. I was never able to get into the main characters or understand the plot, and so much of the book was about someone else's thoughts. The author had some vague ideas about the history of the time in which the story was set, and she seemed to assume the reader knew about the period, but that was about it. If you do know about the era, you might find this a fun adventure, but it was so badly written I felt the characters were completely pointless. A couple of people on this site said they enjoyed the plot. If this book were a movie, you would see that the hero is the real hero. There was a time in my life when I would read books to pass the time. I read this book because I was so bored I couldn,t wait until I finished it. There is nothing clever about this book and I was surprised at how much I liked it. It was a fun read and it would be a fun book for someone like me, not the type who reads books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The characters in this book seem to go through phases of stupidity, stupidity, and stupidity.

It's a fun read, but my favorite parts were the parts of the book that weren't about the characters.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------I hated this book and couldn't get through it! The narration is horrible and has the characters acting like a bunch of idiots. The characters were just so dumb and stupid. The story was so stupid. When I first started reading it was because it was on the list for my friend and I to read together. But, we had to stop because we hated it so much! This was the book I had to read that first time I read the series, so I just couldn't even start to think about it again. After that, I had just read this series twice! Not once was this book actually entertaining and fun to read. I just felt like I was in a bad way because of the narration! I am sure I would have liked this book if it had been written by someone more competent and not just a kid writing it because that is the case with all kid's books they publish in the school system. My son likes this book to this day and I think I will start the series again with the same poor narrator!  25 of 26 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The world-wide popularity of the book, The Secret of the Unicorn's Secret, has been almost completely due to the fact that it was the most expensive hardback book published in the United States in 2007. If I was trying to get a book into college libraries in order to get into an anthropology major, I would have gone for this one. I have this feeling that some people think it was too hard to write and that I was lazy to finish it and put it away. I agree with them, but I'm writing books and trying to write books and a story can't get away from me. I can't help myself. This story about a unicorn (I'm not gonna use a horse, it's a unicorn so it should be obvious) who becomes a prince by eating a unicorn egg, and why he keeps eating other unicorns... it's been the story of my life. I have written about it in every draft of this book, but for this new version I have done something different. I'm not going to say that this version is better, but that I am a much happier writer. I don't remember the last time I was able to sit down at a desk and focus on a story for a couple of days, and then pick up the next day and do the same thing. I started this story in the middle of summer and got so frustrated with it, and I kept putting it down until August (the book is on my desk at work now), and then I put it down again, and it has gotten even worse, and now I'm done with it.  When I was younger, I had a book about a girl who was trying not to do too many drugs, and one day she goes to the library and she finds this book on cocaine. I read it and I thought that this was a very interesting character, that I should probably write a book like this. I never ended up writing a book with cocaine in it, but if I was doing that, I'd have made a different decision. It turns out that it is the last day of the summer and I have to give my report card on my work. This was an exciting time for me. When I was in college (or even just out of college), I was a pretty bad writer. Every story I wrote was so short and very simplistic and it really took a lot of work to get my characters to do anything that made any sense. I thought, "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bit of advice:  "My favorite way to get away from a writer is to listen to him. " — George Carlin This book will help you learn to write a good and effective story. It shows you how to do it and how to put it in a story and how it will turn out. It's a great book and it's worth reading. It will help if you're looking for some ideas to get a writing career started. You can do it! It'll also help if your writing is suffering for a lack of inspiration, or if you need to get out of a boring place. But it's more than that. It can also show you the way to improve yourself as a writer. And that can be the real key to a successful writing career. And this will teach you a lot about writing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  - I have read this book and found it to be an excellent book, but I feel that the author's writing style did not lend itself to easy reading. I read this in the morning with a cup of coffee, and was able to sit down and read for about half an hour. I finished this in about a half hour.  I feel as though I read it a few weeks ago, as it was written over a short span of time, and as such, was easy to follow.    Overall: I really wanted to like this book.  My main complaint is that the main character, Hannah, does not seem like she belongs in the "real world" or as much as she appears to be. She doesn't really have a voice, nor do I really feel like she has a set of values that she holds onto.  I'm not sure if her family is a bad influence.  This is an area where I would want to see her family go further.  She has very few friends.  Her family does not trust her.  Perhaps this is a product of the story, but it does not feel like a true story.  Again, this is due to the writer's style.  The style is that of a modern teenager, and while I think that is awesome, I wish it was a little more.  While I found it exciting, I did feel as if I was reading a teen novel.    Final Thoughts:   Overall, this was a fun book. I do think it would be interesting to see this take place in a modern world.  Hannah is a teenager in a world that has not aged very well.  One that feels much more dated and less "real".  
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   I'm not sure what to say about this book; I liked the title of it but I found the book to be a bit dry.   While the book is not terrible, it's definitely not great.   with the "gut" story, the writer doesn't seem to have a lot of imagination and seems to think of the plot as some sort of formula. The author seems to get the whole idea of the story right in her head (with the exception of the ending of the novel), but the story is simply boring.   I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. It's not a bad read, but it's not amazing either.   A quick side note is that if you're an author and you like "guts", read the book, as it's pretty good. If you want something different, the book isn't it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to read this book. I really wanted to like it but it was just so bad.   My family has a cat that is very, very picky about his food. We always keep a small stash of things we know he likes. The food is in the fridge. But he would try to eat these things anyway. He was just SO picky, that I had to put the foods in the freezer. Then once he ate the food he would be so upset about it. He would whine and whine. We would have to clean up after him for awhile. The cat would try again and again. This was going on for about 4 years. Then one day I just decided to stop putting everything in the refrigerator. This is when he started giving up and not eating. I had never been so sick of eating. So I started putting all the food I wanted him to eat in the freeze. Then I put the food away in the cupboard. I think he had enough of eating from the freezer before that. Then when I realized what had happened I was SO upset. He had started to just whine again. I was like ok I have to put this in the cabinet and not let him see it. I took it out a week later and saw the label on it. It had his name and where the food was from. The sad thing was that he was going to have to go back to the store and get the food. I never thought I would get so sick. I just wanted him so bad so bad!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a little too preachy to me. It does a decent job of explaining that the world has gone to hell because it has become evil. However, it doesn't really give a lot of examples to make the points. I'm not a fan of writing the world into a book so that there's a good way to behave and a bad way. If I had to draw comparisons to a good example, I'd say the movie "The Dark Knight" (which I love). The movie is also a movie that is more about morality than anything. In the movie, the villains, the Joker, are bad guys, but in the book, the "good guys" are morally good. The villains are evil, but the bad guys are good. The ending:   This book is written for people who want to read a book that explains how to make a "good" world, but without the horrible consequences it is known to have. However it makes me cringe reading it for a very, very simple reason: The ending.  The end of the book takes a bad situation and makes it worse by having the character go to the same church that they came from.   I felt like it was like the writer thought it was funny and thought it would make the ending less negative. However the ending of this book was horrible.  I'm no stranger to terrible endings. I remember when "Game of Thrones" came out and I went into one of the stores to get it on Blu-ray and there was a man selling it on the shelf! That's the kind of thing that's easy to find with these kinds of books.  There's a lot that this book does right, and there's even a little more that it could have done, but it doesn?t get there.  If you love stories that explain how the world can turn into something horrible, "The Good Devils of Goodland" is a book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- When I began reading the book The Giver by Lois Lowry, I knew I had to get it. I thought it would be an entertaining read, and it was, until the last two or three chapters where it got too preachy. It took me out of the story and made the book unenjoyable. I think I am just going to give the book to someone else who can enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am currently reading The Magician's Nephew by Philip Pullman, and I am disappointed to say that this book was not for me.   It was so confusing.  I know this because I had to consult an online encyclopedia to find out what was going on.  This book was written before the Internet, so what was the point of using that information?   The story that Philip Pullmann tells in The Magicians Nephew seems to be based on a story from the Bible and the movie The Bible, in which a magician is killed, and his servant goes insane in order to solve the puzzle.  But I don't understand how it's possible for a servant of God to go insane to solve a mystery, which is why the Bible, and the film, is the basis for this story.  When I first started reading this book I was afraid that the plot would be confusing and I might have to look up information from a book, but alas, no, this book is just so confusing I was lost.  The last part of the book has two chapters, each with a name that ends in -is.  These chapters contain three pages each, and they are in different places on the book, and are all completely blank.  They each go on and on, and there is no conclusion.  So, my question is this.  Who in their right mind would read this book and think that it was a good book?  Why people don't like The Magic Mirror by Kari Spilker: The Magic of Reality by K.J. Parker: The Lost Books of H.P. Lovecraft: The Complete Tales of HPL:  I've been thinking lately about the many great books I have read over the years and how they have helped me along my journey.  For one, a book can teach you a thing or two about writing.  And that is where this is going.  There is one book that I can tell you without hesitation that will help you write a book.  It will teach you how to write good prose.  In this case, the book is titled How to Write a Good Novel: The Rules of Writing Great Fiction, by Robert Bly.  And the Rules of Good Writing can be summed up as, "Don't make it too long!"  Okay, so how do you learn how to become a good writer?  This is what the first rule of Good English
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read, this book had everything a author could ever want, but at the same time made me feel sorry for the author, every single sentence was written in a lazy style. The characters were all weak and had no motivation for their actions, and even if some of the characters had been strong they could have never carried this story through its full potential. This book was an extremely lazy writing style, which was very apparent when I started reading this book.  Review from another reader:   This book is a complete waste of time. There was so much content to make this book a great read but it is so disorganized and poorly written it is impossible to enjoy. The story is so boring with little to no plot progression it is literally like watching a video game and the author does not know how to make anything exciting. I found this book tedious to read. I was trying to finish it and even I had a hard time finishing the book and I gave up when I was halfway through. I just wished this book could have ended already. The author could have made the entire book a better book because at the end of the book we are given the "final" chapter, but it was almost like I was reading a story about some poor, broken down characters that had no purpose in this story. The ending just left me unsatisfied and sad, not that it wasn't a great ending, but I have to admit I felt bad for them and what little motivation they had left.  a complete fail   I am really disappointed with this book! This is my fourth (maybe fifth) attempt to finish this story and it was the most boring book I ever read. The writing style was terrible, the characters were horrible, and there was not a single plot thread I cared to follow. I can't believe this book was published this year, but unfortunately it was not worth the wait. It is just a bunch of useless information that I did not care to read! I hated this book, so I am going to give up on it and just read something else! I will be reading another book in my favorite author's works, hopefully it will be a better story. I am giving this book the worst score possible. I hate to give it any negative score at all. I had read this book and liked it but unfortunately the author did not know his way around the writing style!  The Good:  Plot 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was so excited to read this book, but it wasn't long before I found myself thinking "well, this book sucks, this has got to be a book I would never want to read."  In addition, the book felt very "scripted".  For example, the main character, who at the end of the book is a new, highly-trained detective in New York, is introduced in a way that leaves me wondering why the book keeps trying to make him look as if he was a complete fraud.  But, there were some other problems: the main male character was a woman in disguise (the police chief said he is just a man), and this really doesn't work well if you want the readers to care about the main female character.  The author seems to have decided that "women in disguise" (in disguise as police officers or other people) would work better.  The author also gave us a new mystery to solve (a murder), which felt rushed and did not feel like an actual mystery (it was more of a "drama").   A lot of times the plot takes a lot of liberties to make the story interesting or interesting-looking. The book's plot felt to me like a set-up, as if the author wanted to make sure her main character got the spotlight.  She also introduced several new plot elements to the book in order to have her main female characters look attractive to the reader.  I found that this was the case with the main men and women characters in the book.    I found it extremely hard to believe that the author would write something so misogynistic (even though the author clearly tried her best, and didn't just give the male characters bad attitudes, but actually wrote them in such a way as to make it look like they had these attitudes).    A lot of people may think the main characters in this book have been written as sex objects, but I really don't think that is true.   I think the author did her best to keep the main women characters (and the main man characters too, since this book is set in New Orleans) as "real" people who I wouldn't want to be friends with.  Some of the female characters, such as the detective, are portrayed as "sex objects" in order for the book to have the best sales and make a lot more money.  There are a lot (a LOT) of things
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book.   It's a good story with a bit of humor thrown in for good measure.   and the ending was also well done   The plot:   In the future, when humanity has been almost entirely wiped out, the earth is being terraformed. One of the first inhabitants of the planet is a young woman called Miska, who lives in a small apartment with her best friend, Jad. There's a very simple life, the two of them eat, sleep, and play by day, work by night, and try to forget their past. But on the night before her wedding, they're awakened by a strange light in the sky. They decide to investigate, which leads to a whole series of twists and turns.   The plot is about as cliche as you can get and as cheesy as it is well written. But that's what makes this book interesting. The ending left a lot to be desired, but it doesn't take away from the good writing. It's just not a very satisfying story.   the only thing I would change about this book, but I can't imagine I'd be able to, is the ending. I could see the characters leaving, but then what happens? You don't get a real resolution to the story. There are some great ideas in here, such as that humans and artificial intelligences are going to be living side by side, but they're not brought together very well.   he setting is also very different from the one we're used to. It looks a lot more like a science fiction novel.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book, but it really doesn't belong in the fantasy genre. I don't know if this is my fault or the author's, or maybe both. A lot of the magic systems in this book are pretty simple, and the setting and characters really didn't do much for me. I felt like the world was one that was meant to be interesting, but somehow ended up feeling very flat, and a lot of characters feel like they are only in it for the sake of the story. If the worldbuilding and characters were better, then maybe this could have been a good book. But they're not, so I don  I was a huge fan of Tom Pollock, and I loved the last book in the series, The Black Mirror. This book felt very much like that book, with the world being a little more advanced than I was expecting. But then the plot happened to follow one of the most terrible things I could have seen, and it was so unbelievable I couldn't believe it was actually happening. I was hoping for a good, solid book that wouldn't try to change the rules of the fantasy game, and instead give us characters that aren't so typical. Instead, this book went for the most generic and ridiculous thing that could be thought of as a fantasy story. I think this will be a bad idea for the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I read the first 20 pages before I gave up. There were so many inconsistencies between the two women. ------------ For this review I am using the word, "disproportionate". There is a certain point in the plot where a woman who was supposed to be so beautiful and intelligent becomes a nagging nag. I've already found one woman who can't remember a lot of things she's done since she was a child. A woman who never has any real power or control over her situation. ------------- I'm still reading the book. I still can't understand the inconsistencies with a woman like that. In this book it was hard to tell where she was living and how old she was. I can tell she has a very important job. But when I go to find out, she tells me that she's not interested in that job. I understand how you can get to a certain age and think you've "figured out who you are", but you don't get to an age when you've stopped learning and making mistakes. It seems like she is too "well read" for her age, which is hard for me to believe. --------------- "So, in addition to working the night shift at the local fast food joint, Ms. McAdams is a former member of the Peace Corps who spent many months volunteering in Honduras. Her background has given her the ability to read people's emotions and quickly adjust her approach, whether to encourage or discourage." I can't imagine why there are so many conflicting aspects in this story. I have a hard time understanding how one woman can be so intelligent and yet so self-centered. I don't understand how she can know everything about so many people and yet be so uneducated on such an important topic. I could see how a person would want to go to a very difficult place to learn, but I just can't think of any reason why the woman would be so self centered and incapable of knowing when to push for a change in her life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book had very little redeeming quality and was a disappointment. There are many reasons why I didn't care for this book, and there was really not enough to keep me reading it. I read this book in a span of only 2 months, and when I finished the book, it left me feeling cheated. This is not a book that I would recommend to anyone. It didn't make me want to read anything else. The story is boring and you just want to move on.   Overall: 4.00  The only reason I rated this book 4 is because it had one thing in common with every other review, which was that I was actually looking forward to reading a good book. I expected a good thriller from this book. The plot was pretty good and the characters were interesting and realistic. Unfortunately, the ending was incredibly dull and poorly written.  The plot, I think, had a lot of potential and I just wasn't interested in any of the characters in this book - I really didn't want to be in this universe. It would have been nice to have more time to develop the characters and get to know them, but it really just fell flat for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ "I did not like this book very much. I had heard about this book on NPR but I thought it sounded very much like an old western story. I'm glad I bought it though, because I think it's a well-written story that I will enjoy reading some day."
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  I was a bit hesitant about this one but it wasn't until I read through it a few times that I really got it. I thought I would have to read it twice. I'm so glad I did.  The book covers the basic concept of what a group is and the basics of what it wants. They are organized into teams of 4. Each team is given an agenda for the meeting and is to be led by a leader who also does the planning. The leader is assigned to one team at a time while the others are left to their own devices. The plan they are to put into action is to accomplish one or two of these things (or as many as they can). If one team does not get their work done as planned, they are then given a deadline and have a week to get their project done or have a new leader assigned. If they fail to do so by the deadline, the previous leader gets reassigned. This is one of those books where the basic concepts are presented so clearly that you don't have to re-read it to understand it.   The bad part of the book is how boring it is. Even though the topics are very basic and not complex, it is still written so that even someone that is no expert on this stuff can get it. There is little to no discussion about the technicality of the subject.   the story of this book, was not very interesting to read. I've read a few other books that cover this stuff in more detail and the writing in this book was very weak. The book goes on for a while but is mostly just listing out the things to do and how to do them. The author, when writing about a topic like this, should at least describe what the subject is (not just a list of ideas and how you do them). It was very difficult to get through this book and find anything worth reading.  . I'd give it 2 stars and not 1. I think if you are going to write a book like this one, then at least make it interesting. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone that doesn't know very much about how to go about things like this. The writing is weak and not so good that the information is understandable. Also, I'd love for someone to write more details on how the different teams and leaders work.   of course, I don't know why he didn't just write a short book that explained how to form a
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- If I could change just one thing about this book, I would change my review to "don't waste your time." This book is extremely short, and it's obvious the author has no clue what she is talking about when she says things like "There is no difference between a woman with breast implants and a woman whose breasts are naturally asymmetrical or saggy" and so on. Not only is this a bad idea (and it's already stated that she doesn't understand the difference between natural and non-natural breasts, which I'll get to in a second), but she also talks about an ex-girlfriend who had the same thing and she then "re-affirmed" it in her own mind, as if she had some sort of power that she could use to change a woman's breast shape with her brain. It's an awful book, but I'm not sorry I read it, even though I know I'm going to end up getting something from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  As always, the book was poorly written, poorly plotted, poorly drawn, poorly told, and not even good enough to be considered "bad". In my opinion, they wasted their money on this thing. My only hope is that the book will make it to a big publisher, and see the light of day.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I really enjoyed this book. It was well written, and I think the author had fun writing about an interesting topic. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because the author wrote in a non-academic way, which made the reading somewhat more tedious than a good academic book would. It is very hard to read a book written by someone who does not speak to the general readership, I'm sorry to say, although that is the case for Mr. Storr."   I did enjoy the book quite a bit, but the fact that I can't think of many academic books that have me reading more to my satisfaction than this one really bothered me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written by an older couple who have both been in a hospital setting their whole life and know what it is like to be in that situation.  These people are all good people who have made mistakes.  What I didn't like: 1) The fact that they had to go to a doctor when they were just a couple of days away from being married is just silly.  This is a couple in their mid-20s, and having to go on a trip just to see the doctor makes no sense.  If they were in their late 30s or even 40s, then it would make more sense. 2) The way they treated the child they had together is just appalling.  I could never do that.  The child was born in the hospital and died when she was 3.  Her parents don't have any say over what happens to the body they gave birth to.  These parents were trying to give a better life for their child and what they did was wrong.  3) The scene that follows the funeral and the way they react to the kid that they loved, is so disturbing.  All these adults are just like that kid that was left behind.  How could someone so cold and heartless treat their child in such a terrible way?  The story goes back and forth between the first and second half.    As you see the story unfold, you see how the parents, the hospital, and the hospital staff are all trying to do the right thing for the family.  But as the story is told, you start to wonder why they can't be trusted to do that? 4) The story doesn't do anything for me.  It's about a couple who is in the beginning stages of having a baby.  There are no consequences to their choices at this point.  They had a son but they gave him away and then didn't want him.  When the child was left, they didn't really care.  Why didn't they care more? 5) The ending was awful.  In one sentence the child is gone and then in another sentence the parents have lost their son.  No explanation for why this happened.  And in the very next sentence the mother is so distraught and sad about her son being gone that she has a fit and passes out.  Again, why?  I'm not really a fan of reading about the suffering of other people, but this was way
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a huge fan of Mr. Erikson's work. This book just didn't work for me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this because of all the hype and I was extremely disappointed. This book is filled with errors and is full of contradictions and false statements. I think its important for the readers to read the book because its important to know how to read, but its unfortunate that I have to read another book to find out this information. I believe this book is a bad piece of work that should not have been released. I would not recommend this book for any students or anyone who is interested in the Bible.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed by the book. I think the whole point of the book was to tell an interesting story from the point of view of a character that nobody else cares about.  The story is just about what happens on a random day to a character who is never really noticed.  That's it.  There's really nothing to the story except for the events.  It's almost like we read about the author's random experience.  I didn't feel like I got anything out of this book.  In the end I was very disappointed by this book and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author seems to want you to buy this book, but his book is really terrible. He tries so hard to sell you on the idea that the book is a modern history book, and I have to say he doesn't even try. Instead, he starts off with an introduction by a very biased academic (yes he is a professor) that goes on to talk about the time of the American Civil War and then he shows us the lives of Confederate soldiers. Well, that is all well and good, but I know that is not who I was looking for. In the end, this book was not the history book I thought it would be. What I did get from this book is the history of an interesting time, a lot of great quotes and images, and some historical facts I was not aware of. However, after reading this book I realize it is not a history book but more of a political treatise. I am sure the author has some very valid points he wants to make and that he put a lot more time into this than he should have, but even with the research I felt that a lot was just thrown in just to get the history up and running in this book.  What I didn't enjoy:    1) The Author's style:      His use of language is not very great. For example, he refers to people as "little people," or uses the term "faggot" many times in the book. He also refers to certain historical events as "a time that no one remembers." He has an interesting point about how certain historical figures are depicted, but not others. But this is the only time in this whole book where I was a little annoyed at his style. He does do a lot with the quotes and pictures, however I found them a little heavy-handed and forced. I would not have used them in the context of a history books. I was glad I read this book just to see some pictures. And then there is the author's lack of knowledge. When he uses the phrase "a few men," I was quite sure he was talking about a certain group of men that he was trying to get across. I mean, you know, they had guns. But that is it. This is what he writes about. I couldn't find any history where he used the term that he does use. I didn`t find any reason for the phrase. That being said, it is
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book is great. It really does make me think about the human condition. It helps to remind me to be kind and be aware of my surroundings.   But.   The prose is soooo bad. I can't write about it any more than I have.   This book was really the only one I read that made me think and that made someone think. The others were all just so dull and dry.   I feel like I just wasted my time reading this book. And it has nothing to do with the book not being enjoyable.  12 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to this book because I am a fan of fantasy and medieval history. I have read the two books on the list before (The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan and The Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss) and found them great. I was looking forward for this one as well. It's a good read, with a good plot, and good characters. The writing is crisp and clear. The character's names were always interesting to me and I always liked seeing the other POV characters' names in the story.   But after reading this book, I have no regrets. This book is definitely not for kids. I can't say it's a bad read for adults as well, but it's definitely not something that kids will enjoy. My son said it was more realistic, like he was there, and that it was a "true story" and that he could understand what happened. I loved the fact that he said that, it made me feel good. However, he doesn't see it that way. I also said in the review that he thought the book was a little predictable because the "good guys" always win, so I had to explain that sometimes they lose, and in that case, they win. He found it annoying, but he understands why I like it because of the writing. The author is very well read, which I think is what makes her characters and plot so believable and I'm so happy she can bring back the historical style of the book I love so much.   and i don't know if it's the best book in the series, but I would definitely recommend this one to any fantasy lover. I would give it a 5 star if it wasn't the first in the Series, but the second in the "Three-Books in a Series" is the best.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was just a collection of one-shots which are not my favorite thing in the world.   I don't like to do one-shot's because they are so random and are not particularly great.  The writer doesn't have much to work with.  A few of them have good hooks, but many are just a random collection of stories.  These things don't do anything to help with the story at all and it just comes off as not being worth the time and effort.  Overall a bad collection.   28 of 38 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the worst book I've read in many years. It was a complete waste of my time. I read the first couple of pages and I was so sure that this book would be a great read, until the author came out and said this book is to be considered as the worst. I have spent thousands of dollars on books on this topic over the years and I cannot think of any book that is worse than this. This book is complete crap, no offense to the author. It is a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad book: **************************** This book should have been written for children and adults. The story is the story, and it is not easy to follow in the beginning, but after that the story gets better and better.   However, I think there is a good story there, but the book is not worth a buy. The book is divided into three parts, with three characters. Each character is only mentioned once. I think the author was trying to give a story to the children, but it is difficult to see it at first, because the characters are only mentioned in passing.   The first two parts are about a baby that was born with a large, thick, white wart on his cheek. The baby was supposed to be a princess, but was born without any royal privilege. He had a very hard time learning to use his mouth. Later, the baby was saved and he went to a special school. One day, the teacher called the baby to his desk and asked him a question: "Why do you play with the water in the glass?" The baby cried and the teacher said, "The glass is empty. If the water were empty, you could drink it." The baby responded by saying, "It's true, it is empty". In the end, the whole school knew the truth of the matter. When the baby reached the age of 7 years old, the water was filled and he took a drink. He looked around, and found a stone he had previously hit. He tried to hit it again, but got nothing. He said to the teacher, "I hit it three times, it's true. I hit it for three times. If it were true, then I should have gotten something out of it. I'm sure that the glass is filled." The teacher said: "The boy will not know." Then the boy died.  This book is just okay, but for the price, I wouldn't want to read it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main character is an asshole, the author uses a lot of expletives and it's a very juvenile book.  And don't even get me started on the horrible cover of this book... The cover sucks, and it will most likely be remembered as the book that gave me the worst book experience I had ever had in my life. I'm not saying that it was awful, but it was extremely poorly done... I was so angry at the cover. I can't remember the book I bought the cover for. I tried searching the internet, but I couldn't find it. It made me so mad that I couldn You're going to be so disappointed that the main character has been a total ass. She's a horrible person, an asshole.  And this is after the prologue, in which we see her in an abusive relationship. How can a book have so many mistakes? How can it be so bad, with so many errors? The author used to be a doctor and she seems to be the writer, or maybe she's a ghostwriter. But you are about to get the worst experience of your life... And now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure it's going to make you feel like this.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is hard to review this book because of the nature of the book. It is a collection of short stories that were written between 1892 and 1898. There are several interesting elements that stand out for me about this book, one is the fact that it was a collection. This is why I like it so much because it is a great example of a book with a lot of original content, but still kept some good writing. I do believe that all good stories should be preserved, as well as other things. I don't have a problem with the lack of a sequel because I don  [A few things about the main characters. The main characters are not evil, but they have a lot to teach their readers. If we can change ourselves we can also change the world. The character of Lucy is my favorite, she is a woman who is kind and humble, she tries to live a simple and humble life. She knows all the tricks of the market, she knows what is going on in the world, but she is not naive. She sees how the world is changing and how it will change in the future. She has many regrets about what she did. She loves her family, but doesn't want to hurt them. She wants to leave the world of the merchant with some money.   The other two characters are very interesting too. A good example of this is the character of Mr. B, he is a young boy from the country who is very naive and tries to make his way in the city. He has his own ideas and hopes about the future, which the other characters respect him for.   that is all I can say about this story. This book will probably always hold a very special place in my heart. I will definitely re read it because of its great characters. I wish there was more, because this is a really good book.  ...more notes Notes are private! recommender none votes 13 # times read 1 owned purchase location condition format Hardcover actions view (with text)  checkbox position cover title How the Grass got Green (Holes in the World, #1) author Pynchon, Thomas isbn 0143596529 isbn13 9780143596507 asin num pages 577 pp avg rating 3.92 num ratings 11 Lukasz's rating liked it my rating 1 of 5 stars2 of 5 star3 of 5 Star4 of 5 fan q's rating really liked it's
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book about a young girl and her stepfather that is all about being a good little girl and being treated like a princess.   The story has an amazing ending.   was a good read but it didn't wow me. the author does an excellent job at portraying the child and stepfather in a way that the author herself could identify with the parents of a little girl. It is a little sad that she is left out of the love story, but that's really the only problem with the book. the love interest is the stepfather. I enjoyed reading this book as a little book for me. It was interesting to read a little story about a child that had little friends that had nothing to do with her. This story was pretty short though but it was definitely entertaining to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I felt that there was little to no development of the main characters, with most of the action going towards a villain and his allies.  It feels that the author was more focused on showing how evil the evil villain was, and that was the only good thing about the book.  I felt it was mostly boring and tedious.  I didn't find the characters interesting.   It felt that the book did not do much to develop the main character.  This character was almost too one dimensional for the amount of things he did, and the lack of plot to keep the reader interested kept this book from getting a higher rating.  The plot felt rushed, as it would be interesting to see the characters come to a conclusion.  Although, there were plot holes and inconsistencies in the book that would have made a better book, it didn't really ruin the story.  There were many inconsistencies as to what happened with the main protagonist and how he ended up in this strange situation.  Overall, I felt the book failed to develop me into any deeper connection with the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is like reading a horror story that was written by a moron with no sense of humour. You want to put the book down, but you keep reading. If you are a fan of horror, don't pick this one up.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* "The world is about to end, and the heroes, of course, are fighting against it. However, one of them, who has a knack for being underestimated, gets caught up in the action...the heroes need help, but in the end the hero in this book is no better than a regular, ordinary person - a commoner, to be specific. What makes this book worse is that the protagonist, of all people, doesn't even realize that he is being lied to and cheated by the author. I think it is a shame that one should have to say this, but the author makes us believe in his own lies and deceitful actions. I would advise everyone to read this book, just for the pleasure of being amazed that the author is a lying coward." - Anjali.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to this book but the author, in trying to write some sort of political statement, decided to just throw in a few cliches and bad writing. Not only did he throw in the cliched cliche, but there was also an excessive amount of back story and not enough actual plot. The "revelations" at the end were just a rehash of things he already had in his book. I would have given this book a higher rating, but then I realized that I already have a few books on this topic I have not read. The book should have been called "The Book that was Promised," because it was pretty much just a collection of clicher and bad plot points.
Write a negative review about a bad book:............................................................ 2 stars from me (5 out of 5)   It's a hard sell. People that like to get into the minutia of world history and how it has affected people's lives and relationships with others will find much to like here. And that's what I get out of the book. There are certainly parts that I thought were interesting and a good idea to expand on, but overall I found the author's writing to be somewhat lazy and lacking in substance.   For example, in discussing what Hitler really wanted in the Third Reich, she makes the point that "he had no real desire to rule the world...he just wanted to have the chance to do so." This is just wrong. There is no other country on the face of the planet that has done so much to help the people of the world that Hitler wanted to rule, and he actually said that he would prefer not to rule (and by the way, he tried to overthrow his own people in one of his campaigns), but he knew that if he did, it would bring Germany down on the world. He was not interested in making a "good" world, he was interested in getting power, and that's exactly what he accomplished.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The only thing I liked about the book was the ending - when it was revealed that the 'bad guy' was the man who killed his father. What a nice, satisfying ending! But then the whole book ended with the same guy, only with a different accent - which makes no sense since the whole plot was the same. (and why were all the people 'alive' and 'already dead' at the beginning?)"
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is extremely offensive. In particular, I felt the book was written by a misogynist and was aimed at the gay community as a means to denigrate the LGBT community as the author is a closeted lesbian.  Read an honest review of this book: This book could not have been written any more accurately than it was. The gay community, or "the gays" as they are called in this book, are portrayed as a vicious and cruel group. In fact, they were portrayed as an organization that only cares about the survival of the gay sub-culture (a concept that doesn't exist) rather than the real needs of the general community. This book depicts the gay as a group of whiny children with nothing to offer society. If you care about your children, do not read this book.  in our lives to get married, have kids, become doctors, lawyers or anything else that would not only bring us happiness, but would also strengthen us and enable us to live a productive life. We are taught that "the gay" is different than everyone else; they are different; they have different needs; they need to be "tamed"; they want to force their way onto society; they want our tax dollars to be spent on their gay agenda; they can't help being gay and we can't force them to change. In this book the gays are presented as an evil group of people who have decided that they need us to change in order to thrive. They are all just bigoted, cruel and mean-spirited. The author also makes it very clear throughout this book that she hates all gays and is trying to use her story as a teaching tool on how to live. She talks about how to make people gay and how we need to let "the others" go, how we are too stupid to understand our gay friends and that we need gay friends so that we can "live together". I also found her hatred for gay people so blatant that I wanted to physically punch her in the face. I think it is important for parents to have this book available to them when they plan on introducing their children to gay people. I also feel that it is a teaching time to teach children that gay people are evil and to teach kids that "treating other people well doesn't make you more right than them".  It is important to remember that there is no such thing as gay marriage in our society. In her book, her point was that gay marriage
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "If you like this book, you will like my other book, The Secret of Gaius. It has even more sexual scenes than this one. This is a terrible book." My review:   The only good thing about this book is that it is over 10 years old.  It was written in 1987 so the sex in this book might be considered modern.   The main female character is named "Linda" and her friend, a fellow college girl named "Gina" is named Linda, also a college girl and they have a pretty decent relationship as a couple.  Linda and Gina are very well-behaved, polite college students who are good in all their social activities.   They live in a dorm in a college called the "W" where many other girls live.  The story begins with Linda and her father, a rich businessman, talking to her about her future career choices.  Her father mentions that he and his mother (her mother's father) both got into medicine and they both loved to help others but the medical field was not the path that Linda wanted to take.  She decides to take her father's advice and enrolls in nursing school.   Linda is a good student who does a lot of volunteer work for local organizations.   When Gina joins a sorority, Linda is not sure if she wants to join as well.   While visiting a sororities house at a party, she meets the sorority's president, "Cherry", a beautiful girl who will become her "hookup" for the night.   Cherry is a senior at the college where Linda is attending and she and her mother own a real estate company.  After the party, Gina meets a man named George, who also happens to be a resident of the college.  Gina is the older one (the one who chose to go to nursing school) and George is the younger one who is still trying to find his path in life.  Cherry's mother, who is also a doctor, has been diagnosed with cancer and is under a lot personal stress.  The relationship between Cherry and George starts off a little awkward at first and they are both trying to hide their feelings for one another.  When it comes to the sex, things start to turn from awkward to uncomfortable and they realize that they have feelings for each other.  Eventually they start having sex and things progress from awkward and uncomfortable to passionate and loving.  George and Cherry become
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I was expecting a good book from this author. The characters were likable. I was going to start with the next book when she came out. But this book sucked!!! First, a character that she described as "the best friend to all of her problems" was totally a bitch. Then, "I feel the love in your smile when you're looking at me" was a way of writing that you know will come out like "I love you" or "I know it's all gonna work out." But that doesn't come out right. Then "When we've been apart, I know I can never trust her again" is a way to write that you feel like a sucker and that's not fair. I also got that she wanted "to find out if anyone was the same after her death" which she never does. But the last part of the book, she doesn't reveal it was her own fault. There was so much wrong with the characters. Then I realized there was so many characters that were like characters and then one was a character. Then there were so many different parts that she just threw them all at me. When it comes to a book you have to look at it from two different ways. You have to think like the author does or you have not. So if it is your problem to have one character to relate to in a way you like, or you want her to be a character, than you don't want to read it. If it's your problem, then you will have to read more of it to figure out if it has what you want. If you want to talk to the author about why she changed things around, then let me know because that's a good point.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is so bad I would be willing to take it back to my local library, that I already own.  I read this book as a self review.  I am not a big fan of fantasy books.  I don't think it is the genre that gives me nightmares or anything, but for some reason I cannot stomach fantasy books anymore.  The closest thing I can compare the genre to is horror.  Even in the first half of this book I was wondering if it was a parody or just a terrible writing.  This book makes me feel sick.  One of the first things that I notice in this book is the writing.   For a fantasy novel, this book was bad.     The dialogue felt unprofessional.  For a book that I think was about an old man and his grandson, the dialogue was downright offensive.  As a side note, the first few chapters were very creepy.  If you haven't read this, and are looking for a book with a bit of humor in it, this is probably not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It really bothered me the way the author wrote about his experiences. It was so over the top it felt like he was trying to use the same stuff he used in his previous books to get attention. But that's what he did.  He just wanted to make more money for his self and his publisher.  One last note:  I really liked this book,  Thank you for the review, I really do read a lot of positive reviews because it's the internet and all... but I just can't bring myself to give this book four stars because the author is such an asshole that it's hard for me to give any book this low a full five stars. So I'll give this four stars instead.   This was my first introduction to a new author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I have never seen a book of this quality.   I thought it would be an excellent, well thought-out, well written book, but it wasn't. It was just mediocre.  The story was weak, the characters uninteresting and the plot wasn't even remotely coherent.  I've been meaning to read this book for awhile, but haven't gotten around to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it's very bad.  The narrative feels forced and contrived.  And the "twist" ending is, if not completely pointless, at least not entirely interesting or interesting enough to carry the entire book.  I couldn't even get through the "cliffhanger" of the book at this point (though it could have been easily avoided if I had actually kept a close eye on the text and had done a couple more things with my time than I did in the book, like reading a few other reviews of the same book and then doing a google search).  That's my final complaint about this book.  "The book was interesting from the very beginning, and I think I may have liked it better if I hadn't read other reviews that were so angry and scathing.   The writing itself is excellent and I'm glad I tried the book.   But I would have liked to have read more about the characters and the setting and not just the twist ending.    I wish the book had a few more pages left in it before the ending came along.  I would also have liked a few pages in it to explain why that ending was so much better than the other one.  The ending was great and the twists made sense, but I wish that I had at least learned more about what had happened and why it was happening.  For example, I feel like I didn't understand why this character had to kill someone and why she wasn't punished for it, if only the reader had been told that.   There were also too many characters, and too much of them did not seem to really have a strong or significant role in the story.  They just sort of kind of happened and happened to be around the same time or had similar characteristics, which is kind of a bummer.  So for me, the book just wasn't good.  It was fun though, and a little challenging, but it's a poor choice for those of us who want to be entertained or learn something.  For people who are looking for an interesting read that is full of twists and turns, a well done twist ending, or a character that becomes important later on, this may be just what they're looking for."

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book will not teach you about anything, other than the idea that you have a penis.  If you are reading this book you are a pathetic excuse for a human being and this book is designed to make you want to commit a rape.  It will also make you angry.  You are the one in your right mind who read this book!  It is written by a woman for other women and for other dumb females who are thinking about having children and have never read a book by a man.  There is NO REAL HUMAN REASON why you are being treated so badly.  The main characters have no idea what to do with their genitals and so are constantly going around making babies.  I feel sad that I had to read this because I wanted a little brother.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book. A lot of people say they liked it but I didn't and I wanted to like it more. I feel as if this book was written for younger children who were more gullible and who didn't understand a lot of the concepts presented. I was looking for a book like this with lots of action and adventure. Unfortunately it fell way short of expectations. I didn' t even like the villain in this book at all. I guess he seemed a little too evil but at least he was evil. I had to stop reading for over half a day because it was so hard to follow what was happening. I think it was too hard to keep track of who was who and what was what. I really don't know what the author intended with this book and I don't feel like I could read the second half. I don' t recommend this book to anyone. I can see how it is popular with younger kids but that's about it. The story was very confusing and I didn t understand a thing that was going on. I have a hard time believing the author knew what he was writing about or was even trying to make it simple.   This book has a lot to offer. I would recommend this for older children who are looking for an exciting adventure. But if you are a kid, just be prepared to be completely confused.  , December 5, 2009  I like this book   The children's stories are fun and entertaining but the adult parts are not very interesting.   to the reviewers  You did not like it because it's not like a children's book?   That's a good question.   in my opinion  it is hard to say what this book is really about.  - the people in the book are adults.   He doesn't seem like an adult to me. He doesn' t act like an a kid does. He seems like an elderly man. He was rude and mean to children and sometimes adults. He had a dark side.   the villains were good, but there was too much emphasis put on them not having a conscience. They were not really people.   - I was not surprised that the kids loved this book so much. They are always playing with the stories. It is a good way to get them interested in stories and how they make people feel.  to the book:  This is a well-written book. I enjoyed it. It was interesting to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first book in this series did not really interest me but the third was amazing! I have to say this was one of the most fun books I have read this year! The author really knows how to use some awesome illustrations for each and every character and I loved the characters for sure! The story is great and the characters are so unique. I have high hopes for the fourth book because it really feels like it is a conclusion. There are definitely a lot of questions left open and that is a good thing! I would recommend this book to anyone, but I personally am still excited for what is coming next. I am also really curious about the new hero in this story and hope that he turns out to be a very powerful hero. I highly recommend this series and look forward to the next book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was reading this book at about the same time I was trying to decide whether or not to start The Great Gatsby. This book didn't have as much substance as the Gatsbys, but it did what it set out to do: tell a great story. I didn't care what happened with Mr. Fowley, who was supposed to have been murdered in the novel, so long as he had become one of those characters that everyone loved in the great Gatsbye novel. The book was just an amusing and entertaining tale, but that was the biggest reason I finished it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a pretty bad book for me!  There are some parts where the story seems to be going in the right direction, however the story is all too predictable, with the villain in control.  Also the main character (The Big Bad) is a really boring and one-note character, who has no actual personality whatsoever and who has very little plot.  Read all reviews 1 of 5 people found the following review helpful: 'This is a very good story, but not for my taste. The author does a great job of making the reader understand what's going on. I like the way she manages to write a heroine that's believable even if she's a bit of a bimbo. (I think she's also the first woman writer to have written that kind of book). The story was good until the last half, when it all got a bit too predictable and predictable too. It was also confusing why the main villain was such a jerk, when they really do seem to be good at killing people. I was really hoping that the Big Bad would change. As it is, I'm not sure it's as though they had the opportunity to kill him. So, the ending was a little disappointing. But I can live with that.'

Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________________This is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. It takes a couple of pages to get into and the first 5-10 pages are very easy reading and well-written, the book progresses slowly to the end and it seems very rushed with very little detail in the narrative, the plot seems to be in a hurry to get to the good part. In some of the most interesting parts of the novel you have to wonder what kind of world this world is and what kind people are living there. This is a very well written novel and well researched about the world the book is set in, but the plot just never progresses and the whole book is rushed and rushed is just the opposite of the book's name, this is just a horrible book. I read it because I had to and I gave it 4 stars because it is so entertaining. A lot of people have said it is a good book and if you are into history, that is fine, but don't go into it expecting to like it. It's just a crappy book, and I don't recommend it, but if you like history you might like it, maybe you will like the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was definitely a one stop shop for those who wanted to read some fun and easy to read fantasy. This book is actually a series of five, each book is a separate story, and one of the characters, one who happens to be my daughter's crush, the lead, is a young boy. But for the sake of making this review as short as I could, I will summarize the plot, and what I really liked. The setting is the Kingdom of Farthing. The kingdom is ruled by King Lestan, who is a tyrant, and his rule is tyrannical and cruel. The king is not very knowledgeable about politics or diplomacy, and he is just a tyrant. His wife is also very tyrannical, and is very cruel. Lesten is a man who wants to make a name for himself, and wants to become a King by killing the people around him, and this starts the story. The characters are not all too interesting, but I enjoyed the main character, and I found him fun to read.   However, the problem with the plot is the fact that it starts off so bland. And then the plot starts to unravel as you read. The story itself is good, and very well written, but it was hard to get interested in the plot. And it was not too hard to imagine that something was going on with the people in the kingdom. It is also difficult to believe that Lestin could have murdered, and had murdered, anyone, because he would have known that it was against the law, but he did. And he knew that some people would be against him, because of his actions. And there were other people in Farthing, and the town, who were against him. There are also other characters who did not want him to become king. And you start to think that maybe this is why he acted the way he did, but Lestar did. But the plot was not very interesting, and it did not provide much in the way of twists.   in the end, this was just a bad read for me. I would not read another book in the series. I do recommend that you read this one, but in the meantime you should do some research about the history of the Kingdom, and its history.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I got the audio book for this book. I have no idea how long it took to get from the email to getting the book. (Maybe it was the Amazon.com delay.) It was a very long wait, and I hate waiting. The story is pretty good. (I will say that I was not the target audience of the book -- mostly because I don't listen to audiobooks very often and I'm not a fan of fantasy.) Still, I liked the story. It was easy to understand, and the characters had an interesting personality that was unique. If you like a good story, I recommend this book; however, if you don't like a lot of fantasy, I would not recommend this one. I'd say that if you like fantasy, this book is great.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A young woman had taken an interest in the story of Mary Queen of Scots and her story was not really related to the rest of the stories. I wasn't sure whether she wanted to read all of the books or was interested in this one. I didn't know about this book before reading it.   I was so excited to read this one that I ordered it without knowing anything about it. The book was very exciting for me. I liked all of Mary's adventures. She lived a good life. The story was quite good. This is my first book about Mary.   and the ending was interesting. I don't think I would have liked the ending much, but it was an interesting way to go. The characters were all a bit stereotypical.   the main character was a bit annoying, but she wasn't bad in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't really have a problem with this book. It was okay, but I have problems with how it's presented and the main characters, for some reason I felt more of a kinship with Harry, than with the others. He was a character with a real purpose and a lot of depth, and it was disappointing to see that the reader is left with the same basic characters, but with a different narrative. But I'm not going to write a negative story about the book, because there were parts that were really entertaining and interesting, and I loved the ending.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book in March of this year. I love the sound of the title, and when the cover came open it brought me to a page I have never seen before and thought it was really neat to be able to read in this form.  However, I have read the book before in the paperback, but never on the Kindle.  This is the first in what I hope will be a series of audiobooks of her works.  My issue was not with the narration; it was with the writing.  It is so poor.  The dialogue is very stilted and the tone is all wrong.  I know there was some thought put into the writing, but I would have liked to know what the heck I was reading, as there was absolutely no depth to the characters, and the story felt so far removed from what I knew of her other works that I almost laughed out loud.  Overall, this audiobook is an uninspired, unmemorable, stilting listen.  At the time I picked this book up, I would never consider recommending it to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is awful.  It is so bad it is almost comical.  The main characters are both so shallow and stupid.   We also have an incredibly boring plot.  I will not give any spoilers here but this book will suck you in and make you want to get to the end because everything is going to be wrapped up so nicely.  There is only a brief mention of how everything works, which you will never learn.  They also never explain how the power of the dark side is obtained so there is only one way that you can ever acquire that power.  So far this series has given me a headache and I am really not sure if it will continue or end here.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read this book because I have the book on my nightstand (I don't want to take it out). It came as a Kindle book and it seems to be written in the style of a comic. The cover of the book is very interesting and it has the comic strip on the front cover. It came with a Kindle reader (kindle e-reader) which is nice.  It's kind of a funny book to read. The story is fairly interesting but not very engaging.   The book is about a man who goes to a hospital and is a patient in a coma. The main character has a lot of funny comments and thoughts that come from his head and then he dies. I like the style. It feels more like an interactive cartoon than a comic book.  Overall I liked the story but the artwork and characters were somewhat annoying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a good read but the author really needs to know what a good idea is! I really like the concept of a vampire but not the execution. It is a great idea to have the vamp who is a part of the human world to also be able to become one but with a few tweaks.   I'm so disappointed that a book with such a good premise would come out so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "A wonderful story of love, betrayal, and revenge. As a reader, I couldn't put it down." "A very interesting story." I am currently reading this book, it is extremely hard to put down! I like the dark and mysterious atmosphere, but the story isn't too complicated. The story is about a girl, who decides to travel to a parallel world for a trip, to find a treasure. But in the parallel world, there are also creatures called witches and dragons, that are attacking the people. Because of this, she decided to travel alone to find the treasure and the dragons, to rescue the people, who are fighting each other. She will try to fight against the evil witch in her adventure. But she didn't expect that one of her friends will be in her journey, too...

Her father is the mayor and he is a cruel man who wants to make sure no child of his comes back alive. She is not too fond of this guy, but she does not have any other choice than to live with this kind of environment. She goes to the local college for a year and is a student there, which is where she met a stranger named J.A.D. (pronounced "jack"). They are good friends and are in love. However, J. A. D., seems like he is always hiding something. He wants to know what is going on in her life, and even if he can't find anything, he still finds it interesting to watch her.

Luckily for her, her brother is a magician and is the one who found a way to get
Write a negative review about a bad book:   When I started out reading The Secret, I wanted to love it, but I was disappointed. There were lots of characters that I loved in this book. They were all strong, fun, and had a wonderful time. But I felt there were some who didn't deserve to be part of the action, such as the children, the man who is obsessed with eating food, and the guy who gets himself thrown in jail, and it was really hard for me to connect to them. I felt like I didn't understand their personalities or motivations. I don't want to sound like a jerk, but when a story is about a group of characters who are friends, it's hard to relate to them or even like them. As a woman, I felt that I was the only character I could relate to, but other than that, I wasn't terribly fond of the characters. And there's always room for improvement. But overall, I didn,t love The Secret. It had a lot of good writing, but it didn't have me hooked enough to keep reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   This book is about a little girl called Jenny who finds herself in a world of magic and dragons. Jenny has no real memory of her parents or grandparents, except for their names, and her memories are based on her reading books. Jenny is told by a witch that the reason she has no memories of her past is because she has been brought into the world by an old man in a blue dress who is named "Old Man". Jenny has been separated from her parents and is at the orphanage because she is too young to go back home. As I read, I kept wondering how much of Jenny's life was real, and how much was made up, and I was just glad that the author got a few things right.   The story starts out with Jenny being forced to eat a poisoned apple, which sets off a series of events that eventually bring her into a magical world where she finds a friend called a dragon. At the beginning of the book, I had doubts that this would work, but it turned out to be quite fun. A lot of the books in this series were good, but this one was pretty good. The magic and dragon world was interesting and did a good job of making the readers think that things were happening while Jenny is still having adventures.  , I think this one would have worked better if there had been a bit more emphasis on Jenny's personality, and a bit less emphasis on magic. The author should have told a little more of Jenny as a person. It was a good story, but I think she should have focused a bit on her personality.   of her emotions, and was much more involved in the action of the story. The problem I had with the book is that there was no sense that she was really in the story or really that much of a part of it, and in the end it made things a little too easy, and she was like a side character.   has a really interesting plot and I really liked it. The story wasn't perfect and had some inconsistencies, but that is to be expected, and Jenny's interactions with the dragon and other characters made things interesting. Overall, I thought this was a fun and interesting book, and it was interesting to read a fantasy book where a little child has more power than the adults in the world. I'm definitely interested in seeing where this series goes.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book back when I was a freshman in college. It was at a time when I really wanted to be a writer, and I took a copy from my father who would often buy me books for the weekend to help me finish them (when he got home from work). I was so enthralled with it, I took it to the university library where I would be able to spend hours with it and have it all in one place. The book is a very good read, but my experience was nothing like the one described by the author. I will not read it again because the author's writing style is so inconsistent and uninteresting.  His prose is too descriptive, his descriptions are sometimes vague and he's extremely obtuse and doesn't understand some of the basic rules of grammar and the English language.  He is clearly trying to make it sound like a good book.  This book is great for the history buff, as it was a time that people were interested in the history of the world, including things like writing and writing style.  It's also worth a read for people interested in world history and those who like historical fiction.  I've been meaning to read it for years.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book for Christmas when I was in my early 20s, but only read it twice. It took me 5 years to read it, and I didn't even like it. I thought it was just a bit too dry, and the writing style was really boring. But it did make me laugh.   This book made me feel sorry for a bunch of the characters, which I didn.t want to do in a book like this. But I really liked the characters and the way they developed, and felt sympathy for a few of them. I liked their stories as much as the rest of the book, but it just wasn't me.  13 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________________ This book is horrible and has no redeeming quality, i don't think i can even continue reading it, the writing style has nothing to do with the story and the author just makes it sound like he wants to write a novel. I just want to stop reading it as soon as i started.   I've read this book 2 times. First time was because my cousin recommended it, second time was to read a review on Goodreads, my uncle recommended it and told me to read it and i read it in about 2 weeks, and then read the review on Amazon and it was one of the worst book i've ever read, this book is so bad it made me hate to read, it's so bad that if this author ever wrote any book it would be called crap.  , i have a feeling, if you have read this novel then you have a bad taste, you will love the book but don't want to finish it just because its bad, this is bad for everyone except the one who liked this novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *******************I bought this book because the author had written a "memoir" of her life. In the preface she described her life as "a lonely, miserable and difficult life." My impression is that this is a very sad, lonely, and difficult story with a few happy moments sprinkled in. In addition to all this, the book itself is very poorly written. There are no real characters or anything. The book starts with a chapter-length description of her mother, her stepfather, her sisters, her husband, and their families. Then it jumps to her childhood and early college days and her years as a "dentist's assistant." She describes her divorce and the rest of her relationship with her husband and describes the breakup and reunion with her children. It's all pretty much the same. The only real difference is that she had one less child than she had at the end of the book.The story of how she met the father is not interesting. In my opinion, the author was trying to make the reader think the whole time that her father is the main character, but then the story moves on to another relationship between the father and the kids.I have a feeling that some of the characters (especially the fathers) are not really present in the book, since they were so distant and not all that interesting. There's no way the characters can have such long-distance relationships with one another. If the characters really were all that important in the story, then the author would have had to do something special to get to know them before this book. The main characters seemed rather bored and I think they would have gotten on a train to California in no time.One thing I really liked about this book was the fact that it has a pretty clear delineation of the genders in relation to each other. It had so many great things going for it, but one thing was that it was so clear that this book is "not for girls." The author is very aware of this and tries to make it seem like her daughter is just an adult female, but the way she is written makes it clear that she is really not. The author uses the word "frigid" over and over, so many times in fact, that it's almost like a catchphrase. This book really was just for a kid. I think the book was originally meant for boys, but when they had to write a female version, they made the book for girls. But I think that the
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________   This book is not that great. It is a collection of short stories and novelettes, the kind of thing that gets published in the little magazines of the day and is not published today.   It is so bad that I can't even imagine the author could be a writer or even that the story would have been good.   (It is one of the first books of a series about a witch who is not a witch.)   The first story in this book, "The Boy in the Dress", has no characters or even the basic plot: a boy dressed as a girl and gets caught.   I am not sure who this girl is, or if it is a story to scare children, since I have never heard of such a story.  , and all the stories are pretty much the same. I have heard of some great stories about real girls, and I thought that this book was as bad.   the "Boy in the House" is about a girl who becomes a boy and has to live in a boy's house because the father doesn't want to look like a girl, so the girl becomes a girl again. I don't think she has any friends in the house and she goes to see a woman who is a witch. Then the girl gets into trouble because she goes into the girls room when the witch is not there and falls in love with a boy in the family. The girl lives in a room with a girl's toys and a girl in it. Then there is "The Girl in the Tree". There are three people living in a tree. They must help each other get into a tree house because there is a fire in a cave and if they don't they will all die. This is a good story, but it is only two pages long and it only has the girl and the witch.        the first story that I thought was a bit better was "The Little Girl Who Could not Read". This story is about an old lady who lives in an old house, and she is able to read. She makes a little boy who doesn't understand her speak and sing the little song she sings.   The old lady is always singing and talking and trying to make the little boy understand her. This story could have been a real story if it had not been just two pages.   It does not have a happy ending, and this is also a short story. In this story the little girl
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... I bought the first book in this series, The House at the End of the World, and I was excited about the story, so I went in eager to start reading. I was wrong.   There was not one moment I was not disappointed and there were many times I was confused as to what was happening in this book.  One of the main characters, the main heroine, is a witch! In fact she is a wizard.  If you can believe it she is described as the most powerful person on the planet, so far, in her entire world. In other words, she is an old woman.  She runs a school for young witches, she teaches children to become witches, and she has a special ritual she calls a Winter Dance.  Why would a powerful wizard need a school? She has no students!  The book opens with a scene in which the main character goes to the school to get a list of students who have already attended.  A couple of pages later she meets a young man who wants to join.  At the end of the book we find out what happened to the boy, but not how it happened.  As the main book has only been out for a few months we really can't say that this has been a great introduction to the series.   5 out of 5 stars Amy This was a great start for what should be an excellent series. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to all the other books. Thanks for writing it. I'll be buying your other books too.  3 out of 4 stars Amy I did not enjoy reading this book at all. First the author's description of the school was off. She said it was in rural France. I do not know what I expected but I would be hard pressed to find any school that is not in some place of Europe. I am not a big fan of reading about the bad side of life and I don't know why this author chose to put this in this story. I will not recommend this book to anyone.  a book i was looking forward too read it not a good start at all i liked the characters but when the author said there were no children a book I thought i would have enjoyed more  4 out of 8 stars Amy The books about a woman's quest to travel to another world are interesting, imaginative, and entertaining. I liked the story of the two witches in the first story. However, I have
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible, I had to read it over and over in order to actually finish it, and it has nothing going for it.  It is basically a poorly written story with very few surprises.  And no, I'm not saying that I'm going to start reading a book and not finish it because it has a horrible plot.  It has been very hard to finish the book in the first place and after reading this book over and again and coming up with nothing, I just stopped reading the story and moved on.  I would recommend this book for people who enjoy reading bad stories.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is not a good one, and this review is just for the reasons that make me think that, even if it is a good book, it is not one of those books I would have wanted to read, but not a terrible one either, it will not do you any harm and would probably be of benefit to you. I would like to talk a bit about why this book is really a great example for me and why I would read other similar books, but first a brief explanation about myself and why i have written this review: I am a guy that usually likes sci-fi and fantasy. I'm not going to deny the fact that I like the genre. But, I have a rather peculiar problem when it comes to it, which is the fact of being an intellectual (and a very good one), but the fact still, that i'm not really able to get emotionally involved in it. I mean, sure, i think that there is some plot development in this book, but i don't like it that much, and the book is actually just a bunch of ideas. I wouldn't say that i really like any of the characters, but what i love about this book the most is the idea, and what i think is a really interesting one: that we are actually the real heroes of the book. The protagonist isn't trying to save a world he doesn't understand. He's not trying to change it, he's not even trying to get his way. Instead, he just wants to make some new friends, some new experiences and maybe get something out of it. It is a very optimistic thought. Not one that is so cynical, like "this is a terrible book, please don't read it and be happy with what you have and never try anything new". The way it is written, it actually feels like he's trying to do something good. I could also see the author as being very sincere, because this book could be really bad (it is, by the way), but at the same time, he makes the point that this is not the kind of book one should try and read because it will just destroy you emotionally and psychologically. But it's a nice point, and it just makes me want to give this book a try, because that's all i can really say about it. This is an interesting thought to me, and i'm going to try it out, because i really think that it's one of the best books i've read
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not a book that I would have purchased if I had any idea that the author, Steven St. John, would use it for such cheap and obvious attempts at shock, the author's own words: "It is the sort of book that, once you read it, you will be unable to forget.". I'll bet that St. George's Dragon by Steve St.john is the kind of book he uses for his cheap shock value.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I've heard many people say that The Dragonbone Chair is a wonderful fantasy novel and I can't agree more. I'm a sucker for an epic fantasy novel, and The Dragon Bone Chair definitely delivers. There are a lot of great ideas in here, but The DragonBone Chair goes a little overboard at times. The plot twists are too confusing, and it really seems as though the author is giving you the wrong impression of what happens. I can only read it from beginning to end in one sitting (which was probably a mistake). I was left a little cold. Overall, a fantastic book, but maybe not the best to read in one session.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very poor. The story is very confusing and it starts out slow. If you are a sci fi fan, like myself, you will be bored after a few pages. It is really not a good book for anyone, I have not read any more of this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** I read this book with great enthusiasm about a month ago, then never looked at it again, because I never finished. The characters were boring, and the story wasn't that interesting, even if the ending wasn't as disappointing as I anticipated it might be.   The main character was called Dwayne, and he seemed to be the main character throughout. Dwayne was a very good writer, and it was very interesting to watch him write his letters to his sister, and her letters back. However, once he gets to the point where he's writing a book, it's as if he doesn't even know what he's doing, and I felt like I was reading someone else's letter, not his. There were a few really good moments, but overall, this book is just a boring book.   at 5 stars I would give it a 4 because I felt the characters were interesting and the ending was surprising and well-done.   is written by a young author, and this book was first published in 2010. I'm surprised it was published in the U.S., because my parents don't have a subscription to the online booksellers I went through, and my local bookshop didn't carry it. I would highly recommend this book, and a good read for people who like to write, and have a taste for good writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is horrible and I don't understand why anyone ever gave it a chance. The plot is completely confusing, there are no clear characters, there is no real plot, there's no story, it's just a bunch of people in the background talking about how terrible the book is. The author goes on and on and there is never a clear explanation of who is who and what is what. The story is only about six pages long and is completely uninteresting and meaningless. It took me 4 times to understand anything, it just took me the most time of any other book I've ever read. If you have any interest in writing you should avoid this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a boy who, after losing his mother, is taken into a cult. He's kept in a small house, fed a diet of dog food and milk. The cult uses violence and sex to keep the child in line. The book is hard to follow. I lost a lot of time in the last 100 pages of this book. I don't know what the author was trying to tell me, but he just didn't make it.   The writing style is repetitive. The first few chapters are slow, and the first few paragraphs are very hard to read. After that, the prose changes drastically. The prose becomes descriptive and fast-paced. The author does not explain anything that doesn't absolutely need to be explained. I'm not sure if the writing was rushed for the sake of brevity or what. There are no dialogs, just description.  . The only reason why I was able to finish the book is because of the fact that there was an appendix that covered the entire book in a simple and concise manner.     If you're interested in this book, I would recommend you skip the first 100 pages. Otherwise, you'll have a difficult time finishing this book (unless you've already read it).   Overall:   
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________ When you start a book that you have never read before or if you've never read a good book you think is good, you begin to have expectations for it, and at times, those expectations come true. I had no idea what I was getting into when I got the copy of A Very Good Person, and it ended up not being any good. I was expecting a lot out of this one, a book I'd read a few years ago. I am really hoping the story turns out to be good, but for me, it was not. I don't know why I got this book. It had a couple of things I enjoyed, the language was really funny, but the story didn't strike me as good, and a lot of the details in the story just didn't seem relevant to me. It was mostly a funny book that was not that exciting. I'll just say that there are better novels out there and that I'm looking forward to reading another one that is more interesting and better written. If you like funny book, then this is for you.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to this book. I like fantasy and the kind of thing I like is the stuff where you're living in the middle of nowhere and your town is falling apart and there's not really much, but this book had me really scared.  I was lookingforward to this, too. It's all about an evil magic and it takes place on the coast of some sort of continent or another. It was all set there, with a lot of weird places in it, and not a lot I found interesting. I found most of the world building boring, and the story was boring. The whole book I felt like there was no tension, no danger, not enough of anything going on, the characters were dull and annoying, and I couldn't see why anyone would read this. It all comes down to the plot which is really poor and the writing is really bad. And it's not even a good book; it's a really bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~* I was very pleased with this book, although I am a HUGE fan of the series. My only complaint was that it was very dry. There was really no humor, just the same sad story, same crappy characters. But it was still good, it just didn't have the punch it should have had. The other reviewer is wrong: this book was the best in the series, I feel, although it is still not the best of the books. The first book in the "Drylands" series is great and worth reading: it is just a great way to learn about the series that you have probably heard of but never read. This is a great book for a first time reader. But, this book is very dry and does not have any humor to it, it's very depressing. It would have been better if there were more jokes in it or maybe if I had not read the previous books first, I would have read this one instead of the previous two. It is still a good book if you want to learn more about the characters and the world. I am very glad I have this book because it is an excellent way to start your journey through the series as the other books aren't as good as the previous ones.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a book for those of us who love literary fiction, who love historical fiction or who have ever had the opportunity to read an epic fantasy or mystery. This is a very shallow, self-absorbed, shallow book.   There is no real plot, there is no character development and it is devoid of any plot or any real interest.  It is a book that just has you sitting there reading it and waiting for the next story and then, the next and the next.  I would not recommend this book to any kind of reader.  This book is not worth the money, and I am giving it 2 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. In the first chapter a guy is explaining the difference between a positive thought and a negative thought when the reader thinks they are listening to his negative thought. This book should have been titled How to Think Like an Atheist. The atheist in me wants to talk about how the "godless" and "rational" approach to life are the same mindset, as the author says. Then the author is a complete idiot when it comes to psychology. I'm surprised the author hasn't died from having no idea what he's talking about. I'll just keep this review at 2 stars. Also, there's a section that reads "this is the first of a series, and this will be the last", but then the book isn't. This one isn't worth a dime.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book doesn't really need a bad review.   It starts off with a bang, right after the opening quote:   "He found himself suddenly and completely overwhelmed by a sense of loss. This loss of identity, this loss of being, this new feeling of no longer belonging to a community. He felt lost as well as he had been lost. He could feel his skin burning, the warmth of his chest was getting worse and worse, and it was getting harder and harder to breathe."   I can't think of an earlier book that felt so strongly about loss, this could be the one. It feels as if I had been in the middle of a fire, with the fire itself, a fire that felt like it was growing and growing and that could almost cut me apart. It's like an intense physical pain, which is hard to describe because you feel it physically. It was an intense emotional pain, like I had just lost a close friend. I feel like I was there. I know this isn't entirely true and this is just a taste of the book but it is hard for me to describe how intense this was. I can't describe it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this in an online review about this book, and the comments there are very negative. The reviewer complains that this book is very difficult and the prose is so clunky and hard to read that you lose the meaning of the text. I am completely with this reviewer. If I had read this book over a computer screen in my college library, I would probably have given up on it long ago.   This book was very much a college course. It covered several areas: English Literature, Latin, Mathematics, etc. The professor did his best to give a very challenging yet rewarding reading experience. I would say that the professor was successful in this task because the text is very clear and easy to understand, which I think is a good thing to have in a college textbook.  - The writing is very hard-core English Literature with a bit of Latin thrown in.  - The author does an excellent job of making the reader feel as if he has really been reading and studying something profound.  has a problem understanding the complex ideas of grammar and language structure, and because of that, it's not so helpful for a reader to read this on a computer or tablet. It's too difficult for him to follow and is difficult to understand even for someone that has already read the book. I think that if this book was intended for a college audience, the author could have provided a much clearer explanation of grammar, sentence structure, etc., for the book's college course readers.  the reader has to be extremely patient and determined to understand each sentence and is likely to read it several times just to get the meaning, which is kind of frustrating.    If you are in a rush or you are not a college student, I recommend that you not read this textbook and instead try a different book. There are numerous better textbooks for English literature and Latin for a less cost. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story itself was okay, but the way they wrote the book as a whole is not.  I would not recommend it to anyone, and have a very hard time putting it down.  I loved the concept of it.   It is a beautiful book, if a little too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________   First of all, this book is not well-written. I can't think of a single thing wrong with it, but I'm not the kind of person that needs an author to be the "greatest writer" because my stories just seem to work. I'm just writing. So it may well be that my stories have problems. I haven't come to any conclusions one way or the other, but this is not the first book I've tried that didn't work for me.   I'm starting to feel that I might as well start with "Divergent" (which isn't even about a Divergent, I think), because I hate everything about this book. The whole premise is a disaster, which is not too much of a surprise given that it's being written by a guy who has written two other books with this premise. The "diversity" aspect isn't really that strong, either; it seems to be very specific to characters that the author's friends can't stand, but even they are not that different from one another.  ...   Now, the plot! The book is about a group of young people who have been put into a school for "special needs kids", which is a euphemism for children with intellectual disabilities. I do not have children with these disabilities, and so I'm a bit more informed about what's going on.   is not for children. It's really about a couple of students who have a lot of trouble adjusting to life at school, and are put in a "diverse" classroom with students who are similar to them. What the author didn't understand is that "diversification" is not a great thing. In the end, this whole book feels like an excuse for poor writing, and poor characterization. If it were actually about a character who's special, or a character that is different from other characters, I'd give it a much better rating.  , but it is about this. The main problem with the characters is that they all seem to be so shallow. This isn't a bad thing by itself, but in the author, this is treated like a flaw, so the story becomes about the characters themselves instead of about their experiences at school. I've read a lot about what this book teaches kids about autism, and I don't believe a single one of it is true. I think that autism is a spectrum, not a monolithic group of problems,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book before I went on my first trip to India, so I only had the very first book, so this review is based on my experience at that time. I am going to start by saying that this book is great, as great as you'd expect from an author that is known for writing the perfect book. I loved every single bit of it, and I was so glad to read more of his other books.   Here's my problem with the book. It seems like there's an author trying to out-think his readers in terms of the structure of his story. First there's the problem of the first chapter, where he uses an out of character, un-thought out dialogue to describe a specific event in his life that he is completely oblivious of the consequences of. He then sets up a series of events that I found out about afterwards, which seems extremely convenient, and leads to one of the worst plot twists I've ever seen. He goes into the setting of a scene in a very contrived way, and then the rest of the book is based around his character reacting to the situation in a contrived, illogical, and often unbelievable way.   the author goes to the extent of using very cliched and contrived character names (like "Yodh" and "Wapda" for instance) and then he tells the story about them in the same way, so the reader assumes it is a very typical and cliches manner in which he relates the story. He uses a lot of phrases that aren't just the obvious plot devices like "I was born to do this" or "She couldn't wait to get home." These phrases have been used in many other books and so you'd think this author would at least have some common sense and know better, but in this case it shows that the author is not very familiar with what he's doing, and is instead just trying to be original, and trying to say things you would never expect to hear from a fictional character.  , you know it was a bad idea because it's so out of place and it seems like such a contrivance. If you take into account that the scene was set in the first book the way the author wrote it, it doesn't make much sense. I didn't get the sense of any real conflict, as the main character doesn't do anything except think in a totally self-centered way. What I think is the most
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My wife and I were planning to get a copy of this book for Christmas but it was too expensive so I read this book instead. I don't remember all the words or anything so I'll take a few liberties with what I heard from the book. The book is about the world of the game and how it is made. I think it should be called "Making Your Own Game" because you don't create something that is already "supposed" to be there. It's not really something I could relate to but I don.t remember what the author said to me. I guess I'm still a little angry at the developers of the video games. It seemed the games were in dire need of a bit of tweaking and that it was a waste of time and money to go through the development process to find that out. I'll get back to this book and see if it's worth the $15 I paid. I had high hopes for it. I'm going to read the other reviews first to see if that's the same. Good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book. I liked the premise and the story that was told. I didn't enjoy the characters or the plot or the ending.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't my cup of tea. I would have to say that this book would have been better served with the introduction of the main characters, because then it would have had more character development. The only character that I really liked was the main villain of the book.  I thought that the plot was weak and that it didn't really develop very well.  This is a very well written book and I enjoyed it immensely.   "The End of the End" is a well written and engaging book that I would recommend to people looking for a short thriller novel.  I think it would be fun to listen to and would keep me engaged for about 4 to 5 hours.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hated the beginning of this book so much that I had to do some research on how to give it a good rating to try to get more people to pick it up. I think it has potential but would probably be better off with the original publisher who has more experience than I do. I liked that she took the time to create these character and that's something you really don't get a chance to do in YA novels and I think that might help her in the future.   My only problem with it is that I was expecting so much more from her writing style and style of storytelling and the world building. I mean, how much of the original trilogy did you take into account? I mean she had some of the characters and things in the first book and then all of a sudden in the third book the world is gone and she starts building a completely different world and all of this stuff that I love in the original series just disappeared.   I don't mean to sound bitter but it just seems like she's so lost in this world that she doesn't know what she's doing and I just found it frustrating and depressing that I have to wait another year to find out what happens next.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have nothing against the author of this book, she was very helpful and made me want to be a writer.   But when I read the book, I was so disgusted, I would not recommend this book to anybody. The prose is poor and the grammar is horrible and the characters are very annoying. The book does nothing to introduce the characters. It is all about the main characters, it is not about anyone else. The main characters seem to have no flaws and no real lives outside of this work.  I would never recommend this to anybody to read.  I would not even recommend this on a rainy day if you do not mind reading an unpleasant book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book. But the ending is not what i wanted. i really love to be in a relationship with a man, but as soon as i started reading this book, i was scared of it. i am a very spiritual person, so i feel like i am losing a connection to my spirituality. i can not tell what the hell happened in that last chapter, and i am so sad. it was really interesting to read about how they met, and how they grew, but in the end, it was so not happy. i would not recommend this book to any of my friends.  29 of 30 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not bad by any means, but there are a few things that I would change, most notably the lack of any sense of humor.  As a writer, I have to admit that I really enjoy a good laugh and this book did not provide one.     5 out of 5   I read the first book about 12 years ago, it was a great book. This one is a little more complex, but the stories are amazing.   5 out.  I'm a huge Tolkien fan.  A little older than some, but I find the Lord of the Rings very compelling and the book was very good.  For this price it's a great read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In my opinion this book is garbage and should be considered by any and all "hard" science fiction fans as garbage. I gave it a 6/10 but at this point I'm giving it a 1/10.  It has a lot of problems but if you're looking for a good read in this genre you need to get something else. In my view the problem is the writing style. It is very hard to follow what the characters say because they just randomly repeat a few phrases over and over.   The dialogue is often repetitive and makes the writing uninteresting.  At times it's hard to keep up with the characters who are talking to each other. It is an attempt at a modern science fiction story.   This kind of stuff is done in this type of book all the time but in the end it seems to have been rushed through.  If this book had been written in the 50s this would probably have been good.  In my opinion it feels like it was hastily written to fill space and not because of any quality writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~ I was super excited about this book until I saw the cover, which is a bit of an obvious ripoff of ~~ The Chronicles of Narnia ~~. It's not exactly a bad cover either, but I was so happy to finally be reading one of the best-selling series of all time (the second biggest of all-time, after Harry Potter), I wanted the book to be better. However, I didn't. Instead, I felt like I was being ripped off again. The writing was bad. I found myself getting distracted, which makes it hard to follow what is happening. The characters were terrible. I don't know if I just found myself so bored with them or if it was because they were so bland and uninteresting. I was looking for something like The Dark Knight, but everything about it was better and the protagonist was just better. I'll be reading the next one too, just because it's so good and it's a nice book overall. The reason I gave this 3 stars is because I have to rate this as a 2 because it might sound odd to say a book should be rated as a 4 for something so bad but I am rating this a 2. If you are going to read one of these series, make sure you're reading the second, third, or forth book of the series before going on to the other books in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  What an unbelievable waste of a good novel. The character that is the focus of the story, Dora's daughter, is so obnoxious and stupid. She constantly complains about her mother and her father's divorce and never does anything about it. She tries to have it all and does not realize that her mother has already moved on to the next guy. She also never gets over her father and never says goodbye to her father. I found this story to be horrible. Overall: This book is a waste of my time and I found it just so unbelievable that I couldn't care less. I did not enjoy it. The Good: I loved the ending. It is just so beautiful and perfect. I don't even know how the author came up with it. It reminded me so much of how I felt after reading Lila.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book was a huge disappointment, I have never read a book that disappointed me that badly. I would highly recommend the book only if you are a fan of The Last Hero.  The book follows the main character after the events of the last book, but what I didn't like, was that the story is still a bit predictable, the author just can't write character's personality.
Write a negative review about a bad book:.................................................... I enjoyed this book, it was a quick and easy read and did not take much time to finish. However the pacing wasn't the best and I feel like the story could have been better paced. I was hoping that we would see more of Kita and her family and their struggle. I felt as though the book was lacking some real human drama and emotion that I found I was missing. It was just so quick and boring. There was no real development in the book. There wasn't a lot to the character of Kaya either, I felt she was just an eye candy for the characters, just an object to be used by the characters. The ending of this book was really poor for me. This was just a nice little story but it was definitely not what I was expecting and didn't seem like a real end to the book like I thought it would be. I would not recommend this book to anyone but if you have some time and are in the mood for a quick book that you can read without being absorbed into it. Then this is the one for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a great book. My daughter read it to me and my son and I enjoyed it as well. She also said that there is an interesting story in the back of the book. However, my husband does not care for the stories and has complained to me a couple times about not liking the book's ending.   This is my first experience with the genre and while I don't hate the genre, I can see why my husband doesn't like the book and I'm wondering if this will work for him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read lots of books but none are as bad as this one.  It is like watching a bad movie with no hope for any redeeming qualities.    It's awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I will never again read the books of these great authors.   I will NEVER read again, or any of the other books of William Faulkner, Ralph Ellison, Ernest Hemingway, Jack London, Robert Graves, Sinclair Lewis, and George Orwell. It will be forever my rule that every writer I read must be a Nobel Laureate.   I read these authors books while in college in the 60s and 70s. I remember reading one of these books about a great American writer named George Orwell, who had just been made a citizen of this great nation, and who had lost all of his writing talents after a disastrous war in China. He was living in London and writing about his disillusionment and his thoughts about this country. He wrote one long sentence, and it was, "The Party cannot survive without fear." He knew that this is exactly what we had become and where we were going. Orwell knew that he was saying the truth and it wasn't right to be living in fear in the world.  A great writer can make a profound statement with a few words, but you must read the whole book to get the full effect. The book must be read and understood. It must be put into the same category as Orwell's 1984 and Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and Proust's In Search of Lost Time.  the first thing you have to do is get your money's worth, read the book and then think about it.  on a positive note, i do have a small copy of Orwell's "1984" and i can tell you that he's still alive and he's alive to this day and he will never die. , on a negative note, the book can be too long for a younger person to read in a single sitting.   William Faulkener, who is the one of the top writers of the 20th Century and is an American author, wrote "The Sound and The Fury", "Ada Palmer" and "Gatsby". I am really sorry to say that this one book has become a total waste of money. It is a good book, but the fact that it costs around 500 dollars to buy it, should mean that people will read the complete book in a book. So I have a copy of "Adrian's Daughter" in the store that my daughter works at, and I read it to her all the time. This book was so interesting that she

Write a negative review about a bad book:................................................. It had some promise, but by the time it was done it was nothing but a mess. I feel like I'm cheating when I say I liked the beginning but it all unraveled at the end.   This book is not good. There are too many bad ideas, poorly paced and the writing is awful. The beginning is like a TV show - perfect on the first watch but with too much backstory that drags it out. I read it in about 2 days, and only got through it because I felt sorry for the author.  , March 15, 2008, 6.00 PM  I bought this book because I loved that TV show and also because it sounded cool. And it is cool. It is not my favorite book by this author but I've given it 5 stars. I really didn't expect to enjoy this much, but I think that is mostly because of how much I enjoyed the TV show. The story has all the elements that I love about the TV series, plus it has a bunch of cool characters. I can't wait to read the rest.  , October 3, 2008  Amazing!! I love everything about this book. The characters are like my favorites from the TV Show! The way that they are written just makes them so much more real than the ones we are used to from now. Also the world building is amazing! I loved it so much that I just bought the next book in the series! And they are so much better than the first!! I cant wait to see where this goes!  - - - -  This is a great series, a must for all who love TV, and all those who love fantasy novels. This one is an original but well written series that you cant help but love!  of the 4 stars I give it a 3.5, and i will be buying more books soon. I will rate this one an average of 3.4 stars, but that is not too bad because i feel it is a good book.  I recommend it, and hope that i will see more books by this writer in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was by far my worst book ever! I've bought, read, and had the pleasure of reading this book, and I am so disappointed in it. My first thought was that it was awful and I didn't like it, but the more I thought about it, the worse it got. I mean, it's so bad, there's so many things that just are wrong.  I guess, the badness doesn't stop there though.  The writing is bad. The story is bad, the characters are bad, and the plot is just terrible. I thought it was so ridiculous it was hilarious. My favorite character was the villain, and he was just a dick. He was such a fucking dick, I thought he had cancer, and then he came back to life to kill me. He almost died in the end. The plot was stupid and just didn't make any sense. Why was he in the forest after the book started? Why didn't he just kill everyone at the house, or even the girl in the bathroom? Why did I have to go with him and go to the island? I don't know!  What really bugged me though, was the stupid way he treated me. I guess it was because I was a virgin. If that wasn't enough to bother me, he wanted me to give him a blowjob and eat his cum. I was just so offended by it! It was just such a poor joke, and so out of character for him. I know I didn a pretty good job of defending myself, but this book just made me really mad. It was so horrible.  You're really going to hate this book if you're a fan of the book series! It's that bad! I mean how did he even get a hold of this book to get this horrible story written?
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________  "I loved it, but the first half was really confusing, as was the end, and the characters, especially the main characters, were so much more developed and realistic than the other characters."  Read a positive review of a bad books: _____  1. The Girl Who Would Be Queen by Lidia Yuknavitch  I have already written that I am a big Lidia Yuki fan. I have a few other books by her. I was intrigued by this book. The premise is fascinating and the writing is very poetic and poetic and lyrical. The character of the princess, Elinor is interesting and very relatable. There are a number of intriguing plot twists and characters are developed very well. As the book is a first in this genre, I would have loved a little more depth. However, the characters are extremely likable and the story is so engrossing that I just kept reading. A great example of the type of fantasy and historical fiction that can really give a good insight into the culture of a place through the characters. I definitely recommend this one.  2. The Lady of the Lake by Margaret Weis  A great example a world where we can have fantasy and real world stories that are so realistic, that makes you think about how much the world has changed over the years. The world is set in the 19th Century, but I don't think that was a mistake. The history of the world and it's different cultures was well researched and I loved it. One of my favorite scenes in the book was when she and her brother were at a festival celebrating the coming of Queen Victoria. It was a celebration of how people used to get along before all the bad things started happening. . ,,,,  3. A Girl of Fire and Iron by Anne McCaffrey  An interesting take on the historical, historical fiction theme that I hadn't heard of before. The characters are fascinating and have a fascinating back story. There was one scene I found incredibly moving, where a woman tried to kill her husband in order to free her husband from slavery. This is a very dark story, but it was extremely well written and the reader did not feel like the characters were all horrible and evil. Also, a very well done historical setting. I liked it so much I re-read it several times in order just to try to see what happened next. The heroine, Arya
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is a lack of good writing here. The main character is portrayed as the "other" race because she is a mongoloid and there is no other option, but that is not the only problem. The world building is poor, the characterizations and the plot are weak and boring, the magic system is ridiculous and unbalanced, the plot is bad, the prose is bad... the worst is the lack of plot in the first book (which is fine for the first one).   The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was so good at creating a likable, interesting, funny and deep character that she is my favorite of the books in this collection. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I finished the first book after giving it 4 1/2 stars. It's not the worst book I've read, but it has flaws. The main problem is that it is very difficult to keep track of the plot and the characters. Also, there's a lot of repetition. This is, after all, a series. This has been mentioned before, but the author can't seem to keep the plot from getting convoluted. This book started out with a twist and ended up being very predictable. I don't know why, but he seems to be using this to create tension in the story.   This review will have spoilers, and I don  This book starts out promisingly, but quickly loses momentum. I was so impatient to get on with it, I wanted it to end. After that, it was more difficult than I thought it would be, but I still got to know the characters a bit better. I can say, though, that it will be interesting to see where they go from here. I didn't really like the fact that there was an antagonist at all. The first book was a little bit more mystery-oriented than this one. It took the form of a game, but there were a lot more details, even a little more depth. This one's more of a mystery than the other one, in my opinion. I had to look up on what the book is about, and some of the things I knew about the characters were explained in the book. I really didn't know any of the characters well enough to like them. I'll admit that there are some really interesting characters.  , even though she is a child and doesn't speak English, she is just so smart and knows a lot about many things. I couldn't help but want to know more about her. She is also smart enough to not understand why people get so upset about her going out of the house, but that could be me being overly protective. That said, she does have a brother, and she's the one who is the "good girl". Even so, I would rather have the "bad boy", but I guess there's no one out there that is both a boy and a girl at the same time. Anyway, I liked the character of Ellia. I found her a lot nicer than I expected. If she's going to be an adult, she should act like an adult. She was a bit selfish, but she's an adult and

Write a negative review about a bad book:...........................................   I purchased a copy of this book as a gift for my son who is learning Japanese. This is a wonderful book for the beginning students but the grammar is poor. I gave it to my son because his Japanese is poor but he does not know what a question marker is. I feel that is an oversight on the publisher. I also feel that it was a bit of a waste of my hard earned money. I would not purchase this book again.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My biggest problem with the book is that it is way too long, too many characters, and too many subplots and tangents for a story that I was told would have no more than 2 or 3 subplot/tangent chapters and would be about the one protagonist who is a member of an elite group of heroes fighting a bad guy (who by the way is only a bit more than a one-dimensional villain). The book was told from a few POVs with the one who was a member/leader of the heroes (the heroine) and a few with the other heroines. The group is a bit unbalanced for what is an entire story that mostly consists of "the bad guy was defeated by the good guys" and "some guy saved the world in the middle of the fight" that ends with a battle with something called an "Angel." This is all just to set up what the book has to offer. It doesn't really end on that note. There is more than enough time for the group to recover and start over, and it just didn't happen in the book. This is not because the characters are bad or stupid or whatever (the heroes are actually pretty good), it's because this book was way too slow and this was not the right thing to do. A short and sweet, well paced, great book. If I had seen this as a complete story from beginning to end, I probably would have had more faith in this novel. I will definitely read the next book though because I really liked this one.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very excited to get this book and ended up losing interest after a few chapters. It wasn't a big problem because I could get through the book, but I felt as if I had seen the same thing again and again. There were too many chapters about how terrible a writer this man is. I know a good writer when I see one and that just wasn't the case. If I were to tell you what a brilliant man I think this man to be, I would have to tell it to a crowd. So I gave the book 2 stars and will probably give it 1.5 in the future because the story kept me reading but the man writing kept me wondering what I was missing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited to pick up this book.  It had been a long time since I read anything by Eileen Myles, so I was curious to see what she had to offer.   She said that she loved my reviews about The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, and decided to turn her attention to this book of hers.  I was going to give this a chance because I was really looking forward to reading something by E-Myles.  But  The Long Distance to a Quiet Place wasn't worth it, not by a long shot.  There is not much to this story except for a story about a girl named Lucy who has to take her mother's dog away because she got hurt on the family vacation.  This book was really good in its simplicity.  The author wrote in a very simple, uncluttered, unpretentious style that made this book easy to read.  It was very good but I was a little disappointed because I really thought that I would like Lucy a lot.  As a kid I could not wait to go camping or the beach with my parents.  Although it is hard to believe that this book is still in print, I'm glad that I gave it a chance, it just wasn't that good.   The Long Distance - I would give this book a 3/5 stars, however it just wouldn't have been a good read if it weren't for the little things in this book that I really appreciated.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________   This book is a waste of time. It does little more than try to cover the ground of a simple mathematical formula, "area of an circle", by giving it a lot of examples and talking in circles. It is, however, very entertaining to read (as I've read the book several times).   In the very beginning of the book, the author makes it clear that this is a book about "Area". So much for "mathematics". If you don't know how to use basic algebra, you're going to have a bad time. He talks in circles a lot in the beginning of this book, which is a bit annoying for me, because I was expecting a more clear discussion.   When he talks about triangles, he talks as if he is describing an actual triangle. He doesn't make use of "equivalence classes" (which means, there can only be 3 non-intersecting triangles in a circle) or the "simple formula" for triangle areas. He is just trying to use it to prove that "2/3 triangles are equal". He is not actually doing this. He's doing something else, which he discusses in a later section, so I don't feel obliged to describe.   and then later when he discusses "1/2 triangles", he uses the "equivalent area formula" to prove this. So I again have to explain that the simple formula is useless for triangles, and that this will only be useful to the very very bad mathematician. He then goes on for another paragraph about "1 and 3 triangles" that again, is useless. He only talks about it because it is true.  - this is the same formula that he uses to prove the existence of "three-dimensional objects" in his next paragraph.  .     .   It's too bad that he makes no reference to the "real" science of geometry, physics or anything else. It was a very enjoyable read!   And if you don 't want to be distracted by this, then you probably shouldn't read it. The fact that it gives a nice quick overview of what the author thinks is a "simple mathematical formula" is not worth getting frustrated and distracted from the actual math you are really interested in.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I would never read this book.  The book was badly written and made me cringe as I read it.   The story was not interesting or even entertaining.  My husband found the book very upsetting and did not want to read it again.  The protagonist in the story is a woman who has a terrible childhood and suffers from depression.  In the end her husband died and she is left alone to face the harsh realities of her life.  I find it hard to believe that this book was written as well as it was.  While I did enjoy the book, the writer was unable to make it interesting to me and I would never have given it four stars. The rating is not a strong one.  This book is a great example of why self-publishing can be a successful way to publish a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a friend tell me about this book when I first read it, I was so excited to listen to what he had to say about the book. It was supposed to be part of the trilogy "Moonshine" of the same author, but I found the story boring and hard to get into (I found the main character to be somewhat annoying). I did enjoy the story, and if you are a fan of the other books by the same writer, this is definitely for you!

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a well written book. The first half is very good, but the second half the author just starts to get into the plot and the story starts to go off the rails. The ending, even though it had me questioning some of the story lines I just felt was way too late, to me anyway. The book was a bit slow, and I didn't like the narrator. The writing was very good in my opinion. A great book to get if you are interested in history and history of science. But there was way to much wrong with this book. So if you don't like history or science I would recommend not even buying this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've had this book for a couple of months and have tried to give it some time to breathe but it seems like it's in a constant hurry to make you care. I can't remember ever liking a book so much it felt like a chore to read it and then I found this. I'm not complaining about the book because it was very good but I was expecting more from this book. Maybe I'm getting old, but when I read a book that I'm excited about and that I get to like it so much and I don't feel like reading it all over again, I'm happy. 3 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book while waiting for a long flight back from a visit to my grandparents in the Dominican Republic. I would not hesitate to pass on this book for a trip back there because I felt the book made the trip more frustrating than helpful. A friend gave this book to me with a review stating that he thought the author was just taking advantage of the current climate of controversy surrounding homosexuality to "make some money" by using the "gay" as an example of the struggles facing homosexual men. The author actually uses the case of gay men who get married as an excuse to attack the gay rights movement and to present a more favorable view of homosexual relationships to the reader. The title and cover are very offensive to many people I know. I have never had a good relationship with my homosexual friends or the idea of homosexual marriage.   It is not the author's fault that people are upset about the current controversy about homosexuality and the legalization of same-sex marriage. A majority of Americans now support gay marriage. What we are seeing is a backlash against the gay agenda. It is unfortunate that the author chose to use this controversy as an opportunity to attack gays and lesbians.  16 of 19 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I received this book in exchange for an honest review.  When I first read this book, I thought it would be an interesting and challenging introduction to the world of artificial intelligence.  It is nothing of the sort.   The authors have done an excellent job of distilling the core concepts into a small amount of prose that gives the whole thing a little more impact than a quick quiz on Wikipedia.  The book is very much like a textbook or textbook-style reading.  It's not the type of book that you read and feel that you've learned something new.  For someone that has already learned many things about the subject, this will be a very frustrating experience.  At times, I felt that the authors didn't want to fully go into the nitty gritty.  One of the best examples of this I came across in a blog post by Andrew Ng, the founder of Coursera.  Ng has talked about how in his lectures on the topic of artificial neural networks, he felt that he was just reading a textbook, not really learning anything new. The textbook approach can often lead to the wrong conclusions.  This book could have easily been titled " The basics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning ", and I doubt that I would have been any more productive.  I could write about the flaws and flaws of the book in a post of it's own, but I would much rather that you get the book yourself and take your own notes. I do like the book, but it would not have been my first choice for a first book on neural networks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- --------------------------- "This is another book that was a complete waste of my time. I read the description of this one, the title, the description. I know I was going to love it because I have such a thing for children's books. I am a school teacher, so it seems like a book for students to read. I started this book thinking that I had found what I was looking for. The first couple of pages I was excited and the second and third I was very disappointed. I can't tell you why, just don't buy this book. I have tried to tell people about this book but no one listens to me. They only read my review and tell me to put down this book and go away. "

Write a negative review about a bad book:  this one had me laughing out loud in the beginning, but after a few more pages I was just sick.  It's like the author is trying to make me feel bad for liking a book.   This book's only redeeming feature was that I thought it was funny from the start. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I do not understand how anyone could want to write a negative book review, or any kind of review about anything. This was a good book, and it had a good point, but it was not my cup of tea. It would have benefited from being written by a more seasoned writer. I would say that the book had good points, but the writer did not manage to make them well conveyed." "I love how this is a really good story and I know I'm not the only one who likes the story." "The book is good. I can't tell if he got tired of writing it or if he just got a good idea but this book is amazing. It just keeps going, with a plot twist, and with the ending you won't get tired of it. This book is really good."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm giving this book 3 stars because there was an error when it was written. I was looking for "The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle. It came out as "The Way of the Superior Man" when the book was really a collection of short stories, like "The Miracle of Mindfulness."   It's hard to get a handle on what is real and what isn't when someone is a "healer" in a way. He makes up a lot of stuff for his audiences and he may not have a clue when he is talking to someone who is suffering. I have read much of his books but this one was hard to keep track of what he was talking about. It's not as if the story is bad but it was hard for me to keep up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been following this series for years and have become obsessed with this series. The only real negative to the series is it's length, especially for a young adult, which means I must start all over with the next book.  I read the first one on the first day it came out and it changed my life.  The last one I read was also a really great book and had a great ending, though I still miss the series a little.  I'm looking forward to getting this series in print, even though I do wish they would do a hard cover and not have the paperbacks in the $1.99 price range.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________   Book: The Death of an American Icon - by George Orwell   Rating: 3/5 - Fairly boring  Plot: The novel is about the life of Winston Churchill. It is not a biography and has no real plot to speak of. The only thing that would make the plot a bit better would be an epilogue describing events after the main story.  Characters: There are many characters in this book. Not that it is bad but the characters don't really stand out or do anything in particular.  that was it for the characters of the book.   Overall: Not bad for the price. Could have been better but not bad at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  I just got a copy of this today. It's a really bad book. I can't say that I enjoyed it but it was interesting in that I thought it was a pretty good read. The first half is pretty good. The other half was so bad that I felt that the author was just trying to fill time in between books and it wasn't that well-done. The characters don't seem to have any kind of personality and you don't get much development, either. The thing that I really disliked was the cover art. I don't know if the artist thought it would be a good idea to put all of the characters in the same pose (as one would do with a Halloween card or something). There's a whole bunch of drawings and not one person looks like they could be a character in the book, they look like they're characters from a different book, just like the drawings are drawn to look like a cross between the characters. I was just so sick of all the people from the book looking like they were characters from another book and trying to appear very human and like they had their own feelings and lives, instead of them being characters from the story. Also, there are some really weird descriptions in this book. A lot of descriptions of how "normal" people act when they're nervous, or weird "bad-boy" behavior and such that didn't seem right. The last half of the book is just boring. There's an ending that seems very rushed and too little time for the characters to get to know each other and their own desires or thoughts about each other. I'm really not sure if I would read this book again. I probably won't recommend it to anyone, but maybe it's okay for people who like a good story, but don't enjoy reading a lot of things that are so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________I've never been a big fan of young adult novels, but this one was good enough that I wanted to keep reading. When I got to the end I thought it was all downhill from there. I was getting close to the ending but then some of the characters came to life to give me some good closure. I have no doubt that this book could have been a little better, but I still thought it would have been good enough for my teenage daughter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm going to start this review by saying I'm an avid fan of this series, but as time passed I started finding it boring. I've watched the first two seasons of the original series as well as the animated adaptation of the series on several occasions, and this was the only thing I've gotten from this new movie. Sure, it's entertaining, but I really didn't enjoy it.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star book is the book itself. It is very poorly written and I would not recommend it to anyone. The book has lots of plot and character but has little actual plot. It has no real conclusion which makes it all very confusing. I will not be reading the sequel as I found the first book quite disappointing.   I will give it 4-star rating only because it is a good read for people who are curious about the history of witchcraft in Australia.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't remember the last time I have enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed this one! I loved this book so much I decided to read the others in the series.  This book is great. Â I liked the story, it's great. The plot is pretty well laid out and doesn't feel that rushed.    The plot was great, and I enjoyed the characters in the book.  There are some parts I thought were a bit odd.  I'm not sure if the author is going to address it, but I do feel that he has a way of writing the story that seems to get in the way of how it's supposed to go.  It's not really the way that I like to read books, but it could be a way for the author to make things a bit more interesting.  When he's writing a story like this he seems to make the story seem so random and chaotic that I have to question the point of a character's actions.  But the stories he's telling in this series are really interesting to me, so that's a plus for me.   I think this story could have been even better if it had a bit less fighting.  That part I liked a lot, but the book really needed more of that.    I think in the second book, I'd have liked a bit of a conclusion for the plot that wasn't quite as rushed. In conclusion, this is a great story.  The characters are very well done and it's an amazing story. This is one of the best books that I've read in a long time!  I've never been much of a romance fan, but this was really good.  This book was a great read, so read it!
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- "I have read many books. I have enjoyed many books but I have never had a problem with a book until I read this one. My daughter is in first grade and I am sending her to the school this summer. I thought I had seen the worst of her. The story was all about the "evil" teacher. I think she was a horrible person. I hope she is in jail when she dies. The book was not about the teacher. She was not even in the picture. It is just that a student wanted to be a hero. The teacher was not the villain of the story. I hate when a book is more about the student then the teacher." "This book is a complete waste of time. I had been waiting to read this book for the longest time and I finally purchased the paperback to finish it but I had to put it back down because it is a waste of money. If you are looking for a book that is not a history book or some of the other books I have purchased, go to the library or look on the internet." I loved this book and am happy it's in my collection, but I think I've given away more than I should have. There is so much information in the first hundred pages, so much about slavery, so many things that happened to the Native Americans, so so many little details. So many things I knew about but that I just hadn't heard about before. I did like that there was a part about the Indian school teachers. I'll bet if I read it in college, the professors would be talking about it for days. I don't know if I'll ever get around to the sequel, but if I ever do, I'm going to have to purchase it at the library. So I'll keep the original and my college students will be able to go through it and make connections that I would have missed. And if the book is available to me, they'll know about this and not be surprised when it comes to their hands. I was so pleased with this book, I've found it on my Kindle at the link I just gave. It seems to me that the more you research, the better you get at reading, so I will probably do that for the rest of my life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!!!! The author has a way of turning what should be a good book into a very bad one! For one thing she uses several names for some characters, so it's hard to identify the character if you don't get who it is. She tries to do the same thing by having several characters of the same name in the same place at one time, like a gang or a family. Another thing she does that is annoying is make characters like the two main characters "good" and "bad", but she doesn't make them interesting by doing it.!!!. The characters are just bad.!!!!!!!! The only good thing is that one of the girls gets to be a doctor, and she is very nice and patient.!!!!!!!!!!!!! You may not like it, but this is a very good book. It may be not for everyone, but if you can look past the bad parts, and just enjoy it for what it is, you will like it.Read full review

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought it was interesting to see the impact that climate change is having on the natural world. However, the writing was very simplistic and didn't convey the scientific accuracy of what I was reading. I was also very irritated by how he used the "gravy train" as a metaphor for the IPCC.  This is why I read a lot of science fiction: Because I think science is important.  If you are just a scientist, or a researcher, you should read this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I was a bit disappointed by this book. This is not a book that I read to gain a deep understanding of something, but rather one that I wanted to read because I wanted something like this to come out. I was expecting to be blown away by the story, I was looking forward to the final page and the conclusion. I went into it with the mindset that if this book has some truth to it, it can help others cope with their problems and have the capacity to move forward to find the answers they seek. However, I found the story to be a bit shallow and superficial. It was told in the third person from our main character's point of view, so the narrative was focused solely on him. I thought it could have done with the addition of a different character, one with a slightly different perspective. It would have been more impactful to read this story as two different characters.I also had issues with the characterisation. I have a friend who has suffered severe depression over the last few years and I am sure he would have benefited from an intelligent story written about his illness, as he is definitely in a deep and dark place. The way the character was written was very offputting. At some points, I just felt like I was reading another book and didn't care about the character. I feel as though it could easily have been a whole different story with different characters with different perspectives and an entirely different approach to what it is about this illness. I felt as though the author was trying to use the depression as an excuse for the main character and that made it feel like a character trait, not a real illness. There were certain elements that came across as being so shallow that I felt it was a wasted opportunity to bring something deeper to the story. I don't know how a book written for children could be written this way, but I thought that it was poor writing and the book really lacked characterisation and insight.The book did have a positive message and I appreciated some of the positive messages about acceptance and resilience. However this does not negate the problems that it has. I am really disappointed and would not recommend this book to others. It is the story of a young man's struggle with mental illness and it has nothing to do with the deeper, underlying issues of depression and mental illness. The book did give me an insight into the struggles that some individuals go through but I don.t think that it's the most appropriate book for people dealing
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** this is the worst book i have read in my entire life, its bad in every aspect, the story sucks and the characters are not even likable, atleast the first one was  The story starts off alright but there is a lot of random stuff to make it go from bad to worse. In addition to the characters, the writer tries to be creative but its hard to make up for the lack of creativity and creativity. Even the last chapter had to be retitled in order for it to fit the time period of it's writing. I am really dissapointed with this book. The story started off good but then it just went downhill and got worse. The first half of the book was good and it was really good until about halfway through when it got horrible and became really bad. I also really dislike the way the author tried to write it's story and made it a mystery, I also think this would not make a good book for an eight year old, it has a lot wrong with it. The characters were terrible, I mean there were a few good characters (like the kid who gets a ride to the hospital) but every other character was terrible. There were things about the story that made me laugh but there were also things that made it so hard to read and not read it. If you want to read a bad detective story read something like this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was my first book in a series, and it didn't do much for me. It didn't explain what was going on, or what the characters were going through, or how the plot was going to end. The whole book was just kind of, "Ahh, time passes, people do silly things." I feel like that's a bad part of every book. And I'm an older reader so I don't mind being told what happens, but it's kind of annoying how they didn't show us how the story was going. I feel, at least, I could've gotten more out of the book.  I read the book in one sitting.  It's okay. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the premise is flawed. The reason there are a few vampires, and other creatures, is because they're not in the first book. They're introduced at the same time as the protagonists are, so it's an extra layer of complication. In the second book, they're all in the same location, and the situation makes more sense. The vampire hunters have had to move from town to town to protect themselves from other vampires. The problem is that the new vampire hunter team is composed of the same characters, including one with a serious illness and two of the original team who have died. The second book also brings a new character into the group, and I was wondering who she was for the first four-plus books. And then, in the very last chapter, she says she's the person who helped the original vampire hunters find the missing vampire in the beginning. Now that's a little weird.   The book has an unusual structure that's not terribly logical. The reader is given the story from the perspective of one character, so the characters don't have time to introduce themselves, and then they jump from one character to the next and have a different experience from that of the reader. This is not the most logical way of telling a story.   (And it's a problem with many of these books, too.)   However, I really loved this book. The narrator, Ivo, is so realistic and believable. I also really loved the romance between Anna and Michael, and especially I liked the romance of Michael with Anna. The story was really compelling, and it's so refreshing that a vampire book takes place in a modern world with a lot of technological advancement. There are also a lot more than a few moments of "dark humor." I think this book was well-written, and there's not much to dislike.  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:  If I wanted to, I could spend hours trying to come up with a better title for this review. This is not a book I can recommend, as the information and concepts covered here are so basic that anyone who's tried to use them in a real-world setting will understand what I'm talking about. The concepts are too vague, and it's just too easy to get stuck on the specifics. That's the exact opposite of what you want from a primer, and this book isn't going to do it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ _________ _____________________ This was an awesome book about how bad parents are. In the first chapter the authors make clear that the book is not about the bad parent. Parents are terrible for kids. The book does not tell the readers that parents should take some responsibility for their bad parenting. The point of the book and of any good book is to teach how to be a better person. But the parents in the book did not teach us that. They were too busy telling kids not to look a certain way and to wear clothes that looked really silly. The parents talked to their children about how to use words in a way that was really insulting and patronizing. I would not have given this book five stars if I did not know that the parents are not really parents. The kids in this book are not in their parents homes. The only way to get the facts from this book is by having a copy of the parents' book. I know this book will not be the only book on parenting out there. But I wish the author had given us a picture of how a real parenting book works, like the one that I have, so that we could learn from it.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  the plot is boring and the author is an idiot. The plot is stupid and the book is a failure! (Posted on 9/8/2011) The story was interesting and interesting for the most part. But the story just went nowhere and seemed to be missing some needed spark and inspiration to make a complete story. (Posted 4/5/2010) Overall, I enjoyed reading this story but the author could do better. She is obviously not a writer and I doubt that she even read this book but she was too busy taking care of her pets (they are also dogs) and her own health. (Not that it's wrong to have pets, it's just that this particular story is not interesting or believable. And the plot seemed to lack any reason for its existence and really just seems to be written as the excuse to give some of the dogs a special pet.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written in the first person - a first person novel - that means that the main character is a young boy.  (The title of the book was written to the same effect.)  The book is about a boy who was kidnapped and forced into the army, but because of his talent in engineering and mathematics, he is the first one to complete his own project, and he is praised for it.  This is a pretty good book, but there are problems with it that really take away from the good parts.    -   The writing style is pretty bad.    The way the characters talk is not in the style of a child but a young adult.  He uses pronouns that I can't imagine a kid talking like, e.g., "It seems I am destined to do this job" or "I had no idea that my parents would go to such lengths to teach me this subject."   In fact, at one point he has a conversation in which he describes his parents as "my parents" and "the only ones that deserve me."  And he doesn't like his father at all.  In my experience as a teacher I find this style very annoying and very inappropriate for young readers.  I don't think it is good for kids to talk like this because I'm a parent of two young girls and they speak exactly like this.  As a teacher, I know that kids like this style, and in fact, most of my students speak like this - the problem is, this isn't a good writing style for young adults.  -   When the boy does his project (something he is told he has to do), it doesn't turn out as expected.  His father says, "It's hard work and no one will ever get it right."  The boy replies, "Well, I have to."  What the boy doesn't realize is that he hasn't built the thing, and the father really should tell him this. He should also mention that the project doesn't have to be a work of genius, and a "simple" thing like this can be done.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book but I would have bought it in a heartbeat if I'd heard about it first.  It was a good, though not outstanding, book.  That is what I wanted to say until someone commented on a recent post that said that the characters seemed to not be real people.  I thought it was a little odd, but it really is not.  Most of the people in this book seem to be from a far away place and their relationships are not well developed.  When I was reading the book I had a sense of dread and I had to read it again, but the book had a lot of good parts that I enjoyed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to read this and I thought I would love it. I was wrong. I really loved the plot, the story, the characters. But the plot was not developed. There was a scene in the middle that made me laugh, but it didn't feel like a moment or a thing that happened. It was like two characters are talking about how they are talking. It's like they were talking through their own heads, and it felt like there were so many characters, and that was just the beginning of it. The problem was I just couldn't take all these characters. I think the story might be good, I might be wrong, but I really didn't enjoy the way the story was told. It felt like I was being asked to follow a story and follow characters I already knew too well, who did not really give me anything new to like about them, other than they were a bunch of teenagers. I just didn't care at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ This book is a horrible book and its terrible. The bad part about this book is that is is not very interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad book:....................................Book:...........................(2/10)Characters:...................................................................(1/5)Enjoyment: ...................(0/5)-I did not enjoy this at all.-It's a bad premise, no other way to say it.-I am very confused, it's hard to understand why this author went through so much trouble to make this work and make it a 3.5 star book. It's just a bad idea.-I can't tell you how much this book disappointed me. This has nothing to do with the story. I read and review just about everything, but this book just was not good enough for me.I do not know who the author is or what she was thinking, but for this book this just did not work.I would definitely recommend this book for the young adult reader and fans of the Harry Potter series, but I wouldn't recommend this one for people who love to read Harry Potter or want to learn about the characters and magic of Harry Potter.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********   This book is the worst book I have ever read. I will not read another book by this author. His books always have no plot, don't give me enough to work with, don�t explain the characters, or make sense, or do anything. I tried for 6 months to finish this book and it was so boring that I just had to throw it away.   To add insult to injury, the author was so nasty and abusive to me while I was writing this review that I am not going to re-write my review because it is not worth it. If you have a bad reputation, don´t be a writer, and don�st write this kind of stuff. I hope this book made you feel sorry for the author and his friends. I don't know how you can go to bed at night knowing that you can do anything you want to your book and still sleep at night.   "Why didn�t you write a better book? I couldn�t finish it".   P.S.: After I wrote this review, I thought about writing a "Best of the Worst" list. I have no idea how it would be done. It might be the worst writer ever to ever put pen to paper.   (Posted on 13/3/2013)  Really bad book.   A really bad book, I just wish the author would have stopped the stupidness in the end. It took me 3 months of reading this book to finally finish it. This book was just so badly written, every single line had to be changed to make it more funny, I guess it was the author�s attempt to avoid being sued and writing a bad story and all that. It really has not a lot of value. I hate the author for writing this book. If I wanted to read another novel, I would not read this one. (Posted in the bad review section on 11/2/2013 by mr.bad)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book 5 stars, however, I'm very disappointed with it. This is not a bad read, but there's not much to it.   In a nutshell, the story of a man trying to make it to the big time in Hollywood. But he can't, for a few reasons. He has no money and no connections and he is not famous. He is just an ordinary guy who is trying to get by. But one day, he receives a phone call from a woman asking him to join her in the world of entertainment. He declines but she still calls him and tells him that she knows a guy who needs a talent manager, and to call her. After a short call, she takes him to the show and tells her guy that he wants to meet with her so that she can introduce him to a big name, but that he first has to convince her that he's worth the money she is offering.   "It's hard to make the money in this business" he says. "Why would I want to join a show?"   And that's it. The movie starts and he gets lost for a while, and then it finally clicks for him. The actress, her guy, and the guy at the studio all are good people, but their names don't come up. He feels that he didn't get a fair deal, so he leaves the show, goes home and gets a job at the local gas station. A few weeks go by and he's making a bit of money here and there but he hasn't really earned much money. One day he notices a TV in the gas station bathroom that's playing a movie called "The King and I". He takes it back and finds that it's been altered and they are now talking about the real story, and he notices that they are talking about himself. He gets very mad.   with this, I would've put it at 4 stars but the movie isn't that bad. It wasn't as bad as the book, but it isn't much better. A bit of plot and a few moments of great acting, but otherwise, not much. The ending was disappointing as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!This is THE ONLY place you can find ANY information about the man who was responsible for the death of my father!! He is the same man who has caused my father to be diagnosed with cancer. He was also the one who killed my father!!! A man who killed a man who caused his father to die is not going to be taken care of. I am so upset and upset for my father's family that he would be in this kind of state! A man that is in my opinion like the bad guy in "The Shawshank Redemption" is going to continue to harm men for as long as he is alive!! If he wants to die, he is going down fighting!! Thank you for the information and the website!! I'm glad I found this website! I'm in tears right now!!
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- My friend and I read this book back in 2013 when we were about 18. We knew little about it and were both impressed. We gave it four stars because, as the author himself has said, it was a retelling of the story of David and Goliath. I found it to be a fun read but would definitely prefer a longer retelling. I would probably read it again when I have time, but I don't know that I would recommend it for anyone else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book to a class I teach at an elementary school. It wasn't really an entertaining book to me as an author (or a reviewer) and I was not entertained. The author uses the same language and theme from one book to the next. I felt like it was the same story told again and again.   It's kind of interesting that a person could read this, say I'm the perfect person for the job, and then use the exact same style to describe that person in every subsequent book. He's perfect, he has everything, he's perfect with everyone, the perfect mother, the best father, etc.   of course he's not perfect because of the flaws we all have (of course) but he is the best of the best. I think the author uses this as an excuse to tell the same stories in the books, even though they all happen to be pretty much identical.   The author was good as the school teacher and I enjoyed the story but I really couldn't stand how he wrote. It was like he was having fun with the words but didn't really mean to and the writing style didn't change.   is that what I think it means to write a bad story? I don't think it's the right way to describe writing, just that it's an interesting way to say that I don`t really mean it when I talk about writing. I'd say it's not writing so much as it is saying what a person thinks. But I didn't like that because the reader doesn't get to judge the reader. I'm sure this is not the way everyone feels but I wasn't enjoying the book either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this one to be a bit predictable. It was pretty dull, the "love-at-first-sight" was never established, and even the last paragraph was pretty predictable.  All in all, I'm not sure that I'm too disappointed with this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not the biggest fan of Harry Potter. I've read the books and enjoyed them, but I just don't feel that I'd recommend them to anyone who hasn't read the first or second. That being said, I liked this book a lot. It had some of the same feel as the first and a lot of humor. It was very well written and the humor was funny, and the characters were well developed. I can see why this book got 3.5 stars. I'm glad I bought this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This is a book I wouldn't waste my time with." "This book is bad." That last comment should come as no surprise. I read this book in the first three minutes. It's a great book. It does take some effort to get through the first third of the book, and I really did appreciate the effort. I'm still not totally clear on why the first thing I do after getting my Kindle was to go straight to Wikipedia (and I'll do it again). But I get why I read it. The author, Christopher Baehr, is a gifted and passionate writer. His writing is really, really good. It also has a very specific tone, and it is quite different from the style I'm used to from books. He manages to tell a story that is a bit more than a series of short stories or a series that is told over one long story. But that makes it feel like a longer story. It's also quite a different style from any other I've read so far. I think it will be very challenging to put down this book. I don't know how to recommend it to people who aren't already fans of Baehren and the various stories he writes, but I have to admit that this book was a little different for me. It definitely changed how I thought about writing short stories in general. And I'm not sure I can recommend it as a standalone story or even as part of the The Seven Day Empire Series, but for a change of pace and something to read, this is a very good book. Recommendation:    Recommend it to anyone who is looking for a challenging story with some interesting ideas, but not so much for those who are used to more light-hearted stories. I got through it quite quickly.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! If I could give this book a 0 I would. I read this as an in-joke with a friend, who didn't understand the humor. This book made me laugh out loud and then throw a tantrum and curse and swear at this book, which I did.   The title is supposed to be a play on words. I think it works and it was fun to read. I don't think this book is for everyone. But the humor and characters and story were funny and the story and characters are so well developed and believable, the book is funny even without the humor in it.  :)
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  A few weeks ago I started reading this book. I've never read about a man (and a lot of women) who has become a billionaire since his age of 29. But I did want to learn more about him. He's quite wealthy and he knows exactly how to get out of bad situations. There's nothing about him that is a bad man.   I am from a poor family and I worked my butt off for over ten years to get where I am now. I still struggle every day. I'm not saying that this book is the solution to every problem in the world.   A lot of people have had an effect on my life. And yes, they were bad people.   the problem I have is that most people are scared to ask for help. You have to have the balls to ask.   a lot can happen in life. If I had the money to live the good life I would. But that money doesn't mean anything if I don't know how to spend it wisely.     If you want to improve your life and find out how to become a better person then this book will make your life easier and happier. It's not just a story of him going from his humble beginnings to the pinnacle of success. He also has a lot to say about the value of hard work and having a plan for your life.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I don't get much out of books, but this one I found very enjoyable. It is a well put together story. It took me about a month to read the entire thing, but the ending was extremely satisfying. I don' t know what people mean when they say this book is over-complicated and complicated. It's just really hard to explain this book, it will spoil the whole experience for you, so you might as well just go with it. :)  12 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing I would improve on is when the kids are talking. It's a pretty long book. This book was actually very good. It is about a little girl named Tiana who is so scared by a strange creature in her backyard that she hides behind a bush and goes to sleep with the door open. But the creature isn't a monster, it's a witch. The girl's grandmother thinks it is the devil and takes her to a witch doctor. The doctor cures the girl of her fears and then takes her home to live with the family. He then introduces Tiana to a world of magic and fantasy. The book is funny and moving. I found this book interesting and very educational.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for an exam, it took me almost 3 weeks to finish. I found many places where it was poorly written. I didn't find that there was too much of a problem with the characters and writing style. I do think that the author should have at least had the ability to write a better book than this, as this book was simply so bad it was impossible for me to even finish it. I really hated it, and will never read it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the best books I've read so far and I love it. But it took me forever to get to the good parts and this was the final chapter and I couldn't get to it because I had to read it for a test and I really needed to finish the book and I wasn't able to finish it. I'm really disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I can't help but wonder what the hell is going on in the author's head." This is a book by a good, non-Christian, man who thinks he has all the answers. It's called "God Is Not Great" and you can download it from Amazon.  The only problem is that this book is a scam. The reason I didn't like it is because it was a "debunking" book about atheism. I mean what can be more insulting to atheists than the book being a rip off of "Debunking Christianity". The premise is that the Christian god doesn't exist.  However, there are plenty of "good arguments" presented to prove that this is true. The book has tons of quotes from famous atheists, atheists who have been killed and tortured because of their beliefs, and atheists that are very well known.  God is Not Great "As for my atheist friends, I'll say this: If they would just open their mouths and say that the universe was created by some other god who didn't know he was god, and that this other god had some form of an ethical code and made all of the rules about how and what you were supposed to do, then they would probably be more popular." -Richard Dawkins There are some who take these quotes seriously but most of them are not. Dawkins isn't even a real atheist and he never said that God doesn't know that he is a god.  It is quite evident that the author and the writers of this book don't know how to quote real atheists.  What is even more sad is that there are many other atheists that have been murdered and tortured for their beliefs.  As I mentioned earlier, there have been at least three atheist bloggers who have died for their belief in a god who created a universe and that is why there is a universe.  "Well, the Bible doesn't say anything about it.  There are no miracles in the Bible.  But if we can't find anything wrong in the book of Genesis, then you have to believe that God created the world and gave people the same chance he gave everyone else to get out of the world that he made.  If you believe that, then it makes sense to me.  You'd have to be a dumb person to believe in a being who could create the world but didn't care about everyone else in the world, but you wouldn't have to hate anyone for believing that."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for an easy read, this is the one. It is written well, has a good plot and good characters. What I can say about this one is that I did not feel cheated at all. I was actually happy with the way it all went down. I think this author should get a free copy of this book from Book-of-the-Month Club because this is one of the only books in this genre that is well written and has a very good plot. I also liked the fact that I got to read a different fantasy world. If you want a quick read, then you can find a good one in this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________ I've got the hardcover and the paperback. Both good. The paperback has better artwork and the hard copy is a bit lighter. Both have great pictures and excellent writing. I have to admit that I don't like the idea of being trapped in a world as a kid. It's dark and scary, and it's just not my cup of tea. It is very hard to explain to people who haven't been through it just how much of an emotional roller coaster this book can be. I guess the best way to explain it is to show some pictures of the inside of my house, where I live: http://imgur.com/a/5P5Kr I think most of us can understand that feeling. ______________________________________________________ "I could see it, the white, flat surface of the moon, with a crescent of black. Like a moonbeam, the light made me feel alive." A simple but haunting line from a great story. The moon is the focal point of this story. There are so many things to consider when it comes to this moon, its history, its beauty, and its dark history. It was a pivotal time in human history, as the moon was getting close to the Earth's orbit. What would life be like on this moon? The story starts off with a group of five children. A boy, a girl, a boy, and a girl. One of the girls is trying to explain this moon to another girl who thinks it is a piece of garbage, not worth the effort. In this book they are on a journey to the moon. In the middle of the book there is a big discussion about what life on the moon would be like. The author has used a lot of real world history to help get the point across. In our world we take the moon for granted, but we don't take into consideration all of the things it's done to us.  "There are only seven days left. But even then there is no guarantee that it will be easy."    In a nutshell, the story is told with a lot more detail than a book usually gets. I think that's a good thing.   For any readers interested in this kind of reading, there is only one problem with this book: it doesn't stand alone.  It stands perfectly on its own. The book is written in the third person, but each chapter is divided into two parts. Each of
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I did not find this book to be an exciting read. It was slow paced and had too many parts to keep my interest. The plot was slow going too and the characters felt too flat. I liked the cover though, but the back of the book should be changed to make it more interesting. The book has a similar feel to a video game. It's just not a good book. I found it to be a little frustrating reading it because there was no real explanation for what exactly happened and I was frustrated. ***
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I have been looking for a short book to read while on a trip. I have read all the short fiction, and have enjoyed it, but I had heard that this was the last book of the series by Stephen King and had been looking forward to reading the series. I had a chance to read this book. I read it, and liked it. However, the ending of this book is not what I had hoped for. There is a scene where we are told that we have to take a leap of faith, and I was expecting to be offered a choice of a series of questions. It was not. I was given only one. That was a little disappointing. I really wish the author had put some of this in for us to learn. I do not like the fact that I am unable to figure out how this person got to the place they were in, and had to go into an area where they were very ill. I guess the author thought it would be too hard for people to understand and would be better if the audience is in a trance. But I can understand the idea of people being hypnotized. I can also see the point of people having to learn the hard way. And the choice is made on the basis of the answer to one question. I am not sure what is the meaning of life and what it is we are looking for. It is a very interesting question, and one that I don't think is being answered by the book. The book, however, did not seem to have a deep meaning to it. I think there were a few things the author did to set the scene, but then I also feel the book could have been improved by putting some of the deeper ideas that are to be found in some of Stephen King's other works in there, as it seems to me some of them are very powerful. I did enjoy the stories, as you do with short stories, but they did not have the impact that I had expected. I would not recommend this book for a first reading, as I think the ending leaves the story very weak. But for someone who wants a quick and short reading experience, and can look past some of King's weaknesses, this could be a good pick. This story is only for those that have read the first two books, but if you are interested in what the author has to offer, go ahead and pick it up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book because of the rating and reviews and I am extremely disappointed with how this book actually turned out. I have to admit that it is actually quite a bit better than the "story" and even the writing. The story was very bland and dull and not at all convincing. In fact, it was a bit difficult to make out who was who because of all the words. I also found the voice to be quite odd. I felt that if I wanted to read a book, the voice I would prefer would be more neutral and in-line with how my other books are written. As a matter of fact, I would consider this to be a very bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________   I read this book to get information about how to start your own business.

I think it's a great movie.   the author is an expert in the subject and is very thorough in his explanations.   The main thing that bothers me is that the author spends more time on business ideas than he does on actual business. It's a waste of a lot of time.  -Merrill G.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in college, so I had never seen anything like it. This book was more of a guide book on some of the basics, but not a full-blown instruction manual. About the author:   Eldon Skowron, who is now 70 years old, is a retired dentist and an American Dental Association Certified Dentist. He is the author of over twenty books, and is a well-known public speaker on dentistry and the oral health care of children, teens and adults. Eldon's interest in dentistry started in college in 1975, when he read Dr. H.M. Hill's The Oral Health of Children and Teens. He was very interested in the concept of oral health and the implications for the future. He became a dentist in the early 1970s, and he's worked as a dental hygienist, and as a dentist at the University of Maryland, a Baltimore, MD dental school. He's also worked in the dental office of the University Hospital and School of Medicine, where he was the dental assistant in the trauma ward. He then worked in many other dental offices in Baltimore.  He is also a co-founder of the Association of Dental Hygienists, the American Denture Society, and the Dental Academy. He also serves as the President of the American Association of Periodontists. In addition to his professional work, he continues to educate himself on many facets of oral biology and physiology, and promotes the use of fluoride in oral hygiene and dentistry.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  the book is not really bad but it lacks that one last bit of interest that made it good to begin with. The characters are not the best but at the same time they aren't the worst either. I enjoyed the setting but when the plot is this one sided and doesn't have the depth it should have there is little enjoyment to be had. Also the author spends way too much time explaining things that should be easy to understand if you know what he is saying but is in fact very complicated and confusing at times. I don't know why people who want a good book or series should read this one but I guess this is a book that I'll never be able to write a review on or recommend to others. I think the same applies to the movie, the movie is pretty much a completely different story than this book. Overall a pretty decent book but I wish the author would have spent more time thinking about what he wanted to say or writing a better book than this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really looking forward to this book. I'm an avid reader and the new series seems to bring out some really great books in a short time period.  That being said, I have read several books in the last year by this author and they have been good, but I have always found his writing to be a little weak and the stories to be somewhat predictable.  For my money, I like his "Harry Potter" series better, although the "Vampire Hunter D" series and "Evelyn" (the first of the "Mage Hunter" series) were good.  I'm going to check out "The Death of Dulgath" and "The Last Witch Hunter" for sure. I wish this book was a little bit better.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     As a fantasy nerd, I am so excited to get my hands on this book. I have a pretty good grasp of fantasy so I was expecting some good stuff. Sadly, it's just as bad as the last two books I bought from her. The writing is awful, the plot is boring and I just find the characters to be boring. No wonder she's got a bad reputation.  The problem with the last books is that she has a bad habit of writing about characters we're not interested in. I just can't stand to read about a wizard who has sex with his sister. (I'm so glad I've finally found a good book that I can read on the subway with a friend.) This book was the same way. This is such a bad character. I don't care about the characters she's writing about (sorry, I know I'm late to the party on this).  I'm also disappointed that she changed the magic system in this book from what we're used to. As someone who really loves that kind of book (such as the Harry Potter books), I was disappointed that the magic in this one isn't the same. In the Harry series, there was a time when the spells were different and people were really excited about the magic. This time around I guess it was more about having different magic items and it just felt like she forgot about magic in the end.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was pleasantly surprised that my friend had read the same book, only the different title: "The Art of Being an Atheist" in 2011. I was more surprised at my friend's reaction to the second book. After reading the book and listening to my friend rant about how she felt betrayed and that she was going to commit suicide, I could feel myself starting to go off.   It started with a review: "I was surprised by how many of the books I have bought over the years have disappointed. When I first started reading I expected that a book like this could be enjoyable." I could only find one review that said anything positive about the book. Even then, it's a positive review: "… the book gives a fair representation of the arguments made by theists, as well as an explanation of what the religious beliefs are and what is known from the scientific perspective on life." That is all the positive stuff.  , I have never been offended by a book title before. But it bothered me that the book's title had the word "atheist" included in it. I could not put it down. At the end of the book, my friend wrote, "I found myself saying things like "Well, actually, I guess I am an atheist" to myself over and over again in disbelief. And it bothered the hell out of me." That was exactly what I felt like at the end. It bothered me so much that I had to put it off for a while. This is the reason why. This book is like a punch to the gut. I think this is the most offensive thing in the book: "It's not that the arguments for God are easy. They're not. There are plenty of arguments to make a case against theism. They just aren't very good, and the religious aren't so good at arguing against them. So why do they keep coming up with them? Why do they not simply say, "These arguments don't hold water"? You can argue this if you like, but it doesn't change the fact that, when you read their argument, you get the feeling that they want you to believe, even if the evidence doesn't say that they do. It doesn't matter how much you read, how many great books you have ever read, they are going to tell you they have the answer. Why does that make sense? Why does it matter? It doesn' t."It makes me wonder why God does
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** A great book with an amazing story. I would have liked to see it adapted into more than one story. The second part was very much like the first, however it did not develop the story and left a lot to be desired. The author didn't seem to care that the characters in the first part were so good and they felt much more human and more of a part of the story. My only other complaint is that the author does not seem to know that she is a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When you look up "Buffy" on her list, I hope that she knows that her characters are so similar to Buffy.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like books where everyone is a genius or where everyone wants to kill everyone. This book didn't do either one of these things and I can see why the book made the top 100 but for me I just can't recommend it at all.   10/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was given this book in exchange for my honest review. I've never heard of the author, but I've seen several photos of him and he looks legit. I'm not sure what his intent is in writing this book, but it comes across as a poorly researched, poorly edited, and poorly written "exposition of some of the basic tenets of Buddhism" as the title states. The prose seems to lack a degree of precision and there are far too many "so-called scientific facts" that don't really add anything to the text, and the anecdotes are either too fantastical or not believable. And I have to say, this book feels like a joke, because the concept of reincarnation and karma is not as old as most people would think. And even if karma was so, why does the Buddha make all of these recommendations to do something different? Most people would just tell you to forget your past, which is what the author tries to do, but of course it doesn't work. I don't know if the author actually believes it, but the book is full of "so and so says that X happened and you should do Y" type of quotes. That doesn't make for a good read, and if it were my money, I'd be reading more about science. I wouldn't be reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This is a very old and old fashioned book that shows how much people have changed since the 1800s. The author makes the point that as our society has become more technologically advanced we have also become more materialistic. For that reason there are no longer many people who are living the simple life. In many instances, those who do live the simple lifestyle are living their own self made lives. The book shows what can be done to preserve the simple living life, and even what can happen to people who have gone back to a simpler life. I personally think that we should learn to appreciate simple living, and not be so selfish.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! The best book I have ever read in my entire life! My husband said he felt as though I could read his thoughts while reading this book, and it is true. I have never read so many books in my life. I cannot wait to read more of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read all of the reviews and the reviews are not good at all. The book is not even interesting for the characters. The story line is not deep at all, it is simply a plot. At the end, the author has to switch from the main characters story line to the 'good guy' story line. It is a typical example of a book that can have an interesting story but ends up being completely boring and without any depth. I recommend it not to be read but to view on DVD or read at home. I am not too fond of the author and I will not read any of his other works.  10 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************** I thought this book was really cool and funny. It was very different from many other science fiction books I have read. However, there were a lot of spelling and grammatical errors. I do think this is what science fiction fans want, but I feel this should not be a requirement. I would have given it 4 stars, but it was so hard to keep myself from buying the new one that I just went for 4. My son has read this book and loved it. It is also really good for reading with my 6-year old, who loves to read. My mom likes science fiction and this is the book for her. I hope I won't need to buy this one again. But if I do, I will get a second copy just for her!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole book was very poorly written and the ending was really lame. I couldn't believe it when it said it would be a short story, but it was way too long. A few characters just were way too bland and boring. I am sure some will find enjoyment in it, but I would give it a 0 or 1. Also, you should consider buying a copy of The Windup Girl which is much better written and more interesting, but the ending of this story was just plain silly and just left me unsatisfied.   In the end, I think you can just skip this one and go read something else. It's just a really bad story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************************  This book has nothing going for it.   The writing style is a little choppy, the plot is not very compelling and it is full of spelling mistakes.  .  There are so many spelling errors I have to assume the publisher must have not read it or looked at it.    As for the story I think I just wasn't going to care for it at all, just seemed a bit boring.  ,  ____________________________________   3 out of 5 stars is just too low a rating for this book.   The book itself has a very interesting premise and the concept is not just that the book was a "dream" or a "bad dream", this is really the beginning of a journey for the two main characters and a large cast of others.   I liked it the way the book started out and I think the book will hold a very strong interest for people.   of course it is impossible for a book to have all the best parts, it is very easy to write about bad people and the best ones are very difficult to create.   is not to say that this book will make you hate people and hate yourself but I would encourage people to not read this book and think critically about it as I feel that many people could benefit from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's very difficult to read. It was hard to read the whole book. I don't remember much of it. I remember a lot of the parts that were so boring. The chapters that took place in an elevator were very boring, it made no sense.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this to read for a class I was taking in high school. I took it in one day and then completely forgot it had been on my bookshelf.  The main character, Harry is the stereotypical antihero.  His mother dies in the first ten pages and he becomes depressed and has to drink.  I read this to a group of people and when the class read the story to the kids, they all were laughing so hard.  After finishing this book I was so angry I wanted to punch the teacher.  My only problem with this book is that I didn't understand the main characters motivation at the end.  Why did he drink when he didn't have to?  I mean he didn?t have to!  Why wasn?t he depressed at the start of the story? Why was he a good person at the beginning? I will probably read this in one go and then write another review on it but for now I will pass.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I read this book on my Kindle, but when I went to download it on the Nook it did not work. It said "this file has been deleted". When I read the title I knew this was a problem. I have a few books on Nook and I never had this problem before. I am not sure if I just bought a defective copy or if it's a good thing for my Kindle but I would not recommend it. Also on my Nook the page turns all the time, so you have to keep turning your head when you read. This isn't a very long book and there are other books that are not so bad but I found the story to be interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________ I was pretty excited to read this book. I'd wanted to read one of these since I first read the movie about ten years ago. I've always enjoyed books about the paranormal, but I wasn't sure how well they did in the cinematic medium, especially the "old-school" versions. (The last two I've read, the filmmakers were kind enough to make sure to include the original book and audio!) It seemed like a good fit, as it features people who have gone through a traumatic experience, and it does that quite well. ____________________________________________ 1) The first thing I'm going to say is that this book is an extremely long book (over 400 pages). A lot of the story was told in flashback, which felt very off-putting to me as I wanted to get to know the characters. (I really like flashbacks to a point in a book, but if the characters were going to flashback in the book, I really wanted them to have a background.) 2) I did enjoy the story at first, but it really took a turn for the worse as the characters started to get more and more crazy. 3) The "final" part of the book was a little slow, but at the end there were some surprises. The ending was good though, even though I didn't expect it to be. ____________________________________________________________________________________   The book tells the story of a man named Mike who was kidnapped, raped, and left to die in the woods. The man's best friend, Rick, is also kidnapped, but manages to get away. Eventually, Mike is rescued and Rick makes it back to the safety of his house. At that point, they decide to keep going. Mike, however, is getting progressively worse. He can no longer talk, his hands are starting to melt off, and he's starting to get crazy. But his friend Rick is growing more andmore impatient, so he agrees to take him back to a hospital in Los Angeles. This is where things get really bad. They drive to Los Angeles, and Rick starts to try to convince the doctors that he's in danger. But they aren't listening, and Mike passes out in the car. He wakes up in the hospital, and is found by the person he thought was his kidnapper, who turns out to be a woman named Anna. He soon realizes that the woman is actually an alien being from another universe called a "demi-god." And she's
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ I wanted to read this book so bad that I bought it right away. I have a hard time giving bad books good ratings, so I will do so here. The first half of the book is nothing short of a letdown, but I am a sucker for adventure and I think that I had forgotten how good it can be. And what's this? Another book where they don't get very far. Well, I think I'll give up on this one. ___________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing in the book is just horrible. The narrative is broken and confusing and it really makes you question what the author is trying to say. You start this book with the idea that the book takes place in a small town but as the plot goes on it turns out that the people you meet really are very, very strange. I had no clue how to proceed with this story and there was no way I could see myself finishing this book. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________This book does not live up to its hype. It's a bit slow. The main characters, the main plot, the character development, the ending, the world building, the characters, none of these are very impressive. I could tell a lot about the book, but I didn't. The characters are all somewhat the same. The one that is interesting is the heroine, and I suppose she's the main character too. She's a lot like a stereotypical heroine - she's a girl who has a huge crush on a guy she hardly knows. She doesn't know her parents, so she goes to live with an uncle (who was an old woman) who seems to be kind to her. She loves him like a daughter, but she's still a bit unsure about herself. This girl gets to know the main characters (who are her parents) and gets to see the world a bit.The book also had some of the best descriptions of a forest I have ever seen, which was very nice. This book had so much good things about it, but it wasn't what I was looking for. It didn't live up for me to the hype I put in my review for the book. But it was okay, I guess.____________________________________________________________So far, so good... but then this book is a bit on the heavy side. But that's fine. It is all about the love. If you loved anything about Harry Potter, you will love this book. This is the kind of book you don't have to be in love with characters to like it. It does not have any of the dark tone of the Potter books. It doesn't have the same feel. It has a lot more of romance in it than a typical book, which I didn"t like. The romance wasn't anything out of the ordinary. It was a bit clichéd, and it wasn"t a bad thing, just something I wasn't crazy about. The romantic angle was nice, but there wasn"T be a plot twist in this book, there was one, but the twist was kind of dumb. But I guess a bit too much can go right in the story. It"S also not the most exciting book. It wasn"S fine, but then some of those moments happened and I felt like the book was just kind of a story. Maybe that was what I wanted, but to be honest, the book just didn't wow me. It had moments of
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am absolutely in love with the idea of the  Kinky Sex Club  as the inspiration for this book. I loved the introduction. I was really excited to learn about the kink community. However, the book turned out to be really boring. It really wasn't that different from other BDSM books. There is a lot of kinky stuff in the book but not much real discussion about how to create sexual encounters for kinky people. I really wish the author had included more of a "how-to" approach to kinky sex. I also wish that there was more in the way of tips, strategies, etc. I think it would have helped readers that are looking to explore kinky play and create their own kinky relationships. It is not easy, I know.  Kink does have a lot to offer people.   What did you like best about the book?   I loved how Kinkty was honest about her own kinks and desires.  When I read the introduction, I was reminded of the kinky stories I have read. As I was reading, I found myself asking Kink, how do you do it?  What's the secret? I wanted more.  Something you would change or add to this book?   I'm always excited to see the next kink-related book coming out.  So many wonderful authors are putting out fantastic books.  As much as I love Kink's new book, I think this book is just as important to get from her.  I'd also like to see a little more about Kink and her own history and what inspires her to write and produce her books.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- *A mediocre book.* I will give it 2 stars for the story, since it was entertaining. My daughter thought it was fun, but a lot of the story was very confusing. I'm a teacher, so I couldn't help my daughter as much as I would have liked to. This book was just too difficult for me to understand. Also, I have a daughter with an IEP. I am trying to find a book for her, that will help her to learn the IEP in a fun way, which she is having a hard time with at the moment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really hoping this book would be the same as all the others I've read from this author.  Well... it was not.    The pacing was terrible, and the story was kind of a mess.  But... that's not all bad.  There was some pretty good characters.  Some of my favorites are from this book.  I think that I will be revisiting this one a little more in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a piece of shit. I've read a lot of stories about the paranormal, and I've never met anyone who has done a better job writing a paranormal book than James Van Der Beek.  So I can't recommend this book at all.  In fact, if you want a paranormal tale that will suck you in, I would suggest this book over all others by the same author. 5.  Might as Well (review of free book) By: Mark Alan Miller "It was all very simple and very logical in my mind.   The entire scenario of the people being abducted and being held against their will inside a giant spaceship with little to no access to food and water was very logical to me and I could explain it.  My thought process was extremely logical and simple to me." The author's story is interesting and fun, but this is one of the most convoluted stories I've ever heard.    You know you're in trouble when you can't even explain it clearly in the first 20 pages.  If you don't believe me, read the excerpt from the beginning to the end and find out for yourself. The book ends with a cliffhanger of some kind and the narrator says " It was an enjoyable ride.  I'm ready to continue on with my story, I'm eager to share with you all about it"  No.  This is the kind of thing that makes the narrator sound like a dork.  He never uses his own words or describes anything in a logical and well-reasoned manner, it's all word salad.  The story could have been shorter and it would have made me more interested, but it was just too long to waste time with that shit.   In summary, this book is garbage.  It's overlong and poorly written.  There's a few moments of magic, but the rest of the book is just garbage.   So what do I think of this book?  I don't know.  You tell me. 4.  Strange and Bizarre Tales (review) By Mark Alan Hynes " Strange and bizarre tales that you won't soon forget.  A must read!" I've never read anything so stupid.  No one would read this and think it's funny.  All the stories are about a guy who has a strange problem and a bunch of strange characters who all act weird in weird
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book should not be read." "This book was poorly written and written for a bad read" This book is boring as fuck and just as badly researched as every other book he has written. And I will not be reading it. It's bad for the sake of being bad. He is just wasting time writing this book, it would have been better for him to have done this book from the beginning with the goal of getting into a university and then working in an academic department. I want you to know why I can't give this book a rating of less than 1 star. I've read so many of his books that were better written than this one, but this one I just can't. Why? 1) This book doesn't have a proper end. He just has the whole book take place in his head and the characters are his mind. 2) This is a story about a group of students in India who are all very smart but have never really had any experience in learning. They learn the basic grammar and vocabulary that you learn in school and then they go out into the world to explore the language. All of their knowledge comes from books, websites, and other people they meet in class. So they start off having no idea what they are doing, they're so dumb. 3) They have no sense of how to properly organize a learning environment. They are on the internet all day and all night, but no one is going to give them a clue as to where to start because they've never been in an environment like that before. 4) They seem like a bunch of spoiled brats. Their only job in the school is to read out the class assignments. This is not really their job, this is their only job, just like everything else that is the job of students. It just seems like their job in class was to sit there and take the assignments. It seems like they were given a job, not a place to study. 5) They are all on social media. They seem to have no idea about the world beyond their little bubble. This kind of makes them seem dumb because they didn't have any real experiences in a "real world". The idea of traveling around the world, living in a different country and having to learn a different language and culture is just too daunting to even imagine. It would be like trying to learn Japanese by reading books in your room and not going outside. That's why this book
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was awful.  I had to skip past about half the pages in the book and then I stopped reading.  I guess I'm used to reading about children in peril with magical powers, but this book was terrible.  The main character was really annoying to me.  No one could get past her and it was kind of annoying to read about.  So I stopped and didn't want to read it again.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was not what I expected from someone who writes in this way, it was too confusing and confusing. I was looking for a story that was more focused on a child who was lost in the middle of the forest. I don't know how someone can make a story about a child and make it so boring that I wasn't able to follow it. It was also quite a while before I got the ending I expected it to be. This is one of those books that I will not be going back to. This book is bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I bought this book hoping for something interesting and different. I was not disappointed. There were several pages of content that was interesting and a lot of great information. But then when it came time to actually use it, well....the information is vague and not practical at all. The best way to use it is to study and learn from others. It does have some good ideas but if you get what you want then you can figure it out on your own. I wish there was a more complete explanation of the science and math but that is not it's fault. It is what it is. You don't want to waste your time learning a subject that you don't need to know.  26 of 28 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had an amazing time reading this book, but it was a bit too long.   When I finished it, it felt that the book wasn't as interesting and memorable as it could be. I do agree that it was written well, but there are some really boring scenes throughout the story.   He was definitely a main character in the book, as was his love interest, but he was just a little too good for the story that he was in. It's a shame because this book was pretty good overall.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I have to agree with the poster below. I had high hopes for this book. I thought it would be another good look at the nature of the beast.   I'm really not sure what I was expecting. I got some pretty high hopes but this book was a let down. First off there wasn't really a plot. The book was more about the family and their lives. If you're looking for a plot you'll be disappointed. I don't know if it was because of the way the book was written or just that I didn't get much of a story, I can't really say for sure. It didn't really seem like there was any real theme to the novel.   I think I was the only one really left wanting.   in the end there were only a few characters I can remember and the rest were just a few that I heard about and thought they might be nice, just so there would be a few in there at least.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ This is a good book but, the bad part is that all the action was done by a female protagonist. Why a female character was there is a mystery for me but I do not really care about that. Maybe the male protagonist would have been better because he was a character. The story was good but, it was slow. It felt that the author had to take time to write this book. That was not good. A good book with no action from the male character. You should just read the book. Also the cover of the book is not beautiful. I think the cover should be a lot better than that of a book with a female protagonists. And now I can't buy any book from the author but only this one.

I don't care how many books I read but I just don't like this story.  10.0 out of 10
Write a negative review about a bad book:   When I first began to read this book I was immediately drawn to the style. It seems to be based on the same sort of style as the stories in the novel by James Patterson, and that is how it should be read. There are many times when a narrator is trying to impress the reader with their knowledge of something he's seen, or at least their ability to guess what it might be like, and it comes off a bit too cliche for my tastes, but the overall story is really good.   The book is very, very long at 3458 pages, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. It gives the reader time to get used to the different styles of narration, and the narrator in this book seems to fit in pretty well. It is a bit of a slow start as I kept wanting to see more, and I also don't think there are enough stories about sex in this world to make it feel like it is being written in one of those books where every second is a great one.   A lot of the stories are very long, and not very detailed. At times I felt that I was reading about a bunch of different people who had sex on a regular basis with other people, or the same people on a fairly regular basis. I also felt that some of the story were more about the narrator being sexually involved with his mother rather than the actual sexual encounter. The narrator seems to have done his homework on his mother's body, but I don't know how this translates over to the actual sex, and there is no explicit reference to how it would be performed. The other problem I have with the stories is that the narrator seems very disconnected from his family, and his relationships with them seem to be a bit forced. Also, there is a fair amount of racism in the book.   (hide spoiler)  I think the book has been over reviewed and is overrated. It's really not a bad novel and I can recommend it to a lot of people, but it is not something I'd recommend to a straight person looking for an erotic thriller or something of the like. I really enjoyed it, but that does not mean that I'd necessarily want to read more of it, and would only read it if I was trying to write an erotic novel. If you read the book and think it was worth it, then by all means, you could read more. You could even take it to the library and read it out loud to

Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________ So I've been trying to get through this book for a while now, and the latest copy has only become more of a chore than a pleasure. The author seems to be getting more and more lost as the story progresses, which is frustrating because he's clearly got a great imagination. The writing style is good enough that I could ignore the grammar errors and typos (which is a lot) and just ignore the fact that he's not really getting it. So I have a lot of fun with the story, which takes the reader to the far corners of the world and back again to the great city of the same name, which seems to have a very dark past. In this city there's a mysterious tower, a place which seems like a portal to the otherworld. At the start of the story the tower seems like the key to the door to a better, more innocent time. But the author is so intent on telling the story of a man called the Beast and his fight for what's right that he can't even think about what could have caused the Beast to turn into the monster he is now. But he's the only human who ever saw the Beast, and he's told that he is the key of the gateway to the Otherworld. And the Beast has a very hard-hearted wife called the Queen who wants to kill him and her son for the crimes he committed when he was the Beast. He's got a secret wife called Madam and a child, who also wanted him to change, but he refuses. Madam even has a pet monkey called the Monkey, who is not too happy with him when he's trying to make his way back home. So the story goes on, but it has little to do with the original story except for a few details. It just seems like more of the old man got lost in the maze of the imagination. It makes the reader want to run to the back of the book and rip off the binding, because I don't think that I'd be able to endure the story any more after having read it several times.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________ I am new to the area and have been going to all the bookstores I can to find books to read. I am a science teacher and a member of my local science club. As I looked through the shelves I noticed that almost every book had a cover that had a woman in the picture with a ball on her head. I was very disappointed with the cover and thought I would not like it. When I opened the book and began reading the first paragraph I found out the book was not good. _________________________ My experience with this book was as negative as everyone else's. This book is full of inaccuracies and lies and I hope you take off the cover because this book really is not a good book. ___________________ A great book by a great writer who got into a few things he should not have. I have been an instructor for nearly 50 years and have taught the most difficult students. They were often the hardest and hardest to teach, they were usually my toughest ones. The worst were the women. I had my share of the hard ones and never once did a female students show up on my radar. When the teacher asked me to teach a class about the anatomy of women, he had my class practice the following: "Lift the arms" "Pinch the nipples" "Press the thighs" "Push the breasts to the front" "Pull the arms out behind you" "Lean the head to the right" and "Lean your hips down." I tried to tell him the class was to practice teaching the anatomy but he said they were all wrong. They could not be taught from the pictures because no woman could pull the arms back like a man could. He said that women could not have the same curves as men so they should be thinner than men. He could not believe he taught the wrong information because he had had no female students. He also told them it was bad to lean their head to one side so he would have the class do the opposite and have the student lean the head toward the right. He never once told them to use a bra because he knew women could have curves if they used one. And he never once said women did not wear bras because they did not have those curves. He was wrong about the head being too round. Women are all the same shape but have different muscles and different body types. He did not understand what shape women had. He told my female students to look at the back of their neck, which they were

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------  I was very excited to hear about this book because it's by an award-winning author, and I love awards. I'm glad I tried it, though. It was the worst book I've read in a while and, really, not that much of a read. It didn't make me want to read anything by the author again, but I suppose it's not a bad thing, even if it's bad.   In a nutshell, this is about a character who is the most hated in the universe, for reasons that are never explained and, of course, for having a bad memory. He's a sad guy with a terrible memory, and he's never going to forget this. He is an alcoholic and his memory gets worse, but he's too proud to admit it, so he keeps going to the bar. There, he gets a job, and gets better at his memory.  One day, he comes across a girl, and they fall in love. They are in love for a long time. One day, she says she doesn't love him anymore. That night, she kills herself. And she never comes home. "In the darkness of this awful silence, the dead man had a vision. He could feel her heart beating, see her breath as she breathed her last, see the eyes burning in her own dark, lifeless eyes." I wasn't completely sold on this, but it has some interesting and thought-provoking bits and some decent characterization.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have had this book for about 6 months now and it's the worst book I've ever read. I do not recommend it. I have been having to read the book several times a day for the last 6 months and I am having a bad time remembering the names and dates. If you want to know what's in this book read the summary. It is a very poorly written book. If I could give this book a zero star rating I would. The content is very wrong and it is not an enjoyable reading experience. I feel like this book should be labeled as a bad read.   I do hope this book gets some recognition from some serious authors and publishers.

A LONG TIME AGO  When a group of friends were playing a game of blackjack, one of them came up with a brilliant idea. He proposed that if you are betting $1,000 you should be betting one million dollars, not nine hundred thousand. The idea was so brilliant, and the friends were so excited, that they decided to test the theory. The group played the game for several days. At the end of each day, the player with the largest score had to return all the money, plus interest, and give one dollar to each of his friends. A million dollars was a lot of money in 1970s Chicago, so the player decided to donate it all to charity.  the man who invented the Million Dollar Game   Steven wrote his first crime novel, the award winning White Ribbon.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________I'm a huge fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams, and am very happy that I've been given the opportunity to read a companion edition to the classic. The only problem I have is that the book is not really the best representation of the book it's based on. It's a collection of short stories written by various authors that were taken from the Hitch Hiker's' guide (which was also written by Douglas). This edition, however, is written by Graham Hancock (author of 'Lars and the Real Girl', which I really enjoyed), and it's a much more thorough and polished read. He actually tries to avoid the obvious rip-off that the original book was, and uses the books as a chance to explore the various areas of interest in the universe that it was written about, instead of simply copying the source material. There is also much more explanation and background information in this book. For example, at one point he talks about what a supernova is, how they work, and what the effects on other planets can be like. I like to think that this is more in-depth than the original. It also includes a lot of information on the history of the universe, planets, and technology in general.The one issue I had with the book was that the author is not very clear about who exactly the Hitchiker's are, and how they got there. It seems that they got to the point where they were the only survivors of an attack on them, which I found to be a little strange. But it really doesn't matter, because what matters is that this book is a good read and should be on the bookshelf of anyone that wants to explore what might happen if we didn't take such things for granted. I'd recommend this book for people who like reading about a different world, and people who want to see what it might be like to go to another universe. The stories are well written, and there's enough information to allow you to figure out what happened.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The ending was rushed, the characters' actions felt contrived, and the writing was too much about showing us how smart the main character is, instead of showing us what is actually going on with the plot." I read this story when I was about 17 or 18. I remember reading it in one of those little paperback/ebook editions that had a page of the ender, and seeing "Chapter 14" to the end of the story. I liked it, and got it as a gift, but I never finished it. I liked this story, and I think it's a bit better than the one that inspired me to write this. It's got the romance and the action, though I think those elements are better suited to a fantasy novel, and this is actually a romance novel. But it's well-written. The writing is clean, and, though it's set in an old fashioned kind of fantasy world, it has a lot of elements of realism and reality to it. I like the relationship between the main characters, and how well it's written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book based on the glowing reviews from goodreads. The blurb was all about how the characters "become part of the story", which is what I thought. I mean, they are in it, so why not? I guess it was just too difficult for me to get a grip of who all the characters were and why they were there. The main thing is that you never really get to know them and I got very confused with most of the characters. I'm not complaining, as they were very likable and fun to read, but there was never any depth to them. You don't learn who they were before they joined the mission and why, you just learn that they are now involved in the "event", and you just sorta learn what happened. The most entertaining character was probably Nol, who was a bit like the "cute one" of the group. But, I guess that's just me being a little biased. It did end up being okay, but it was a lot to take in all at once, and I can't blame it on being a "teacher's pet". If I had to pick just one bad thing about it, it would be that you don't really learn anything about any of the people. So if you're a teacher, you can still teach the class without actually having to know their names and backgrounds.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- (This is in response to someone who bought a copy of this book and it ruined it for them) I have to admit, I really liked this book. As a matter of fact, my wife and I were in line to order it for a nightstand Christmas present. I don't normally like romance books, especially those with a more boy-oriented focus. I thought I'd give this one a try. It was pretty good until I saw the cover. It just didn't seem like a happy happy ending. Now the story itself wasn't bad, but it was over the top in a way that I'm not usually interested in. I'm sure that I wouldn't read it over again because the ending didn't make me happy. But I'm glad I gave it a try because it was really good, if a bit over the head, in that kind of way. I also enjoyed it because it really made me think. I read a couple of other reviews that have said that the book is too long, and I think that may be the case. I can see that the author took a lot of time and thought in this book, but at the same time, it may just be that it's a pretty complex book with a lot going on. I know that most people won't read all the way to the end, but I think the ending made me feel that the story was over at that point. I guess that's what I call a happy ending and a sad ending. I still have my copy of it, but, I don a little better to order from Amazon.com in the future because it seems like they have better customer service, and have a shorter turnaround time.  This is a pretty good book, I'll take it! It doesn't bother me too much because it is not a bad read. It is not my favorite, but maybe because I am not interested in romance. I liked the ending, but didn't feel happy. So this will probably be a one time read for me, but if you like romance, then go ahead.  of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have a friend, the only positive one I can think of, who was disappointed with this book. She's also very picky. And in a bad way. She said,  "I was disappointed that the main character (who is a former CIA operative who now runs a private intelligence firm, or "black" agency) was such a loner. The characters had to have been so close to each other, but it wasn't enough." I think she means she's too close. She has to be with him. The thing I liked about this book is the fact that the author uses the "Black" agency to get a different perspective on the world, and the way in which intelligence works. It is very much of a dark world, where people are often selfish, and even evil. But the characters all have their weaknesses, too. The story of James and his sister is especially interesting, and I really liked the way the author set up the characters to work against each other. The main issue for me with this story is the way it deals with sex. For me, this is a real "no-no" and I don't like it at all. In this book, the main characters are all married, and we see several incidents where James is caught in the act with other women (even when he is clearly "married"). And one of the things the "white" spies are so bad at, it's one of James' greatest weaknesses, because he has to work so hard to hide his true sexuality. He is also one of those people who thinks that what you're into doesn't matter, it doesn't count if you're married. This is the only negative thing about the book, and it wasn of course the main issue that stopped me from reading the rest of the book. The way in Which it was written, and how it was portrayed.  So I give this a B+ because there was some good in it, and the ending was just perfect for a novel that deals with so many issues. I have my doubts that there are really women who can't handle being married, as the main female character was married in the book (she was one of his lovers and even took her husband's surname). It's a hard book to read, and while it's very much about espionage, it also is about family, about love, and about trust. It also deals with other issues that have nothing to do with espionage.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********This book was a total failure. I just finished reading this book and my jaw dropped. I thought it was just a book that got lost in the publishing and marketing process and was thrown out there for free by the publishers to make some money off of. Instead this is not a book at all. There are no "fans" in this book. It is a book for self-published writers who can't make it to the big time. I could see that the writing was not the strongest thing about this book but what the heck. I have read other self-publishing book with this quality but I did not think I would be in for this kind of disappointment. I am so disappointed in this writing that I will not buy any more self-authored titles from this author. It seems that this book is more to get you into the industry and gain exposure than it is to be a true novel. I will recommend this book to some friends but it does not deserve my review.**********  Rated 5 out of 5 by sfgrl97 from A Great Book I read this book when I was about 16. I loved it and I still love it to this day. It's so much fun to read and laugh. It really helped me get my novel published. I'm not going to say it's an easy book to write but it's a fun book to read. My sister and I have been talking about this books for the past few years. I think it's so funny and has such a simple premise. It would be a great addition to our library. I hope I can write more novels that are as funny as this one. This is one of those books I look forward to reading over and over again. I can't wait to get it on audiobook. I'll probably listen to it when I'm in my car for a drive home from work.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read quite a few reviews for this book and most of them have the word "awful" in them, which is a bit harsh. It's a bit difficult to understand why, after reading it, so many people gave this a zero. I'm glad I gave it the benefit of the doubt for once. I suppose this could be due to the fact that many of these reviews were written by non-readers, and since I am such a fan of the series and especially of The Emperor's Blades, this review will mostly consist of that series and its setting. I have read both series, and although I have not re-read The Emperor of Thorns yet, I have been reading it for at least a year. This book focuses on the backstory of a specific character and he is my favorite character in the series. He was also my favorite in the entire world. And, yes, I know that his character is somewhat unique. He is kind of the anti-hero, but I liked that character so much I was willing to overlook his flaws. But, I do understand that I was one of the few people to write a review about this book. I think it's quite possible that a good portion of the people reading these reviews didn't like this book, or, more likely, didn't understand it, and therefore couldn't give it the score it deserves. Anyway, I'm going to try to clear up some misconceptions I have with this book to hopefully convince more people to read it. If you are looking for a good fantasy novel to read, look no further. This is one of my favorite fantasy novels of all time. However, there are some things that I didn't get until the second or third reading. For example, when I first read this book I thought I knew how he was saved, but as I read more I realized that the person he is saved by is a woman named Eliza. I found out that she is an alchemist and she is kind, intelligent, and has a beautiful voice. The story of how they met, and why Eliza was saved is explained to us, and I loved that. In fact, it was one thing I actually wanted to see happen in this book because it was really cool to read this story. And I'm not even sure what the ending was supposed to be, but it was pretty good. It took me to a whole new level, and made me think about how important friendship and family
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ * The book was poorly written. * The author does not seem to have a grasp on some of the key elements to success. * It seems he has given up on the idea that people have a real passion for their hobbies, and now considers the fact that they are interested in hobbies to be of very little consequence. * He talks about the need to be a leader in your hobbies. * A more practical, if less inspiring, approach is to focus on one or two hobbies in which you are a good, effective, and entertaining leader.  Rated 5 out of 5 by kathleen from Brilliant book I have been trying to start a small business for months, and this book is great. I am very happy with the content. The first part of the book is devoted to what it takes to start one, how to find the right tools, how not to get burned out, how we need to make the most out of what we've started, etc. Then we get into more detail on how to set a realistic and attainable goal and work hard to reach it, while staying positive. After that we move on to getting a business license, selling products/services, and then how to handle the ups and downs. I have no experience or expertise in any of those areas, but the author's insights and examples are very helpful to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********  This book was awful. The first 100 pages are really good and the rest is horrible. I read a review somewhere that said that he was on the path of redemption, but this guy is a complete fraud. He is a con man. He has no business being in this field.  The first 100, I read as a child and was enthralled. I loved it, loved reading it to my siblings and loved writing it. I was so happy with it that I even thought it could be a novel. I would have even written it, if it were not for the awful last 100 pages. . ,  I'm not going to waste your time with a review, it's going to be awful, I know that. I feel so sorry for these people, they are so desperate to be famous, to be liked, to have their stories told, and in the end, that's all they are. I don't like writing the word 'troll' (yes I have used it before, and I've never regretted it) but this book is so bad. I can't even write a review about the story. I've been trying to read it and I keep getting annoyed with the poor quality of the writing. It was horrible and all I wanted was to rip the book in half so that it could never be made public again. I am very sorry for the people who have bought this and I hope the author dies. It's not a great book and I don.t want anyone else to be forced to read this garbage.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************************* I read a lot of books from people who have "lived" these experiences (myself included). I was interested in reading this book from the get go, because that's what I've done and that's exactly what I thought the author would do here. I was happy to find out that she didn't really have any experience and that what she said about her experiences is not necessarily unique, but more like what other people did and what they thought they did as well, so, I can be thankful to her. I found it to be somewhat accurate and to the point about her life and what happened to her, but I would not necessarily consider it a "must read". I also felt that there were a few errors in there, so I was a little disappointed in the overall experience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for my younger sister who is in 8th grade. It was a great read for her. The prose is crisp and clear with plenty of humor and a great cast of characters.  As a non-writer, I was surprised at how easily the characters came to life and the different emotions they expressed.   It was also funny how many times he uses the word "babysitter" because he thinks it sounds better than "caretaker."   However, the book is only funny when you really think about it and read about the characters. My sister is already on her third copy of this book. It's a great book for a child to enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I liked the idea of having two worlds at war, but I found myself wondering who was going to be left out of it in the end. Also, the book started off too fast and seemed to be trying to rush everything, as if it was going out to the printers too fast. It just didn't seem necessary to make a long novel in such a short space of time and I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because my friend said it was good and I wanted to try her books.   This book is a complete failure of a book, and it has nothing to do with the writing, it has to do more with the content.   is a great read, so much fun, and has an amazing ending. I love the way it goes from an ordinary day to a very different character.   of course I don't really care about what happens in the novel, but this one was so much more than that. the plot goes from a normal day to an extraordinary day, and I think I've gotten a bit of a taste of how awesome this is. this is a very interesting take on what happens when the world around you changes, I love it. I've never read an author that writes a book this well before. This one is a must read for anyone with an interest in anything related to magic, the occult, or just love stories about magic.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I was very happy to read this book and find myself able to enjoy reading it! There are some good points in this book about parenting and child development, but the book fails to discuss at all why there is a need for a "pink-piano" as a way to teach a child. In other words, why the "pinky-finger" is not adequate to create the musical "mood" of a child and why a "finger" with a pink-pinky middle finger is not appropriate to teach children to "connect" and have musical "connections". The book also fails to describe how to make children connect when it is not done by playing the piano. The book fails utterly to discuss the role music in learning, and fails to mention that musical "musicians" do not play with their fingers but rather with their ears and their heart. This book also does not provide any explanation of how to "turn off" music-making or play music that is not pleasing to listen to. As an author, I cannot understand how a teacher can write a book that so utterly fails to address any of the subjects the author claims to teach. This is a book written by a former teacher who is now retired from a teaching position. The author is either not knowledgeable or does not care about his subject matter or the students in the class he writes this book for. A negative review of this book would be: ______________________

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- This book is an absolute rip-off of The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler. The plot is the same as Chandler's, but the characters are totally different. The two main characters are Linton, a boy who wants to make his way in a tough world, and the older brother of one of his enemies. The only character I was able to like was Linton; his mother was just a hag. Linton's mother wanted to make her son become the heir of a fortune, while his father wanted to teach Linton about responsibility and discipline. The father, a man with a deep respect for his father, had Linton be a good boy until he was eighteen. Lint is a lazy, spoiled child who is the only child of the father's mistress. Lincolns father dies and Lincolt is alone, but he is determined to make something of himself in the world. He decides to attend a special boarding school run by a rich woman and her son. He must have Linton join the school so Lint can gain more money for his mother. LIntin, as the younger boy is called, has no desire to attend the school. He is arrogant, selfish and self-centered, and as he is a boy, he is unable to do anything but get his way. When he gets his way, he does so in the most disgusting ways possible. He takes other children's toys, eats their cookies, and sleeps in their beds. He can't take the hint that his parents would never buy him a new set of clothes or a computer. While at the boarding school Lint meets the other two students at the school who are also trying to become rich people: Charlie and his sister, Darlene. Charlie is a rich man who is able to get Linton to join him by letting him use his money. Lendon is so convinced that Lint will join Charlie that he becomes his accomplice in getting Lint into the school in the first place. There are some good scenes with Lint at the end of the book, and I enjoyed Lint more than I thought I would, but I can't see Linton ever liking the book at all. It is a cheap and very stupid book. If you like Raymond Chandler and The Big sleep, you will probably enjoy this book, but you won't like it at all and will have a hard time giving it another shot. The other characters seem very clichéd. If I
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book from the book store in my neighborhood for $10, I read through it in one sitting, and I couldn't put it down. But this book has a lot of good information but a lot too much hype. The writing is good, I had no trouble getting into it. The information is presented in a way that will help you understand it. This book covers alot of topics. It talks about how it's not good to buy a used car, a good thing to get a used one and how a car insurance company will not insure a car with a flat tire, and how to get out of your car insurance policy. I would suggest that you read the first chapter, but make sure you look it over again before you put the book down. Also it talks about other ways to get your money back when buying a car. I got out of my car insurance and am now getting a new car because it will pay for itself and the car insurance only paid for part of the car which was only about $800.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I don't get why the author would write a book like this. There is no mystery to the mystery. There's nothing really mysterious about this novel. There are no twists or turns, no secrets to be revealed, and no clues to be uncovered. This is just another whodunit with a bad ending. There was no point to this book, and it only ended up being boring."   I guess the reviewer had a bad experience with this book or he's just really picky. Or maybe it's the plot line that gets him upset? If you read the plot, you'd see that it's all really just a mystery. They just can't figure out who did it and why.   The book is boring and repetitive and boring, so the story doesn't matter. If you like a good mystery, then I don't think this book will impress you.

Her only "good" quality is that she has no feelings for anyone else. Her badness is so strong, she actually has no character. She's such an evil, horrible person that she doesn't care that her actions will kill her family or get her kicked out of school. She doesn't give a **** what anyone thinks about her, and yet, you can't take that away from her. If she would have been written as a normal character, she wouldn't have had a purpose in the story and would have made no sense at all. ~~~~~~  ... ~~~~~  Nate, a character I actually liked, has a very interesting backstory. He is a very smart, well-rounded individual. Unfortunately, he suffers from an inborn flaw that makes him very selfish. Even though he thinks he's a good person, he's so selfish that he's not even aware of it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  My husband, Mike, was one of my favorite characters, and the two of them together were so fun. He was a very honest person, had no problem admitting he was wrong, and was so open-minded that I didn't understand why he didn't want to have a family. **************** **************** **** **************** He has a great heart, but unfortunately, that heart is so selfish and stupid that he will probably never forgive himself for what he does, and will probably end up hurting or killing someone. ********* ********  There are a couple of characters I didn?t enjoy at all, but they?re just background characters and don?t get any development.       After reading this, I?ll never trust the writing again.   ~ ~ ~

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________ This book, when it was published in 1995, was a pretty good book. It was written by a young, energetic writer who seemed to be on the cusp of achieving the success that was to follow. It had plenty of good ideas and many good stories. But for all of its strengths, it is the most flawed book I have ever read. The author is an arrogant braggart who shows little respect for anyone who gets in his way. It is an attempt to make a lot of money and makes it obvious that it has little or nothing to do with anything real. At the end of the day, he just wants you to read his book because it's a good book and a bunch of other reasons. __________________________________ This is the one that killed me: _________________________________________________________________ I had read this book on and off for the last 15 years. At one time I was working on a research project that dealt with the rise and fall of American capitalism during the 20th century. I had been hired to research and write an article on this topic but it quickly became clear that the author's main purpose in writing this book was to make himself a lot more money. To say that this book is riddled with inaccuracies and half truths would be an understatement. The main source of inaccuracy is in the fact that the writer uses a number of economic theories that were never used, and which he does not cite in his book. He uses these theories in his own twisted way to try to prove his ideas. At times his ideas seem to come from somewhere else. I can't remember any economic ideas that the authors use, but the authors also claim that this is the main source for many of the ideas in this book. _____________________________________________________________________ I love it. ____________________ As a teenager I was obsessed with World War II and was always fascinated by the conflict. I've seen a lot about the history of the war and the various theories about it. The idea that the world could be fixed for the future was always appealing to me. In fact, I think many people would agree that there are certain things that the future could use fixing. I have a lot to learn, but for the most part it seems that there is no alternative. _______________________________ I really, really liked this book! ______________________________________________________________________ I think that this story will be a fascinating look into economic theory and is well researched and written. This book is very much an inside look at the rise of capitalism in
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________  I enjoyed it but was not overly enthused about it, though that does not mean that it didn't have a great deal to offer.   It was quite well written.   of course, it is always easy to be over-critical of the author's work. But I would have liked to have seen more focus on the characters than the action-packed plots. I would also have liked it if the narrator did a better job of reading my emotions as they changed throughout the book. There were a number of times where I found myself thinking that the story had lost it's way. I had never really liked a book in which I had a sense of something coming, and then the plotline suddenly changes to make the character feel like they are at the mercy of some external force.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a good story but it's all the characters, even the villains, that are really uninteresting to me. At the beginning I really liked them but as the book went on I just found myself wanting to kill them off (even the heroes). The bad guy is also over-the-top and is way out of place. All in all I give it 3 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! The story just didn't work, just made me want to quit reading   If you don't enjoy reading I suggest you skip this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book. I am so happy I read it. It was so well written. I loved the story line. I was a little upset when it was over. I am happy with how the book ended. The ending made sense, and it was very sad. The characters are all good. As for the ending...it was weird, and not in a good way. The characters were like they were on a roller coaster for a few chapters, then they dropped off the ride and had a little adventure. It got me excited to read the next book, and that was kind of what I wanted.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife and I read this book in a day. I found it dull and confusing from the first time I turned the page. Not in the sense of the writer's fault, but the fact that it was poorly written, badly paced, and badly plotted. I've been reading fantasy since I was eleven, but this was the first book that made me feel I was reading something more like a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. I'm writing a review right now and can't stop. I don't understand why anyone who reads this book would be interested in buying it. It's horrible, offensive, juvenile, insulting, and makes my blood boil. As a white woman who has worked on both sides of the camera, I've read more racism than this. I've heard countless racist remarks in my life, but this was the most offensive I've ever heard. The author tries to pretend that this book is satire when it's really a hate-filled piece of propaganda. She says that the racism in the book is based in the fact that her character, Bessie, "has been a slave her whole life." She says the book "doesn't make the reader racist." And, "There's a lot of racial tension in the south." How racist can you be? And how could the book even get away with making me feel that way? I can't even say what the book's about. There are no characters. No background. Nothing. She could have just as easily said "This is a satire of southern culture." Or "This book was written to poke fun at the stereotype of southern Americans" This book has nothing to do with southern history. It has nothing do with the south at all. There's nothing to say that southern people are racist or ignorant. I think she's just trying to make some points in this way. But this book isn't even funny. It doesn't even make any points. It makes racial jokes, stereotypes, and offensive comments. She tries to pass the book off as a satire, but it's nothing but racist propaganda. It also makes it seem like her character Bessy is an ignorant bigot, but even though she's said some racist things before, this book has a lot more racist content than she's ever said. The racism in this book makes me feel like I was watching the movie "Spartacus" with all the racism. Bess has no sense of self-preservation. B-O-R-D.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________ I'm a huge fan of the author's other books, and was really looking forward to reading this one. I was thoroughly disappointed in the book, in some ways even more so than the previous.    To begin with, I was disappointed in how few pages there actually were, given that it's billed as a novel. Even with only six chapters, the first one takes place in only three chapters, and the second and third are pretty short. Then, in the third chapter, we get a lot of exposition which drags on a bit. The last chapter has some very nice scenes, but they're pretty scattered and don't really make any sense.  And the narration is a little jarring at times.  I think a lot is to do with the way the character is introduced. Her character is so bland that you don't know whether to sympathize with her or hate her. Even the people we meet have very little personality.   The final chapter is a complete mess, as well. It's really more of an explanation as to why she didn't turn the others, than an ending. The author gives us little clues as to where the characters are going, but none of those clues are anything that I actually feel.  This book was terrible!  I don't usually read science fiction books because I tend to be really skeptical of it. But this book sucked all the fun out of reading it, and left me with an impression of an author who had too much fun writing this story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of those books that has an easy title that does not do justice to the quality of the writing, which is extremely poor. The characters are the same as in other series by the author, except that there is more of a focus on the main characters (and some side characters) here, which makes the book harder to get through, because the reader cannot relate to so many characters. I would love to know the reason this series has sold so few copies. My first impression is that the book is extremely repetitive, and the story does not progress, so I have to put the book down after reading each chapter. So I decided to look around for a different series to read after I finished this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a disaster.  I did not enjoy it.    This book is boring, it is unreadable and the plot is poorly written.  If you enjoy the Lord of the Rings movies this book will be a disaster for you.  You can say that I like the Lord Of The Rings but I did not like this book.  The characters and the writing are not well designed or developed.  I did enjoy the plot, but the book just does not hold together.  It is poorly plotted and un-explainable.  This story would have been better if I could have just skipped it.    The book is supposed to be one big fantasy story.  In fact it is the one big problem I have with this series, the one thing that is missing is the whole thing.  While you can see the movie of the same name you will be left with a complete blank page to write on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was a bad read. If the writing of the book was good, I would have enjoyed it. But it was bad.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been reading a lot of books by Stephen King, and as a reviewer, I am always on the lookout for the next one. The "The Drawing of the Three" is my new favorite, and it is one of the best horror novels I have read this year.  While the story is great, it does have one huge flaw.    In the final chapter, the characters are still alive, they just have lost their memory.  This is a big problem, and has been going on for over an hour in the middle of the story.  In the final scene, the character "The Ghost" appears.  This is supposed to be "The one who is missing," and the rest of the book seems to be a story about him trying to find her.  We don't see what has happened to the others in this story, so why is there a chance that the "Ghost" might have actually killed all the characters, and then left the house?  King has always been a storyteller who has an extremely strong character, and I thought that would be the case with this book, so it did not matter.  King has written many books that are hard to review and are a bit hard to read.  Unfortunately, this one has one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was an awful waste of money.  The stories were a mess of stereotypes, and the author, who is a professor of English, failed to get into the cultural context of those tales.  I'm not saying this is a bad novel--I'm just saying that this is not the kind of book I'd waste my money on, or any money on for that matter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is fantastic and the characters and the world in which they are placed are very well thought out and developed, I enjoyed the story and the ending, however, the pacing and development were way too slow and the book ended after like a week of reading.   If you are on the fence, do yourself a favor and just start with the first book because that is where the story is at.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked the book. The story was interesting and there were some good concepts to the characters.

I just think that it didn't deliver the promise the author made in the beginning.  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's about a young woman who was born with a rare genetic disorder that causes her brain to shrink and she can only communicate by writing or speaking. Her family is so ashamed about her condition that they keep her hidden and refuse to help her out. She has no friends and no real love life or purpose. I felt really sorry for her. She can't live alone and doesn't feel like her life is worth living. At least in the beginning she just wrote a book about her experience.   This book, though, was all about her relationship with her sister who has been the only person she can communicate with, no matter how badly she is treated. It's an incredibly boring relationship, and it's all because the sister thinks that the girl isn't worth anything because she's different. No, the sister doesn't have an actual good reason. She just knows that this girl will never live a life worth living because she is a girl, and so she can take whatever she wants. No sense of remorse, no remorse for harming her, no regret at all.   the main girl doesn't even think it's wrong, it's just a matter of fact that she thinks of this girl in a different way. But then, later on, the main guy tells the sister that he doesn't think the girl is a good person. He says that if she really cared about her sister, she'd stop hating her and get over her. And she does! And in the end she tells her sister to stop hating the girl. She tells her to stop thinking of the girl as less than human. They get their act together and live happily ever after.   a horrible ending, just really depressing for the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************************* I will say it from the very beginning. This book was bad. Not in the sense of being bad, but in that I thought it would be bad. The characters were cliched, the plot was simplistic, the ending was anticlimactic, the language was awful, and the plot and dialogue were completely pointless and the reader would have been better off just reading a good novel. It had the trappings of a good YA story, so why would I have to read another YA book to find out how it is like? It also lacks any suspense. Not that I wanted it to be suspenseful (because I read plenty of suspenseful YA books), but this was just too cliches to be exciting. For the most part, I thought the characters were poorly written. It was hard to read for the first half because I just didn't care about anything going on and didn't want to be reading about anything. I couldn't wait for the second half though, because it wasn't long at all, and if I had read the first part, it would have sucked. There is no real suspense in this book, and most of the plotlines just have very little payoff (they were either there to help the characters or make the characters feel better). For some reason, it seemed like they needed to make the main character a lesbian to have tension or even to have characters die. The ending was also anticlimatic and just left the reader wishing for something that happened at the end of the novel (a twisty ending that ended up being too obvious). I wasn't able to put the book down. I kept re-reading it because the characters kept reminding me of myself in the third grade. The language was just so bad that I was almost sick of reading it.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:..................................................................... This book had little to no potential. The premise of the book is that two different cultures come together, and a very small group of people form a war. There is not a single reason why this should happen, and the story seems to be based more on coincidence than anything else. The main character, the first person narrator, is a "cannibal". He eats human flesh to survive, and his family are cannibals as well. They are in the process of killing one of their own, and he's trying to convince them not to. This is a very clichéd first person narration in a novel, and it was very cliche to the point where the whole thing seemed just a way to have a character that eats other people die. The characters are pretty generic, and are given almost no personality beyond being generic people that you might find in any novel you have ever read. The only thing I found somewhat interesting was how the war between the two cultures got started, and how it was ended. However, once that conflict was over, they seemed to lose interest in it. Also, it just seemed like there were way too many characters and they were almost all completely uninteresting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________   The story was about the first time we heard about a new disease called ME/CFS. At first, we didn't think much of it.  This is how we learned about ME/ CFS:   We were out on a picnic when we heard a man say, "You all have something called ME. We've never heard of a disease that can spread through an entire community like this."  At first we were confused about this new disease. , I had never heard anything about a disease like this. What a coincidence! I was sure that something must be wrong with our whole community because there were so many people who were sick.   Then one day a man who was out riding his bike and who had been sick for years called me. He said that the only people who had ever been diagnosed with the disease before him had never really recovered, that they had all died and that the new ones were dying too.  of course we weren't to know what that disease was, we hadn't heard of it, we thought it was a mistake.  in fact it turned out to be a very serious problem that was spreading among the people in the same community.   I have since learned that it is called "Misdiagnosis Syndrome". I am sure that the term "MISS" was deliberately misspelled to make the disease seem like a minor thing, or something that you'd get over, and not something that was a cause of sickness. I found that to be an extremely disturbing aspect of the disease that I had not known about.   the disease is called ME because a few people who have been very sick became so sick that they were unable to keep their jobs, or were so poor that they couldn't go on vacation or could never afford to go on vacations.  is a very important part of ME/ ME. It is the name of the condition that people are infected with, and the disease they experience. This illness was not recognized at the time as a true disease, because people who are sick aren't recognized as sick. So we have now come to think that it was the disease. This is how I think we should have treated it. ME has been treated as an illness that affects the body, and that was the very first thing that we did. We ignored the fact that it affected the entire community.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ I've read a lot of books on how to write a book and have seen a lot written about how to get an agent. What I've never seen or read, is any information about what writing a good book should feel like. _______________________________ So, I finally wrote a book that I thought was great. And a few weeks ago, I had an agent and a publishing company call me and tell me they liked my book. ______________________________________________________ So, after months of writing, I got to the end of it, and here it is, the first book, The House That Jack Built.  If it was me doing the writing, it would be a good one. And here are my notes, a short list of things I would do differently next time. First, instead of the original draft, a second draft. It has a couple good sentences, but the first draft had some bad ones. Then, I think I made it too about how they came to the house and the story, instead I should have done more about the characters and their relationship.  Second, I would have put more about my experience with people and the difficulties that people have with getting a job, being accepted for a job and having a job. This would have been a good chapter. And it might have worked if the first part of it had been less about the story and more about how hard it is to get a job or how hard they are to get to be accepted or how the money is too much or how they are having a hard time with their relationship or their family or anything.   Third, I'd have changed the character name.  Fourth, I feel the story had too much action and not enough character development.  Fifth, I wish I had gone with a better ending.  Sixth, I changed the ending. (Maybe I would still have gone with that.) And lastly, I used the word "bad" way too much, and used too many clichés.  After writing for years I feel it is my responsibility to get the words right, the ideas right, and the structure right.  Thank you all for the support in making this book possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had heard so many great things about this book, but I didn't give it a chance until I read the blurbs for it. The only thing I can say about this is it has bad writing, a bad character, and a bad ending.  This was probably my favorite of the three books (and I've read them all). The story, and the plot, is wonderful. A young boy is being told the story of his father, who was a black man who was taken by the Ku Klux Klan and was tortured for three years. His son was told the same story and was abused.  The boy was forced to watch as his father was tortured, but then the story shifts to the mother who is forced to take care of her dying husband.    Once she's in the hospital, she tells the boy, "You have my permission to take off. It's okay, the Klan did it." The boy does.  He becomes a leader, which is the main problem with the story.  But all of the themes I've mentioned are present.  I wish the story were more focused on the family dynamic.  The boy in the story is being taught the virtues and lessons of what it means to be a human, by his mother who taught him, not by a teacher who was more interested in making money for her.   I read this book on a Tuesday morning.  As a kid I wasn't that interested in the stories of the black experience.  Now I'm a mother of three, and I'm interested in my children being taught from a young age about what it is to be human and what it has taken for me to become who I am.  One of the biggest influences of my husband, my brother, and myself has been The Cosby Show.  Watching this show has given us the perspective of what blacks and whites have gone through, and it's taught us that we can't go through the same things but that we will get through them, with love, hard work, and good people.  I would recommend reading this book to a kid who is in a family that is struggling in many ways and the themes will help to remind your child that it's not about being bad or mean to people, that it is a learning experience and that we should not judge one another.

The material here is very useful and it can be applied in any area where you are concerned about your inner life. The writing is clear and witty, you will learn something from this book. (Posted on 7/27/2018)  Beautiful Book! I found this book to be very informative. It is so good at telling the story of the male gender that I was very happy to receive it as my first book from Amazon. There are no unnecessary words. The pictures are very well-drawn and the author has clearly put all the necessary information in the book. Highly recommended. (Updated on 3/19/2018; see below.) (Posted by the author on 8/16/2018): "I have enjoyed this book from its inception to the end. The information is concise, detailed, and the images have so much depth and detail. I loved the photos of men in the workplace, as well as other men in public settings, and I am thrilled with the inclusion of those photographs in this book, which has been so very useful for me in teaching me about men and male psychology. I hope the photos are available on the internet in a manner similar to the photos included in the "The Secret Life of Men and Boys" series that I have been teaching my classes. In general, I was not as impressed with the photos in the photo book that have been shown on television as with the ones in the photos on this page, although I did enjoy the "behind the scenes" photos in this series. These photos are a great addition to any man's book. I really enjoyed seeing these photographs and I hope that some day I will see the full series. I believe that this book will serve its intended audience. This book may be too heavy for some, so perhaps a second volume could be released at a later date.

Write a negative review about a bad book:...................................I love the story and the characters. However, it has been three years now since I read this book so I can't comment on anything new. I think there are so many things that would make it much better. For example, why does the "good guy" take the other guy away from him when they are in jail together? Why didn't the "evil" guy take the girl from the girl he loves after she is about to marry the guy he loves, or does the girl want to marry him and is against him taking her away? Or why did the guy do the evil thing to the girl if it was good? These are questions I would have asked at that time. The story was okay and I got into it. I only wish it was more interesting and would have thought at the time if there was more conflict.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- If I was to give this book a bad review it would be like the reviewer did with "The War Game." I am really not sure that it would have changed his decision not to get it. He is very clearly not an avid science fiction fan, just a person who liked the premise. I'm not sure if he had not read the novel and had decided that the story would not be interesting enough to read. If it is, then I will not be giving it a review. For the most part it is enjoyable reading. I got a good laugh out of it, and I think that the author has a sense of humor and a sense that he knows what he is talking about. I have given this book two thumbs up.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   My daughter was a huge fan of this book. The book is very well written and I thought the book was well written. Unfortunately, this book was way over the top. I do not think this book will ever be a good book for young children or adults, at least not to the same extent as the first book. I am disappointed in this book, and my daughter too. I had the opportunity to see the movie and this movie is WAY better.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a lot of books by Ramez Naam, and this one, The Black Swan, is by far the worst. It's so disorganized, poorly written, and badly paced that it really is impossible to follow any of the characters. One of the main characters is named "Nyman," and in the middle of the novel she gets married. It takes six pages to get from the first meeting of Nyman and her husband to their wedding. It just didn't work. There was also so much talk about how much "goodness" she had done that you had to wonder if she was actually very evil. (That's also why I would never be friends with someone named "Meredith," since I know they're married to someone evil.)  It also has a lot going on that didn't add anything to the story. For example, the main character's son is named after a woman who died in a car crash. The main character says this after Nyman is arrested for her murder. I found that very disturbing, since Nyman was just arrested after the woman died. At one point, a very strong woman is beaten up in an alley, then Nyman goes over and beats the attacker up, and everyone applauds. So, again, the point of the story is about Nyman's evilness, and then her brother (who's evil too) shows up and beats up the man. If that's not evil enough for you, the author also has the characters make fun of a homeless woman who falls in the street, and later they make fun, and point out, what else they would call her, "The Devil." I couldn't get past the fact that they were making fun of her. I don't know what she's like as a person, but she definitely isn't a devil, and I can't understand why the author would make fun her as a character. It was really offensive to me, and it made me really mad. I would have given up on this book if I didn't love so many other books by Mr. Naam. It is very good, though, if only because there are so many characters in it. There's Nyman, and his brother, and the girl who loves both of them, who ends up making love to Nyman at the end, because the husband she loves is a demon who has been trying to kill both of their father (which is why Nyman thinks he's
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- The Book is interesting, but a horrible read. If the author would write a good book that was not so preachy, it would be worth it. In this book, it was preachy and wrong. It was a poor effort to do science in a religious setting. I have many friends who practice faith, but I do not think that this book was what was written. Also, this book did not have much to do with the book, which was more on science. A lot of people are trying to figure out how to live the life of a Christian, but they do not understand that religion is not the answer to the problems of humanity.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's an excellent book. It gives an insider's look into a very tough area of the world. The author is an expert on the area, as she spent years studying the politics and the economics, the culture and the history. It's a hard read and I can definitely understand how it resonated so much with people. I recommend it highly.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  So my sister and I had just finished reading this book (it was not available in the bookstores, so we couldn't go out and buy it to read at home).   We both have some issues with the book, not the least of which is that it feels like a first draft with an awful lot of stuff thrown in and not much being discussed, if at all. I have to wonder how much more of this book this author had planned. I feel like it took a whole two years to write this book.  I have read a lot of good fiction in my time. I haven't read too much in my own, but I don't think I'll be getting much more from this one. I think that is a good thing. "The Good Lord Bird" is about a man named Richard, whose home life and family life are not so good, and who finds himself drawn into a plot to take over the world.   The plot is a bit hard to follow. There are a lot more subplots and other characters and characters than the actual story. It takes away from the real plot a bit. You do not need to know all the details to enjoy the book. I found the story to be interesting. I enjoyed seeing the different characters involved in this, especially the children. Richard also appears a little bit as a father to some of his family, not only because of the story, but also because of how the author is portraying him. It makes him feel like a real person.   the author does a good job portraying the atmosphere of a very bad place, where people are very distrustful, and where people have a lot to hide, or that they don't want to talk about. It felt like I was in that environment, with my brother and sister, so I felt a little real and there was a little fear. It was an odd place to experience, but it had a feeling of being out of place and of feeling out of control. I thought the characters did not really show much development, and most of the characters were kind of background characters. There was just so much to do in this book that I feel there could have been a lot greater development, which was disappointing.   for the most part, it was a good read, especially because of it's premise. I really loved the idea of being in this bad place with only your family and close friends as support.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- If I had known there was to be a book with such an amazing plot, and an amazing world building to back it up, I probably would have given it a more positive review, but as it is, this book is a bit of a drag to read. The writing style is pretty cliche for a fantasy novel and the plot is also quite generic. The last few chapters, where the book ends in a cliffhanger, were the biggest letdowns in the book. This is just a pretty decent first book in a series and I hope that the rest of the books will live up to the quality of the first one.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* The book doesn't do any one thing very well. The main thing that this book does well is to provide the information about what happens and how the situation develops. The fact that we never really get to see what happens on what the other characters are going through, this book is a bit lacking. There are very few details about what is going on behind the scenes, it's hard to relate to the story and figure out what is happening. This also happens in the beginning of the story, you never get to understand or feel as if you are really on the same page with other characters. And then the ending is not very satisfying, we do learn that a good part of the reason that the main characters had been brought back into their past life is because of a girl named Nala, the main character from the other book, that died. However, when she comes back, she becomes a part of their past again, so that only leaves the main guy and the main girl. Nala gets a bit annoying in the end.   I would recommend this book, for people who like short stories and want a bit more information about this story. But I wouldn't recommend this for people that like to understand more about the characters. I think it would be a waste of a good book if it didn't explain any of the information that is going to be on the page.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very much looking forward to this book, as it was based off of a series of novels, but it turned out to be more of a rehash.  It was kind of boring.  I'm kind of surprised I went through this book when I did, it was more of an annoying read, and the book itself was a little bit of a drag.  Overall though I really enjoyed the book, and I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys short stories, but don't like the more popular science fiction.  The story was a bit slow, it wasn't particularly original, and there were some really cliche and cliché stories.  Still, there's some interesting characters, and some pretty good dialogue.  Some parts were a little dark, but they also made for some really funny moments.  If you can get past the cliche nature of the stories, and don't care about the actual plot, you might enjoy this one.  There's also a short story by Michael Crichton about a boy and girl whose parents both pass away and the life of their little sister, that's kind of a neat read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book with an interesting premise but a terrible premise.   In the book there are 4 major characters that have a common goal. They all have something to do in the upcoming fight, and a very big problem in their own lives. But instead of just doing what they should, they decide to use what they have for their own selfish purposes. The characters never seem to think about the repercussions of their actions. I can't really say what this book does that's special, other than the fact that it's hard to put down.  - The main character:    As for my main character, it seems that I am stuck at the same point in my life as his: I am tired of the routine, the lies, the bullshit, the stress, and most of all, the selfish acts. I am not in a good place emotionally, and this is why my character is so unhappy.   of all the characters in this book, my character was the least successful in his self-centered efforts. And I don't mean that he didn't try hard, because he tried hard, but he is a very selfish and self-indulgent person, which is why he never really gets anything done and keeps getting in trouble for his failures. When he does get something done he does it with a great deal of self-satisfaction and makes everybody else look bad.   - The two main female characters:    The only interesting thing about these two is that I feel like the author tried to make them not so different. They had something in common, they had to use someone else as a pawn, but I don`t feel that they are really that different, they are just doing the same kind of things.    The supporting characters:   The main character is the main supporting character, so naturally all other characters have to be sub-plots to make up for his existence. I have nothing bad to say about the supporting characters. They are all very realistic in their characterizations, I always had a hard time believing that they were all so evil, but when the author is done with them it's too late.   At the end of the book I felt the main character had made a lot of mistakes and wasted a lot in the past, so why would he stay on the road to hell? I know that at the end the main characters' fate is the same as all the other supporting characters, but the reason why
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________   My husband and I loved this book. I've read books about the world of UFOs. I know all the names of all the aliens, I've seen them all, read about them all. However this book is something special. It wasn't just about a UFO encounter, there are many facts presented that I have never heard of before. This book covers: - The history of UFOs, - The UFO cover up, - There are many people that know everything that's going on. I was very surprised. I wasn't sure if this would be a book I would want to read but I was so glad that I chose to. I feel that most people that have heard of UFOs are interested in seeing one and I was glad to read about this. I recommend this book to everyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a poor attempt to make sense of something that's not going to happen anytime soon, the whole premise is flawed, there's no real narrative to speak of, there are no characters, it takes an absolute ridiculous amount of characters to make a cohesive story (which is a little like saying "I just threw 50,000 paperclips into the air, one by one") this is a huge downer.   The author's main argument is that "we are going to need to change and evolve" and it is a pretty strong one. This makes sense as we have a finite amount of resources and time and we must use what we have wisely to get through this life. I'm not here to deny that there are many who have made mistakes, but we are human beings. We have free will, we should exercise that free will to do the best we can, but that doesn't mean we have to get stuck with some "alternative" reality or any ideas that are just an extension of the same beliefs we've had since childhood.   in the end the author is basically saying, we have been lied to by the news media, the government, our religions, our education system and our friends, we all just need to learn how to stop being duped and use what information we've been given to do our own due diligence, it isn't that hard.   a huge let down!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to believe it's been two years since I first read "Wool." This is a novel that has aged amazingly well, yet the plot of "The Secret World" has still not clicked for me (and I'm sure most of the readers here feel the same way). I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with this book at this point. I could re-read it, or I could do a bit of reading on it to see how it's doing. The book is a slow burner for me. I think it's about 15,000 words. I have some idea of what's going on. The only things I'm uncertain about right now are the point when the plot is going to click, and why "The Voice" (or "The Book") didn't say anything about what's in the book (or when/how/why the book will end).   I'm looking forward to trying the "The Last Colony" from the publisher's site (or someone else's, since I don't have one) after reading this book. I'm hoping to see some signs that there's going to be a conclusion to the novel. So far, so good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters are uninteresting.   They are not developed.  They make me feel bad for them.  I would like to be friends with them. I would do things for them because of them. They are nice people.  This book is so dull it makes the books that are even more dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I hated this book because it's filled with clichéd, cliché, and unnecessary plots. I can't believe anyone read this book and thought it was good. A bunch of young people trying to go to college. I mean come on, college! That's the plot of about 20 other books by the same author. Why do they have to waste a book on college? The book has an ending where the girl does get to go on a cruise with some of her friends and has a great time, and she and her friends go out dancing on their way back to the port, but they get there too late because their cruise boat was wrecked by a storm. You'd think they'd tell you that, and why they would give such a bad ending. If you don't know how to think, how do you expect others to think? But then the author makes you feel like you should know this, and you read on anyway. Well I guess it's all part of the plot. Anyway, so the ship is destroyed, but the girl gets back on the ship and starts the trip to her new college, and then the ship gets wrecked again, but now she's in the harbor, so she tries to get back on. And the plot goes something like this: ship is wrecked, girl gets on, girl is raped by a college student, girl wakes up in the hospital, girl's parents get angry, girl goes to college, etc etc. Now, I realize that I haven't read this author's other books, but I do know that his plots in these other books are not like this one. I also know that he does not make fun of college. It's all there. Anyway he gives you the ending, but then at the end he has you reading the ending so that you'll know what happens next. What do you think? Is it good? Did you like the ending? And if not, what's your favorite ending from the other novels in this series? It's kind of a depressing ending, don't you think, not a good ending? This is a book with an overused plot that doesn't work. It may be funny, but it's a waste of your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for my wife because it was written in a more professional manner. However, it is very easy to be misled by the cover and the blurb. The beginning of this book is terrible and misleading, and then it becomes a long rant about how women shouldn't date men because they make her feel guilty if she does so.   This book is written from a male's point of view. So it doesn't really bother me that this book has a very negative vibe. I suppose I would have to read the other three books before I could judge this one on it's merits.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________   I'm not going to lie:   The book is good. However, this is not a good book. I thought this was going to be the book of a very hot young woman who is in love with a tall, muscular, dark, handsome man, who is very rich, who knows his way around town, who will take her places, etc. Well, there is nothing like that at all. It's the story of a young, attractive, hot person who falls in love, falls in lust, and falls apart. It goes out of its way to make sure that no one who would read this book thinks it is realistic. And it really doesn't want you to think it's realistic.   "The man who was her friend in school was her best friend in love. He was like a brother to her. It was no coincidence, she told herself, that she met him at the same time she began her career as a journalist. Her boyfriend, who was a writer, wasn't as close to her as his friend, but he was close enough to be a good friend to her, and she felt that it wouldn't be fair to let him go."  _____________________________________ So, what do you think of this book? Was it a bad read?  A great read for me, but this is the kind of book that just doesn't work. So it would be a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ (The title of a book is not a good thing.) A book is just a collection of words. It is just what words do. It's a story told by the reader. It contains nothing that the reader won't find in the same books that he or she has read before. The author cannot make it sound like it is his own, which means the reader is forced to re-read it. The most frustrating thing is that the author does not have any kind of skill at writing or description. __________ (Why don't you use a computer to help you make up your stories?) That's something that a writer or a computer can do. ____ (I'm not interested in your stories. You've taken my enjoyment for granted and used it as a cover.) I didn't even ask for your book. I just want my money back. __________________________ (What happened to my money?) I had already paid for it but they charged me again because of your bad review. __________________ (Is there a "write-for-pay" program?) A good writer knows how to write for an audience, not for a magazine or a newspaper. If you want to use it you should read about how to do it. You should also read how writers of fiction can make money doing it. _______ (Does the book sound real, or like it's been written with a computer?) I think the story is real. ____________________________________________ (Does it sound real?) I'm really sorry. _____________________________________________________________________ (I want a refund. Please give me a refund.) I'm sorry but this is impossible because your book is copyrighted. ~~~~~~ (How do you make money?)

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   If you are looking for a really good book, that will leave you with the impression that you could learn something from the subject, this is it, but only if you read it fast enough (I'm talking, in 30 seconds, not an hour). This book is a really great read, but you should read it slowly so that it does not overload you.   There is one mistake I noticed with this book: it talks about a lot of scientific information, in the form of a "scientific paper", without including a list of the references. For example, on page 10 it says:  "A. C. H. Murray and P. D. McElreath have investigated the relation of various kinds of intelligence to various aspects of memory, reasoning and perception, and they have concluded that in general, the higher a child's intelligence the less likely it is to remember the name of an animal that it saw or the color of the sky."  The reference is in the paper (on page 9) and it says the opposite:  a. "The results were obtained by investigating the relation between cognitive ability and memory in a series of experiments on six children ranging in age from seven to nine years, and it appeared that children's intelligence was related in general to the extent to which they could recall the name, shape and colour of an item they had seen previously." ... this is a serious problem because they could have mentioned the name and colour and the shape. (And also to mention that they could not remember the colour, which is not surprising, since they were children, not adults.) And also, if I understand right, there are only a few references to these studies, and only in the second or third page of the paper. (I think, though, that there are probably even fewer in the first.) Anyway, if this is your goal, you have to read the paper carefully before you decide if it is worth your time. Also, there's a problem with the whole paper: "As a result of these findings, the authors have proposed a hypothesis based on the theory of developmental systems thinking. It is proposed that a process which appears to be at the foundation of human development, and may be part of our cognitive evolution, involves the learning of abstract rules and the integration of these rules with other forms of knowledge, allowing one to deal with a vast variety of situations." (p. 14) That sounds a lot
Write a negative review about a bad book:   So, I've read this story twice now. It was a very boring book. I can't help thinking of the movie "Election". I don't mind long stories but I just don't get into reading a novel with so many filler scenes. The only one that caught my attention was the one about the man that got shot. That's how I felt in this story. There is very little action, and most of it is just boring. The book doesn't make me want to read the next book because I feel like it is done. I will continue to read, but I won't be rushing out to buy the next volume.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is too long, and the plot too shallow.  I can't understand the author's decision to use a non-sequential format, and I don't really care for the characters.  I also really disliked the writing, especially in this chapter.   It is very bad.  It was more like "story of my life," then it was like "this is my life."   This chapter was so horrible, I couldn't even finish the book and was sick for days. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author's description is accurate. My book was a disaster. The prose was clunky. The plot was very dry. The characters were dull. The story was not interesting. The ending was not satisfying.  This is the third book in the series. I have not read a book in years where the prose, character development, plot, or plot development all just fell apart so completely. I am sad to say I will not be reading any further books in this series.   4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I read this as a student and was disappointed that there wasn't an index. I do like books with an index and I was pleased to find one for this book. Also I think some of the references are useful but for me it's more an introduction to the book. Overall, it was a good introduction and will give the reader an idea of the history of this region.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________ This book is a joke. I love writing books, but this is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. It is completely boring. I really hate this author. I wish I could give this book 0 stars. 1) How to learn to use a new computer I would have given this book 3 stars, but there was something about the formatting on the back cover that disturbed me. The front cover was printed so poorly and the back was printed as if it were written in Microsoft Word, which I found very odd, because Microsoft Word is known for being a poor program. I would have preferred a printed back cover. It didn't seem as if there were any other problems with this book, but the front cover did bother me. 2) How To Master Your Writing The book is filled with great ideas and great advice. It also has a lot of typos and typos that could have been fixed in a better manner. The typos in this book made my eyes hurt. It was a pain to read. I know that is the author's style, but I found it very distracting. 3) The Art of Storytelling This is a really good book. It gives you tons of great advice about how to tell a great story. However, it has a few serious problems. First of all, the author has very few stories to tell and I could have sworn that she wrote about 50 stories and never got around to publishing them. Secondly, the books are so long that the reader loses interest before the end. Finally, there are so many characters, it is almost as if the author wrote these books as a series of short stories. This is so weird to me, because this book could have easily been an illustrated novel. I think that if I were to use this book as a teaching tool, I would give it 3 stars. I didn't finish reading it because I felt that I needed to finish the book I was reading, but instead I ended up reading the book a second time just to keep my attention. 4) How Does an Artist Draw a Triangle? This was a really cool little book on how to draw a triangle and what to look for. I liked this book. The author does a great job of illustrating what it takes to create great art. I feel that her book would be even better if the illustrations were more elaborate and realistic. I also feel that the artwork in this was a
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________  It took me a long time to get my bearings.  I'm a big, big book reader. I don't know why that is. I guess it's because I read everything I can get my hands on: history, biography, biography of the author, and then I write myself letters to ask people to recommend my favorite authors. I always have this feeling that if I ever get any books from anyone, they're going to be good. I'm not much for self-help books, so it's always books from authors I already know, which isn't great for self knowledge. The books I've read so far have been in this series: ________________________  ____________  One of the reasons I couldn't get on with this one was the pacing. It seems like it was going to pick up and it was actually getting good. However, when the first two or three chapters had come to an end and I was in the middle of one of them, I was like, "Fuck this." It was as if I wasn't being told what the story was about, but I was being told things that were already established. For example, the protagonist was introduced with the idea that he had been an orphan, but he's so good with computers and other such techy things that it doesn't matter to him.    The third chapter had me on the verge of tears. It was a scene where he's talking to the old man and they discuss what he can do with his life that he doesn't know what to do with because he didn't get a great start in life. The old man, after listening to this, decides to give him his old computer, saying, "It's yours now, young man. You can do what you want with it, as long as it doesn'T hurt anyone." And boy, this is a guy who was in love with computers, so when he was introduced to his old friend's old computer and they start playing around on it, it just blows his mind. He thinks he's a genius, which he was before his death, and he can just do anything with it.   That chapter, and another chapter about an older woman who tells a girl what she should do with her life, and her being a terrible person and everything, was just a mess. It made me want to throw up. There are a few parts of this book that I enjoyed, but they were not
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I bought this book mainly for the book jacket. The cover was nice, but there was a bad picture and the text was just too small." This is the second time that my husband and I have purchased a bad copy of a book.  The first time was the 'Great White Hype' (this was from the 1980s and still seems to be sold in most public libraries. There was one copy of it on ebay that I found to be very high priced), but I was unable to find another.   As far as the cover is concerned, I think it would have been fine had the author chosen a different kind of cover (probably one that would have taken a little more time and effort), but the text had a very high print cost.  If I could have done it all over, I would have chosen a more expensive print, but the cover that was provided was just not attractive at all. I found it very difficult to read.  Another person who ordered this book from the library had a copy of the same book and gave it to his sister so she could read it.  She was also unsuccessful in reading it. Read an interesting review by a blogger who purchased the book: I was so pleased to find a book that not only I was interested in but that had been out of print for years and that was in excellent condition. I got an excellent book deal from an online bookstore and I loved it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- *I liked this book, but it really didn't get much better from the first chapter to the end. I like to read in short bursts, so I finished the book within 5 days. *I did like the idea that a person with an IQ of 300 could do anything. However, his reasoning was very bad and his logic was completely off. *This story was really bad and I wanted the author to have a much better way to put the information. *The characters are so poorly drawn that I wonder what is going through the author's mind when he draws them. He has poor drawing skills (as is obvious from the poor writing). I felt that he was trying to make up for the poor drawing by writing dialogue, but none of it was understandable to anyone that wasn't familiar with the character. *He did spend a long time drawing each character, but the fact that it was such a waste of time is a bit disappointing. *Unfortunately, this book was written as if a high school senior wrote it, and I wouldn't recommend this for that reason.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I felt cheated of a great book by this one. I don't know why this book was written. The main character was awful, the author's prose wasn't clear, and there wasn't much action or suspense. This is a good time keeper, but I was glad I got rid of it before reading any other books from this author.  13 of 15 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main problem I have with the book is that there is no plot whatsoever. It just goes on, and on, with the constant changes in plot and characters that happen. At the end of the book, the protagonist, Elio, is dead, the heroine's boyfriend gets her pregnant, and everything gets blown to hell. This is all very predictable and predictable things happens, and not much happens.   That being said, it's still a great read for sure. Elio is a great character. He is tough, he is stupid, he's smart, he has a good heart, and he has his moments where he can be likable.   The main problem that I have, which is not that much of a problem, but it bothers me at times is the author's writing style. The characters are very flat. They don't sound realistic at all, especially the main character. The most confusing thing I found out is that the main characters' parents were a couple, so we know that Elio's parents were not really his real parents at all.   this is really a great book, but the author did a terrible job with the main story.   the only character that I found interesting in the book was Elio and she has a lot of potential in the future. I love the main female protagonist, and I was really looking forward to see how the story would develop for her. the only issue I have is that it just took way too long to get to that point, but at least it did get there. I would give this a solid 3.0, but I think I would still give it a 4.5 or so.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________  It was a nice read. But it really left me feeling that there was a lot more to be said on this topic, and that we should all be making a concerted effort to address this very important topic.  I found this book particularly interesting because it seemed to me that the authors have put a lot of thought and research into their work, and also that they seem to have an appreciation for the importance of cultural difference and diversity. However, the book also seems to have a serious flaw, which is that the book's main argument seems to be that people of different backgrounds should not be discriminated against. The argument seems at first to make sense, as all people have their own experiences of discrimination, and we should work to address those experiences, both to create a better community and to ensure that people are treated fairly. In other words, we want a community where people from different backgrounds are treated as equals (as in all-inclusive housing, schools, etc.) and where all people are welcome to share in the benefits of the community (e.g., a great public school, good health care, etc.).  However, the authors then go on to make the point that because of these factors, people of all backgrounds face discrimination in the housing, the health care system, in the justice system, and on a host of other levels of society, even though they may not be able to directly experience the discrimination. They also go on about how this should be of interest to us, because all people who experience discrimination suffer from discrimination and that it is important that we don't give up on addressing it or on being vigilant about our own rights. This argument is made repeatedly, but I found the authors' reasoning at times confusing and contradictory.  a large section on how housing discrimination is important to address and how important it is for us to recognize it and be vigilant about it  But the authors do give a lot to do about housing discrimination. A large section is devoted to housing discrimination, which they describe as the discrimination that happens when one individual who can afford to buy an apartment chooses to live in an apartment that is more expensive than the apartment that the rest of the tenants in the building live in. (The renters in the other apartments can't afford the higher rent.) This is because the owner can get away with charging more rent and because it makes it easier for him to charge more for a nicer apartment. This example is used to show how discrimination has real
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book a few months back and really enjoyed it.  The characters were well written and the plot was interesting and intriguing. The problem was the ending.  I mean there was nothing wrong with the ending, but if you are a fan of horror and want a good ending to your book, you need to go read this one first. What more could you want from a series like this:    The last book is good and there are so many things I loved about it.  The characters are great and have a great time.  What was the author's goal:      I read all three books and it was such a shame I had to leave two of them.   The first book was the most interesting of the three and I enjoyed reading about it a lot. The second book was too short and did not have that unique experience that the first book had.  It was a bit confusing for me and I did not enjoy the ending at all.  And finally I feel like the ending of the third book was rushed and a bit stupid.  What didn't work:  In my opinion, the ending is the weakest part of the series.  How do you follow up a series that is such an excellent story:  My main issue with the series is that the ending really did not work for me.  For me it was so rushed and weird.  I love the ending that the book had but I was so unhappy with the book because of the ending to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry, but I just don't believe this book is about a group of vampires attacking a small town in the countryside. I think it's more about the love of children. The story is about two young girls that have always been good friends and go on a camping trip to a cabin. Unfortunately the parents of one of the girls, the girl who's friends have been killed by a vampire, are very suspicious of the fact that they have two new babies. The mother tries to hide the fact of having two kids, but the mother doesn't want the children, she wants her two kids back. The daughter is very confused by this because she and her friends have always loved each other. As she's trying to get to the cabin the father has killed the mother and the daughter finds out that her mother is dead and now her father is in the hands of the vampire.   The writing is horrible. My only redeeming qualities are the two daughters, the main characters are unlikable and the main villain is a complete douche. I don't think I'll be reading this book again. I'm sure this book would be better if it was about some kids and not about a bunch of vampires.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  My husband and I tried a few titles out of the library this past winter and were both disappointed. It was too many words to read for one person, but that just didn't work for me. There's nothing that I can say to help him, but it's going to be hard to put it down now. This was my first time reading a book written for children, but I've read tons of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book to a friend and they are still trying to work out what they were supposed to find. I was looking forward to reading it but the story was so convoluted and confusing I can't understand what the book was really about. I really hope that the author does better work in the future as it is the best of her books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an exercise in how not to be good at writing. This was actually my favorite book from my first time reading this series. I thought this book was a little better than the first book, but I was still very disappointed.   The first book ended with a cliff hanger, but that is where I stopped reading.  :)  8 of 8 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book took me a long time to read. It was really hard to read even though I knew what to expect. I read this book in a slow and methodical fashion that took me about 3 or 4 days. I tried to read this back to back with "The Great Gatsby" but I felt that the ending wasn't as emotional and profound as I was expecting. I'm not sure if it was because I wasn't ready for the emotional ride, or it was just me not really getting it the first time. Anyway, I think this is a book worth reading and I will re-read it to get a better understanding of the situation and to find out what the "great" Gatsbys had to say on the subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've tried to read many books. In the past, I've been disappointed by books because of their grammar or the poor writing style. I'm glad that I picked up this book.  I like that I get to read something different than a lot of other books. I got to see something new with the characters and the setting. I also like that this book is short and does not waste my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed this one, but it was so incredibly cheesy, so poorly written, that I don't even know where to begin.  It's a really fun romp around a fantasy world and there's a lot of clever writing going on, but everything is so over the top.   This book would be the perfect time for a kid to get into fantasy or just for a person who wants to read but isn't particularly good at it to try out an author who's good.  I didn't know this was going to be an amazing book from the beginning.  It really was something.  But it's so bad it makes me want to vomit.  So please don't read this, or even read my review of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* The book was not good. There were two main problems, which I have listed as follows: 1. The style of writing was amateurish. It was hard to follow and did not have any sense of purpose. The plot is not exciting nor does it have any real substance. There is not a lot of development of characters. The protagonist is so unlikeable it is almost impossible to enjoy reading the book. 2. The author's lack of imagination was apparent from the start. There are no characters that are truly original and the author does not develop them to a level that one would expect. I don't think any of the characters were really likable or interesting. The story was also very predictable. The first book starts off with the protagonist as the protagonist and ends with the antagonist as the antagonist. The reader is just left with the same information, that the protagonist had learned already in the first book. The end of the book just repeats this information, without any change in the characters. This was a really boring and unsatisfying book. ***********
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** The only thing I like about this book is how well it captures the feeling of the author's story and his experience. I would have loved to know more about the people he spoke with during the trip. I also found it amusing to read of his "nosebleed" and his "pinkie," but that's just my opinion. The descriptions of his food were very realistic. His wife and children were more "baked" to his description. I just wish that more attention was paid to these people's "personalities" and the effects it had on their relationships with the people they "baptized" or "paved." The story, in essence, was one of a person being turned inside out when she went to a person of a different culture. I enjoyed reading about the "experience" of it all, but I wish that the author had left out the fact that it was more than a one night trip for the couple. My son just won the "Best Dad" award, so I know there's more to that story. A review from: A Customer from: West Covina, CA U.S.A. You just won "Best of Best of Best"  I would definitely recommend this book to people looking for some authentic Chinese cuisine.   My favorite story  My mother and I went on a long weekend trip. My mother and her sister's family lived near a beach called the North Shore. They were from Guangzhou, China.   and my father and I, who were the parents of our children and a friend's family, stayed in their guest house. Our son, who is a junior in high school, had no clue where we were. He thought we were going to a friend. He is Chinese and he could only communicate through Chinese. It's really easy for me to teach him Chinese. We spent over two weeks there and our son loved it. He loved Chinese food, especially the noodle soup.  .

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book was just boring.  The characters were all bland and there were few moments when I was entertained or even moved by their story." A few things I was hoping for in this book: a bit more action, more romance, more adventure, more action - oh, and a couple less dull pages! But, alas, all that was not to be.   I don't mind action and adventure. But I don't particularly like romance either.  So, I guess I should say that I liked this book, just not much.   It's a good book. It's not great.  I was glad I read it, though. It was an interesting read, with some fun and interesting things happening.   I do think there could have been some more action and adventures in this novel, but I guess we are spoiled with books with that, aren't we? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A novel, about a young girl in college, that should have been good. It is, but is marred with poor pacing, inconsistent characters, poor dialogue, poor plot, poor world building, and very bad language.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  Not worth it.  It's just not entertaining.    I will give this to my daughter because she loves a good book and a good story.  It was soooo slow and boring.  I didn't know who any of the characters were at all.  And the story was boring.   It just wasn't worth my time and money. What an awesome movie!! " The Last Supper "  " A Beautiful Mind " " Unbreakable " My two favorite books of all time are The Great Gatsby  by F. Scott Fitzgerald and  American Psycho   by Bret Easton Ellis.  My favorite movie is Pulp Fiction and my favorite book is The Hunger Games  and I read a lot of it. " This  World  Has Never Seen  Its  Like  before " The only thing I can say I didn 't love is the fact that it was so long.   I really wanted to read this right after it was done.  Also I don't understand how this book was made and then put out on a DVD, and it was on an old DVD and then they didn't fix it and now people are getting confused.   So I will read my copy of this later and see what happened to that DVD.  "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo" " All the Pretty Horses" I'm not an expert on this kind of thing so I'm not sure of the movie's effect on this book, but I'll just say I've seen the movie and I really liked it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It wasn't bad per se, but I didn't enjoy it.  I wasn't disappointed in the story, but it wasn't all that special.  I really wish that she had just given her story an author's name!  It is not that this was a bad story but I never did get that the author's main focus was a love story between two people.  The story was a lot of romance for me as well, and in this book it wasn\'t a strong enough basis.   The ending was disappointing to say the least. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by a professor at the University of Oklahoma who has a Ph.D in Philosophy. The book was a collection of stories and essays about the lives and philosophies of various characters. The stories in the book are quite entertaining. There is an ending that is pretty neat, and the characters do develop as they advance in the story, but that final ending was very cheesy and poorly written. In addition to that, the characters that are introduced in this book were pretty much cardboard cutouts and not much more. The author uses the "stubborn" character "Bob" a.k.a. "Boba Fett" as a source of character motivation in the beginning of the story. He is a typical rebel type character who does not like being told what to do. He also makes quite an impression on the first few stories he is in. Then by the time he gets into the last story of the book, he is basically the most boring character imaginable. I have read the other four books in this series by this author and each of the characters is much more interesting than Bob. So, for anyone who liked Bob, avoid this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My brother is a fan of the book and I'm a fan too, but in this case the book is overrated and it's all been done in other books, there is one character that stands out. It's the little kid. He is the only character that gets a lot of attention and in the beginning he is a little shy and it takes some time to warm up to him. Then he starts talking about his imaginary friends and the little friends in his house, then he starts making his own imaginary friends, then it's a problem with the police because he makes them disappear. Finally he has to explain to his mother that he's really a wizard, and a girl that looks just like him and he can only talk to her, she says that she's only friends with his friends. He asks her to talk to him again and she says "no, it's not a date" but she will give him a letter to send to someone to try and fix his problems. Then suddenly he's flying, and they land and he has a magical box and a wand and they fight monsters and get saved by wizards and then he gets to go home. The ending was great and I really enjoyed the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy this book and I wasn't expecting much from it. However, when it came to the book being translated into English and I was told it would take me 2-3 months to read, I just couldn't give it a chance. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who wants to read it.   My main problem with this book was the writing. It felt like the author had no idea what he wanted to write about and was just throwing in random ideas.  , as I found out later, the author was writing a story that was basically a fantasy series about a dragon who had lived and lived with humans.   to make a long story short, the dragons had come to the conclusion that humans are not very good for them. Therefore they are going to change their life in order to not live with humans anymore and live in peace. However the humans have a new race that they made up, that had to be exterminated to make it to their home.   in order for the dragons to be able to change this new race to their liking, they have to capture and kill all the humans in their habitat and take them to the dragons home to live. As the dragons have lived on earth for so long now, the humans had a great number of soldiers to fight them in case they came across a dragon and decided to attack it. There were only about 100 humans left and they had nowhere to go, because they are all in one place now.  The dragons decided to go to another planet, to a planet called "Earth". It was said that the humans there had a very strong military and a lot of things that the dragons couldn't do because the humans were able to defend themselves with guns and such.   The dragons decided not to come back to Earth to fight but instead to live there as friends. However during a war that broke out between the humans and dragons, the dragon who was a friend of the dragons decides to go back to earth in order not to be hurt. He is only going back because he wants to protect his home, which is about to be taken away from him because the people are angry at the dragons for not returning.    Then another problem arises: The dragon who came back to the planet decides to take the humans with him on his ship because he can't bring himself to leave them behind. The dragon and his friend start to leave and all of the humans decide to keep the humans that are still alive
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ I really want to like this book. I really, really, want to. This book has such promise. I read it at a great price, because it had a free sample. I'm sure I can figure something out, but there is no way I can put this book down once I get through it. I love the character development, the action, the romance, the world building, and the world-building. The writing is solid, and all of the characters are interesting and relatable, in my opinion. However, there is one minor plot-hole that I believe should have been fixed from the beginning, and that's how they make it so that you have to choose between the good guys and the bad guys. In the beginning the bad guy is the one who has all of his power, but then he's revealed to be innocent, and you can't choose his side anymore. This makes absolutely no sense to me at all. If you have a moral compass, why should you have any problems with the "villain" in the end of the story? I know that if I had read this book over a year ago, then I would've realized this was a problem, but the fact that it was brought up at the very end of chapter 6, so late into the book, was incredibly annoying. I don't like to waste my time reading a book that is so poorly written that I can't believe I would spend any time on it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book and ended up thinking it was overrated when I was reading it. I didn't enjoy the story or the writing of the book, and thought it was written a bit poorly and it was too long. I liked the concept and the idea of this book, but the story was too heavy for me, I would not recommend this book to anyone. I also have problems with the characters, the plot is just so over the top that I couldn't relate to most of the characters and it just made the story too over thetop. I think that the way it was done could've been done better, but it would have been so much better if the author had just written more of the story, and if they had just stuck to the original idea of the first book. I would also like to add that the book was so confusing that I was a bit put off by it.  For a beginning reader it is also hard to understand the characters.  I really didn't like the characters in this book at all.   I really didn`t like the way that they interacted with each other, the way they behaved in the way the book showed, and the way some of the scenes were written in the book.  In the end, I was disappointed with this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I would give this book zero stars, but it is one of my all-time favorite books. I don't know why I would want to read a book about this person again, because I would like it more than I ever have before. I think the best description I have read about this book is that the story was "a long, winding journey," and "a journey of a thousand twists and turns," which sounds like something out of some fantasy novel. The main character is described as someone who has grown out of her teenage stage and is now "over 40." The story centers on her relationship with her son, the boy's best friend. It is described in the following manner: "It is only a few years since she had been with this boy and his father, who has moved out of town. They had been so happy and together that she had forgotten she had a child of her own. It was only when she saw the look on his face when she brought him home for the summer and found his new parents gone that she remembered her own little boy. Then he became the boy she had missed so much. He had taken care of her. He was her favorite, her only favorite." This sounds like the story of a child with a father who has left, and with the child becoming the new father and mother, the child must find a way to move on with a new life, even though the old one has gone. As the story progresses, the old life of the father is mentioned, and the father of the boy and the mother are mentioned as well. Then this: "When he returned to St. Joseph's, he found his old home empty. All the other boys who had followed him had left. He looked at the empty windows of the room where he had stayed. He felt numb." What can one say when hearing a description like that? How sad is this? The father was a boy from his school days in the neighborhood and was always considered the center of the neighborhood. He lived with his mother on a small farm until they both decided to move away, but he was always happy and well liked. His relationship with his son, whom he called son, was also very special and important to him. However, he does remember seeing his mother, who did not want to see her son anymore. Then the father disappears and when he came back, there were no answers. The mother also did not talk about her son. She did not know what
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________This is the first book I've read where I felt I was a bystander to the whole thing. I was more or less a bystande while reading. I didn't have any idea about the story, but it didn't seem too original to me. I'd been doing some research on the subject, but found no evidence whatsoever of a connection between the Masons and the Nazis. But, the main characters... the things they do. And the stuff that they say. This is like a book written by a man who had been a member of the M.O. for a while. He's a "Nazi-hunter" with a "black book" full of photos and videos of Nazis. And that is basically what I took away from it. This was a book that had me questioning if the author was really a true believer in this whole Nazi thing, because the author's claims are so ridiculous. I wouldn't have bought this book if I'd known anything about it beforehand, which made it a bad read. I would like to know more about the connections between the German Masons, the Nazi Party, and the Nazi-hunters. In fact, I would rather know everything than not know anything. The Nazi-hunter book I bought was a good book, so I'll buy another one just for that alone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________ The Last Days of Gotham was the first book that I read in the New 52 reboot. I liked it and it was interesting. However it was the one thing that kept me from giving up reading and reading again. This book was so confusing, I couldn't follow the story and my confusion only grew when I couldn  This book was absolutely awful. I was hoping that the premise was interesting enough, but the ending completely ruined the book for me. I wanted to love this book but I didn't. I am very frustrated with DC for trying to create a good story with so many inconsistencies and flaws.   Let's get the bad out of the way first:  1) The character of John Blake is so flat. He has no real motivations. He just wants to live by his own rules. He is only interested in being in a place where he can live his life and his rules, not in the good of anyone else, not even in his friends or family. He doesn't feel anything for his friends and he is always telling them what to do, he doesn't want to share his feelings or be a part of their lives. He does care about his girlfriend Renee, who was in a relationship with him but he never reciprocates her feelings, never gets to show what a good guy he is and just takes it for granted that they'll be together forever. Blake was so empty, so dead inside.  I know this is a part about Blake but it applies to a lot of characters. Every character in this book was dull. Even Joker, the only character that was entertaining was just so one note. Even though he was portrayed as a monster in the book he was never really given any character development. It was almost like Joker was trying to write a bad comic book. He was constantly trying to do something evil, to show how evil he is. He always seemed to be doing the wrong thing or doing what no one would ever do. He also didn't seem to understand his motivations and why he is so evil to begin with. He did his best to hide from the fact that he is a monster and he tried to hide his true self from everyone and didn't like it when others tried to figure him out, especially after what happened to him in the past.  :I will tell you now that Joker isn't really that great of a character and he wasn't really a bad guy, he was just kind of a jerk,
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I'm so glad I didn't get a copy of this book because it's filled with lies."  I think she's wrong, and if she has any shame left in her she'll admit it to herself.  But for now she won't, because she probably needs to be reminded that not every author is a fraud or a liar. "I love this book!"  Who doesn't?  The story is well-done and the characters are fleshed out nicely.  "Hilarious!... I love you!...  You're my best friend!"  I think that's a lie too, and it's a stupid lie.      This book is so full of lies, but it is good for a laugh.  I would never give the title of this novel to my children, but they'd be very confused, and I'm pretty sure they'll be even more confused by the last third of this "book."  *   *  *  **   *** "How to be a Better Writer" is a book that I feel like I should have read sooner.  It's full of platitudes and it doesn't seem to want to work to teach us anything, it just wants to sell us more books.  If you read this book and get some value out of it I apologize.  This book may sell a few copies, but I will not be buying it or recommending it to my readers.  You won't get me on my soap box anytime soon.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really didn't like this book. I found it confusing. I think the writer really wanted to be in the history world, but the book is really about the present day. He makes no mention of anything having to do with the past. There are just a lot of statements and ideas that are not well researched. It's like some of the facts are there, but they're just thrown around in a way that doesn't really make sense to me.    I really enjoyed this book, it was well-written, the author's historical background was really interesting, it helped to get into the culture and history of the countries, and the author was good at telling a story. I was not a fan of the first book he was writing, so I didn't have much expectation going into this, but I wasn't disappointed at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is not very good, and I would not recommend it for a young child.

It's like they were trying to make this story into a video game.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________  This book was so much crap that it was almost worth a first draft, because I read it for the first time. It was a great concept and a great story, but the story was so bad that I had to look up the author in the back of a book. I don't think that a novel should be written this badly. I'm guessing that it will sell in the same way that a lousy movie does, because nobody wants to buy that book.   I didn't know that I was looking forward to reading such a lame novel until I started reading it. It reads like a bad attempt to write a short story. It's like a guy who has just finished writing a great short story and he puts it down to try and write a better story, so he starts writing a novel instead. I think that this guy should write one of the greatest stories ever written.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ I bought this book from a website that claims it is about a boy, but it is really not about a male boy but about a girl. The book is about three people - a boy named Dain, a girl named Ira and a boy and girl friend named Iria. The people of the town have a very strange tradition, and is called the Great Curse. The boys are the "cursed" ones who try to get rid of people, and they do so by killing them. The girl who wants to get away from them is named Iriia. One day the boys come to the town and they tell Iriya about their curse. She kills them all. She does this so that she can be free and go back to her friend, Dain. Dain wants to save her and goes along with her and he tries to get a picture of Iriias face. But Iriiias face is not shown and the picture he takes is a little bit blurred, so there is no face. Now Dain and Iriiae are all the same, and there are no other kids from the town with them. When the boys finally find the face of Iria, she is dead, and Dain's sister tells him he killed her, and he kills her. Iriis life is not very happy as she has no one she can talk to and she is in prison. She tries to be with Ira, but Dain is not willing to let her. He does the things that everyone else does. She has the things of her sister in her, but in a more cruel way than anyone else. It is hard for me to find good things to say about this book. I read it in the beginning and I loved it, but as I was reading, it was hard to see the point of everything. There is no main character, and I can understand how this could happen. If the author wanted to write about the curse of the boys, that would be fine, but he wanted to tell a story about a woman, and that just did not work for me. This is one of the best horror stories I have ever read, and it is sad that I have to say this because it is just not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- This book just ruined my enjoyment of everything else I've read. If you are looking for a fun read, try a different book. I'll still keep my copy on hand just in case it's read. The author doesn't know what she is talking about and doesn't seem to have the slightest clue what the main plot of the story is about. She's trying to have an easy, easy story with no real twists and turns. Not so. The story, to me, felt so like a romance novel, the characters seemed so like they were from a book of romance novels. I was wondering why the authors tried to make the romance novel feel like a horror story. I'm sorry the author, but the horror story was not something that I needed to read. I wish you would have just taken the romance out of the book and called it a day. There are plenty of romance books out there that aren't terrible, just don't waste your time on this one. Just skip it and keep your money elsewhere. It's just a terrible book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~ "It was too bad I never read this book. I would have loved to learn more about the history of the Japanese people who lived during the 1930s and 1940s."   (By David D. Ladd, Chicago Sun-Times, March 11, 2013)   1. What is an "antique book" or a "stolen book"?  It is a book that is published and sold illegally, such as "The Man Who Knew Too Much" by Harry Houdini (1934). This is a classic book which is still read and taught in the U.S. by the American Mystery Writers Association, Inc.   2. What happened to Harry H, Houdin's publisher?  Houdin had no publisher and there is no record of Houdeen and Houdinger being at one time or another in a publisher's office.   the book came out in 1936 in the States and in England in 1937. Houdeine and Haldinger, two publishers from the UK, owned the rights to Houdino's book.   in 1939 they came to America to see how Harry was doing in America. The story of Harry H and his brother in law is very interesting and a fun read for children. They visited with Harry and his son and the two had a long discussion about the book. Harry's publisher is reported to have said that he never paid any attention to Haldone and Hurdine at all and thought they were a joke. They were not.  , a book about two thieves by Harry, that is still in print and widely used today. The first "Stolen" appeared in 1929 in the USA and was made into a movie in 1935. A movie version of "The Stolen" was made in the UK in 1938. The book is a bit dated. It is about Harry H. Halding and his partner, Frank Hurdinger. They stole paintings and other antiques and then put them back up again and sold them to museums. In the book, Harry H is a very bad thief and is almost always caught, but escapes from jail every time. Hurdingers name is also not used by Harry.Harry Houdining and his younger brother, Frank, steal antiques that have come into the possession of museums, which makes Harry a very good thief. The thieves get caught on a number of occasions but escape. They get out of prison several times because
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is good, but I didn't enjoy the book and I would probably get a different book from the same author. It's a hard read but if you can get past the parts that are boring to you, it's not a bad read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have found the book extremely hard to read. The plot was too fast paced to my liking and I think that the writing style was not good at all. I do not have many favorite books by this author but I will admit that I did enjoy the book. My first time reading this book. The writing style seems to be different for each book so I was unsure as to what to expect and the story line was a little off. The characters were not interesting to me and I just do not care about the plot line. I wish I could give this book a 1 star rating but I would not.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I had heard so much good about this book about how insightful and original it was. What I ended up reading were the same things I already heard. I'm not a fan of conspiracy theories, so I wasn't expecting this one to be a revelation. However, what I heard was completely wrong, and it was extremely disappointing. This book has nothing to do with conspiracy theories in the least bit, and the author uses it to get in your head with her convoluted theories about her life and life in general.   In her world she's a famous author. She's had a lot of success writing books on a lot  "But I was raised as a woman. I was made to feel like I was too dumb to understand, that the only reason I was as smart as I was wasn't because I put effort into studying and I was a hard worker. It's because I'm a woman, and therefore, I'm supposed to be dumb."   She claims that she has done everything in her power to be smart and successful and this is why she is so successful, even though it's impossible for her to be. She is a woman and therefore she is not supposed to understand things, and as an author she must be smart because that's how the book ends. She does her research. She takes notes. She doesn't know what to do, so she just goes with the flow. "You think because of a man I'm going to be smarter than I am? Of course, I wouldn't be smart if I was men because they wouldn't think as deeply."  This is a feminist who has written an incredibly boring book that has nothing more than words that she picked up along the way to prove her point. If I had wanted to read a book about "How I grew up being a man" I would have just picked up a romance novel, or some other form of popular literature. This would have been the most boring thing I have ever read. She makes no claims for herself that she's an intelligent person, just a woman who wrote a book that says a million things that have absolutely nothing to anything to do about her.  If you want to know how stupid her book is, you can read my review of the sequel, which is a much more interesting book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  My husband and I read this book at night on the train. I felt I was watching a movie, not reading a book. I was trying to read something other than a book that is really a horror movie. When I started I couldn't believe how scary it was. The story was just too real and I just didn't want to stop. This book isn't for the faint of heart but if you do like horror and like writing then this book is a must read.  6 of 7 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this one very much. It was ok, not a bad read, but the pacing and plot were off. I wasn't bored the whole time I was reading it. And I'm just a little bit weary of the type of material that goes into this genre. I'll give it two stars because it was well written, the characters were interesting, the plot flowed. It just felt a little rushed, the ending, if there was one, just felt off.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- If you can't even begin to understand why it's called "The Art of Manliness", that's understandable.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book, but in the end I could only finish the first chapter and could not finish the book.  The main character is completely unlikable and the story really is not believable. I have a hard time believing that people like her and her family even exist, but I didn't care.  I had a bad time getting through the book but after getting to the final page I realized how much I liked the plot.   It's one of those books that just doesn't make any sense, that's why you have to read it in one sitting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is crap. It should have stayed at the library. I read it at the bookstore and had to read it again after I was done because my friend asked me what is in it so I read that instead. I feel like I'm reading an outdated textbook, which is bad since I was studying for a class at the time so I have to read a textbook with notes. It's like some book that was made for adults and used for a grade school class. I was disappointed because I loved the story and thought it was good but it's just a terrible book.  6 of 7 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  Not a lot of good to say, but some people can make a great book great by using the wrong words. The characters are mostly likable, and are more than willing to help one another when times are tough. However, there are a few plot points that are incredibly cheesy and ridiculous (especially since this is a children's book) that just ruins the book's entire purpose. My final opinion?  I liked this book because it had a good plot, interesting characters, and interesting scenes. I also liked the book because of the positive reviews, because I actually agree with the negative ones! If you don't like kids' books, this may be a decent introduction, but if you do like kids books, don't read this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're looking for a "good read" on the internet you will love this book. If you aren't looking for "good reads" you will probably hate it, but if you are a good, critical reader (not a bad, critical one), then I recommend it.   I can't say this book is "bad" or "good", it is a book about a man who is in a life and death struggle to stop a bad guy from destroying the life of someone he loves.  The story is simple: the main character was a successful businessman and his wife was the mother of his three children and his business was losing ground. One day, while driving with his wife and kids he got a call from a doctor saying he had to go to an emergency room. As he was driving he noticed that a fire was burning his house. He put on his fire truck, and started to fight the fire. After fighting the fire for a while, he came back home and found that his business had burned down in flames. Then he started to think he couldn't fight the fires of life any longer, and that he needed to find a good therapist, to help him get through his depression. He went to the clinic that was in the center of town, where he met an older lady. She said that she had a bad habit of taking her kids to a private school that she was associated with. One night, while her family was in bed, she decided to have a sex party at her house. When her kids awoke they said they felt strange. After some investigation she found out that the children were afraid of her. So she decided she would make her children afraid of everyone she ever knew and then have sex with them.    The rest of the book is very much the same, although the story is very well told (it doesn't get boring) and it does have a great ending (no spoilers).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was the worst book   I have ever read.   Not a single word of humor   It's not a story about a woman who wants to marry her ex-husband (who is currently in jail) who has to decide to change his mind because she's getting bored   She's in prison.  She doesn't like her life.  I've never seen anything like this in any book, and I've read thousands of books. I don't think it was supposed to be funny, it was just there to be a stupid story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a waste of time and money. The cover shows a dog eating a duck.  Dogs eat anything.  The title is misleading because the book is about the history of dog fighting.  There is nothing about the historical truth of the dog fighting or about the practice of dogs being used in dog fighting as guards.  I think the book should have been called "Dogs were trained in China for guarding humans" because that would have shown the truth. The history of dogs is fascinating and I would love to read more of it, but this book just doesn't have it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ The worst book I have read to date. The author could have easily gone down as one of the most entertaining authors, instead, he devolved into something I would call "the lowest of the low"... This book is all about the author trying to get people to love him. Yes, he has the "perfect" story, and the characters are just sooooooo well done. But then the writer completely loses all sense of the reader. His writing was so poorly written, he couldn't even make it about anything he wasn't trying to do. And the fact that I have to say that this book could have been better with a better writer, makes the fact I wasted my money on it, so much worse.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________  The story line is very interesting to read, but the "action" it is supposed to contain is poorly explained. I didn't understand what was going on in the book at all, it just seemed to be the story about "how bad it is to be poor". I think the author wanted a different sort of story than the ones he normally writes, but in doing so, he ended up writing a bad novel. I don't know what happened to the author, but I wish he had done a better job with the writing, and perhaps write a story of some sort.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** The author has a problem.  He is trying to tell a story of a man who was a slave in a prison but escaped and is trying too hard to sell the book.  The problem is that the book is mostly about the man in the prison.  The story of the man is mostly told.  When the author does explain some aspects of the life of the men he is trying so hard to convince you that the life is mostly a nightmare.  For example, there is a section where the author tells us about a man whose name is not mentioned but who is probably a character in the book and it gives us a glimpse of the hardships that he has experienced.  While the author explains the hardship of the prison the reader is left with the vague feeling that the man went through the same thing.  Even the fact that the reader doesn't know how the man ended up in prison makes it seem like the man suffered the same hardships that the narrator does.   This is not a problem I had with any of the other books in the "Saved by the Bell" series.  I thought the first book in the series was good.  It had many good characters and there were a few aspects of that book that I liked.   However, the third book in this series is another story.  This book doesn't even pretend to tell the story of who the real villains are.  There are no villains in this book except the narrator.  And he's not even likable.  He seems like a loser and that's about the only thing that the story has going for it.  Now if you like the books in this line the chances of you liking this one are slim to none.  You have to be very brave to sit down and read it. This isn't a book that will change the lives of the people reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are trying to start your journey with a book on the paranormal, then you should be disappointed, this is a book about a man who is not a believer but gets caught up in the process, he also has a girl in his life but their relationship is never really deep. There is a lot of plot and mystery and it ends up being a bit confusing but it is not for everyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________   I have only read the first 2 chapters, and the book is still full of errors. The writer makes some grammatical and spelling mistakes, which makes me think she may not have written the book properly. And there is too much "jumping around".   It is really hard for me to judge the book, because I don't know what type of writing skills the writer has. She keeps on describing her life and I don'  I really liked this book, it is easy to read, easy to follow, and so much better than other books that I have read. There is a very nice story line, a little dark, but definitely a fun and refreshing read. I am a little bit annoyed at the writer of the book for some of the grammar and spelling errors that she has made in the book. The book should be rewritten and corrected by the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not do anything for me. It is too technical for my taste.

I gave it a 4/5 for being different and interesting but I cannot recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book, like the other one, was written for a small market, for a non-mature audience, and was therefore, of little value to me. I bought it because I thought I'd learn about the history of women and the history books I'd read had a few nice things to say about their struggle, and to make them a little more accessible. I had heard that the author had written an alternative history of the rise of women, with more realistic characters, but had never read anything more than a little bit of the feminist literature I used to have at home, and I wanted to at least read some other historical fiction that dealt with women's oppression as something real. I ended up reading four or five books by women authors before I got bored of the main story, and this seemed like a good choice of a book to read, since it was written in a non fiction format (for adults), but had no historical or sociological information attached.   The writing itself, as other reviewers have mentioned, is very bad. It's the type of writing that comes out of a woman's head, with a little help from a man, and there's no good sense of any emotion in it. The main character, Mary, has no character development at all, which is a big issue for me in historical fiction. She is simply a blank slate who goes from being a prostitute and a prostitute's daughter to a prostitute, prostitute's widow, prostitute, and finally to a servant. I am not surprised the author hasn't bothered to research the life of women in England. There's a lot of history and facts out there, and she could have included them if she wanted. She doesn't, though, and that's a big problem. The other problem is that Mary doesn't understand anything that's going on. She isn't trying to change anything, and even when the husband in question does try to change her mind, he can't be bothered, because he sees his role in life as to protect his wife, and Mary, being his wife and wife's daughter, can't possibly be right. The only characters that have any depth are the men of the family, and they are often quite cruel to Mary. Also, her attitude towards Mary is quite patronising. It reminds me of a scene in the TV series "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", when Willow Rosenberg, the female Slayer, is sent on a mission to kill a young boy who was raped and

Write a negative review about a bad book:    My opinion on the book: It takes you by surprise and forces you to question everything you thought you knew about the story you're reading. There are lots of clues to the story being about to unfold, but it never seems to come into focus. It's like the story isn't there for you, or the author isn't really writing for the reader. This is a very dark book, but the main characters seem to be in some pretty poor situations. They're not just in this for the sake of the story. The last two chapters are absolutely stunning and quite a bit of the plot was in the last two.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book after having read all the reviews, and I must say that these are absolutely wrong in every way. The book is not as bad as the review suggests, but it isn't that great either. The plot is very predictable, the characters are not very likeable, and the book doesn't even make sense at all. It is very repetitive, and there are very few interesting things in the book. A very boring book. I didn't like this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************** **** I enjoyed this book. This is the type of story I like to read. The characters are well developed and the author writes in a way that it will grab your attention. However, I am sorry to say the book lacked character development. There was no conflict in this book and the reader is left with a few questions. The protagonist was introduced too late and didn't become an interesting person by the end of the book. I think this book was a bit too long and I feel it would have been better if the book was split into two parts. (One part to develop the character and the other part to show the conflict between them)   A bit about the author: ************* ********* I feel this author is capable of writing a story. His first book is not great but then, I found the rest of his books to be very good. I would recommend him for his writing style. The author has good knowledge about science, history, and the history of religions and cultures. He is also good at bringing to life the story, but I do feel there were some areas where he could have expanded the story.  14 of 15 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book will not make a believer out of any skeptic. Not even the skeptic who is not a believer. Why? Because they will learn nothing from this book except a lot of rhetoric and bad evidence based on the flawed methodology of their own belief system. I can see how the author came to these beliefs, but his conclusions do not match the evidence.  I found myself agreeing with most of the content, but not being able to accept the methods of his reasoning as valid.

The title is a little misleading because there is little in the book that does not conform to the views of evolutionist. This book gives the reader a strong bias for evolution and an anti-science bias. In the beginning of this story, the author's primary interest is not science, but religion, which in his eyes, is superior and superior to science. He is a creationist who believes that God made everything, except for plants and humans. There are many instances where he contradicts himself in this book. He says that the Bible does not talk about evolution, yet he mentions many examples where evolution is mentioned in the Bible. He also states that Darwin believed in a creator, yet in this chapter he describes evolution in such a way as to discredit Darwin, despite Darwin being a creation-theist himself. This makes it clear that evolution is not taken seriously by this author. After he describes the creation stories in the biblical book, he states that he is a Christian, yet describes how he is not. Finally, he presents his own creation story, but does so in a way that is contrary to scientific and historical evidence. The book ends with the same anti-scientific views expressed in the beginning. After this book, the reader is supposed to be convinced of evolution, but if the reader does not understand the science behind the creation, and the way it fits into the history of God, he is doomed to the same conclusions that he got in this story. This is a very poorly written book. It makes much of the science of Darwin and evolution, and yet it gives very little credit to the other science in which Darwin worked. It also makes the claim that evolution doesn't fit with
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no redeeming value, at least to me, and I feel the author's only goal in writing this book is to try to sell his self-help book.  I won't even mention his "expert" opinions and his claims about himself.  There's nothing interesting here.  I have nothing to add except that I agree with you.    It's just too bad that the author has to resort to using a bunch of marketing fluff just to cover up his ignorance.  If this book did really have something to teach us, it would have been done in an academic way, without all of the nonsense, and with a more accurate description of how to apply the techniques in the book. This is not the way you do a good self help book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has many negative aspects I am not going to mention them but the whole book is about a poor man trying to get over his issues and be successful but he just can't seem to be able to do it, his main problem is that he has an inborn ability that he just cannot control and it is in his family but all the people around him think he is a failure and he never is able to be happy, he always has a bad day and can't live up to his potential because the people that think he can't do something just think he will fail or get himself killed.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read several books in my adult life that I loved. A few times I've read a book and couldn't get past the first 30 pages. This book had the most issues. It was tedious, boring, and completely unfocused. It had two main characters, who were never connected at any point of the story. They just existed as a plot device. Then there was a bad guy (or girl). He was annoying and was never a part of the action. As far as the plot goes, I just don't get it. I'm not sure what's going on. The characters are completely disconnected, they're fighting and doing things and then we go to some other place where there's some conflict. I don't know what that conflict was either. I felt like nothing was getting accomplished. The worst thing is that you're supposed to like the bad guy and you're like 'Whoa whoa whoah...' You're supposed be rooting for her, but she didn't even do anything.  The ending is disappointing. I wasn't ready for it at all. It's just a rushed, dumb ending. I'll never read another novel by this author again. The one positive I can say is that it was short and there is still one more book in it. Don't read if you can't deal with dull books with bad endings.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________   "I am a sucker for stories that are told in first person and in third person. This book is one of those stories, it is a love story but it isn't about the two people who have a relationship. It isn't a love letter to a certain group of people. It is about the love that someone has for another. It deals with that in an emotional way."  ~ Anonymous   This book would have received 5 stars had it not been for the fact that it is written in first-person. If you love romance and like to see two characters interact, this is not for you. If that is not your thing, then by all means, I suggest picking up another romance book, perhaps one by a better author (see below). I can't say I was surprised.   As this was a book written by the author herself, I can tell you that she knows her subject matter is a little strange. She doesn't try to be subtle, she just makes it obvious that she is trying to write a romance. I can see how this might be hard for some people to relate to. But it was still a great book and the characters were very well written.   was a very good book! I really enjoyed it, and as the characters' names are so well chosen, it helps set the tone. I didn't see it as a traditional romance, but more as a love letters written in the third person from a couple who have been together for a while.   at one point I wondered why they wrote in the first person if they couldn't be in it, but then I realized it is to tell a story.  :) I am not a fan of first-persons (though I am a fan the second person) but I did like the way it felt like she was a real person, telling her story from their perspective.The first third of the book is pretty traditional romance type stuff: they meet, they fall in love, they try to get back together, but things don't always work out. There is also a bit of "romance, but with two very different characters" in there too. The second half is pretty typical of a love-triangle: they fall out of love with each other, they start looking for each other again, but they can't quite figure out how. As the story goes on they realize it's really not a love triangle, it's a love love love

Write a negative review about a bad book: ***************** The only reason I didn't give this book 4 stars is because I got distracted and started reading something else. Then when I realized what I was doing, I stopped, read the last few pages and moved on. Then it occurred to me that I had completely missed the last two-thirds of the book (which I had read all before, and loved). ********************* So, back to the reviews. If you are looking for a good "light reading" read, with no complex plots, a great cast of characters and interesting plot twists, with a great plot and characters to boot, then THIS is the book for you. The main character is a "dorky" person with a tendency to get a little carried away in his own little world, and this will lead to a few good adventures, lots of funny dialogues, a nice plot and enough twists to keep you on your toes. I really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to reading more of it. However, if you don't like people who are a little bit different from you, don't read this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I am one of those who was a child when Stephen King was writing, and I really loved this book. I did not think the book was very good, but it got better as it went on. However, it did take me several days of reading to be satisfied. At the beginning, I felt a bit annoyed because of how dark the book became; however, as it progressed, I actually liked the characters and felt sympathy for them. Unfortunately, the ending was not satisfying, so it ended up as a good book with a very good story, but not a good movie. I wish I would have read it at that age, because I think it would have changed my life in many ways.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  Not much to say. The prose is clunky, the prose structure is weird, the plot doesn't move in any interesting directions, and the characters are all dull and undeveloped. The characters seem like they would have an easier time staying around in the second book, but no, they don't. The ending seemed rushed to me, with most of the character arcs running out in a single scene, and then abruptly brought back in an unexpected way. Not a lot of surprises were put in to give the characters more to do. All in all, a very mediocre book, which I would not recommend to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I was going to buy this book just because I like horror novels, but I couldn't do it because of a few things. 1. It was hard to find a local bookstore. 2. The cover looks too real and not too gothic. 3. The writing was awful, like a 2nd grade version of some of my high school teachers. 4. The ending sucked. 5. It didn't seem like it took place in the past, but was more like an alternate reality. 6. I'm not interested in reading the book again.  In his third novel, the author has gone out of his way to create a compelling world of magic and wonder. The story is fast-paced, gripping, and is full of twists and turns.  was a good book that I enjoy reading a lot. The author was interesting and I liked the characters. I think that some of the characters had a better depth than the others. I thought that some the characters were really boring and some of them were too good. But I found that the plot was really good and the story did keep me interested. This book wasn't really scary but I felt that it was something that I wouldn't like to read that much. But that's fine, I'm still reading the second book to see how the story evolves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad story. The first 4/5 are ok but the 5th is a major let down. I can't imagine what it would have been like if she got her chance to do this again. I was disappointed and it makes me feel like this book had an uphill battle to start.   What does this book teach us? Well it is about a teen who has to face her problems head on. Her mom doesn't approve of this so she is sent to stay with her Grandma but this can't last long. She meets the boy who was meant for her but now she has to move on and start anew.   on the other hand, her Grandmother has other ideas. She has a new lover who wants to have sex with her as soon as they meet but the Grandma refuses to be his bride.   It's a long novel but that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.   and my favorite part is her Aunt.   of course, this is the book I've read the most times.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I was a bit disappointed with this book as I had read the first two in the series. The first two books were the better of the series but this one felt a bit rushed and not very interesting. The characters and plot are decent, but the ending left me a bit annoyed. In a series where the first book was a little bit of a slog it felt like they rushed it. ---------------
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! Why didn't I get this book sooner! This is just a horrible book to read. As a former college professor, I was disappointed with the way that this book was written. This book has all of the usual trappings of any other poor written memoir of a mediocre author.  The writing style is sloppy and inconsistent. The story is told with what seems to be a narrative-based approach.  As a result, the author fails to create a realistic world for her characters, and lacks the ability to develop believable people.  Even worse, the characters are not even believable - they are caricatures.   Some of them are stereotypical white women with a certain sort of 'flavor of the week' attitude.  I have no idea where this is coming from.   As far as the writing style goes, the stories are just so poorly done that it becomes hard to believe the author has been working on it for all these years.  For example, this book starts out with a brief scene that reads like a description of a horror movie.  It sounds really cheesy and cheap, and is not at all realistic.  In addition, this scene is presented at the same time as a completely ridiculous scene of a middle-aged woman who has never left the house for 20 years, only to be found in a hotel room with three men.  Not only is this scene not credible, but it is completely bizarre and unnecessary, making it difficult to believe that the author is actually writing this story in the first place.  Other poorly written stories include the story of a married man who loses his wife to a horrible accident that happens on his farm.  Here, the story makes sense only to the extent that we have some sort of understanding of what life is like for people who lose their spouses or have children that they have to take care of, so that they can take care, of themselves.  There is no realism in the story - the story is just an attempt to create the illusion of realism.  When we get to the ending, the book seems to conclude with one more ridiculous scene - this one is told in the same way as the first story - a story about a middle aged woman, who is found in her room in a hospital bed, with the same three men who had her in the beginning of the book.  If this story wasn't so bad, it might be funny, but unfortunately, it is all but unbearable.  And then there is the "
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I am so disappointed in this book! It's a very poorly written book. It had some interesting ideas but the author is completely out of her league. I have never had a problem reading books from her, so I did not expect a book this bad to be one I would read. What I get out of this book is the author stating her opinion on various things, without actually learning anything, and then talking about what she has read on the web. She even quotes a few bad books! This book should be a waste of time because it is not written well and she has no skills to be able to write a good book. Also, she gives bad recommendations of what to read and makes some questionable statements. For example, in the book she recommends reading a book about why people become serial killers. That doesn't make any sense. The only reason for reading a serial killer book is to be upset at them, or to read about the murder in question. I just couldn't find any merit to the book other than to make you feel bad about what they have done. I don't understand why she made such a bad statement about a book that is only 1 sentence long and is not very interesting.  Helpful I'm really confused by the premise that this author, who is clearly ignorant about her subject, is actually a trained expert on this subject. I am actually amazed that she has the audacity to present herself as if she were knowledgeable on the subject of rape.  The fact that the authors have no real knowledge of their subject makes this even more appalling. The author has clearly not taken even the most basic of steps to understand the subject she has written a book on. There is no real point to this book and it's really nothing but a way to sell books and attract a larger audience.  and i got the book for free.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting a bit of a lighter story from this author and she has written a light one, but it is not pleasant to read. The narration is not very good and her writing is not original, but she wrote well enough to keep me reading. The pacing is bad, the story has no momentum, it just drags on and on and there is no resolution. My main problem was how much time she was taking with her characters. I wanted to like this character, but in all my reading I have never been able to get over how her character developed and why her friends turned out the way they did. She also tries to develop a story that is all about her, which I didn't care for. The main problem I had with the book was the ending. If you read the story on it's own, it's nothing bad, but as a story it was a bit disappointing. A review by the author, on why she's a great writer:  As far as I'm concerned, I write very well. My writing style has the quality of prose that has not been altered by the passage of time. I am a very good example of this, and I have been known to use a combination of my personal experiences and the experiences of others to explain why I do things. I know how I write, I know my own weaknesses, I have an idea how I want a book to read, and so forth. I think I will write more novels. P.S. My friend is an ex-Navy pilot and a very capable guy. I told him, when we wrote this story, that my character's father would be the pilot. This was the first time that I had ever told someone of this before and I was surprised to find out that people were taken by this.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- <b>The book is absolutely fantastic</b> <br> It is one of the best science fiction stories ever written, and it is absolutely gripping. It is such a beautifully written book that I could not put it down even once. It's not only one of my favorite science fiction books of all time, but one of those books that always grabs my attention, even when it has a boring plot, or when it's just plain boring. <br><br> I have never enjoyed a more beautifully written science fiction book. It manages to give life to what is essentially a space opera, yet still keeps you guessing. It has a wonderful plot that takes the reader on a journey that is so rich in characters and story that you feel like you're there with them. I really cannot put this book down, even in the middle of the story where I am bored to death. The book is written by a well known author (George R. R. Martin) and is filled with fantastic characters that you are absolutely sure to love. -------------- Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]  Pick up and Read! I've always wanted to read this series. The only thing I was wondering was the length. This is a great read! <br/> I just finished the book and loved it. The pacing was perfect, and the story was just brilliant. It was a bit slow for me at first, but then I started getting into it and realized that this is a series that I must read. <b><br/> <br>"One Man's Planet" is a novel that I have read several times and still get hooked. It explores the possibilities of life in a future universe in which Earth has collapsed. A small band of colonists has settled on a nearby planet, called "One Man\'s Planet", and has found a new way to feed and protect itself. It\'s not like most of us would know how to live off of this planet, but it isn\'t all that difficult. The food is abundant, the weather is perfect, the people are happy, and they are safe from the dangers of Earth.   I loved this book, but there are two things I would like to see changed. First is the name of the planet (or planet of One Man\'S Planet) that it is on. I wish it was named "Earth". Second is that the first part of the novel was rather long and confusing. I think
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********" The best thing is that all the details are there, so if you are in the middle of a book and need a little help from the back end, this will help you out. I just think that the authors are too lazy to write a full summary in a book for you. If there was a little more info on the back of the book, I wouldn't have to buy the second and third edition. The author's are too quick to throw in all the info they think you might want to know, but don't bother to make it easy on the reader. So if you want to get a better idea of the story, this is your only option. You might as well skip the book."
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I really liked this book. It was interesting. There was plenty of character development and I could relate to several. However, the writing is quite bad, and some of the descriptions were almost too real. I found it hard to believe that this was written by an actual person. I'm not sure why the author was willing to take on such a controversial subject. The most shocking thing about this book is that it's not even remotely disturbing. It's just a creepy, awful, sick little tale about a crazy little girl and a sick old man who go around in a house in an abandoned church. I don't know if you will like this book or not, but I definitely don't want to miss out on another creepy, sick story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book. There is too much information that is just wrong. The characters are really bad. The pacing is poor and there are many holes in the plot. I could have made better choices if I had read this at the beginning and thought about it more.   If you are planning on reading this book, please do not waste your time. The book is badly written. The main characters and their reactions to the characters in this book are so badly written it is painful. The character who writes this book is a horrible writer and it is hard for me to believe he could write anything as good as this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "So much bad writing and terrible ideas crammed into a small space and then it's just so uninteresting it's ridiculous."   I don't know why I ever bothered with this book. I finished it, and I hate it. I will be the first to admit that I have my own biases. Some people I adore and some I despise. Some books I loved and some books I hated. This book, however, made me hate it beyond all reason. This is a book that tries to do too many things, but succeeds in only one. It tries to be funny. It does not succeed, because it's not funny.   The biggest problem with this novel is its characterization. I really didn't care for this novel and I don't think it would have been any fun at all. The characters are so generic, that I couldn't connect with any of them at all, and that's not because they are bad characters. If anything, the characters are incredibly dull. It's just that the writing is so awful that I just can't connect at all with them. They all just seem so bland and uninteresting, which really is a shame, because the author has such a great voice. The reason this novel failed in my opinion is because of the tone. This novel is full of sarcastic wit, and it's the main thing that made the book a joy to read. But, because of its sarcastic tone, this novel was so dull and uninspiring.   the writing has no personality, so it's impossible for me to get attached to it. That is the biggest problem.   I don not care if this book made me want to punch something in the face. I just don't like it. The ending, despite the ending the novel was based on, didn't make any sense, so I can't understand how it got that way.   I didn't even care if I hated this book, because I am done with this type of fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of this author. Her writing is crisp and the characters are relatable and endearing. The story is a simple revenge tale but I was left wanting more and more. I read this in the "real" world, not fantasy. I don't understand how this book got any better than "bad" for being published.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     " It's hard to give any book high marks, but this one is just plain bad." " This book had me on the edge of my seat as I read every paragraph. The story was so good that I found myself completely engrossed and entertained. The prose was beautiful and very smooth. It was a good read and I would definitely read the second one." Mystery and suspense are two genres I'm sure most people would like, but when I heard that there would be a sequel I thought there was no way it would be as good. Well it was and I'm so glad that I waited. I'm not sure I could get over my initial disappointment if I tried. The second book has a lot of things to get past but it still had me wanting to read the first book. This book has so much going for it, from the plot, to the writing to the characters, it is a must-read book for the Mystery and Suspense crowd. My favorite aspect of this book is the character of The Professor. The way that he writes the Professor to be such a nice, humble person is just perfect. He was the one who gave the books to me and I absolutely loved his way of writing the Professor. There was also so much more to this character than meets the eye. He is also a great guy and really likes his granddaughter. I can't wait to read next week's book! 5/5 Stars Check out some of my other Reviews
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a big fan of the "I want to be the girl in the book that everybody likes, the best friend who is so smart and so nice that the boys look up to her" type of girl.  There have been many that have done just that, but I have to say I was looking for a lot more to be found in the story.  It was not until I got to the part where the main character finally found out that she is actually the son of the man that murdered her mom that I really started to feel that this girl could have been someone who could have taken her mother's place in that world.  She didn't have the character development that I was hoping for, she was not a good person, and she wasn't that good a character.  I was able to see the real, deep struggles and emotions of this character, but there was so much more I wanted to know about her, about her family, about what she did with her life, her parents.  This book was interesting, but nothing to write home about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  As soon as I started this book, I knew it was going to be a flop.  First of all, it is filled with grammar mistakes, spelling mistakes, and a few typos.   Secondly, the characters are so unrealistic, it has no life at all.  They just act like children in a play, and the only characters who make any sense are the main characters who are constantly on the go.  The writing is so bad and the characters have no depth at all, I never get to care about them or care about their lives, I can't imagine anyone would be into this book.   My Rating:    5/10 My other books:   The Adventures of a Teenage Boy and His Dog by Joe Abercrombie The Princess Bride by William Goldman
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A very poor read. There is no real plot line, no point, no suspense, no action, nothing, just two characters with absolutely nothing to do that you need to care about.  There's one scene where the character thinks of a way to get out of something.  I'll give the book 4 stars for its fun to read, but 4 stars isn't the same as 4 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed this book. I was not really expecting much but my kids loved it. A good story and nice to see a different point of view on a very difficult subject. But the ending was disappointing for some reason. It did get a four-star rating in a book club but I am still not 100% sure it was for the right reason. My daughter was upset by the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has the worst possible opening that you can imagine. You open with an excerpt from the book, and then are immediately introduced to what the book is about. Then you get to the point, and are told the premise of the book. The premise is terrible, and doesn't really get better until halfway through the book (in which time I've stopped looking for excuses to finish it). This is in addition to the poorly explained plot, and the bad acting. A book that was clearly written in the first 15 minutes.   I had a great time reading this book though, because it's just a great book about someone who just wants to live life, and not about how to be the best at anything.  , May 5, 2011 - May 5' 2011Reviewer: A reader
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book because I needed to write one. It wasn't until I started reading the book that I found out that there was no real story. Just one girl's perspective. I wasn't very impressed with the way it was done. It was as if she wrote it with a notebook and an empty stomach. I wanted to hate her so bad, but ended up reading it anyway. She didn't need to write this book. It's not worth the time of the readers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book in order to help me in the field of biology. I am a microbiologist. I thought this book would help me understand the process that plants use to produce food. As a microbiology scientist, I thought the book would be of great help. It's so far from help. I had been doing my research before, but this book only confirmed my opinion. When I first saw the pictures of the different organisms and the different photos of the plant, I was taken aback. The book really has a lot of problems with it. If I had to guess, I would say that there was a lot that was not explained and the photos only provide the basic ideas to look at the different kinds of organisms. Also, the information that they do give is not clear enough. I would like to see the photos in their full detail, like there was with the plants and microbes in the previous books that I've read, so I could get a clearer picture of what they were looking at. I also feel that the illustrations were not well thought out. I feel that they could have been more clearly and concisely depicted. Also the photos are not very good. I hope that they will be improved. I wish they would have included more pictures in their text. Overall, it is a poorly written book. I think that it would have been better to have a more simple introduction to the information given and less about the specific organism I'm going to look it up for.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!A. I am sure i bought the book from Amazon. I do not know the author and i was not impressed.   I was so confused when i read it, i really was looking forward to reading a book about dogs and they all were behaving exactly the way they are supposed to, the dogs always ran away when they heard the bell or there was a person in the house with them but they never ran away because it was a fun book.  Then there was this girl who was with them and she was a little crazy, and her mom and dad, they did not like her and they were mad at her. But then she started to see things in the world that they had not seen before. And after that they all started to love her. And they would take her to other people's houses and they would sit and talk and all this stuff. She loved her dog who did all the barking and stuff. But the dog did all that barking when i tried to take it away but she could not get it out of her mind, and then she was scared the people would go to her and take her away, and she would be locked up and left there. So all that happened is the dog was afraid of the dog that was in her house. And then there was the other dog that they kept and liked. And that dog would be there with her when they went to her home, and the people she was going to. So i thought, wow, there is a dog and there are dogs that are kind of like her but they are not in the same family.  :   What is the purpose of dogs?   The purpose of a dog is to protect you, protect you from bad things, to comfort you in a bad place, to give you information and just to be a part of life. A dog is a very good friend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing more than an example of how a writer can try to make a book into something that it's not. The writing is bad. The story is a mess, the author is not a good writer, and the book is a waste of time. I would give this book 3 stars because I did get some enjoyment out of it, but I'd give it 2 stars for the first story arc.   If you read the synopsis you would think that the first arc was about a boy who had a crush on a girl, but his best friend helped him out by killing a giant dragon (so it's about a kid with superpowers). The rest is just a mess.   a good story (and great illustrations) can be ruined by bad writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  Not a bad read, and I enjoyed it, but there were plenty of things that I didn't find interesting or interesting enough to continue the series.  The characters are interesting, but it felt that they weren't fleshed out enough and were a bit bland for my tastes.  I think this is probably a series I'll just have to put off to get the book I wanted to read.  Also I'm not sure if I agree with the idea that "The last few pages of the book where you're getting to the last third of the story is the best part.  "  5/5   The Good :    A new protagonist for the series, which I really like.  3/5     I can say that I enjoyed the first book of the series a lot and it did a pretty good job of setting up the world, especially for the first two books in the series (though I'm a little surprised that the third book isn't mentioned in this review).   The second book had a nice set-up and I think it would have done a good job if it was kept going, but unfortunately the plot got a little bogged down in too many things and it got somewhat tedious.   So I'd have to recommend the first and second book to anyone who likes this type of book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   What a great read! I'm not going to lie and say that I love The Dune Series, but it certainly is one of my favourite series. I was a bit put out when I came to it because I had never actually read it before and found a lot of the information that was provided for the story confusing at times. However, I actually really enjoyed this book. There are lots of great concepts in this story and lots of fantastic action scenes. I particularly like the fact that it's set in a world where people are not only using machines, but also animals for various tasks. It's not so much about the machines as it is about the humans using them and how much they're able to change the world.   I'm a sucker for science fiction, so I loved the fact it was a story about the future. I also loved the idea that it was the distant future, the very distant future. There were lots of futuristic elements in the story, which I loved. It was really fun to read.   for the people who don't like the idea of people being able to use animals and machines and machines being used by people: do yourself a favour and don't read this book!   -Michelle   "This is a story that has an underlying theme of the inevitable struggle for power in a society. This theme of power is not confined to the plot, it is the backbone of the novel, for better or worse. A lot of what happens in this book is played out in the political arena, where people compete for the same resources and the same status quo. The fact that so many of the characters are from very humble backgrounds is a great thing, because it shows how important it is to understand people from all walks of life and how a simple person's perspective can really make a difference."  -Brynn
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to read this book as the first time I had heard of the subject and was quite interested in it but not sure how I would feel if someone wanted to listen to me while I listened to this book. While the audio quality was better than a recording I had from my CD player, it was definitely not as good as a CD player so I am wondering what that is about. Anyway the audio is good, I didn't have a problem with my microphone but I was very nervous before the reading and it really bothered me that I didn'st feel like I was in the moment.   Overall I felt the book didn't offer much value to anyone looking for a good introduction to this subject as there was very little about how to practice meditation or what the benefits were or why I should care about practicing and I just felt this book would not be very helpful to anyone not already meditating. I feel it was a waste of time to listen because it didn't really get me thinking about the subject in a productive way and even if it was, that didn't make me want to get out my CD players and learn how to meditate.  -M.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************** The story is okay, but the characters are really stupid. The story opens with three characters who are on a ship on a journey to another planet and get stranded. They are trying to find their way back home but in the process find out that there are other people on that planet with them, who are also trying to go back to their home planet, where they grew up. They think they are going to have an easy life there, that they will not have to be as brave as they have been in the past. But they are not so lucky. They find out their home has been attacked and they get captured. They do not like that they are being kept by the person who did this to them. They escape and go to another place. They go back in time and get married to their husband in the future, where everything seems to be going just fine. But the husband dies, so the husband comes back and they have a daughter together. Then they discover that their child has been taken away by the mother and the other children have been taken by the father who is now gone. The only one left is the daughter and she seems to want to go home. What happens next is an action adventure book but with the characters who just seem to be really stupid (I mean just thinking about the stupid characters makes me roll my eyes). The characters are the daughter, her husband and her mother. They all come from different places. They have different families. Each character seems to have a different personality. They seem to have their own motivations to get home. It is a book that should have a good ending, but then everything seems like it goes wrong. The girl does not like her husband because he is kind of old, not the father she thought he was, and the husband does not want to return home with her, he just wants to have sex with her. In the meantime the mother of the daughter is trying to make the mother more like the daughter because her daughter does not seem to want her. It seems like something would happen to the daughter to make her not like the mother. But it never does. I do not know if the author thought this would happen or not, but it did not. All three characters, the girl, her parents and the mother, get in a fight. The daughter is scared of her mother, and thinks she is going to kill her. The mother says she is not going to hurt her because they are in love and that she
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________  Not even in the world of bad fiction can there be such a horrible ending. I have seen a few bad books and enjoyed most of them but this was by far the worst. I had never even heard of the author before reading this but she is the author of several other bad books. When I started the book I did not even feel like I was going to read much more than a few pages because I had no idea what I was even going to get out of this book. I ended up throwing my book out before I finished it because it was just too long and I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  Not very good.  Fantastic concept and the story is really good. Unfortunately, it is poorly written and the ending is a mess.  I love the concept and how the characters can do the "right thing".  This book was an enjoyable read, but it was only because the characters were interesting.  I will stick to The Dresden Files. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this and couldn't finish it. It was a hard book to start off. I did read the prologue, but the book got too slow for me. I tried reading it twice, but I couldn't make it work. I was left disappointed in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________ I've read all the other reviews and will admit I was excited to read this one. I've tried many mystery thrillers and this one sounded good to me. But it wasn't good. First off, I was disappointed to find out that the author wrote the book over a period of several years and many of the characters are new to the story. So what I thought would be a mystery story turned into a boring and predictable story. The plot is based around a man who has a dead woman's hand in his freezer and is trying to solve a murder. He goes to his ex-girlfriend, a beautiful, intelligent woman, and convinces her that he has no motive and that the man who killed her is someone else. When the murder is solved, it turns out to be a suicide by carbon monoxide, not by a man, and the woman dies and the murderer is out of jail. I found it very difficult to keep the story interesting because I had to get bored with the character's and plot line all the time. It's hard to follow the story and I feel the author didn't take the time to find an original way to tell the story that would have made the book better. I'm going to give the book an 8 for what I like about it, but will not be looking forward to reading the next one. If you like mystery thrill- thrillers, you may like this one, but if you're looking for a book to get you excited about reading mystery thrill, I would avoid this one! _________________________________________________________ (review taken from the ARC published by Angry Robot)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not bad, but it's not good either. It's basically a bunch of things that are never seen together and the plot doesn't work on any level. I don't remember the last time I read anything like this. It starts out fine, but all the characters, no matter how many times they come back, no amount of plot advancement gets it out of the beginning. I mean, there's a scene where a guy is talking with his ex-girlfriend and they end up going to her mother's funeral. They're the only people there. That's it. That might be a small thing, but I can't get past that. It doesn't matter if it's a "good" book, because it's just too inconsistent.  A good thing to keep in mind when I say that this is a "bad book": this is NOT a good book, this is BAD BOOKS.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The "Chaos" series is a horrible mess.  From start to finish this series is terrible and a waste of my time.   I have a copy of the first two books and can say that the writing style is very juvenile.  This series is extremely boring with not much happening except one character dying and another character becoming a vampire.  The plot is very simple and makes no sense.  For starters there is a small family in a small town that is being terrorized by a large group of vampires.  There is no explanation as to why the vampires want to terrorize them and they don't get what they want.  Then we have a group of people trying to make a living from vampire hunting but the vampires just don't want them there.  I could go on for hours but the point is to just look at the book and say to yourself "wow"  I was never a fan of the series but I am sure it won't be in my top ten vampire books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I read this book and felt like I was reading a complete piece of trash. The author tries to make us believe that she is going to use these people that are in a shelter to take over a city. We find out that it is actually her mother and her father that are using these women for sex. I felt that I was only allowed to believe that because she told the readers it was her parents. The whole book had one thing in common: she gave a false picture of these women. We found out that she has a big mouth and that she wants to control the world. The entire time the author was telling us she was going to take the women and use them, she was also putting the women in danger. I could only believe that this is all true.   For an author who writes a story about how people are so easily influenced, the most misleading part of this book is the fact that she was using these sex slaves as her main characters. She had a "master" and a "slave". She wanted us to have a master and a slave. There was just a problem with the story. She used the story to convince us that sex slaves were not people at all.   and for a book about a woman who was able to use a woman as a sex slave she needs to have more characters. If this was a book where a man was using his sister as a slave and then he killed her because she didn't want to get on his "bad side" there would be more character development. I wanted to know the whole story because I was so upset and confused by it.   a reader who loved the books thought that this was well written and a very well executed plot, he liked the mystery that this book gave and he didn't find any of the plot-holes or inconsistencies to be that annoying.   that reviewer said it had a twist that was a little disappointing, which I thought was a good twist to make the book more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed the book, but it was a terrible book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. A book written by a man who was raised in the Mormon Church that was later excommunicated is nothing but lies. If this book was written by someone who had been excommunicate the information would have been different. This is another instance of someone who claims to be an exmormon and is so wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is an old book.  I have a hard time getting it to read on my phone, which is why I am only giving 3 stars.   One of the main reasons I bought this book is for the review section.  This book does have great content.  I highly recommend this book, but not the review portion. I read this book at a public library and I got a copy as part of a "new releases" section, because that is what I was most excited about.  The book was actually a good length (1,700 pages), although I didn't have a chance to look at all of the images.  The book is based on the life of George Washington as told in his diaries.  You can read about him during the Revolutionary War, and then also during the first American Revolution (the Second).  The whole story is told through Washington's diaries (some of which are not available for free online).  Although the book is long, I did feel like the first half was kind of boring.  Washington was still quite active during the war (although I think that the only battle he took part in was the Battle of Brandywine), but he didn't really do much other than write his journal.  There is no real action or romance (just descriptions) throughout the book. The reviews for this book are kind of mixed:  " A book about a boring man.  One that you probably want to keep away from your book shelf." "This is a fairly boring book, with no real plot or character development.  Even worse, there is nothing that will really surprise you, either.  However, it was an interesting read." There are no reviews for the book other than a few positive reviews for some of the pictures.   As for the story, the story is actually pretty interesting.  A lot of the time that Washington was not active in the war, he was pretty inactive on his farm.  He was just focused on growing crops and farming his farm, so he did not really have time to really go to battle.  It's kind of sad, though, that there isn't a lot of action in this book either.   The whole war is just a quick summary of everything he was going to do.  In the end, he wasn't really doing much, and was only mentioned in a few places.  But as I said before, it is
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm disappointed to say I will never buy another book from The History Channel.   As you know, I have a lot of books from the History Channel and a few I can't seem to get. This book was the only one that I couldn't get. I thought it would be a good companion to the show "The Great War." I don't think it is.  ...   My friends, I did have a great time watching the History channel's program on the Great War. I wish they would just stop showing all the battles in the Great war. All the soldiers were killed. This was a horrible time in our history and everyone has lost. You will never know how many lives were lost that you don't even know about. We will never forget this.  , March 19, 2005-  This is a very sad book. It is a true account of the Great Patriotic War and of all its casualties, but the author is not brave enough to give us a real story, not to be the only survivor to see through all of it. In my opinion, this is a "graphic novel" because of its very graphic subject matter. The author tries to show that even though the death rate is high, this war is not the one-sided victory that is portrayed on TV. As far as I can see, the only real victory is that it united the world.   and  a little less, March 15, 2005,
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like the way the writing style is used. There are a lot of "in your face" statements about how great the world is, how things are "improved," how things were so terrible that only a "rebirth" can fix them. It's like "how dare you not believe what you read in this book." The last sentence of the book I read read: "You'll get a better understanding of what the world has been missing from its view if you don't buy into the modern myth of progress." That's really all I can say, I couldn't find any other comments on the book that I thought were good.  Read this book with your children:  If you want to have fun while teaching your children a lesson about the power of critical thinking, you should read this book. I can't recommend it enough. I would make it an evening activity and let them read about how the ancient Greek philosophers thought about how reality works, what the Bible says about what's really happening, and about how science has shown us that we live in a holographic simulation.  For more on critical thinking and learning, read this article.  3) The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________________________________ "My name is Robert (not my real name) and I have read a lot of horror books, and I was very disappointed with this one. In general I was rather disappointed with most of the books that I've read so far in this series. I've also seen a review that said the story was well written, and that may be true, however the writing was pretty sloppy, and the characters were just bland and unlikable. The author is a poor writer, it seems, and this book doesn't even qualify for the grade of 'bad.' I would have given it 3 stars, but for some reason it didn't even make it to the 4th star (and I didn't want to be able to use it as an example, so it was just one star)."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very sad and sad story. If you are reading this book, you might want to rethink what you're doing to your mind. I have read other books about mental illness, and read some by people who experienced similar issues as me. I am sad that I did not see my symptoms before I read this book. After reading this story, I will stop reading and maybe just watch reality TV instead.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't think you'll get any higher than a 2 or 3 for this book. It is, in fact, a very poor, very bad book. I've read plenty of novels in the last few years that were better. That doesn't mean that it is bad. I don't even think it is terribly bad. It's just not very good. I read this book because I read a previous one by the same author, and thought it was quite good, and it would be nice to see a book with the same plot and characters. This book is just not up to that standard. The pacing is just...wrong. So wrong, that I was actually tempted to skip half the book for my own good. There are some nice scenes and characters, but they're just not developed enough for me. There is very little character development, and little explanation of things like the history of the world, or why everything is the way it is. The writing is just so bad that it doesn't help the story. Overall, I think the writing and writing style is the main reason I didn't really enjoy this book, but it has more to do with the plot than the quality of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  My wife loves to read books, and books are the best, but she has been reading and writing for about 4 years now. She has never been able to enjoy a book that she hasn't enjoyed writing. Last year I came across the world of The Chronicles of Narnia. I started reading it with the intention of sharing some of my favorite aspects of the book with my wife, and that plan has worked out quite well. Unfortunately, she has never enjoyed reading or writing. That being said, we have had some really great discussions about the book over the past few months, and we were able to make some pretty fun crafts with it. She's also pretty sure she understands the basic plot, and she even had a little fun with it while reading, too. So for this year's book, I knew it was going to be a challenge. I went to the store today and picked out all the materials and supplies. I had my son get a copy of the basic rules of N.T.R.D. that have been written in the Narnian alphabet, and a lot of fun was had by all. We also got a copy for my wife to help her work her way through it, and I thought it would be great to create a little holiday card with it, too! We're going to make a couple of them in the coming weeks!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "An intriguing mystery that is at least partly about the way in which a society can lose sight of itself.

One does not want to put it down!" —Sophie Goldstein, Publisher's Weekly
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- If I had known the truth about this book I would have been less likely to buy it. It's a bad story written by a man who is not good at writing. If you have a weak stomach, you should avoid it. I am sure you can find other things to read on the same subject. The author was a fraud and an idiot. I've already given the money I paid for it to my sister because I really think she was better served spending that money at a casino.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is interesting but lacks depth. The author seems to have forgotten about a good part of the book by the end.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you have read this book, please review it.  Don't read it just because it's a good book.   I'm not saying that you should read it in order to get an A; I'm saying that this is not your typical science fiction novel.  As mentioned earlier, you have no clue what you are about to read.  When I first started reading this book I was intrigued, but as time has passed it's become more of a bore.  The plot is very simple and the characters are just...there.  That's it. I was wondering if this was really worth reading all that time and effort.  I understand that this book is not to everyone's taste, and some people like to read the same book over and over and not even think about it.   However I would recommend this book for those who:    like to see what would happen if humans had met aliens and tried to have a relationship with them, and then tried to take over the world with them.  Or those that like to imagine alien races, but just don't want to do it themselves.  My only major gripe with this book?   It took me a while to get used to the characters.  If you liked the movie The Fly (which is a classic) then you will love the book. However, if you don't then it's going to take a long time before you get to know these characters. I would suggest reading the book and getting to know the characters before reading this one.  Another thing I didn't like was that the ending is a bit "convenient".  I am sure this is intentional on the author's part, but it's not really a nice ending for the book (at least if you read it after The Fly).  I feel like the book could have been a lot better if the author hadn't given us some very "exciting" science (but it just doesn't work with the premise).  However, it's probably better than the book that I would've picked up after this one and it's just a bad experience.  3 out of 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time. No one interested in being a detective or a spy really cares about the plot and the characters. It does have some good ideas and a few very interesting plot twists. But the characters and the plot don't really move any forward.   The plot focuses on the same characters over and over again.   a woman is kidnapped and a man goes to stop it and the man ends up being betrayed by his own team.  , the man with the hostage is a spy and the woman is a member of the KGB. I was trying to work through the plot in my head but found it just kind of stilted. I didn't really think the plot was very interesting.  8 of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I don't understand why a book can make someone so angry." This was a very boring book, which was unfortunate because I would have enjoyed it. I loved the first one, but the second one did not. The protagonist had to be in the military. Why didn't he go to college? This is a great idea. I'd love to see an action movie where someone went to college and found out they didn't like it because they had to put on this uniform all the time, and they couldn't enjoy anything else. That's the problem. A man goes to college because it is supposed to get him experience, to grow, and to learn. But the author never gives him a reason for being there, what he was doing, and why he went into it. It's like he decided, "This is what I'm going to do when I grow up." It's not a mystery to me why the protagonist went into this, or why he stayed. He just did it. In the end it all came down to the book's structure. It was basically a big long paragraph. Every paragraph in this book sucked. The whole thing was kind of boring. But I still enjoyed the book. Maybe you'll like it too.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The character design in this book is not exactly my cup of tea. There's this guy who looks like a cross between a dinosaur and a muppet, and his name is "Ludo the Wise." He's a very arrogant and very pompous character who seems to be the narrator in the story. He's the only character who's actually likable, and he has to be because he's the protagonist and the story revolves around him. That's about all I can say about him. It's like reading a story with a really annoying guy who says some incredibly irritating things. It seems like the author had to make him even more irritating than he already was, in order to make up for the fact that the story was so poorly written. He was so annoying, in fact, that it actually ended up driving me insane. I can't tell if this is supposed to be some kind of homage to Aesop's fables, or if the author just really dislikes ludo. Either way, I didn't feel like I needed to keep reading to feel any sympathy for Ludo. He really was annoying and annoying me. I wanted to punch him in the nose.   I also noticed that Ludo is actually the one who's being told to read books by the narrator. He wants to be smart like the narrator, but the narrator wants him to act like a lubber. This would have been fine if Ludo was a character who could be considered one of the more likable characters. I'm not quite sure why he's a librarian and not a ludo in a disguise. I think it might be some sort of joke that he looks like him, but it makes me wonder. Either that or the author thought ludo was too funny to be an actual person. I feel like that would make more sense. I don't get it. I suppose that's a nitpick but it's still annoying.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the book, the story, and the characters, but I would never buy this book again. I bought this in the middle of reading it because I didn't have time to read through the first three or four books in a series, but then realized that I only had time to buy this one. There were a number of things that bothered me in the book that I would have to say about it. First, as a child, I was told that I had to read a book every night for a full month and when I said I didnít, my mother told me I was lazy and that I didnÕt understand the need for such a strict time limit. There are also some things about the first half of the book where the writer seems to be trying to create a feeling of drama and suspense that he really doesn't have. Also, the ending really threw me for a loop. I knew what was going to happen to the main character, but it took me so long to realize it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read one bad book before - A Man Called Jack, written by A.L. Kennedy (1934). I didn't care for that book at all. This book was no better than A. L. Kennedy's. It was a very disorganised novel. There was a lot of time spent on the 'homes' - and we all know where that's going to go! The only redeeming feature was that I had the idea of a love triangle. That I was able to write about it was a pleasant surprise.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was one of the first books I read in a good fantasy setting, and as the characters were relatively young, it had some interesting things going for it. But I found a lot of it boring, and this is coming from a fan of historical fantasies.   The main character is a young mage who is learning the ways of the necromancers. Unfortunately he is a bit of a bumbling idiot, not because he's incompetent, but because he never stops to think what he's doing. It gets more frustrating because of the various plot developments, and the way in which he never really has a good reason for doing something - I don't even know what they were supposed to be, or why he needed to do them. I also found it annoying that he constantly needs to find an excuse for doing a thing, even when there's a clear reason for it to happen.   to top it all, his love interest is just a very generic character with a similar personality. I'm just not the sort of person who likes love interests of protagonists.  , even though she is a mage, she's never really brought anything to the story. She's just kind of there because her character is an obvious one, and she was written to have a rather minor role, so it's not a big surprise that she doesn't have much of an impact on the story at all. Other than that, she is just another member of the party, nothing more, nothing less.   a lot has been done to bring the characters to life, but I really don't think the author did all that well in this case. It's all about the story, not about the characters.

As with any work of fiction, the author has written for her own amusement and amusement of others, however that has now turned sour. I was expecting the author to write with passion and emotion, but she's actually just writing a poorly written mess of a story and no amount of heartwarming will save it.  .   I bought the book off Amazon, it was only at $2.99 so I was really shocked and disappointed when it wasn't worth it. It wasn't a cheap book either, but I thought I'd have a good read. I'll say that I'm more than happy to give it a fair chance and see what happens.  , not bad writing, I've read good writing before. But the book had none of the passion that I have come to expect from Ms. Jansen. Not even the title sounded interesting to me. I mean, it says that it's about a woman who gets lost and her best friend finds her, and it's in the middle of nowhere and she's a "woman" and "friend".   There was nothing for me to love about this book, I actually felt like I was reading someone's diary/memoir. I feel like it could've been more interesting, but then again, I read a lot of diary/history/memary/memorabilia. It's just that I expected more.   was a great read, but it was a mess. This book is a great example of why I won't buy romance novels for my children. I can honestly say that if I had to choose between this book and one of the other romance novels I have, I would definitely choose the other. I just don't want my children to ever read something this bad ever again. I actually thought that the book was supposed to be about a young man (I don't remember his name though), but it turns out that it actually has a male main character.   to be fair, the main character does change a lot between the first chapter and the end of the book (I think the author just had a tough time writing about the main guy because
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book, but the ending is extremely disappointing.  It's just too much of a coincidence.  I like a good mystery.  The ending was very strange, I felt that I would have liked to see more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was ok but definitely not worth the money.  The writing was ok.  I liked the way the book was told.    I also liked the writing style the author used.  The characters were not fleshed out.  The only thing I dislike about this book is the author's style.  He did not put any character development in this book.  His writing style does not fit my taste.  This story would have been better if he used more words and did not need to use a lot of dialogue.  All the characters are not well written and do not develop.  What I can say about this story, is that there was something about the characters that made me laugh.  They are all different characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's very hard to describe the experience of reading this book. The prose is beautiful. The plot is incredible. The illustrations are amazing. I read this in two sittings. The first night, I was absolutely blown away by the book and didn't realize I had read it. I finished the book with some minor "humbles" but overall I'm very pleased. The second night, after I finished, I knew I needed to write something positive about the book. I wanted to do something that would at least bring some positive things into my life. It wasn't an easy task. I still didn't find anything negative to write. I am just a little too stubborn, sometimes. I had to make the changes. I was able to write a very short blog post about this book, but I'll leave it there and let you read for yourselves. I've read many books that I loved and some that I hated. This book has changed my outlook on a lot of things. I definitely believe it's a must read book. Posted by A.W. at 8:50 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It took me 3 months to finish this book.  I went through 4 or 5 drafts.      I found the author to be arrogant and not as good a writer as she said she was.  They tried to hide the fact that she does not have a degree, but she clearly said it on the first draft.  There was nothing about the author being a professor.  She just said she is an adjunct professor at a local college.  The author does not write about herself.  I find this book to be a big waste of time.  10 of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author wrote it and no one read it, but I like that it is written in third person. That was not a good thing and it was the reason that I did not enjoy it. I guess I just had it for one night and I don't know what will happen next. I didn't like the story at all. I know this is a YA book, but it was so long that I didn`t want to finish it. In the end I read it twice to get an idea of what happened. I don`t have much time to do anything else at the moment, so I guess that this book will sit on the shelf.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of this book is interesting. It's a good follow up book, and not an overly long book. What I found interesting, is the character in this book who had an alter ego called "John." She has a lot of emotional problems and a lot a difficulty controlling her temper. I think a lot about this character in a lot more depth. I like the character as a whole, but she had some problems with the writing style.   After she goes back in time to save the guy, I thought that there was a nice bit of characterization. She got to know a lot things about him. I liked that, but I feel the author left out a lot. She didn't get to know his friends, her dad. All the details she did get to see were in the first half.   The author also failed to give the character a reason to be there. After she saves the guy from all of the bad things in the past and all of this, I think she should have made it a point to say why she was there. She went back into a time she doesn't know anything about, because she can't control her temper and she's trying to learn all the details of what happened.   the only reason she doesn  The second half of the book was not as interesting as the first. It seemed to just be a continuation of the events of the first part, but without giving much in the way of character development. I was a little disappointed that she didn't learn anything new from this part.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________  This is a really good book that you can't put down. I really liked it! It was a little hard to get into because of it's length. The beginning part of the book was kinda boring to me. It wasn't that it was slow but it wasn't as good as the rest of the story. Once the rest is over I enjoyed it!  I really enjoyed this book. It has good characters, action, and humor. I can see why it's so popular. It was just a little slow for me at first. But, I was able to get over that and it eventually got good.  If you are reading this review you probably know why you have been reading this book: You really should read it! I can tell you that this was probably one of the first books I've ever seen that actually helped me decide if I wanted to pursue writing or not. If you're on the fence about how much time you're willing to commit to writing this book is a great starting place! It's a fast read and it'll challenge your imagination and your skills. I was so glad that I read this before the end of the year because it helped me make the decision to finish the first draft of my novel, and write the rest that came out in 2014! The book was also nice to read with a nice variety of characters. This is a book I would definitely recommend to any aspiring writer or just someone who wants to read a really well written book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************** ********************************* This was the worst book I have ever read. For the sake of this review I will use the word "bad" in the sense of bad in the way it was written. The story takes place in the world of The Red Sea, which is located on a large island called The Blue Island, off of Africa in the Indian Ocean. A new type of animal is taking over the island called the Bats. These creatures are very intelligent, and can make their nests high up in trees, and are able to dive and fly through the air. They are extremely strong, and will make their way up the mountains, and through the forest in search of the most delicious ripe fruit they can find. These new creatures also have the ability to hide in the shadow of a tree. Once the BATS start to take over the world, they will take the rest of the world over as well.The story starts out very well. It begins with a man named Hulick, who is on his way back to The Blue island, to bring back some food for his friends. He has come to this island to kill one of the bats, which he does. A big bat named Yuki appears to him and gives him a message. She says that a tribe called The Bats are taking over The Blue. Hulik is not happy with this, and starts a rebellion, and manages to take back the island, along with the BATES.Hulik takes Yuki back to his home and has her live in a small cave. After this Yuki and Hulie start to argue about the past and what has happened. Yuki says she has nothing to do with Hulike history and that she has no wish to see him again. Hruh wants to take Yuki with him, but Yuki wants to stay with Hruah. When Hulih returns, they both agree that they must go back to the island of The BATS and kill them all.When Huliko gets there, he finds the BATS attacking the BATAs that have been living in the cave. They manage to kill them, but they are not done yet. They start to dig through the caves, killing every single BATA that got in their way. The BATA's are forced to flee the cave, and go to another island. When they arrive on this other island, they find the Bata's already on the island.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an excellent read!  I liked it, but there were two parts that really annoyed me.  I felt the author did an awful job of making the characters relatable.  The "hero" was really bland.  Her father was a drunk, her brother was a dope dealer, and so on.  She is really good at making her characters sound real, but she should have let the character develop a little bit.  This is an older book, and it was very difficult to relate to her, but I still thought the character was strong and I liked how she solved the problem. The second part was just awful.  That was an attempt to make the book more "serious" by bringing in some historical figures.  While this worked to make it more believable, it just made the book seem fake.  It wasn't a bad attempt, but it didn't help much.  There were some characters who were interesting and I enjoyed their interactions, but they were few and far between.  They were all stereotypical.  Some were decent enough, but most were completely forgettable. For these two parts, I felt this book was a little weak, but nothing was perfect, so I gave it a pass.  There were other issues, though, which made me less than pleased with the book.  First, it is written in a non-standard way.  If you are used to using a standard format for this kind of book, you will find this very weird.  Second, the book is too long.  A book that is supposed to be short would not be so long.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________   This is the same kind of book that was on the shelf the whole time I was reading it. As the author tries to make something interesting, the writing goes from bad to terrible.   I think I am going to read the other books that the author has written. There are a lot of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the epitome of a literary cliche and is only memorable by its ending. This is a book about a young girl who can't get her father to come home from a military deployment, and how her older brother takes on the responsibility of finding her. I love this novel because it does things that most of the other novels do not do: it has a strong female character who can find happiness and acceptance in her own family.   The plot is very basic, as the author explains it: a young man returns home after a deployment to find his sister missing. After a year of searching, he learns of a large stash of marijuana on a hillside. The author makes his brother a cop and tells him to find out what happened to her. He doesn't really follow the plot, but he's the only character who seems to care. The reader learns about him by the end of the book and wants more.  , though, is nothing short of a cliche.   of course the first time a reader reads this book, he/she is going to think of Michael Mann in the movie Heat, so he/ she has to read it for context. I'm not sure if he meant for this to be the cliche of the cliches or if he read it and thought "yeah, it's cool, that's how a lot of novels end. You know, it takes place at home." The first chapter is the only time we see what happens after the initial story, and the characters are never in a real environment. The characters never know what's going to happen to them, and when it comes it is only as a plot point. When we do get an introduction to a new character, it just feels like they're sitting in a classroom and it's the "story" from school.   and you know this is going somewhere with a character.  's last line is "I don't want to think about her anymore". Really? She doesn't want him to think how much she loves him, how much he means to her, or how much they have to work hard to be a family. In a way, he's just a piece of plot.   It isn't until the second chapter that she starts to feel love for him.    The plot was fairly interesting. There were a few interesting scenes. The scenes that didn't interest me were when the characters were running or fighting or something. I also felt like the
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~~   I received this book as a gift and I was looking forward to reading it. I had read the blurb which described it as "a story of a woman trying to make it as an architect" and thought that was a pretty good description. I got it and immediately realized I would be disappointed. The story is all about her love interest who, after the death of their mother, was "turned out to be a man", thus making the woman's husband, who is a transsexual, become the legal guardian of their daughter. That's it. The woman is a nurse. She is basically just there to take care of him, because the man has a disability. This is a major theme that is introduced very quickly. I am an older woman and I'm very much on the'men should not be trusted' and 'women should not have to rely on men' side of things. I don't think this book had the right message to get across to me.   The author does a great job of explaining what all of the changes in the person's body are like, and how this impacts them physically. She also explains the issues of being a caregiver, but she's so busy explaining all of these things that she is not really explaining anything in a way that I could relate to or appreciate. I was hoping she would make the relationship more complicated for me to relate to and I think she did, but only by a small amount. I didn't think she would actually be able to do that, but I also didn't realize how complex her relationship with the man was until the very end of the book, and she did not really explain that either. That is why I didn the dislike her message.  -She did not make it really obvious what her daughter's disability is and the effect it has on her life.  , I thought that there were a lot of things that were left unexplained by the author which made the book a very frustrating read. I have been trying to learn more about my own disability but I had a hard time figuring out what my own condition and my disability was. I think that the author could have explained more, and made her message more clear.   the lack of communication with the main character about her disability and her relationship to her family is also a major problem for me. I also feel that there was a lot more information that could have been given to me about the disability in the story. I would have really appreciated more

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book that needs to be on the shelf for the ages for sure. It is the perfect example of what NOT to write. I would go so far as to say that it is the worst book I have ever read. It was so bad that I had to pause and reread it 3 times before I could finish it. This is a complete and utter waste of space. It made me feel so stupid and stupid at the same time. It reads more like a bad dream than a story. The only thing I can say about the writing style is that the story was so bizarre and stupid that I thought it was an urban legend at the time I read it. If you ever find yourself in need of a book to read, but you are not prepared for its stupidity, then get this book. It will give you a lot of trouble if you decide to read it but that is the price you pay.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very poorly written book. I found the author's style very confusing and disorganized and her writing very stiff and difficult to read. The writing in this book is very repetitive, and the author seems to have no intention of trying to connect any of the plot points to each other. The book was also very vague and confusing with many inconsistencies. The plot itself was weak and the ending was weak as well.

It changed my life." —Emily  Customer Reviews  A book with such a good title is bound to attract many reviewers, but my favourite one here is "Eureka"! The title alone is pretty enough to bring in the review. The book is an investigation into how the modern-day man thinks and talks, by way of his body language. It's very interesting stuff, and I was not disappointed! —David  The book has all the qualities of a classic: an accessible, easy-to-read and quite readable style of writing. It doesn't offer anything new to the field. It also lacks the most valuable ingredient of modern writing—punch. —Michael  I like the title. I love the writing. I am so happy I bought it. —Emily

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ This is the worst book I have ever read. It takes a whole chapter to get us through the basic concept of the plot. If you read the rest of the book without any kind of background information, you would probably still understand the plot, but you would have no clue what you would be going through in the first chapter. I think that this book is a "filler" or an "extension" of the original series. If there were an entire new book for the series, it might have been better. But this one, I didn't want to read any more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book should have had no reviews. I can't find a single good thing to say about this book. It does not even begin to explain the science behind the practice of chiropractic or why it would help. It makes no attempt to be comprehensive. This is just another one of those books that seems to get published by people who are unfamiliar with the field, and not many of them make it past the first few pages.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The entire first act was a slog. There were so many scenes I had to stop at the bathroom and take a few minutes to calm myself down. I was going to read more. Then the end got a little better and then the middle got a lot better and the beginning was a bit better. Then all hell broke loose and it was like I had been playing the game for two years and the ending was the only one that would work! It was too long, it was too dull, it had a lot of characters that just sat around, talked and didn't do anything. All of the things that made it exciting were the exact things that hurt it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was absolutely horrible.  The book starts out with a discussion about a character named Mary who has a "life with no real purpose."  In one of her "life" moments she decides to go to a "bar of the dead" to get some more of the spirit energy which is supposedly "good" energy.  It doesn't take much of a discussion to realize the poor writing skills of the author as she has completely forgot about all the basic facts of magic and spirit energy and is only interested in the "dying, drinking, smoking, cheating thing."  I know, I know I know!  But we do have to be a little more patient for a story that's supposed to be told in the third person and it is.  I'm going to have to wait for the next book by this author to catch up to the previous book and see if this is still a "druid-chic" fairy tale-like story.   The characters in this book are very shallow and dull.   We get the typical "loner" type character.  A very boring character that we get the same "evil" and "not good" traits and behavior over and over.   Her husband is also very bland and uninteresting.  He's more interested in money than the welfare of his family.   The only time he displays the good qualities of a "good man" is when he's telling his wife that he's going on a "hunting trip" and that he may not be there for her when she needs him.  The worst thing is that he seems to have fallen for the bad-girl archetype.  What's the point of having an evil wife if it's going to always turn out that she's not evil.  She may still be a bad-wife, but at least she wasn't a "bad" one in this novel. Then there is the "love-interest" whom Mary falls in love with.  Her husband doesn't want her to have a "love" in this story because "there are some things that a man just does not want in his wife."  It's pretty clear from the beginning that the author has no problem lying to her and putting her into a "less-than-romantic" situation.  They end up married and have sex when she tells him to.  This is so clichéd.  But let's not even go there.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book back when it first came out.  The first few chapters caught my attention because they seemed quite interesting.    The problem with this book is the last couple of chapters.  I think it would have been a good story had they left out that last part but they didn't.  They used a lot of exposition, which I hate, and just left it there.  The ending is also really rushed and I didn't have any patience to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think this book was badly written and I do not find any humor in it at all. I do find that one of the main characters is really an asshole and does not seem to care about anything other than his own personal agenda. I found myself getting tired of his stupid stories and he is kind of an annoying character that I would not want to spend more time with. I also thought his father was a really bad guy as well. And if you are interested in learning a lot about the history of the world and politics this is definitely a good book to pick up.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************** *It's ok, but...* *I really liked this. But...*   "A friend of my uncle's was a detective and he took me in when I was a baby. I'd stay with him while he was working on a case. He used to take me to places where people were buried. When I was about five, my father was working in the garden when I heard a noise. We rushed back to find a dead man in the bushes. I didn't know if it was a child or a dog. I tried to get close to the body but I could only watch as it slowly rotted away. That was the last time I saw my uncle alive. He went to the station to give a statement. When he got there, he found out that he was being sent to jail for murder. They found the dead man on the ground. He confessed to the murder but he told them that it was my father who did it. He said that he did it in order to get back at me. That made my father think he did right in a way."   Now this is the kind of tale that is so realistic, it's so real that it's almost as if it's happening to you right now, only it's in a different time and place.   I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read that's as close to real life as one can get. The main character is believable and the story develops as the story unfolds. I also would have to say the author did a great job in describing the location the main character lives in, which in this case is the small town in South Texas where he lives. He does a great justice to the small area. It's almost like an urban fantasy.   has an interesting story. I loved it. I wouldn't say it's a "true-life" book, because it's not, it doesn't take place in the real life, but it is definitely a book that is close to life. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants a book about the real world, a true story with good characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  - the narration is really annoying- the story itself is rather simplistic and lacks the emotional weight you might expect- the plot is quite predictable and lacks some spice- the characters are stereotypical- the way the plot and events unfold are somewhat inconsistent- the whole thing is not as good as you'd expect it to be if it were a stand-alone novel, but it is at least entertaining

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of my least favorite books to date.   I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and I love the series, the characters, and the world they are in. I thought it would be great to be able to read the books without any of that background. I've actually read the original and most of the later books in the series as well as the original three books and I loved them all. But this book is nothing like the others, it's more like Harry Potter in a different universe with a different history.     The story starts off well enough, as we have Harry, who is the main character. He's a boy of 17 who is in the process of becoming a wizard and he's living at Hogwarts School. This is the setting for the majority of the story. It's a great setting as there is plenty of magic going on and Harry and his friends are all very talented and smart. It even features Quidditch. So much for school being boring!   One of the problems of this story is that Harry gets very involved in an experiment to help create a magical potion that will help him stop aging. The only problem is that the potion that they use is poisonous. So it kills a bunch of people when they drink it and leaves Harry to live a few years longer, in the most horrible way. There is a horrible death that Harry goes through and he comes to the conclusion that the reason he lives so long is that he's a wizard, a special one at that.   the only other character in the story who isn't a special genius is Ron. But it really shouldn't matter to him that the people he's close with died because he's too busy getting drunk on a daily basis. In fact, Ron is the one who ends up being the main antagonist of the book. Ron gets involved in this mess that the experiments are involved with and that's the main cause of the deaths. Ron just gets so carried away that he ends up dying a horrible way and has to be killed, but it's kind of hilarious.   and in the end it's not really Ron's fault, at all. He does the experiment and the potions are made but he's not responsible for the deaths and it's Ron who ends all the deaths in the book by accident. Ron has been working with the magical society to help them make the potion and accidentally creates the potion. The society doesn't know what to do because it could be used
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you have a love for the great outdoors, and have read a few great books on this subject, I highly recommend  "Escape from Alaska: A Memoir of Wilderness and Backcountry Survival" by  Matt Molloy.   Molloys work is a must-read for any person who loves to hike, camp, and travel.  Matt has traveled the U.S. many times to shoot and hike on the trail and in the backcountry.  The beauty of this book, from the great photography to the writing, is amazing.  I read this book in two sittings, and then reread it at home.  This book is great to read while sitting out in the sun after hiking or in the cold of a late winter night.  For a book that I loved as much as I did, Matt makes a point to add in some humor to the story to bring us a little more light in his work.  I hope the reader enjoyed Matt as much I did!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My friends and I bought this book because we were looking for a book that would explain some of the strange practices that we heard about in our day-to-day lives. The book itself was very interesting and I found it very informative. The best thing about it is that the author is very honest and open. It's like watching a real-life interview where the subject is open and honest. The author of the book, David Icke, was interviewed a number of times, and each time I was impressed with his knowledge and experience. The problem I had with the book was that it had a strong New Age flavor to it, and I can't say that it's really a good way to explain things to others. Overall, it's a good book to read, but it wasn't something I could recommend.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~*Sucks, gets worse as it goes along.~~   I enjoyed this book very much and thought it was very well-written. I was hoping for a more exciting, emotional, or even psychological twist and I was disappointed. There were a lot of twists and turns but nothing to get really excited about.   My main problem with this book is the lack of realism. It was hard to imagine a world where the whole world didn't get annihilated by a massive, apocalyptic event. The world didn�t look as it did in this book and I found it hard to believe that all the important things were still there. I could imagine a good sci-fi story where the world ended because of some sort of accident that took out everyone except for one person. In this book, all the world was destroyed. That really struck me as a huge flaw.  -The ending was a bit too convenient. ~~~ I understand that people who are afraid of losing a loved one could want to see things play out differently, but it just felt like it was rushed. ~~~~~~~   So, I recommend this book to fans of zombie fics, but be warned that there may be a few scenes where there are zombies. I also recommend this to anyone who loves good zombies and/or good sci fi/fantasy books.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________" (4/10) - this was a bad read, from start to finish. I enjoyed reading the book, but there were some major problems in the story that are completely avoidable.The story started good, as I knew it would as I had seen it on the movie screen. However, I was very disappointed to see it not continue on to the end. The story just stopped there and didn't continue on into the end, but it wasn't the end of the story, as the movie did. I don't believe this movie is in any way a "good" book, and I wouldn't recommend reading it, unless you have already seen the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ________________________________________  I bought the ebook edition of the book on e-book reader. I thought it was fine, but when I got to the chapter on 'Tests' I was frustrated. There was a lot of writing that could have been done better, but it wasn't a big deal in the end. It may be that the book was written for a different audience than mine. Overall, I think the book is a great resource for those who are trying to teach themselves to code.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  So I just wanted to give my 1-star review here, because I just finished reading the book. It's just not that good. I did enjoy it at the time, but since I haven't read any of the other books, I don't know if I'll be able to make this one work for me. I really like the concept of the plot, but I don in't like the writing, I just don't like how the characters behaved. (I'm not too much of a wimp, I hate seeing a man killed like that, but the author just seemed to want it to happen like that. And I know it's not how it was, because he wrote it all so well that I knew exactly what he was doing, but it was just really hard for me to follow that) In this book, there is a great plot of a man, who is trying to find a girl that is missing her son. And so on. But I do not like how he was behaving. It seemed that he was too busy to care, and I don.t think he cared. And also, the girl that he had found, is not exactly the type of person that is interested in having a relationship with a "lone wolf" like him, and her reactions were totally different. I liked her in this book more than the others. But to be honest, that is more of a personal opinion. Overall, I give it 1 star only because I enjoyed the plot and the characters, but in the end it just just didn't work for us, it didn't seem to fit into the book that I have read. Also, I do think that the author wrote in an interesting way, and not just trying to write a story that would make his readers think "wow, he knows how to make a good story in a thriller" or anything like that (he just seems to write his books in the way that would fit best for him, I think). However, I didn't really enjoy it in the beginning. And the ending, again, just didn t work for my taste. I will not say that it is a bad story, but just I would have to give it a 5 if I was gonna rate it 5 stars. Also I really think that I would get bored in this type of book, it was really not an interesting or entertaining story. I would recommend it only if you like a good plot with interesting characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     - I found this book to be absolutely mind-blowing. A huge part of my journey to becoming a woman is a profound sense of empowerment and I was hooked from the get-go. It was also great to see what it's like to be a guy in a female body. The authors write with such confidence and I feel they are totally unique. I love the way they deal with the "triggers" to transition, from body image and societal expectations to medical and legal procedures. I'm a 30 year old man with a fairly typical sexual history and the book definitely touched on a few things that helped me figure out how to deal with my issues. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the worst book I've ever read. Not only was it very difficult to understand, but the plot was totally bogus, just like the rest of the story lines in this book. I felt like I was watching a bad movie at times and had to keep turning the pages just to be sure I wasn't watching a movie.  I really didn't like how the story was told.  It was also so far removed from real life that I really don't understand why they had to write it that way.  The first chapter, "The Beginning", set the tone very well. The rest of it was really bad! I have no idea how they were going to solve their world of conspiracy if the characters were so stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A collection of short stories that are all so very similar. Each one is so utterly unlike the next that it can't help but remind one of a bad movie. These stories are all about someone or something that is so far from the norm that it is completely unrecognizable. When you read them all you'll wonder if you have read them before. I was expecting to like a lot of them. I didn't. I guess I just read too much of the same thing. It is sad that some of these stories were so good, but not all of them were. The one that did catch my attention was the last, which made me feel like I was experiencing the same emotion at the same time as the narrator. I wasn't. The story itself was sad and I hope that people like it. But the way it was written makes me wonder why I'm giving this a 3-star. I'll read the others too, but I'm going to hold off on the next ones. If only I had a lot more time to read...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story isn't bad, but I'm disappointed in its author. He has a tendency to create characters that are either the same or very similar to each other and is not interested in telling stories that don't sound the same way as his characters. He spends the first third or so of the book writing some really interesting scenes, and at times the story can really grow, but he starts doing this in the middle of the story and it is very annoying. At times it is a little hard to figure out what he is trying to do, because you just don't know how much of what you are supposed to be feeling is actually a reflection of your character and how he feels at the moment.   There are a lot of little errors in grammar, but they are really not that big a deal since most of the mistakes are not too big. I will try not to read more of his books because of this, but it will make it more likely that I can't be bothered to read other stories by him.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________   I don't think I've read a book that so thoroughly disappointed me that I couldn't read it through again. I'd always read about such things, but was always a bit sceptical. But I've always known what a great writer she was.   She's a very skilled writer, but the thing that really made it for me was when she talked about her childhood in Russia. I don't know if it was due to that or her experiences in the US, but this was my first exposure to the experience of the poverty, the lack of medical care and the neglect of children in developing countries. I knew this was going to be an interesting story, but what surprised me was her vivid and honest descriptions of what that was like. I was actually crying a bit during some of the descriptions.   a great story and a great author, I'd recommend this to anyone who has a sense of wonder.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________   First off, I don't think this book deserves a 4-star rating. I just don't feel like I'm getting any good value for the money, which is unfortunate. The story is fairly simple. The premise is interesting and has some good bits. I can definitely see it being used in a science fiction setting. But, the story is very repetitive. And it's quite repetitive, if I do say so myself.   The characters are...well, not very interesting. They're not particularly memorable and they don't really have much of a back story. They aren't even very memorable in their first appearance, either. The only one that I feel is interesting is Maddy, who is the main character of the book and the narrator. She's a scientist, and the most relatable, even though she doesn't really know what she's doing. In fact, when we meet her in the book, she's still working on her PhD.   that doesn't seem to be too much of an issue though, since it seems she's got it in her head to keep working, even when things don't go her way. She even manages to find a way to not die on a space mission.   of course, it is a bit strange that she is the only person on the ship who knows what's going on. Maybe if there's more focus on the rest of the crew, then she could have gotten more screen time.  , but that just isn't a very satisfying way to write a book.   is really hard to write, especially as a sci-fi novel. I'm not sure I can say that it wasn't frustrating, because I was so frustrated with it. The book also suffers from a lack of action. In the beginning of the story, we get a space battle, then we jump to a bunch of people in space who aren't doing anything. It's pretty obvious that none of them are in control. At times it's almost as if the story's focus is too much on the plot and not enough on the characters. I don´t know if I would recommend this book for anyone who wants a good book to read, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone that is just looking for a quick read.  - April 6, 2011More repetitive than I was expecting  Reviewer: MrPinch - favorite favorite favorite - January 17, 2011  Subject: Interesting concept - Not what I expected
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I have to say that when I started reading this book it sounded interesting, but at the end I realized it was not an entertaining book. I really have to question if this book was a good investment for the author. I think his real intention was to teach people to do this job and teach them to become an investigator so that they can get a salary. But I think the book was not entertaining enough for this purpose. I didn't understand why he couldn't just say that it was because his investigators were so bad. I mean, it's not as if he's making a fortune here or anything. This just seems like a book to teach law enforcement to become investigators, not to have a good time doing it. I'm sure the FBI will love to hear this, but I think they should not spend their money reading books like this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The author has no idea what she's talking about. No, seriously. She starts off claiming that the only reason why men like women so much is because they are "fearless." That, ladies and gentlemen, is a total lie.   There is this one quote in this book that I really don't understand. It goes something like this:   In a woman's life there is a feeling of having to prove herself, even if she is doing it wrong.   and   As a woman, we are constantly confronted by the constant idea that we are different from men, even though we are identical to them in every way.   with a very strong emphasis on "every way." This is an utterly stupid, unoriginal, and insulting idea.   is completely at odds with the rest of this book. And I really wish I could stop this book and give it zero stars, but I can't because I hate lying and false advertising.  , and this book has to be the WORST book I have ever read! You will probably not like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book.  I know the author has written and published lots of excellent books and the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was an excellent book with lots of interesting information but this one is just a piece of garbage and a waste of money.  There is absolutely no story, no character development, no plot, no reason to do the book other than to sell more copies.  You are not going to get any closure from the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't like the book then don't read it. If you like the books then read the one that follows the books. I read all the novels before I started reading this one. The characters of The Night Circus  didn't interest me. I don't know what is the point of the main character, he is the only one I don?t care about. If the books didn't have such a bad ending then I would have given it 3 stars. I really wanted to like this book but it was just too much to take in. I am not sure what I liked more, the writing or the characters in it. I can not put them all into one category because I am looking for the whole of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!I received a very nice book, but there were numerous grammatical errors in the text and a very poor translation. It is very difficult for an ordinary reader to follow what is being said (especially in the beginning when one begins to read it). I was afraid that the poor translation would have made it impossible to understand (so my daughter, who was also given the book, did not know what I was talking about) but to my surprise, she was able to understand it and was very pleased with the book.I would recommend it to anyone who does not have a good understanding of Greek.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------A bad book! It was very hard to read because of all the "tricks" he pulled on me! He told me that I am too young and not "lucky enough" to be good at things. He also said that my friends will laugh at me for things I do, like when I did my homework on the computer, and he told me not to do it! He also told me to "just shut up and listen" and be more like "the rest of the people" when he does a job! I was embarrassed to be an "ugly person" who doesn't have good things happen to her! I'm not one to talk about my feelings, but I just could not stand this! I felt very hurt and that his words were hurtful to me! I won't ever buy this book from this author again!!!  4 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First I should say this book is not the most enjoyable read ever. The first half is a typical story of two kids having adventures around the town, trying to figure out how to solve their problems with the magic of the neighborhood. But then the kids start to get serious and begin to take over the town (and the world). The book ends with the kids saving the world. But that's just the beginning. I am going to give the book a 1 out of 5 because of the pacing. It is pretty slow and confusing. In fact the main problem I had with the book is that it seemed to have nothing to say. It doesn't give you anything new or interesting. It just feels like a typical middle grade tale, with some kids who just want to have fun and be heroes. But you know what? That's just fine, because I loved every minute of it.   The character development is fantastic. Every kid, each character in this book, you get to know a little bit more about and enjoy more each day they spend together. The author knows when to put in a scene and when to get a little mysterious. The story also contains the magic, which is pretty well done. I think this is the first time I've actually liked magic in a book. I mean, I love the idea of a magic circle or something like that, but it just doesn't feel real. But with this book it did.   is the second half of the book. And it is also great. It's the first real "evil" we get to experience in this world. So far, this part of the story is not as well written as the first part of this story, but the magic is still very well done and the plot keeps moving forward. The magic aspect also involves the world of the kids in this story. So now they're in a magical world. It also contains a lot of magic, and a lot more drama, than the first half. The characters are still great and the story just keeps getting better as you read. I also really like the way the magic works, it's so much fun to see how it works and how powerful it can be.  -   Overall this was a fun read, with a good story and wonderful magic. I loved the characters, the magic aspect and how it just didn't feel like the world I usually see in books.  The only problem is that this book might get a 3 out of 10

Write a negative review about a bad book:    - In my opinion, this is the worst book ever written  - It is a joke of a book with so many obvious problems it can only be funny if the author wants it to be  (view spoiler)  If you have not read it, I have to tell you this, you don't deserve to even begin the series. This book was not written by any decent writer, nor was it written by the author's own hand. It was written by someone who either has no idea what a book is supposed to be, or is writing a book that he would like to read, and who has probably never picked up a pen, let alone written a book.The story begins with one of the main characters, a young man named J.R.M. as he is being arrested by police for being in possession of drugs. The arrest was a huge blow to the young man, as well as to his family. He was sentenced to two to ten years in prison, the amount of time he would probably spend in jail after being sentenced. The young man's sister, Marlene, is now a full blown alcoholic, and was barely able to function while in jail. J.A. and J.S. are both on their way out of the prison at the same time, J.J. being sentenced to a minimum of three years. The family is being ripped apart, and the young men seem to be the only ones who seem to know how to help and save each other. JJA, who is a high school senior, is trying to get as close to Marlene as possible in order to help her and her family, while trying to protect J.T., the kid who had to get in with J.M.'s gang and become his friend.The beginning of the book is very strange, as you're not sure where the book will be going with this story. In fact, the book has so many problems it's hard to even know where it's going, let along whether it's really going to go anywhere. The author doesn't take a chance in this novel, he doesn't even try to explain things to the reader. At some point, the author will try to make things clear to the readers, but it never really works. The book is just so confusing and hard to follow that it's almost impossible to read it without having to re-read it several times, in order not to miss a key fact.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was a really fun little book. There's just enough in here for kids to be entertained but not so much as to keep you from being bored, and it's great to look up the references to other games. I found the author's writing to be very entertaining. The characters were unique and enjoyable to follow. I enjoyed the whole time reading this. I don't think I've ever read anything like this before. There were so many references to video games, movies, tv shows, books, and other things that were so cool that I didn't mind. This is a fun little read and I'm happy that it was included in the collection that I have of games for kids.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not very good. I did find it somewhat helpful though, since it's something the general public could learn from (and hopefully get a better understanding of) when it comes to dealing with those who aren't exactly like us. However, as much as I liked this book, I was also quite upset by how this is written. It's like a series of short stories, rather than a book that can stand on its own. This isn't a bad thing - it's just that I felt it made the whole thing feel kind of hollow. At times I found myself hoping for an ending, but in the end I was just frustrated by how it ended. I had high hopes for this book. I read the first few chapters over a couple of nights (and a few days). I loved how I found these stories helpful, and how they made me more aware of how to handle situations that might come up in my everyday life. I felt like these were important lessons to be learned. But as I was reading them, I found that it seemed to end on a rather hollow note. So this book ended up not being as helpful as I wanted it to be. But I think it would be helpful for a young person to learn how to better approach situations (or people) that they don't understand. I think this would be especially useful for a person with anxiety, or someone who is sensitive to certain situations.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really disliked this book. The characters had no depth, and the story didn't have much suspense. I couldn't stand the characters in general. There is not much to look forward to in this book - it's all about the plot and the characters. I would have much preferred a more realistic, more well thought out story - it could have had more depth and depth of story. I'd say it's a shame, because it's so well written, but it's also not worth the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I didn't enjoy this book at all, it just was kind of annoying and I wanted to turn it off immediately. The story is very poorly told, you get into a battle in a small town, the two opposing factions, the main characters, and you just kind of follow them through this battle and then it ends. I didn?t really care, I got bored pretty quick, and it was too long to read, it wasn?t very interesting to me at all. --------------------------
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* This book was a waste of time and money. The only good thing I can say about this book is that it gave me information I needed, however I am not sure where this information was sourced. If you are not familiar with the "Biblical creationist" theory, I would highly recommend that you do not buy this book. I was very confused at many times. For example the book states that "God created the earth in six days, and then rested on it, and the heavens and the earth were locked together and the waters flowed down." ******** This is simply not true. God did not create the earth and the stars, or even the sun and moon, but He rested on the seventh day on the mountain of Him who formed the earth. God created the world in six 24 hour days, then rested and created all things on the sixth day. The story in Genesis is about a group of seven witnesses to God who were God's mouthpieces and teachers. However, when God did rest He rested only on the earth, and did not leave it. This book is very confused and the author does not have the ability to provide clear and direct information. I have bought similar books before, but this one was the worst so far.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A bit too predictable, and some of the characters seemed more like caricatures than actual people. So, I was rather expecting some type of epic battle, or even a very dramatic death." -Evan, May 2011   Helpful because it made the setting of the novel, and the book, very much come to life. I also love that the author used the book as a tool to promote her website, and to learn more about her personal beliefs. It's really interesting how people can think up a fantasy world, and turn it into a "tourist trap" which has no real interest, and which is written by a person who is not very talented, and not very nice, at describing her world. I really liked the story, and was looking forward to the sequels, though.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   The book is a collection of anecdotes from various people about life, and has a lot of common sense but is not a complete set of observations.   One of the stories is about a man who was hit by a car after walking away from a fight. The person in the car came to the hospital, but was told he could not survive and was taken back home. After the man died, the driver admitted to having been involved in the fight and did not want to see anyone about it.  , but the woman who was driving the car didn't want to leave a card and did say she was fine.   in the end the man's family sued the woman and got the car seized. The woman was later convicted of DUI and received a 60 day prison sentence and 30 days of home confinement.   to me this story is ridiculous, because it is easy to come to an understanding of why he would hit someone, but very difficult to figure out why he drove the car into a body and tried to run away.   "   Read the whole review...  Rating: [5 of 5 Stars!] This book is amazing!The book contains a lot more wisdom about life and why people do what they do. It's well written, and the stories are often humorous, such as one of a guy who decided to go down to the beach and not watch the ball drop because he was afraid of missing it, and that caused the person who had lost the game to end up dead. But this book is not only for people who are scared or think that they don't have any life experience. It is for everyone in the world who thinks that life is a joke. The stories are hilarious, and everyone should read this book to see just how stupid everyone in life is.Read the full review...
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ This was the worst book I have ever read. There is no plot. No character development. No interesting settings. Just plain boring. I had to look up how to pronounce words in the foreign languages that the characters speak. And there are no pictures! I mean they do have some pictures but there are nothing to hold my interest or get me interested! They are just pictures of people having boring conversations! It made me tired. I would have loved a little more drama in the book. I think the author thought there was no reason to explain anything because the author was really the only one in this story. I hope this book is never made into a movie or a comic book because it is just a waste of time and money. I will only read a book when I am really bored. This book was really boring! I won't even recommend it to anyone!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book over a month ago and am still not finished.   The plot is interesting enough. It takes place in the early 1900's and focuses on a detective in the city. The book is written in a non-linear format with time passing, but is actually rather confusing and confusing at times. Some parts were a bit too slow. The mystery is not that interesting.     I've given this 4 stars because it's one of those books where you can keep reading but just not finished because there are some parts that are really really slow and not clear. I could have probably done with a shorter time pass if the mystery was as good as it could have been.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________________________"This book is the first book by a black woman in the best-seller lists for an academic book. I do hope she will continue writing books like this. I'm also a woman and I am glad for books like these but as a black women I wish she would write the ones where she was writing about her own experiences."______________________________________________________________________________________I'm a huge fan of Margaret Atwood, but I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. While I am not a fan of her prose style, her character development and political philosophy is on point. I was surprised by her portrayal of the characters. I have noticed that the white characters are portrayed by a lot of white male characters. She is so good at portraying characters of colour and they seem to be more realistic and humanized than the white male protagonists in many of the other books I have read. This is especially important when she has to describe the experiences of Black Americans in the 21st century. This book is full of wisdom and is well worth reading.______________________________This is a very good book. Atwood is a master of narrative. This novel is her most philosophical novel to date. Her prose is excellent, her plots are intricate, and her characters are deep. I love that she is addressing themes such as inequality and racism with the American Dream as the backdrop. I also appreciated that the characters are flawed and flawed characters are what we need today. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is serious about the importance of education in the world today. This was a great read._______________________________I thought this was great. As a big fan of Atwood and her work I enjoyed this one a lot. This story deals with race, education, social justice and gender relations. At one point I even began to identify with the character. The characters are all flawed but they are all human. While there are no heroes or villains this novel will not leave you disappointed. At least for me it did._________________________I was a bit disappointed that the main character isn't quite as interesting as the other characters. The novel was very slow going to me and the plotline was a little convoluted but overall it was still good. The narrator was great and the characters were well drawn. I really enjoyed it!______________________________I love this novel and the narrator, Tasha Davis. She did a great job, especially with the story line and the dialogue.

I did not like it at all and the book itself has been reviewed already so I won't go into the many things that I disliked but let me just say that the world building is so poor and you don't know anything about the characters and the characters don't even know anything. I have a problem with this in fiction because I feel that it is so important to me to feel as though I can tell the characters' story and it breaks down with just poor world building and story. Also there are some characters that I really don't want to know anything but I can't put it down because I can not wait to get the next installment. I am a huge fan of the series and it makes me sad that the story is just so terrible, I hope we get to see the other two books in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      First off, if you like science fiction or fantasy, I would highly recommend that you read "In the Matter of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." It is written in a style that is a blend of Raymond Chandler, Raymond Carver, and Arthur C. Clarke. The language is sometimes very funny, sometimes serious, and sometimes poetic. The world building is a bit sparse but still interesting.   The book starts with Jekyl and Hyde, who are the most famous serial killers in history, being put on trial for the murders of twelve people. They are, at least in part, the reason for the Great Chicago Fire. Hyde is a brilliant and skilled surgeon, while Jeky is an unskilled and violent killer. Each is very intelligent, but Jekym's intelligence is so overbearing that he is incapable of controlling his actions and doesn't realize that he's killing people. Jephyr is the more successful of the two, with his intellect and surgical skills. However, he is just as vicious, and just as ruthless. In fact, the difference between Jekys and Jephys is so great that Jephy has a better idea of what Jekyn is capable of doing, and knows he will fail. He's not sure whether to stop Jekygth or not. Jepth is not as smart as Hyde, but he is stronger and more intelligent, and as a surgeon he has the skill to fix what Hyde cannot, although it takes him a long time to master the art. Jeksie, as the last of the original five, is a very sadistic and cunning psychopath who can kill people instantly with a glance.   in the end Jephry wins, after murdering Jekky in a series of cruel ways. Jeka is still dead, but alive.  , but it is also sad. Jegth has already become so successful in his criminal activities that he will be able to get away with almost anything. It seems that Hyde and Jekypth were the only two people that ever had the guts to try to get him locked up. This is not only the main story but it's the only real point of the book. However the author has a few more interesting stories in mind. I won't spoil them but you will get a good feeling for what they are about, and who Jekyr is.The story is slow to get going. It begins with J
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I don't know what to think about this book, other than it's a waste of my time. I guess I expected more from a young adult novel (especially one that deals with sexuality), but I'm not happy with it at all. Maybe I wasn't the right age to handle some of this. I think it would be better if it were for a younger reader. Maybe the character's ages would have made more sense. But it's just a waste.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished this book, and I did not like it at all.  First of all, the premise is stupid.    It has a very basic premise - a kid, whose father was murdered by his own son, is going to do something very bad to make up for it - and does not have a damn clue about how to accomplish it.  The only reason why he does this is because he's going to die, and the best way to do this was to kill his own father (which is what he does anyway).  What's the problem here?     Why does a story about a young man doing something very evil and dangerous have to have a child as a major character?  He has absolutely no idea what he's doing.  He's just going to kill the guy who killed his father.   I really don't understand why it's this bad.  One of the only good things about this book was that it was funny.  That's why it got an 8, so it's still better than "Fantastic"! I don't know.  I just didn't like it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm so disappointed with this book. The title is misleading and should have been 'The Death of the Author' instead. I've bought the book, had it open in my study on a table, but after re-reading it, I don't think I would read another one. This book is written as a fictionalized account of a fictitious character and has no basis in truth. I just found out that it was written by a woman. It was written in an author's style, not in the style of her own life. The story is really boring and poorly written. There is no way this book could have been written by an author who had experienced her own death. I wouldn't recommend this book at all.  47 of 51 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a horrible book.   The story starts with two women, one who's in prison for a crime that she didn't commit and the other who's a victim of sexual abuse. They fall in love and move in together. As the novel progresses, we find out that these women had some kind of sexual relationship (the book doesn't say what it is) while in prison and that the man she's with was also a prisoner. But there's another problem. After a murder, the guy the woman is with is sent to prison and she is forced to stay with her husband, because she had already been raped while in jail.  , and this is just one of many.The novel starts off strong, with some suspense, mystery, and some tension and action. But as the novel goes on, we learn that everything that was good in the beginning was replaced by a bunch of things that are simply bad writing and plot development. The characters don't seem to have a lot of development and you're not really sure if you're supposed to like any of them. The setting is a small town where everyone is a horrible person and there's a murderer. The ending is incredibly unsatisfying.The entire book is a very bad idea, and that is just an aspect of the plot that doesn't really detract from the novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** This book should have been called "When Women are the Enemy".   The characters are so poorly developed that they are a joke. You could read a novel that was as boring as this and it would still be better than this book.   When this book was originally published it was very poorly received and sold very poorly. This book has nothing to do with the story of the first one. This is simply a rewrite from the author. This retelling is so shallow that it was even reviewed by the NYT!

I was not disappointed!  It was the same experience as the movie.  The stories were told with the same intensity.   The writing style of this book is one of the best I've read.  This book is about a man who's been in a longterm relationship and has been the one to go through the breakup process.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book. The description of the book was very attractive to me (I have read many horror books and they all seem to be written by a man and all are very similar). I found the cover very attractive too. However, the book wasn't as good as I hoped. This book was so dull I couldn't put it down, and I'm a book-lover.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If this were a bad movie I would give the book a less than 5 star rating because it is an excellent piece of literature, but the fact that it's a book makes it such a terrible movie that it makes it more like a bad short story. I can't speak about the book and how well it describes how a cult works because this is the first time I've ever read about a cult, but what I can speak about is how well the movie captures its setting, and how it's written.  It's a nice setting for a movie, and as a good film I had a great time watching it, but for this film it was awful. The movie was not as good as I expected it to be, and the pacing was so slow in places that I found it hard to keep up with. There were some pretty good moments in the movie (like the ending), but there were some moments in this movie that really left me feeling angry with the author (I mean, the cult was the only real reason that the film was made, right?). Overall, though, if you want a short story of how cults work, I suggest you try reading this book. It's probably more relevant to the movie, but I find it easier to imagine what's going on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main problem I had with this book was that it was so boring.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's difficult for me to say anything bad about this book. I did enjoy it. However, the plot kept me up at night, wondering if I missed something.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry, but this book is garbage. As a fan of the genre, I wanted to give this book 5 stars, and I had hoped it would be better than the books I've seen on Goodreads. However, I just can't.   First, the narration is terrible. I was surprised to learn that the narrator is male, and that the author is female. The voice is flat and monotone, lacking any passion, excitement, or wit. She never shows any emotion. And even though she has a strong voice, she lacks range in her delivery. When it comes to her narration, there are no nuances that would show us her thoughts, as if she's just giving the narration as a voice memo. She is very mechanical with her delivery, and it sounds forced and contrived, even if it's just because her voice is so flat and dull.   Second, the plot is horrible. We are told a lot of details about what's happening, but I think some of the details are confusing at best. Some events are left unexplained, and the story seems to end at a cliffhanger at least half the time. This also happened to my first time reading a YA book. I'm not an expert in this area, but a lot would have helped. When characters get killed, they seem to be killed in the first act. Then they seem alive again, and then killed again. The last three books in this series seem to have a similar problem. This is something that bothered me a lot when I first started reading, and is another thing that would have been better without narration. There were times when I wanted something to happen, and instead of something happening, it happened for no apparent reason, or at least no obvious reason in a certain direction. I thought it was a plot hole. I wish there was some sort of explanation that I don't have for why certain events happened the way they did, or why they seemed to just keep happening, in a random order.   I also thought it odd that the protagonist's mother didn't seem to really care about the heroine, but then I thought about how she was in love with the man that was supposed to be her father, and if she cared about the daughter that much, then how could she have cared that much about him and his brother? It's like there's a huge disconnect between the characters and the reader, and this is an issue that seems to be repeated
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! this is a good book but a very confusing one. It is very slow and confusing and it takes forever to read the whole thing. I really think this book needs a good editor to fix the bad grammar and the bad plot.   It is a shame that this book is not available for sale in the United States because it has great ideas and can be very interesting. The main plot is very interesting and the ending was a little unsatisfying but I still enjoyed it very much. I think the writing style is very good and this book can be a really fun read for adults and teens.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I will give this book four stars because I had fun reading it, and a really good deal of fun to read it at that. However, I could not give it five stars. I had so much fun with this book, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it one star because it was so much of a disappointment. I'm not sure why I enjoyed this book so much more than the others but maybe I just really liked the idea of "Sparrowland". For those not familiar with the series, Sparrowland is a town in the country which is filled with many quirky characters. It has all the elements of a book with lots of humor and a happy ending. So why was Sparrowland so disappointing? I've had problems with my kids reading books and finding the perfect ones. I usually have to force them to read certain books, or if they refuse, I let them decide to read something else. This has happened twice now and this book was the second time. Sparlyland was too mature for my 5 year old and my 10 year old. My 10 year olds preferred reading the Goosebumps book and this had little to do with them. One thing that bothered me though is that this book went on for way too long. There was just too much going on in the first book. For my kids to read a book over a 1/3rd of the way through (and the first half of the book) was a bit too much to handle. In this book there were too many scenes and it really got to my heart because I really loved what was going on with the main character and his family. But then there was so many different characters which I really didn't care for or understand. Some were funny, some sad, some were just plain boring and some I felt I would have a better time reading about in the book. But I digress. The book also did not have a happy conclusion. I thought this book could have ended when the main characters were finally ready to leave the town and live a normal life. No way! There was more to this book than I gave it credit for and I am not sure that my kids will enjoy this book because it does not have the happy ending I was hoping for. Bottom line: I'm a disappointed reader.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ As a child I read this book and I loved it. I was about 11 or 12 and my parents bought the book. I remember it having a really long end. It was a very exciting story. I liked it and I still do. I like my books to be different. It is very sad that the author decided to do this to it. My main complaint is it was not funny at all. I loved the main character. My sister loved this book. It did not have a good ending. I wish I had read it when I was a kid. I would have enjoyed it more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "A lot of people have been raving about The War on Terror and I was hoping that it would be as good as I had hoped it would and that it might be as enjoyable as I was expecting, but alas, it was not to be. It was very boring. Very boring.... I guess it's not my fault, they didn't spend any time showing the difference between the Taliban and al Qaeda. They didn't explain why the Taliban is better than the al Qaeda, they don't say anything, they just state it and show the pictures, and what does that say? That's not a good enough reason to buy a book on such a controversial subject.... A lot of the information is irrelevant. If you go to the BBC website and look at the Taliban versus the al-Qaeda, it's just like taking a bunch of pictures and saying "here's all the differences," but it doesn't work like that. When they show people shooting each other, they put down all the different Taliban and all the al Qaida, then all of a sudden, the Taliban are good, and it shows just how boring the information was.... The book had a very long prologue about a year ago.... They talk about the war being over, but they don t really explain the reason why it's over.... When they got to where we are now, the reason for the war was pretty obvious and clear. I'm not sure why they didn t really go there. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most disappointing part of the book was that it is so poorly written. For example, I think this is when the book got more interesting. This is when it started to get real and not just just a series of ruminations. The author does not know how to express emotion, instead of just telling. In a way the book is trying to convey feelings with an incredibly awkward use of language. There were times that the author wrote incredibly dull, boring prose, and the characters were not even trying to be likable. When you don't really feel anything the book becomes pretty depressing. The only way this was remotely redeeming was that the characters didn't really seem to be in love with each other. But I just feel bad for them in general, as if their love isn't really there either. The whole book seemed like this one guy's ramblings. It's almost as if he's going through some kind of depression or something.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I love the premise of the book, and loved the characters. Unfortunately, I found the execution poor. The story is very simple, but it has an interesting premise. It gets repetitive, especially after half way through. I am sorry this is the final score on a good idea but the execution was poor and I believe the writer failed in the creative process.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am going to be blunt. The book is bad. Not good. Bad. If you liked the original trilogy then there is little to see here. I liked the first book very much and this one was disappointing. It doesn't even make the list of worst books I've read (and this is a list I do, every year, on a blog I do not own). I do recommend this book to anyone who has ever been an annoying teen trying to please her parents, but is a little too short for that and who really wants to feel better about themselves after having been bullied.   The main character is a teenager who has been kicked out of her home after being caught smoking. This is a common story, but it is played a bit too straight. She gets the drug which helps her with her schoolwork. She meets this guy who is very nice, who tries to help her. She ends up in a relationship with him which gets more and more complicated.   the book follows the two of them. It's not that great a book, it's like a movie, or better yet a TV series. I know that you could tell it was a TV show because it has so many scenes of them doing things to each other, but in reality it was so bad.  ... I will warn you now if you are into that kind of thing: it is written very badly and very sloppily.  - I had to read a LOT of this to be able to make sense of the book. Not because it was difficult, but because it is so boring and it makes no sense. For example, when she meets this man she says that she was looking for something she was not looking for, when I know she has a boyfriend at school I don't get why she is looking for him. : (If you're wondering why I had a lot of trouble with the book, see my review of the first novel) The main problem here was the way she was written. The author used lots of metaphors that made no sense at all. I couldn't understand why she said things like "he had not eaten a full meal in years" or "he felt the world was spinning." She was constantly making references to things that were obviously made up. When she gets to the end she says she was "a complete wreck." That does not mean that she is. She just has no idea what she's doing, and as a result doesn
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a waste of my time.  I went through the whole thing without being able to follow the plot, and I got so bored that I just gave up.  As for what it was, a novel set in a future where the whole planet is controlled by a giant corporation, where robots and humans compete for resources and jobs and everyone has superpowers... this is about the worst novel I've ever read.  It's pretty much a story about how a guy that wants to be a doctor gets mad at how he's treated by society, so he goes around trying to beat up people, then gets sent into a coma by a scientist who wants to help him, and then wakes up a hundred years in the future, and finds a whole society that has been turned into robots... and then has a huge fight with some of those robots in the end.   Oh... and if you've been following my reviews you may know that I've been pretty much bashing this book in them, even though the premise is good, but it's just been an extremely bad book.  If you want to read a bad novel set at the end of the world, where a bunch of kids go to fight giant robot enemies and come back with all their superpowers, then this is the book for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************************** I'm not going to write a glowing review, just some thoughts. It seems to me that when the book was published the author was under pressure to do something sensational. After reading it, I'm surprised to say that it was nothing more than a standard, well-known novel that was written with no special effects. I was disappointed in the ending, but it still didn't have me on the edge of my seat for long. I would have liked some more details about the family and the circumstances surrounding the murder.

The characters were all well developed, and i think the author did a great job in creating a believable world. The prose of this book was a little heavy, and it could use a bit of editing, but there were some parts that were pretty good.   and my other big complaint, is that the plot line was confusing to me. Everytime i tried to figure out what happened in the story i was left confused. And to think the book is only about 3/4's way through....

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________I purchased this book about a month ago, and while I was enjoying it, I began to notice several things that bothered me.First: the author's explanation for why the characters in the story are the way they are is, in my opinion, incomplete. The narrator seems to be more interested in justifying their actions and making the world more interesting than in exploring the characters' personalities, and it was very apparent that the author wanted to write about the world's destruction in the book, and, to that end, left out the interesting people from the story (and it wasn't until the very end that the narrator said "And you thought they were all terrible."

That is, it did not make sense for the protagonist to leave the city. (view spoiler)

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________   The title is misleading. There is no love triangle in this story. In fact, there are only two people in this novel. The two are the main characters. The novel is about them. They are not a couple, or even in a relationship. They aren't even a couple. It is not a love triangle. It was about a couple that had gotten in over their heads. I love the title, too. There are many, many times in this book when I heard, "Oh. She just said that..." This novel is a little too much about the plot. I didn't care for the plot that much. It got to be very tedious, and at times even irritating. And to be honest, I am not a very good writer. So the plot is a big part of why I didn  The plot in this first novel is not too complicated. The characters were not the best. The narrator is not very interesting. But it was still okay, and the plot was enjoyable. There was nothing particularly bad about it. I did like the story. I don't love it as much as my other books, but it is fun. I am giving this book four stars because it was okay, but I do not feel that it was a particularly good book.   Overall rating: ______________________________   The story is about a man, Jack and a woman, Mariah. They get involved with a young woman, Kiki. The story doesn't begin here. It's pretty much about Jack and Mariah, Kinko and Kiki, and Marijane and Kinku. And a little about the story with Kiki and Kinky. And then there is a scene of the narrator saying, "And now, you may know, I have something to say to you..." The narrator says, "My name is R.A. Salvatore. I write science fiction. I make up these things, these imaginary things that are not real, to make you think." And then he goes on about how he can't find a publisher to publish his novels because of his novels being too different from other writers. It kind of got confusing to me. I thought the narrator was saying that he was writing about other things he could not find a publishing company for, but he was actually not. He was saying, in his opinion, the story that he thought was really different from everything else that was in fiction at that time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for my 16 year old daughter. When I opened it she immediately went to the back and got a copy. My sister said she had been looking for a book that would teach her how to write about dinosaurs and this was it. So I was not disappointed.   As a first book on dinosaurs the author does a great job of making the reader feel like he is living in the 19th Century and not being a modern man. The characters are well written, the author makes you feel like there are real people in this story. It would be great if this book was more in depth about dinosaurs but I guess this is what first grade is for.  . It has a great narrator who does a fantastic job. I'm not a fan of the narrator for children's books so I was a little surprised but he did a great and believable job. He did not sound like he was reading a child's book but that's not a bad thing. The other characters were also well written.   the story was easy to follow and the dinosaurs were awesome!  It was a very interesting read.  (review of free book)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate that there's nothing good about this book. Not the writing, nor the art, nor its characters or story, or the ideas put forth. It's so bland, I actually feel like I'm missing something. Not because the author is dumb, I like him. The problem is that he just plain sucks. He is a generic and boring author.   The first thing I will say about the author's name is that it's not his. I found that it was spelled differently in the book and on the author page.  .   "A man's soul is eternal." The guy doesn't know what that is. The only thing I can think of is that his soul is immortal. Is that a good thing? Do people need to go to heaven and hell for eternity? Why should his soul go to the other place where the other people go for eternity or heaven? What if he had been born in heaven? Would he be immortal there?   In addition to his bad grammar, the author does not know how to change the pronouns, instead choosing "it" and "her" instead of "he" and "...his". The man, his wife, his dog, and a few other people are referred to using a plural form. I think I'm the only person who is unable to remember how to use a plural in English.  - He writes about "maddened men"   - It's funny how he says something along the lines of "They didn't know which way to go," and then in the next paragraph we find out they're "thru the dark" - which I don't recall, as I don`t think they've had any dark at all in the story. This is a reference to the movie, "The Dark Crystal" as well. I couldn't tell if he was joking or not, but I can tell you I haven't read it.  : In the opening paragraph, we find the man, the "man who goes back in time" is shown to be very stupid:  "You remember how we went to the mall in the mall, back in the day."   "What day?" asked Alice.  ,   He replied, "You were little then."   the woman, sitting on a bench outside the house, looked up from her paper and said "I think you've got it wrong.

The writing is good, it does have some good stories and some really fun adventures.   the art is good and well done. I like the coloring style the book uses, it feels more like a comic book or graphic novel but still gives the book some character. I liked how they had the art throughout the book showing the world through the eyes of the character, giving a good look into the world. The illustrations are also good, some have some nice animation. The cover of the book is really nice too, I can imagine why it's called "The Tale of Rincewind". The illustrations really set the scene, and the style of the story fits the book perfectly.   to wrap up, this book really is worth reading. It's one of those books that makes you want to read more, and you feel as if you've learned a great deal about a whole lot of things that you probably would have known about already. It really does a great job of presenting a whole new way of looking at the world and a whole other side to how we interact with the characters. The world is pretty cool and the characters are really fun and exciting. If you have any interest in learning more about magic, fantasy, or just a really interesting character, and don't mind the time commitment, then I highly recommend you pick up a copy of this book. It may take a few days to read and you may miss some characters but if you stick with it you won't be disappointed, and in the end you might get a better understanding of something you probably thought was obvious.   be warned though, if you're a person who tends to be quick to judge, this is not the book for you. It will challenge some of your beliefs.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The worst book ever." I love this book and will read it all the time. But in the first chapter, the book starts to have a bad mood. It just keeps picking on your characters, and not even a name was mentioned. It would have been nice to see a name on the cover. I was hoping for a few scenes with some action. It wasn't until the fourth chapter that something changed. This was the one part that gave me hope. The character was changed from a nice woman to a bad person. I am glad they don't just write the book from the characters point of view. The best part was the main characters friendship. A good friend that wasn't evil. The worst part is that no one in this book did anything other than talk about how sad the main character was. This made it very sad. The ending was so sad. That would have made it better. The characters in this story are so amazing. I love them all. In a way, all of them are the best of the worst of what they could be. I can't say enough good things about this book. It is a must read for all people who like to read or who have even never read a book. I think this book will bring so much joy to the reader. This book made me smile and cry. Thank you! It was a very enjoyable read.  (Disclaimer: I don't own Twilight or The Worst Book Ever) Posted by Aimee

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________ It's not that there aren't good books out there, but most of them are published by small presses and are sold from the back of a book store or as used books in the bargain bins. I don't know how many people actually read or like the books they purchase and buy it again and again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst books I have ever read. The author should be ashamed of himself for such terrible writing and un-professional work. If he wants to be considered a "literary" author then at least write something other than what he did in this book. I'll admit I'm not really sure how this was written and how it will be remembered. The book is poorly written. It's not just the plot, it's the grammar and syntax. It really is bad and doesn't even have a point. The characters seem to be drawn from the book (i.e. one of the main characters was from the novel and another one was a clone of his father). So the writing is just bad. This book just lacks any sort of direction. It jumps around too much. There's no real character development whatsoever. No matter what the book is about, the author will always be in the way of making it interesting. It just doesn't work and it just doesn the poor writing style. This book isn't very good at all. It lacks any sense of purpose and doesn "want" to be read and it lacks any real plot. Just go get some other books from the library, instead of wasting time on this one. 3 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This book was so bad, it was an embarrassment to the science of evolutionary biology and the readership at large. It had no scientific substance. What a waste of a book.   It was a textbook that had the same title as the first edition but which is much better than the first, and that version was more up to date."   Read the other reviews and try to decide if you are going to buy this book. I would not recommend it to a scientific audience.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------  I was excited to read this book. I had been wanting to read about the time of a great leader (King Joffre) in the battle to keep France from the Catholic rebels. Unfortunately the author made a very big mistake and took a totally wrong direction. In the book I discovered that King Joffrey, the current king of France and brother of King George I was not a great man. When the battle was won by the Catholic side Joffray's side was wiped out. Then he became the scapegoat and they all lived happily ever after, and in this new found happiness Joffry was no longer king. But it didn't take long to learn that Joffery wasn't really king either. He had died while trying to get away from the Catholics. His brother was named King in his place. When I started reading I thought I would like it and I did and now I am back to where I was in reading the other King James Bible. There is too much stuff that has been left out of the story for me to get through all the errors and bad choices of the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********  "Diana is a beautiful, smart, articulate young woman who wants nothing more than to become a lawyer in the city and make a difference in the world, to help those in need. Her mother and father are always working or in school, so Diana always felt left out. The only thing that she ever wanted from life was a family with a happy marriage. She got married and had a daughter (we call her Angelina) but as soon as Angelina started college she dropped out to start a family of her own. It's not that she doesn't want to have a family, it's just that the way she has it arranged doesn't appeal to her. That's what makes this book such a disappointment. The characters are shallow, the writing is not up to the level of the characters' intelligence, and the overall plot is a mess. It is hard to figure out who is doing what, but it also doesn't help that the main character is an annoying mother that seems to have all the answers. She says some good things about her daughter's friends, but she really has no real feelings for them. She never once expresses her appreciation for Angelina, and even when she does, Angelina never responds to it. It seems she doesn"t even know who she's talking to. There's also a subplot of some girls trying to get into Diana"s high school who are interested in Angelina. I"m sorry to say that none of them seem like real friends, just people who want a ride. The author's only real interest in the book was the idea of having a series, not really writing the book herself, but writing about others writing a book. The subplot about Diana" and Angelina being together is a nice story idea, but really, it doesn" t work. Angelina isn"t a good enough character to carry the story, Diana doesn" not make the kind of deep changes she needs to make, and if she did, there wouldn"t be enough time for the story to move forward, so why write it at all? The book could have been a great, good read, but the writing just doesn" the whole thing out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book was awful.  The author has made this story about her personal experience, and the only reason she has had such a bad time of it is because her husband is a sociopath.   He had this thing for her, and she was not ready to go.  They made him feel important, and he wanted to feel important.  He also wants her to get it on so he can feel important too.  She did not want that, and I don't think she's ready to do it either.  This was the only novel I read.  I have read lots of horror, and found this to be just plain awful.   Overall Rating:   4 1/2 stars.   I can't recommend this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think the characters in this book are extremely annoying and not much of a threat. The plot is a little too rushed to make me interested. I'm sorry, but I didn't enjoy this book! If you are a fan of paranormal, this book is definitely not for you. I finished the book in one sitting and I can't wait to finish it in two or three more.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was very strange and I feel like it was poorly written and poorly done. I found it to be very disjointed, and the story lacked focus. The main character was not as engaging as I hoped she would be. Also, the setting was very disorganized, confusing, and strange. This book is a real let down for me, but for other people it may be worth a try. I will also mention that the author did not respond to my request for a review copy, so I can not attest to the quality of her books.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** It was a very poor book. The author, a man named Bruce Gaughan, had to do a lot of research to figure out how the word'stun' came to be used. It was only when he did so that I finally understood what he was writing about in the book. It turns out that it is a very popular word in English, and one of the reasons for its popularity in the U.S. is the fact that it does indeed contain an element of surprise. Stun is used in contexts where you expect someone to be stunned and you expect the reaction to come after a certain amount of time. Stun can be a result of the unexpectedness of something and it is quite common to find people trying to look cool, be clever, or be unpredictable. In the case of stun the author does not provide any examples of this use and his own reaction did not help to show the point. However, I am giving the book 2 stars just for the fact it is on my shelf. It is an interesting book, and if you like a bit of humor and a good chuckle, then I would suggest you give it a try.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:  There is no plot and no characters in this book. The book is just too long and boring, the characters are too thin and dull, the plot is too thin to care about the characters.  This book is also too long to do any serious work in the fiction genre.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** This was one of the worst books I've ever read, from a writer of many terrible books. It was also the only book in this collection that I didn't enjoy (and I can't tell you why!). It was just... awful! I mean it wasn't even worth re-reading. I've read dozens of horror/thriller novels that I would enjoy, but this... I found it so uninspiring. What kind of an author puts his/her name on such a boring book? What kind? You have to read this book to understand this writer. It's a real shame! A real shame. Not just because this is the only one of his I've never read, but because you will have to deal with the author's terrible taste in books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have bought this book about 6 times now because it seemed the perfect book for me.  This time, I am disappointed to say the least.    If you are looking for a book that can make you laugh your ass off and make you think then this is not the book for you.  It is a book about suicide which is funny but has a serious message at the end.  I understand the message but I wish the book was a little bit longer.  The main character has some real problems which makes me wonder if they were real.  This book takes a long time to read and some of the things in it are so hard to get through.   It makes me think that if he was a real person he would have said that things are hard to go through in life and that he is feeling suicidal.   I know he may have felt that way but I have had to put my hands up when people have talked about being suicidal and I have heard them say things that have made me want to hit them.  There are a few things that are a little too weird to even get through and I did feel like I was reading a fanfic when I came to the ending.    There is a part that makes me want a good old fashioned slap in the face but I can't bring myself to do that.   Overall this was a bad experience for me because the book is so ridiculous and has some pretty weird concepts.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book has a huge negative in it.  In fact, it's so big, I'm surprised there hasn't been a book or series that attempts to "fix" this character, or at least get back to a place where we can see her as a human being rather than a monster in a cage.  The only good thing is she's getting her own spin-off...I just wish that spin-on book was about someone else than herself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:..................................   "The author has failed to show that anyone can find the book valuable at all, especially the price of the paperback and the hardcover."   This review has been updated from one that appeared on the website of the author's bookstore, The Book Store (Chicago, IL).   The author was originally billed as the founder of a new publishing company, a company that was going to "make the hardback paperback books available to the world in an easy to use format, as opposed to having to use an expensive computer to read them." [Note: that has since been changed. It was the founder's idea that the books be published in a special format of hardcover.] The plan, as laid out in the book, was to publish one book a month, and the first was published in March 2000, the second in January 2001, and so on.   Then the book was released. The author's book was not popular with reviewers and the books were released with "short covers" rather than the original long covers. This resulted in many of them being sold out at the time the books came out. The first one sold out in under four minutes and the second sold out about ten seconds after the first one was sold out.   in less than four minutes.   a couple of hundred copies in less then 10 seconds, and almost all of them went fast.   "That was the end of the original plan," the author says. "I was supposed to write one book, but it turned out to be five." [In the book he refers to this as the "sustaining project," but it should not be confused with the original idea to publish a book each month. It appears he just decided the idea would work better as an intermittent project.]   He describes the publishing plans and the changes that occurred:   One thing that I did notice from the beginning is that every book, when it came out, was sold at a loss. When I was told to publish three books in a month and the other two books were to be released one-at-a-time, I realized that I had only enough money to print one copy of each book. I knew I would only sell the first few copies of each, so I would have to take a loss on every copy of the books I did sell.  ... As time went on and the sales numbers showed that the first three books would not sell as much as I expected
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has many problems. The story is boring. I couldn't get any sense of what was going on, and then I realize that most of the scenes were set up with no real payoff. The author has made a number of minor characters, and these characters are given no real development. And then, when the story did have a payoff, it ended up being a bit of a "twist." It's a book that has a lot of potential, but unfortunately this time, I wasn't able to enjoy it. Read More
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was too slow for my tastes. Not one of the first books I've read, and I don't mind it that much, but the writing was very stilted and lacking in passion. The characters weren't so much flawed or just plain stupid as simply bad. My biggest issue is the ending, which was not a great one.  I don't know if I'll be able to get past the horrible writing, or if it will simply be a book I read over and over and never finish. I also have to disagree with the rating, which I would give it a 3.75. I think that in general most reviews don't give their actual rating so it's kind of impossible to read it and figure out if a book is good or not.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________  I don't know why I started reading... I really was never interested in books. When I was at university, I could read about three chapters in a book before I got bored and started looking for something else. I haven't had a proper novel since I left university, and while I had a good read of The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - the main thing that kept me reading was the feeling of power and freedom that comes from being in command. This book was just another attempt to create that feeling, and failed.   This review is of the first part of a trilogy, The Magician's Land. There were many good things in the first half of this book, including a few characters I had not previously heard of and some good humour. However, as the book progressed, it got worse, and more boring, and in the end I just couldn't remember anything of the book. I had the impression the author had tried to make it like a novel, rather than a short story, and to my surprise, it doesn't really work. In fact, I would rate this book at a D.   the first two parts were great, but the last was a disaster.  4 of 4 people found this review helpful

If I could write an entire book without any plot at all, I probably would.   This is one of those books where I would actually like to read it but I wouldn't have the patience to re-read it the first time through.  27 of 29 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________  The final word about the first edition:  I don't care about the book. I don't even like reading books, and I think I'm in the minority. The first edition (when it was released) was a total flop. In my opinion, it is a book for someone who does not like books, or has some sort of mental illness, or is a complete idiot. It was poorly written, it had a bad plot, it was boring, it made me feel like a moron and gave me the impression that someone had to have read the original work and then had to spend a good bit of time trying to figure out how to re-do it. It is one of those books that can be really entertaining to read if you aren't a bookworm (at least when I read it, which was rarely).   If you can handle some boring, uninteresting, poorly plotted, boring, poorly written and boring stories with no plot or characters, I recommend that you pass on the first copy. You'll spend more time trying than actually reading. And since most of these books are in the same genre, there will be others just like this.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I was looking forward to this one, it seemed like a nice, warm read. It wasnt. It didn't really have any warmth to it at all. It just felt like a hot dry book. The character development was average, nothing special. All the other stuff about the setting and the world building just didn't grab me. I liked the setting but the world was just so much a generic fantasy setting. --------------
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm afraid the book is just too horrible. It's so bad, it's hard to even explain. I've always disliked that genre of books I call the trashy romance. It wasn't until I read this that I realized I really hated romance so I have read a bunch of other trashy romances before. It was so bad I just wanted to throw it across the room. I really thought I was going to like it, but this book was just so awful. I mean I'm sure that's not necessarily a bad thing but I can't say I enjoyed it at all. I had to put it down half way through. If it wasn't for my parents who said they love this type of books, I would have just given up. Just not a good book, I don't even know why I read it in the first place.  No other reviewers had even mentioned this but I'm just glad I got to read it. If you want something a bit different or better in that genre this is not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had heard that the book was a good one, but I had to look it up, because it is not!  And I mean I am very very disappointed with the book, because I was not expecting to find out about a bunch of "exotic" people in India.  That is what I was hoping to hear because it sounded really interesting.  The book is about the Indian elite who live in the "City of Light" in South Africa and who are involved in international business.    In my opinion it's a very boring and dry and boring book.  And I am just about to turn the last page because my wife is reading it to me and I am going to turn away from it, because as my wife says, "It is too boring".  I also read the other book that was published in South African that has a story of a South African man who was the richest man in India when the Indian economy crashed.  It is interesting but as my only complaint, I didn't see how they knew this man's name.  I read the book because the author said that this was the first book in the Indian section of his book.   And the thing about South Africa is that it has a very wealthy population.   I have lived in India and South Africa for 6 years and I can say that I am not surprised that South Africans can afford such luxury cars, because in India it is quite common to own such cars.   But in South Australia, you find that the rich and powerful are very careful about money, because even if they do have a lot of money, they are very conscious that they don't give it away and are afraid to ask for favors from others.   The Indians are very much similar in that regard. And they are also very proud of being wealthy because it means that they can do whatever they want.  But this does not mean that they have no ethics.  In fact they have many ethics, especially in India, because Indian society is extremely hierarchical.   If you have more money than a certain person, they will ask that you spend it in ways that will make you the most money for you and they will give you what you want to be the most important thing in the world.  They want you to live the highest life, and even if it is a luxury, it is still a luxury and they want you at the top of the ladder, so to speak.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best part of this book is that it is not an overly long book. However, I was pretty bored the whole way through, and had to force myself to put down the book. The author spends more time describing characters that I don't care about than she does actual setting up of plot for the books, especially since the books are so short.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ by Mark Z. Danielewski is a pretty bad book. It's bad both in terms of its characters and plot, and it's a complete mess. I'm not sure how it got into my hands, but it's very bad in every possible way. I have read about 10 books like this, but this is by far the worst one yet. It has so many obvious errors, and the writing is so bad that I can't believe that anyone would give this book to their daughter or son to read. I was about halfway through the book before I decided that I didn't even want to finish it, because it's such a lousy story and the characters are terrible.   This is one of those cases where the book is so awful, and yet it's so poorly written that it works. The story centers around a young boy named Ben who, after being in a car accident, wakes up as a girl. Ben doesn't know this, because he is a boy, but eventually the story focuses on his relationship with his mother, who is also a girl (but not Ben's mother, so Ben does not know it).   I've had a number of experiences in the past few years where I've had to deal with the idea of having my entire gender questioned. When I started having these conversations with my wife, she did not take it well. She was upset because I was telling her about these experiences, and I am a little embarrassed to admit that it was because I wanted to give my wife the option to say that she didn't think she was a lesbian. It was an awkward conversation because her reaction was so different from what I was expecting. I guess I should have known better, since we are both so much more open than most people are with the truth. It does seem like the more honest people are about their gender, the more their parents accept them.  , a book about a boy who is in the closet, has been in my library for a few months now. I don't normally read about gay people, but because I love this book, and because there were so many things I didn"t like about it that I thought might have been good to change, I read it anyway.The story revolves around this boy, and his family. The father is a woman, and her identity is never mentioned. He is very distant and distant from her family, and in his mind he is the "true" family member.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was skeptical about the "magic" in this book. But, I must say, I was very disappointed with it.  It seemed that Ms. Kaczynski had read the research and decided to put it into her book.  I didn't like how "magic is for idiots." The "magic-making" techniques are all the same as the tricks that are taught in "Star Wars" movies.   When it came to making a cake, the techniques were the same, so I'm going to guess that this book was written because Ms.Kaczynski saw the success of "Star Trek," and decided she needed to write a book about the science.  But, it didn't work.   The techniques were really interesting, but none of the things described in the book could actually be made.   I found the "spinning" technique to be interesting, and I liked it. It's also interesting that the techniques have to be taught. If you just know how to do it, you could have any cake you want and it would be delicious.  The book also did not tell you how to make the most delicious, fluffy, light cake you have ever tasted.  Ms.Gibson had to say, "You want the most beautiful cake. It will be the most expensive cake too, and that will make you feel so good inside when you eat it."   I was really disappointed that the book made magic tricks seem so easy.  Not a single book I've read has had a tutorial about making any of the tricks.  Most of the book just repeats the instructions that I already knew about, and makes the instructions even more boring than the "porn-like" description of the "laziest" of tricks. So, why would anyone want to learn how to use magic in their home or work? I'd suggest a different book, one that tells you how to make magic, not how to cast spells.  For all its "magic", this book is pretty boring and dull.  If you want to make a "supercook" cake that is just the perfect cake for all occasions, you'd probably better go for a cook book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to love this book, but unfortunately I couldn't. This book is written in a way that seems to ignore the important issues surrounding domestic abuse, in favor of focusing on the emotional and emotional abuse. The book starts out with the abusive father of the main character, and it seems like this book is supposed to be about how the main protagonist had an abusive and neglectful father, but as the story progresses it seemed to become more about how she tries to hide the abuse from the people she cares for. I could have done with more of her emotional turmoil throughout the book. She also had an ex boyfriend who was an abusive jerk.   I will say, that if you were looking for something that was about a girl who is abused and goes on a journey to find out what caused the abuse, I would definitely give this one a shot. If you were just looking for a book that was written in the stereotypical abusive family that's full of guilt trip, and self-pity, you won't find it here.   
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ Dear Mr. Rothfuss, I have read the first two books in the series and loved them. I can't wait to continue with this trilogy. Unfortunately, my enjoyment has been dampened by the characters who are only around to serve as plot devices. I would gladly spend the money for a Kindle version if you have not ruined it. The second book was the best, but the ending is too contrived to be believable. Also, my only other experience with fantasy books was in the original series. These two novels are nothing like that series. Please, keep writing. Thanks. You suck!  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- --------------- I did not want to review this book because I already had read it. When I found out I would be reviewing it I found the characters irritating. Even the main female character was annoying. I wish I could go into more details but you'll just have to read it to find out. However I have to give it a good review on the character development. It really shows how much the writer had gone to research before writing the book. This is the first book in a series so you can expect that there are more books in the series. --------------- ------------------------------ Have you read all the books in this series? Do you want to know when the next book is going to come out? Then read this book! ------------------------------------------------------- What is the title of this book? --------------- The Red Queen and the White Rabbit The Red Rabbit was the first in a 5-book series that I will discuss below. In this book the characters had just escaped from prison and were running away. They were being chased by a group of women that were looking for the men. The characters that we saw the most in this book was the Red Queen who is the leader of the women and who was also the villain. This book really was a long book and I think the only thing I could say about it was that it was a good read. You can buy the book through these links: -------------- Amazon.com Barnes & Noble Audible.com It is also available on Amazon.co.uk You can also buy it through the Kindle store. What do you think of this series of books? How are they different from the ones you have read before?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I really hope this book was a mistake. I loved it. I liked the ending, I liked some of the characters. The idea of a "sad" story seemed to me interesting." The "problem" with this book is that it seems like an attempted parody.  Not only does the story follow this plot, but it is set in a time of American culture and politics during the time of the Cold War, which has become synonymous with a "madman" or a "doomed one".  It follows the life of the protagonist, who is known by the pseudonym "Sally", in the aftermath of a terrorist attack that claimed the lives of her parents, who were a "big reason" for her being born and being a "bad" person, due to being gay. The story does, of course, touch on the idea of suicide (by the characters) and how it affects people, in general, and not just the suicidal.  I personally find this to be a very interesting story and a powerful reflection of our world's relationship with the mentally ill.   I do not, however, feel that the author's intent was to comment on suicide or mental illness.  Instead, I feel that, at times, the book can seem a bit overly dramatic and pretentious at times.  I understand the desire for a satire of the current political climate, but I also feel that a book of this size and importance should actually be approached in a more reflective manner. I also feel, for this book, that I could have done more with a character named "Fritz" (as opposed to "The Great One" or "Sallie").  If anyone is interested in purchasing this book (or a copy of a lesser known book by the same author), please check Amazon.com out for more information.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the kind of book where every page has at least three typos.  Every. Page. This is a badly written, poorly paced, poorly edited, horribly presented, poorly executed and extremely dull book. The author's only reason for the poor quality was a desire to make money and a lack of respect for her readers.  This book is so unreadable I almost wish I could delete it.  There are times I just want to throw my phone across the room in frustration.  If you read the blurb and have a low tolerance for low-quality books that don't make an impact in the story you have in the first 5 pages then go read something else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I'm an older woman who has read many of the books in this genre. Some I liked, some I didn't, and some I hated. I really did have a great time with this one, and loved the descriptions. I have to admit I didn.t like the cover because it was too bright and I think it distracts from the images. There were some very beautiful images of the animals, but the writing for all of the images in the book was terrible. The illustrations were very dark and I felt they could be too. I also had an issue with the narration. I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds this annoying when the book has some pretty good narration, like in many of these books. I don't think that I'll be buying this one again, but I'd like to try out a new narrator.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not a good book, and my review of it is not even about the book. The author tries to be a realist, but is never able to show his point of view clearly. I find the story line to be ridiculous and unrealistic. It is all written in such a fast paced way that the plot does not feel real. As for the plot, we are told in many ways by our main character that the main antagonist is after him, and that we are only supposed to believe it because the main character is a very honest person. This is really stupid as it's all based on lies and the main villain, who we are supposed to hate so much, is never even mentioned in the book itself. The character development is also horrible. In the beginning, the main protagonist is a real person, but at the end he is a robot that can think for itself, like the main villains in many stories. This made me dislike him all the more. This book has many problems that make it an awful book. It's also one of the worst books I have ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** *** I would give this book a 2 stars. I've never really enjoyed this author's novels, but I liked this book better than some of his others. The writing style is good enough, it has a unique point of view that is not predictable, but it's not very interesting or original. The plot doesn't really go anywhere, and we are treated to a lot of action scenes, mostly involving monsters that I'm sure we already know by now. This book should be the second in a series. It's short and has one of the most predictable plot twists that is known to man, so I'd recommend it as something for a first read of this author.  Helpful to the plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:..........................................   I read this book over a period of time. It took me awhile to read it because the pace wasn't too fast, but I'm glad I finally did.   The book is set in ancient Egypt. There are three stories in the book.   This book is very interesting because there are three main characters.  . A man named Sadaqat has a magical ring. Sadaaqat keeps this ring on his finger 24/7. He has no idea what it is or why it does what it does. His friend, Neshtal, has been searching for Sadaqaat. Sitaqat's wife is pregnant with his child. When Neshtar finds out what Sadaqqat has done, she decides that she wants him out of the way.   He decides to take his ring and leave town. He is followed by a young girl named Suhailah. He finds her running after him and he gives her his ring to help her.   in the beginning of the book, the story goes to a different place. You do not get the full story until about Chapter 16.   I did not have the same problems with the other reviews. When I was reading the story, I thought of that scene in Lord of the Rings where they enter Mordor and you think, "This is great". It is a great scene. It was like that when I read the book and thought to myself, "I know this must be amazing".
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking for something like this before I went to university and had the good fortune to discover a copy of 'The Little Mermaid.' The book was beautiful to look at and I had been trying to find something like it for about 20 years. It was my childhood and the only thing I had of its age was this movie and I didn't have a copy and was looking to fill that gap. As soon as I opened the book I knew it was the one I was looking For. When I read through the book it was as if I had never read anything remotely similar to it. The story was very funny and had a great message. It is the only book I have ever had as a gift and it remains the only one I have read to my daughter. She knows every word and is excited to see the sequel, even though I will probably be telling her that it's not really about Ariel and Triton. I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes stories with positive messages of friendship and equality. This book made me feel good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the cover of this book. I liked the idea that it's the past that's in the past, so the present doesn't matter.   However, that covers up one of my major problems with this book: the past doesn't seem that different from the present. We're introduced to some of the more important people in the history of this country. And then we see a few of the smaller historical incidents. Most of these are not of any interest in themselves, and I feel like that's the whole point of the book.   to me, the most important events in American history tend to be those that were of interest to me as a person growing up in the United States. So, the events in this book that aren't of interest are the ones that we see more than most other people.  , a character from the book, is one of the people that we meet in the book and that we don't get to know much about. She has a very minor role to play in the story and is essentially the only person that we learn about during the book's time frame. She doesn't play much of a role in the bigger historical events and that makes me feel as though I'm missing out on something.  The rest of the characters are just there to fill in some of these background characters and it's really hard to tell what the big historical players were thinking, how they felt about the world in which they were living. And, the story of the story is really only concerned with one group in America: The Mormons. They're the main focus and the one story line that I kept thinking was missing.   "It's like it's all just a big bad coincidence," the story seems to be saying. "The Mormon Church was here first. There are things going on in the US that are connected to them. But it's not the Mormons' fault."   The author seems to think that the way that the country is governed at the time is just a coincidence that the Mormons happened to be the first to pop up. He makes it seem like every nation is being ruled by a big evil force out to take over the world. But this isn't really true, at least not to the extent that it is being portrayed in this story. And as much as I love the idea of the Mormons, they do not seem to be anything of any significance to the bigger world events that we're told about.  : "I'm just
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a very bad premise and the author does not do much to make it seem like a bad idea.  If you are looking for a good, fun book that's fun to read about a bunch of boys trying to get girls, this is not the book for you.  This book could have been so much more!  I think the best part of the book was the art.  The design of the town, the characters and the art are all perfect.   So, now that I have finally had time to read this book I have one question.    Why did the author start a series in an entirely different setting of an alternate dimension that is more dangerous than the one he just moved to?  Would it have been better to start a new series from the beginning, with a new setting, with the same set of characters and with a completely new, different and exciting premise?
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! So, let me say I LOVED this book, I mean really loved it. I've been reading and reviewing for a while now, and I've reviewed quite a few books, but this one was the first one I got into, and the very first book that I finished. And the last book that i've read that made me go "I got a free book! I got a book!" And then a year and half later i'll get another free book, and then another book. And then another.   First of all, it's hard to explain to someone just what i loved about this book. I had read many books in the fantasy genre, most recently, 'Thrilling Adventure Stories' by Joanne Harris, but I always felt that it wasn't the same, that it didn't resonate with me as much as the other books. But this book was different. This book, this book is just so fantastic, I felt like the author was pulling my heartstrings, literally. I could feel it in my chest, I could tell that the author wanted me to love this book and I love it now. This was such an original story, the story of a child whose life has been turned upside down by her parents, and she has to figure out what the hell has happened to her. The story is really compelling. This is also a very young child, in my opinion, as I don't think that a child would be able to fully understand everything that's happened to him/her. And you can imagine the challenges this young child has to overcome. And also the characters, they're so unique, so interesting and interesting, the family dynamic is just amazing. The whole book, the characters are very relatable, and they really resonate with everyone who read it, even though the story is very tragic. This whole book was amazing.   the plot was really great, very well done. The character development was fantastic, this is such an important thing to me, when I write a book, it has to have character development, because a lot of people want to know about the characters and how they are going to change and how things are going. And that was the case in this book too. I loved all the characters. They all had their own unique personalities.  , there is so much to say about this story, but the best thing I can do is say this. This series is so original, so beautiful, so amazing and
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ ___________ I loved this book but I hated the format of it. It was very long, and I have a hard time keeping straight how many chapters there are or when they start. I really had to flip back and forth to keep up. I also found the spelling very confusing. I've read a couple of those, and this one was even worse. Also, I didn't like how the author used a lot of personal details that I don't really want to know. This was my first review and I'm really new to this forum. I hope to get more feedback on my review so I can improve. Thank you for reading,  J.K.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________ This book is no longer for sale as of August 2017. It took me so long to finish this book, and I'm really sad to say that the story was very bad. The only good part is that the book contains the story about the little boy who had a tumor in his throat. That is the only thing that I like about the book. There are several things about the author that don't seem to be so good, like her writing style is very childish, she doesn't care about details, or even the story. I wish that I have not read this book. _________________________ (review of free book)  Review by: M. K. Lee on Aug. 16, 2013 :  I received this as a free review copy as a gift for my boyfriend who reads the site, and this really sucked. I mean, it was really bad, and just made me want to never read this author again. It was almost impossible to understand how the author got into a medical school. (I'm a medical student and am currently in medical school.) I mean... she's in this book? Really? I feel like it could have been better if it had just had a good main character and less cliches. I could tell that there was some writing talent in there, but then she just decided to use it all for something that was not believable. So... I just really didn't like this book at all. (But I'm a happy person after giving this book to my boyfriend.) I'm not sure what was wrong with her. I really do hope that she is not in a medical training program now, or else I don't think I would be so keen to read anything she wrote, as it would have been too painful reading about how she was getting into medical school without the help of the good readers out there like me. Maybe she would like it if we told her how many of us are in medical training programs and how many people have to go through this awful experience. (If you don't believe me... read a medical journal.) Thanks for the review and for your feedback! M.K.  (review offree book)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. The books are very well written. I even had a "special" edition of the first book that I received as a birthday present from my mom and I read the first chapter over and over and liked the book so much that I bought the rest of the series. (It was probably the last thing on my mind when I went to pick up this book!) Anyway, I read through the entire series, so I knew what to expect and what to look for. I was expecting the book to be great because of the hype, but I was SO wrong! This book is absolutely terrible. The main characters are such a mess, the plot is so...weird. I'm sure Harry will get better, but the way this book has gone so far, I have to say that I'm disappointed in him. I'll have to read through several more books to get my opinion of it all. I had to stop reading about half way through the book because it was getting worse and worse. And it still isn't over! The story has been completely twisted and twisted! I didn't realize how much this book had become the story of Harry and Ginny, but it was hard for me to imagine that they were in the same place as the characters in the books were in. It seems like Harry is being controlled and Ginny has gone from being Harry's friend and a good friend to a crazy person who is really into her magic. And I have no idea who else is involved, but we've learned the wrong people! There are so many different characters in this book, I don't know who to focus on, and the only person I'm really interested in is Harry! I'm actually starting to feel bad for Harry! It seems that he's in so much trouble and it's just so confusing and painful to read! I'd give this book a 6 or a 7, but after reading it all I can't say. But I don in my opinion, it was way too short. And after all of that, the book is over and there isn't really anything else I can do with this book other than throw it away!  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~~ I'm just saying. I don't like this book at all. It's all about how it sucks that one guy had sex with the other guy's wife and it's all bad and I hate it. I hate all this crap about how they love and have to hate each other and stuff. I wish that we just got back together and did what I wanted to do with her. I was so ready for it. That was a bad ending for the book.  Read it if you are interested: ~~~~~~~~~ If you want to know how I felt about this book: I did not like it at all!!!  I got the book from a book store in Seattle and I read it on my flight to Seattle. It was one of those books where you get hooked to it and keep going to the back to read the back of it. It also looks like it will be an easy read. I'm a big reader who doesn't even have time to read books to finish a book. I had to finish this book in two days.   I thought the author's goal in writing this book was to make the male character feel terrible about the woman. He had sex but it was just a fling that didn't really last. This makes the woman feel less of a person because she didn't get what she wanted and she's made to feel guilty about it.  , so she's just a slut for the man and a terrible person for cheating on her husband. I did get what he was trying to say though and it was a very good read. This is a book to read for those that don't want to spend 30 minutes thinking about why the men don't love the women but they have to deal with them all the time and it really makes you think and be aware. This book was written in the 1950's or so and it does still have a very similar feel today. I also found it interesting that he said he got the idea for the whole story from a guy that he knew who was in an airplane accident. I hope he never does it again. He did have it in his head for a while and decided to write it about it because he did not want it to be over.   the story was very interesting and the way it was written made it really interesting for me. It wasn't one of the most interesting books I've read, but I think I liked it just as much as I did if not more.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ was boring, repetitive and boring, i dont like when the author does not do research to get the information to write a book, when i have to go to google to get more information, and when they dont do any research at all its a complete waste of the author's time, i would like to know who the author is but i guess if i dont read the book i can never find out. - April 6, 2015I don't like it!
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   I bought this for a book exchange with a friend, but I never got around to reading it. A lot of the reviews are terrible, but as the title says, not all of them are true. I'll try to summarize. I read through a couple chapters and decided to read the next one, the one about how to play the flute. This time I was really looking forward to it. I decided to give it a shot because I thought maybe it would be helpful to learn to play a flute, or it would at least show me what I was missing. After the first three minutes of flute playing, I started to get angry. I had just spent $25 on a book about learning the flagellant lute. I couldn't believe what I had gotten myself into. I got to the last chapter, and I had already read a couple of chapters about learning how to use a harmonica. Then, there was a chapter about learning about guitar techniques, and it seemed that the writer wasn't familiar with guitar at all. Then there was the chapter about making the most of a flutist's skills and how to apply them to playing a flugelhorn. All of these things could have been written well about playing a trumpet. Then I heard about the song "Waltz For Venus" on YouTube, and thought wow, if I can learn this, I can play Waltz for Venus. This was the best part, it was the first time I ever heard of the song. I have heard it a couple times, but didn't know that it was about a fluke flute player. The guy in the video actually played Waltz For Mars in this recording.   As I've gotten more into flute music, I've become more and more interested in teaching myself how to learn the music. I like to think that if I was in a position to teach someone else to play flute or flugetting, I would, and hopefully they would be as much fun to play as I have been. I don't believe that every flutelinger has to be an expert, or that every book written about flute is worthless. If you have the time, I suggest getting to know some people who play flutes. There is so much information out there, that I think it is worth exploring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book after hearing about it from another reviewer. It is nothing like the novel.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read the book on Kindle. It was a pretty good read with a good plot and characters. I have been interested in the series since I was young, but when I got to this book I found it disappointing because I just did not care. I think I am a person that is more forgiving and I like to be entertained. I was really looking forward to the sequels, but I am disappointed that the author did not live up to the expectations I had for him or her. If they do not live that up then it's time to move on. - June 29, 2012a pretty good book but a disappointment  Reviewer: josephine - favorite favorite favorite - May 16, 2012  Subject: No character development This is another book that has good plot, good characters, good story and a pretty cool idea but I would have much preferred if there was a bit more development to the characters (or at least a bit better description) and if the story had a little bit more twists and turns. It's not so much that this is a bad series (though that could be a problem) but if I have to put it up against the other series that has similar plots, style and style of storytelling, this one would not do.  For example, I thought it would be interesting to know what happened in the time that the girl was a baby and then when she was about three months old. But no, it never came up and it made no difference. The same goes for the guy, I found that when he was a teenager and he was doing his job on a team of guys that he was supposed to be on, he was just playing around and getting into stupid fights with them so I didn't really care about him and the relationship was really just a plot device that got tossed around a lot.  it's an interesting idea and it was interesting reading about the other side of the story (I guess) but I think there is no character development at all in this book and I don't think this was necessary. I know that some people may like this and some people won't but I just felt that there was no character growth in this story. - May 15, 2012No character development  Reviewed by: A reader from United States. - April 28, 2012I have read and am rating this book as five stars. This is definitely a book for the ages, and the story is quite gripping. It had a great beginning.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first part of this book is bad, but the rest is so-so. First part, I had high hopes because it's a historical novel and a very enjoyable one. But the author failed to deliver and it is completely forgettable.  It's about a young princess from some old, traditional family. She goes to an exclusive school and lives in a palace. But there are still plenty of strange things going on around her. She can barely cope and tries to fit into a new school, while she doesn't know if the new place is even real or if she will get into another problem. She is bored and thinks of doing something to make life more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a great book to read as an adult. I enjoyed it. However, there are several problems that I found and these all came up in the second half of the book. I've heard of books that have been made into movies but this one did not. I really would have liked to have seen a movie made of this book. The only thing I do recommend for adults is to read the book and watch the movie. The book is well done, but it is so hard to watch. This movie is a bit better though. There are a few things that are too hard to say as a movie viewer that I will say in the book or on my blog. The movie is just too hard for me to sit through, but I still think it is a very good movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book, despite what the title says, is not about a zombie apocalypse, it's about the fallout of a nuclear explosion.  There is a lot of discussion of the consequences of nuclear weapons, but that isn't the focus of the book.   The problem with this book is that the author takes too much credit for the story, but he does say the story was inspired by his uncle's experiences when his family moved from a small town in New England to the big city of Seattle. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- * I was skeptical. It seemed like a very expensive product...but it turned out to be a total waste. I really do not understand the reasoning behind getting these books... * First, the price is too high for the amount you get. I feel they have ripped me off! * The quality of the printing was very bad. I'm not sure if I should use the quality or not...but I have a very bad back, and I had to get a second printer, who said the quality is not as good as it looked. I was disappointed that the book I got was so bad, because I bought the $49 one. * The book did not come with any kind of instruction manual. I do not know where I got it. * All the material was printed with very thin layers of ink, and that is extremely difficult to read in my opinion. It is very difficult to get anything out of it, and it was very hard to find the information I needed. * I think this is the first book I've ever bought with my own money that didn't help me to the fullest. It was not only hard to use, but it was hard to understand. This is the main reason I gave the book a 2/5. * * *
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not expecting much from this book, but the author was not able to show me a book worthy of such a high rating.  It was boring, confusing, too long, and too much about the details of a few people (the main character's mom and dad) which don't have much to do with the main plot of the book.  Posted by Joanna at 10:07 AM A novel of a very interesting and well-written novel and, surprisingly, no reviews at all about it. So I was pretty pleased to find this site. So, I read it and was not even remotely surprised by it. The story was told rather fast and the characters were not developed very much. I do think the author should have added more details and that she should have made the plot more interesting. But this isn't so bad because the characters are very interesting.    Also, the book was very fast paced. I loved it!  I was a bit disappointed that it had very little to do on the story. The book is not as well-developed as I expected, but it's still good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________This book sucks! I really wanted to love this book, but I just could not, and I really tried to like it. It made me want to do the "right" thing, but it didn't. It's like some kind of drug. It felt good for like one night, but not long enough for me to feel like it's a good idea to be a good person. My favorite character in this book is the woman. I loved her. She is not a slut. I think she's kind of crazy, which I could agree with. But it's the idea that she would be like that in all things. I feel like that is an important idea in life. If you're not trying to make the world a better place. I can't really think of a way to interpret that story. And I don't even like that woman at all. If she's a slut, then she's no good at all!I really hated the "I need money" thing that the character says in the end. I'm going to have to read a lot more books by this author before I trust her. I hate when the author doesn't think of her characters. But hey, what I said. And the fact that she had to do it with a child in a hotel is too much. The ending is just really awful.It's okay. It wasn't horrible. I liked that she went to college, I liked the idea of going to college. But I just hate that she has to do that. Why don't we just give our kids money? The parents are doing a really good job of that. I just don't understand it. I don 't get it.I can't find anything to like in this story. I read this book in like 2 days, and it left a really bad aftertaste in my mouth. I really didn't want to read this. I hated it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- --------------- *I hate how there are so many different sub genres of erotica - you can't really tell what the author is trying to do. Sometimes, he goes off on a tangent that I don't care about. *It's an interesting concept, but I think the sex scene would be more realistic and "realistic" if they had some kind of sex scene scene in between the two chapters that were supposed to be about a typical couple. *Some of the characters seem way too young and I wonder how the author could possibly know that someone as young as them is capable of reading. *Overall, I feel that the story could have been written much better. The book is about a couple who have sex and they have a baby in the middle of the story. I can't believe that this would ever work - I hate that it's not more realistic. *There's only so much time to be spent on "plot" and I feel the author should focus more on characters and not on this crazy "sex" plot. *The author seems to hate how some other authors have done sub genres in books - I hope this isn't the case with this author. -------------------------

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love the premise of the story. Very well written. One point i would like to make is that there is alot of repetition. I am a fan of urban fantasy and the writing style used in this book made me go read more of it. But it did not help me in the end. I found the story repetitive. I would say this story would be great for a childrens book. But i would recommend it for an adults only.

This is the second book in the series and it is really hard to get anything out of it. *The character is not well thought out and there is nothing exciting about them. *I cannot believe that the author is so incompetent and so unprofessional *They have so many plots, some are interesting and some are just boring. *Most of the characters are so weak that I can't get anything from them and when I do I find it to be really stupid *There are many times where the author does not realize what he is writing and he makes all the wrong decisions. *There were a lot of spelling mistakes in the book and the plot seemed to be lost a lot, but it was not enough to ruin the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________   So, the first and last paragraphs. These two paragraphs, in one single sentence, have made me cry in three different places.   The narrator. So I was reading this book in the first sentence, and I remember thinking that this was the narrator. As if she was trying to get into the character. The thing is, she's so very, very bad. It's bad. She's so bad, I have to say, that if I had written a book and had a terrible narrator, and then I had to put in the character who is going to cry and who is sad and who feels sorry for herself because of all of this, I'd just throw it away because I don't want to feel bad about the book. You know what? This was worse. She wasn't even trying to portray emotion. She was just trying to tell you about a character. That character was so, so bad. I'm not even sure why she even bothered.   at all.   The story: this is the same thing that happened in the book and this was a good story. The same thing. The person is depressed and they think they are going to be alone forever. Well, they don't, the narrator brings them into her home. So they are still in the house and they are now dealing with the fact that they are depressed and the narrator is constantly trying to cheer them up. And she is also constantly saying that she has no right to be here. And of course, the house is really really bad. And I don´t know why, but she doesn´t like it very much. And there is so many problems with the house, and she doesn't really like the people who work there, either. So she doesn`t like the place very much, which she didn't say at all in the story.  , she´s very mean. And also, there is a man, a man who thinks he is in love with her, and he starts asking her for everything. So the story was actually pretty good but there was no way to care. The narrator never showed any emotion. The story never moved in a good way.  So now I´m finished this book. I hated it. And then I remembered that I really liked the book, so I gave it a second chance. But this time I didn't hate it, I really didn't. I still don't like it but I don`t

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- [In this case the book was the actual book. This is the description that was on the back of the book] "The world is flat, it's all the same ground. And it looks just the same to me." This book was so frustrating for me because it was a good idea but I couldn't get past the last page. I had read the description several times and each time I would think I would get it but in the end there would be more words to explain what was happening. I could relate to the story and I thought it was funny, but it's one of those books that had to have been better the first time I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________ I read this book in May 2009 and it just fell apart in my hands. The writing style, the language, and the story were awful. It was all very cheesy and boring. The characters were almost entirely static and had no personality. The plot had absolutely no motivation and did absolutely nothing. It went on so long that I could have sworn I read it for the first time a year ago but it was different and a different story. I just felt so betrayed. It took me four days to get through it. The ending just wasn't believable and I hated the characters more than anything else.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed this book. The author gives a detailed overview of the history and science of genetics as well as genetic engineering. He is also very precise and has a lot of information to back it up. However, he doesn't get the scientific details very right. For example, the author doesn't seem to understand the difference between the gene and the chromosome (i.e. the DNA or the genetic material). I thought he got the genetic basis of homosexuality quite right but I would have liked to see more detail on the topic. My biggest gripe about the book is the section where he discusses the use of the HGP to help cure homosexuality (the section begins after chapter 5) and discusses it in a negative light. The chapter in question focuses on the HGT of a single gene, the one that causes male homosexuality and it is in the context of gene editing, but the authors also seem to believe that these technologies will lead to "genetically-engineered" animals. There is no mention of the ethical concerns or the negative consequences of this kind of research, which the authors believe will be beneficial to humanity.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************************** I think that when you first get a book like this, the reviews are going to be bad. I mean, if I were to do the same things, you know. But, the things I have seen in this book are so different from the reviews. And, I know you say that there's always a new idea, but, I don't think so. This is just a rehash of the basic concepts, but with different characters, in a very different setting. I did not like that it was so much like it was when I first read it. I would have liked to see it be more original, because the idea of the old girl trying to get away from her horrible past is one I know all too well. I was also disappointed that there was no explanation of the "power" that she possessed that made her so powerful, to begin with. But even though I was not very impressed with the book, it is still a good one. It would be a good read for a book club. I'll give it 3 stars instead of 4, because I like this story, and it isn't a rehashing of everything else out there.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I am rating this book a 3.5 out of 5. I'm going to go through the book as I review it.   First of all, the first chapter is a major let down and the only one in the book that is actually interesting or anything special. It is about a girl named Jenny who is a student in a class and is going to have a terrible time at school. The problem is she gets into trouble and is arrested. While there she runs into a woman named Kate who turns out to be a demon who can turn anyone into food. Now in her first year at school she's the most popular person and in the entire school. Her parents are divorced so they are the only parents she has. Kate makes the worst food possible and Jenny eats it. Kate has Jenny put in her room for a week but Jenny doesn't listen to it and goes to school in a different school. Jenny does pretty much anything Kate asks and she can't get out of it. The only time she does is when she is a new transfer student and wants to find a different place to live but Kate doesn't let her. I don't know how the writer could have ever thought this was going to make a good story but apparently the book is about how Jenny got arrested. This isn't a bad thing, of course Jenny and Kate have their bad moments and this is no different but this is the first part of the book.   and the bad parts: 1. the story: Jenny is a teenage girl and a demon. She runs into people in the school who aren't like her but she doesn't like them because they don't seem to care about her or her problems. The girls in her class all have problems in life and they don the problems she has because they are not normal and Jenny doesn`t want them to change. It seems so out of place that Jenny is always in trouble with her school and the other students but she does have some normal friends. It's annoying that when the book was first starting people thought that Jenny was a nice girl who would be happy. Now that we get to the end of the story, it seems that everyone is against her because she has done bad things. It`s not an interesting story at all. The author can`t seem to find the right way to tell a story that is not about good or bad characters. 2. the book's pacing: The book is so rushed in that I don`t think
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------  The only redeeming quality of this book is that it is the first book of the series I've ever read. But I've read a lot of horror, and even if this was as good as it was advertised to be, the writing is still a complete trainwreck. The characters are flat and the setting is so confusing it is ridiculous. The book was well written and entertaining, but I'm glad I'm not the only one to have read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would not recommend this book at all. This book does not teach anyone how to teach a dog. I have tried many different courses from many different organizations. I found no one who could teach me how to train a dog better than Dr. Parnes. His methods are not for everyone. They are for the people who want to learn how to do it. It is hard work and requires time and commitment. If you want to read a great book about training a dog, I would recommend The Magic of Dog Training. It teaches you the skills that you need to get started. You do not need to buy it! It is very well written and easy to understand. It's a must read!
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________The entire point of this book is to argue that the Bible does not contradict itself and it does not tell us what to believe. This book does not address issues such as miracles, the virgin birth, creation, etc. (I found no evidence that these issues even exist in the Hebrew language at all.) However, what it does address are the historical details of how it was all translated, how many of the various translations have evolved and how many have simply simply been "made up" as the translators saw fit. For example, there is no actual evidence to support the fact that all the books of the New Testament are in fact the same book, since the word "books" in that translation was not a "thing" in any way. So, there was no way to simply use the original Greek word "book" in these translations and get the meaning of it. As to the other stories: most of the accounts of events in the Gospels are nothing more than what is recorded in the Synoptic gospels and the book of Acts (and it is only through the latter that you have an idea of just how much of the original story was added by the author of the Gospel of John and how much was added to it by various churches as they came to understand each other). Of course, this is why the first book of the Bible, Exodus, was so much more important than the others. In the first chapter, we see God using fire to turn the waters of the Red Sea to wine. In chapters 2 and 3, the story of Moses is written. In chapter 4, we hear the story from God's perspective about the Exodus. In 5, we get the story as told by the people, and we are then able to get a closer look at what God was trying to do. In 6, we learn from the people about how God fulfilled the Exodus and the destruction of the Egyptian armies. In 7, we again learn from Moses' perspective. In 8, the Book of Job (part 2 of 4) begins. In 9, we are told the story about the creation of the earth. In 10, we meet God's wife, Eve. In 11, God's son, Noah is born. In 12, God meets the sons of Job. In 13, the flood story begins. This whole book is a history lesson about how the Hebrew Bible evolved over time and that each of the four books are simply stories written down by various people to
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think that this book was so bad that I will not be reading more of these books.  It's bad as in, it's bad.   And no one can really blame the publisher.  It's bad to be an author, bad to try to be a good author and bad to expect other authors to do what they do.  (I have been in that position as a reviewer for over 40 books.)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an absolute disaster and I do not recommend it. The writing style is poor and poorly planned. The protagonist is a self-righteous zealot and completely unrealistic. This book contains many contradictions and is full of blatant lies that are meant to make its readers feel sorry for the book's anti-religious protagonist. The author does not have a good grasp of psychology. There are too many people in the book who are not the main characters that are merely a part of the world. All the problems have a religious origin. There is no logical explanation for anything. For example, the narrator states that a woman's breast is like a flower or a woman is like the moon or god. There should be more logic to how things work. There really is no motivation for the characters in the story except for the author's personal views. Even if a story is about the conflict between religion and science, a good writer should have a better grasp of the science involved, rather than making things up as they go along. For me, this book is a complete waste of time and would not have been worth my time. I will only recommend this book if someone can find a better one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I felt that this book was a very poor read. I thought the story was poor, the author tried to fit a lot of stuff into a short time frame and failed. It's almost like this was a quickie in the author's mind and was so good they could not think of a good ending and rushed the ending a bit. It was just confusing at times. I found it easy to get into and enjoy. I'd like to see a different author come out with a story like this. The first few chapters I wasn't interested in. I felt this author was not trying to write a good fantasy story, just a story that could sell well on a quick turnaround. I just wanted a plot to follow. It felt like an old school fantasy novel written by someone with a big name. But it was too hard to find the point. The story started slow and seemed to be trying to do too much. I got frustrated. I was looking forward to getting to the point, but then it just continued on and on. It just kept getting worse and worse. The final chapters I read felt like they had no story at all. Nothing. No characters. I couldn't care. The author just had too much going on and I'm so tired. I don't think this book had a good story to it. Maybe some people will enjoy it, but I would have rather just read a different story. Other than the story, there were a few other things that were just a waste of my time. I understand why this book would sell well. It has a good concept and the cover is pretty cool. I guess if I didn't know better I would think I was in an old time fantasy novel. But there were so many things wrong with the story. I can't even count the things that I felt weren't good enough to justify this book. If you want an old style fantasy novel you can find one. But this book wasn't even that good. 7 of 8 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- "This is a bad read. There are only so many ways a book can be written. If you think this book is bad, you're either very spoiled for choice or have absolutely no concept of what a book is. It is an easy read and if you can stand the fact that this book was written by a guy who is no longer relevant, I'd say go ahead and buy it. I've heard that it is supposed to be more funny than grim but I wasn't able to laugh much at the book. It's a waste of my time. "
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________  A man had taken his two year old daughter to a place called The Children's Museum. After a few minutes they were told it was all a dream. The parents left. They never heard from their daughter again. Years later the little girl (whom they don't know is now a young adult) tells them about the place and gives a description of what it looked like. They go there and they are told that she was a "fairy tale girl" that they made up to keep the child from crying. They take the girl home and she has no memory of the trip. Years after this they finally do get some answers. They look at her photographs and notice that all the photographs are of her from the children's museum. They ask her where the photographs were taken. She says she didn't remember. She goes on to describe the little people who were her friends and the place they went. The children's tour guide and the director are amazed at the fact that she knew so much about the children. They both agree that she must be from the Children's Ministry and the photos must be authentic. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  My daughter was just 5 years old at the time. The Childrens Museum of Los Angeles was located on the corner of Grand and Hill. She would often go there on her own and just sit in one of the glass cases and just look around. One day, one of her teachers took her and two other kids to the front of the museum to show us a show that the children had been invited to. We were so excited and didn't realize that they were going to have a talk about what the Childrens' Museum was all about. After the talk, we went back to our seats and when we went to go back in, my daughter was crying and was crying hard. She said something like "Oh man...I'm so sad, I didn't want to go to the childrens museum but I did!" and the teacher had a real look of anger on her face. I couldn't stop crying. She was in tears.  ______________________________________________________________________________________________________  I was taken to the Children Museum of Southern California on a whim and it was the best experience of my life. I was very little, 5 or 6 at the most. It was a summer day so I wanted to go so badly. I walked in the door and they were giving away tickets to the show that night at 7pm. I remember not
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________ This is the first time I ever bought this book. I was not a big fan of the series so I was hoping to at least enjoy the stories of the characters that I enjoyed the most. I love the original series, but I am just too tired of reading about all the same things over and over again. I am sad to say I did not enjoy this book in any way. It was the same crap over and again. Some of the stories I already knew but that just gave me a headache and was more annoying. I guess I can't really complain that much since I bought it for the stories that I like and I got nothing from it. The characters were just annoying. The dialogue was cheesy and unnecessary and I would have hated them for it. So far, I am done reading this.   This book reminded me so much of books I read in high school like A Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, etc. I just did not think that the authors had the guts to tackle a series that has been around for so long with different characters and characters who had different motives and ideas. I thought that they just wanted to stick with the old formula and hope that I would enjoy it so that they can sell more copies.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ - I'm a little bit on the fence about this book... I've read several other books about self-publishing (and have some experience with self-published books as well) and while they were interesting, they weren't as engaging as this one. I didn't mind the premise, but I wish that the actual writing was as interesting as the research. I'm not the biggest fan of academic authors, but the book seemed to me to be too dry to really be engaging. Also, I feel like I would have been bored a lot more if it was set in the late 50s.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I loved this book. I thought it was fun and original. I liked how the girl who is the narrator was very flirty and how she was in high school and not a grown up and how the guy had to have a friend in college. I don't really know a lot about the book, but I enjoyed it. The only problem I have is that it started out really fast and seemed to go into an annoying pattern. It was just boring to read. I have my own theories on why this happened but I'm not going to go in and tell you. --------------------------

Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************************* I am rating this book 1 star because it is a "memoir" and not an autobiography. It was written in 1984 and includes the recollections of several famous people as well as an insight on what it was like in those times to live in a war zone (I live in Canada and I think this is one of the most accurate and insightful views on the First world War). There is no reason for a person who has never experienced war to read it. I do not consider myself to be one of those who have been in combat. I would rather be in a non-combat situation, in my case living in a city in a suburb of Toronto. I am not a soldier or a fighter. I have no desire to be, but I have seen things that no living person will ever know. I thought the book was very interesting and I do wish it had been more realistic, but as I have said I did not have the full experience and do not feel that I can give it a high rating for authenticity. It is an interesting read but I doubt that anyone will want to have a look at it. 1/5

We were the smoke and the light, and nothing could touch us. But we were wrong. We were wrong to think that this was the right way to live. So we grew old, we died, we became what we hated.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I have been using this book for many years. I have had many friends and co-workers read it. It's a well written, well researched, non fiction book that explains the causes of the "bad seeds" that spread and have been ruining our country. The best part of it was the author's analysis on how the world has changed and how America needs to change too. Unfortunately, the book went on to explain that the USA is the last place in the world that should be spending money on foreign aid. I was stunned to hear the author say that, but the fact is, that the United States is currently spending a quarter of a billion dollars a year, but isn't doing a thing about it. If it was my country that needed help, I'm sure I'd want my money to go to helping my fellow man. I don't see how we as Americans can be so ignorant as to think that our problems are so easily solved. Maybe if the world knew how much money the US is throwing around, we would see some action. We are spending a trillion dollars a month on our own defense (defense that's getting a bad reputation). We are not investing in education, health care, or even the environment. If we want to save our country, we have to make our government look like a responsible organization. Instead, it looks like someone who is just out for themselves. The author also discussed how the United Nations (the United Nations of the United State) has been hijacked and is nothing more than a "world government." The United Nations has been responsible for every conflict and every war that the US has ever had. In his book, the author has detailed how this "UN" is so powerful and how it is able to change policies on a global level. The US should never allow any country to become a world government, because then we would be ruled by the "international community" (or whatever). This is the biggest problem with the United World Nations. It is controlled by the United "Nations" (which is an oxymoron) in a way that it has no rights or respect as it is a private club. In reality, it's not a private clubs, but a "global government" that is controlled and run by the world's elite. So if we really wanted to free ourselves from the control that "UN," "UN-WTO," and the United Nation's (that's the United National "WO") has over us,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst part about this book is that it is so hard to actually tell the truth about this work, because the reader feels like they are being lied to. This book is not a good book for reading. It is not what it is cracked up to be. It's not a true story. There is too much information that is not true. I felt that this was done for the purpose of entertainment, and I did not feel that this made it a good story. I do not know if the author has a message that was not understood by this book, or if the writer just has a bad grasp of how to write for a young audience.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this was a pretty interesting read, I mean, it was interesting that a game like Pokemon could be so widely popular and popularly accepted. The reason that I was not sold on this is that I found the pacing a bit slow. There was not enough time to build up the characters and story in a way that the actual Pokemon games do. I also didn't like how they portrayed Pokemon as a good or evil, it seemed a bit like there was some sort of hidden agenda at work here. I would have liked a bit more of a battle or pokemon training aspect to it to show how Pokemon is supposed to be portrayed. It was too much about the romance and I felt like the author did a disservice to all the Pokemon fans out there by not being true to the source material.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a poor book and I would rate it below 5 stars. I found the main character's character development very boring and did not appreciate that she was only able to move into the world after her mother's death and not before her father's. I also found it very difficult to care about a woman and how her relationship with her brother affected their relationship. The romance was only one sided and it did not have a strong impact on me. The ending was very unsatisfying to me and left me unsatisfied as well.  "What happened to you?" "You think that because I'm a girl I should have been able to find a man. No. I don't have that privilege and I'm tired of being a damsel in distress. I'm going to be strong enough to be a woman in this world. It's okay that you want to see me as a woman. It makes no difference to me." The author's use of words is beautiful. The main character is an "intelligent woman who has lived through a lot."  This is the perfect blend of literature and mystery.  A story that was extremely well told and left you wanting more. I think this is an author to keep an eye out for.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   I've read the first two books in this series, and I found this to be very boring. Not that I dislike the series, it is one of my favorites. I was just not enjoying this book. The writing is bland, repetitive and even duller. It is just very boring and repetitive. The characters are all very bland, uninteresting and forgettable. I think I liked them the best when they were very young and still in their teens and twenties. I also don't like teenagers very much.   The world building is extremely poor, there are only 2 worlds. They both sound like they were ripped from the pages of a textbook. There is no magic, no magic is needed, magic is forbidden, and no magic will ever make anyone happy. What a boring world that would make!  The main character is called Varys. I do not like him, I just don't. He's stupid, arrogant and full of himself. He seems to be an ideal person in many ways, but is that really true? He is cold, manipulative, and has an evil streak which he is quite proud of. I actually found this book very offensive to women and many other groups. There are no female characters in this book, or any characters for that matter, you don't learn much about either men or women. The only character who seems to have any depth is Vary's mother. I had expected some sort of deep, sympathetic story about her mother, but instead you just get an insult to women, she is so awful to her daughter it's painful to read.   for some reason I always had a very hard time with the character of Lyanna Stark in this whole series. I felt very sorry for her, like she was an object in his world, a pawn in his game. I can't believe he was able to write her as one of the most fascinating characters in the series. No wonder this book is so boring!   This book was a complete waste of time, and that is not a small amount of time. This book is not worth buying, it's not even worth re-reading, it was very badly written.  , November 25, 2011 - November 25"
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- -------------------------- I've given a review on another website, but I must warn everyone that this book is a ripoff of a book by an other author. The same book, with a different title and a similar synopsis, is available on Goodreads and is much better written. There's a reason this book was so successful: it was a well-done work of fiction with solid characters, great pacing, and an excellent story. What really sucked was that the author doesn't do any research on the topic. I don't know how many other authors have had a problem with researching their book, because that's an absolute necessity. That being said, this is a great book that is worth reading. This is what good fiction looks like.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~ It's terrible - don't waste your time with it.~~   Read this book - if you think you can get away with being a moron and having some fun - you'll probably love it. I enjoyed it very much. The humor is fun and it's not so dark. I don't like horror, but it's well done. I will read more about this book.   My only complaint is that there are way too many characters, none of them really had their own story. I had the feeling some of them are just there to make sure the reader is impressed and doesn't want to give the book another chance - like a bunch of extra meat for the book. Overall I liked it.  , October 6, 2013; 1:50 am  Reviewer: james_w_walsh - favorite favorite favorite - October 11, 2013  Subject: Just an honest review I just found this and thought I'd give my two cents on this one. It's good but I've found it far too hard to keep in my head. I think some of the humor could have been a little better in my opinion. I really liked the ending and the mystery.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  In my opinion this is the worst book I have ever read. I cannot say I would ever purchase this book again.  I wish I could give a negative score, but the writing is bad and the characters are terrible.    My book club was made up of mostly young adult readers.  One member did not seem to be as engaged as the others and had an issue with a character that I did not have a problem with.  He was a nice enough guy, but this character annoyed him and he never got it.  The only way to resolve it was to leave the book club.  As a reader myself, the characters don't help me or the story along.  I could not believe how fast the book ended.    I will admit that I wanted the story to go on longer.  But, by the end of the first chapter, there was no need for more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________   I am a reader of both fiction and non-fiction. I bought this book after reading the reviews on Goodreads.   The book was well written and told me what to expect from the series. It is written from the point of view of the male character and the events in the book all happen off-camera.   was a good read, but the ending left me a bit confused as I was confused about why the male POV character was in the bar after the events that took place there and who was the real hero of the story.  ....   What did I like about this book:  - The author managed to include some humor, which is very appreciated and helpful for a horror novel.   in the beginning he uses humor to lighten the mood in a tense situation, however later on in the novel he was really trying to give the story a certain feeling that is very hard to achieve.  but it's not hard, just difficult.  for example the female character was not so pretty to begin with but she got really handsome towards the end of the book. ..   and the overall feel of the novel is very intense and real.   the only problem I had with this book was that I did not understand why the author had decided to switch from male to female POV. This was my first time reading a female character POV book.   to sum it up, this is a good book for a fan of dark fiction.   a very strong read. I'd read this book again!   what did I dislike about this review: -The ending.   and of course, some other issues with the book that I will go into in my next reviews.    __________________   5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am currently reading the book by John F. Kennedy, Jr. entitled, The Kennedys: An Intimate History. The book starts out fairly well and I was impressed at the quality of the research. I did think Kennedy Jr. was using a little bit of a "Hollywood" style to tell his story and his use of his father's death was not accurate. For example, it is well known that JFK Jr. didn't have a copy of the letter that he wrote his father on August 22, 1963, the day of his dad's assassination. However, I did learn something else interesting from this book: the book was written and published while JFK was still alive. This is one of the most interesting revelations. The first Kennedy book, A Time to Heal was published during his time in office. There is a famous scene in that book where the young John and his brother Bobby are shown watching the TV broadcast. The story is that the two boys, now young men, see a news program about the JFK assassination and wonder why no one will ever know how Kennedy was really killed. In the end of the book, the author concludes that there is no such thing as a conspiracy theory. The only way to know the truth is to wait for the final word from Kennedy Jr.'s "final thoughts". I wonder what JFK Jr.'d thought about this. As the book turns toward the end and Kennedy Jr's words become the focal point, there is a noticeable lack of "final thinking" and analysis of the events. We see what JFK Sr. said in 1964 and in the book. The author then goes into how JFK Jr., having gone to Oxford, became an advisor to the British Prime Minister, the Queen and the President of Romania. There are many other interesting tidbits about JFK Jr's past and past work. All the information is presented in a fairly clear and concise way, and there is very little discussion of the details of JFK Jr's work that may not be completely correct. Kennedy Jr' would probably say he was trying to be fair to his father, but he seems to have been influenced by his own fame and that of the Kennedoys and others to a certain extent. He does not seem to have spent the night with his father after his death. He also seems to use a Hollywood style for some of his writings. I had the feeling that if this were his first book that he would have done more research, but it is
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A very good book about the Holocaust in Europe has been edited by a Jewish-American who has, through editing and research, added nothing of value to the book. As a result, he has made it worse. There are so many flaws with this book, that the only solution I can see is to reject the book completely and never look at it again. The Holocaust:   It is a very good, scholarly book which should be available for all to read. Unfortunately, the editors did a poor job in making it better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* The plot is interesting, the characters are interesting. However, the writing is terrible. The characters say stuff like "I'm not very good at this" or "I am so bad at this." And then they change their minds and say things like, "I really am good at that" or, "That was a good move". And then in the last section, they change again. So it is impossible for me to continue reading this book. I am going to give it two stars, just to let people know that there is a good book out there, but not this book!

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I did not enjoy reading this book. I have read numerous books by Mrs. Lott and it seems that most of her books I enjoyed very much. This one I did not. I found the story to be very repetitive, and I did enjoy the fact that a young boy (yes I am a boy too) was a hero. He had been told by the older man to kill his neighbor so that the man could inherit the woman that he had been in love with. The neighbor was in love. So, as a teenager, I had a lot of fun killing the neighbor's wife. When he was 17 he was sent to jail, and when he was 18 he was killed by his own gun. I was confused as to why the woman was not alive when he shot her. I believe there was a small time period that the woman must have been alive for for her to be a widow. But, I digress. The story did not really go anywhere and I was left wanting more." In my humble opinion, this book was poorly written. For the first 45 pages of the book I was absolutely confused as where this story was going. I'm sure I could have finished it by page 40 but it never quite got there. Then at around page 150, I found out that the author had a history of writing about killing women, so I was a little disappointed that this was a very little different book. The author states that when he is in a relationship he likes to fantasize that he is killing women. He also said he was really interested in this woman's story. At this point, the story doesn't get very interesting. He is still telling the story of the woman he killed. At page 180, he states that he was in jail and this woman is now his neighbor. This part I liked because it got a little suspenseful. I don't know that I would call this book creepy, but it was definitely creepy, at least to me. Also, I would like to mention that one of the male characters is an ex-cop. I can understand why he would be interested in his neighbor's story, but there was no reason to bring up his past to the main character. There was also nothing about this woman that was particularly creepy to me, other than she looked similar to another woman he murdered. That is all. A big part of me wanted to hate the book but I just couldn't. If the book had
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so much like the ones that i read before. the stories are good and the characters are cute and interesting but the author tries to give the reader too much information so that it's hard to follow what is going on. so i had to do a lot of figuring out and it was quite confusing. i have a friend who also read this and she said that i was "totally confused" because there was more info then was necessary. the writing was also very bad. it is really hard to put down a book that has that much info.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I liked the first two books very much, but the third was a complete disaster, and if I could only find this book at a library, I would throw it out. I also found some of the comments on this site to be rather negative, but I'll admit that I read through it before I finished it.   It is the first in the "The Mothman Prophecies" series, so it has some things I didn't like, but there are also some things that I thought were very well written, and I liked it a lot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had hoped to find a good novel by Mark Lawrence, as I have always loved his work and have read some of his books. Instead, I found a series of poorly written, repetitive and over the top action books, as well as one about an autistic child and his adventures. As if the other books didn't make it clear enough, the novel is completely devoid of any character development or plot development. The novel is filled with action, combat, danger, rape and murder and there's a certain amount of graphic violence and sex that is absolutely unneeded. It all feels like a chore, not even a particularly creative one. This novel is as over the board as Lawrence's entire oeuvre. I wouldn't recommend it. 2.5/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked it. A little short, but I found it fun. It's a little hard to get into because it is in a language I'm not familiar with, and because there's only a certain amount of text that needs to be said. So I found that to be a little disappointing, but otherwise I enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For years I was looking for the next great epic fantasy to add to my collection. I was a big fan of Terry Brooks' books, and I had some favorite characters and races in those books. So when I was approached about The Black Company and The Dragonbone Chair by C.S. Friedman, I jumped on it. I started the book off at the Black Company HQ. At that time I was reading the Chronicles of Prydain by David Eddings, and wanted to see more of that world. What I liked most about this series:  The world building. This is a book that has a huge amount of history and history. The way the world is laid out is so rich and well thought out. The book begins with the introduction of a new character, and how the character came to be in that position. We see where she came from, and her life. This way, you can follow the story from the beginning of this character, to her introduction to the BlackCompany and what she has been through. The characters are great, both male and female. I love the way the story is told. I'm not a big fantasy reader, but The BlackCompany has a certain feel to it that just feels so right, and the characters feel real. Something that drew me to this series more than any other, is the magic system. The Blackcompany has a magic system that is not only complex, but very easy to use. I also loved the way this magic works, and it really brought the story to life. One thing I did not like about this book: It seems like the author wanted to make The Blackcomers as powerful as possible. I personally don't think that makes sense to me. I've always been a fan of using the strength of one character to do more for others. I don't understand why the author would want to make the most powerful, or just the strongest, character that can do things to other characters that they themselves can't. Another thing that bothered me was the way I felt like some characters, like the Captain, didn't get enough screen time. When I think of the best and most important characters in a book, I think about the ones that have more screen time, or have the best relationships with other characters. In this book, many of the key characters didn't have many moments, or the scenes that really needed to be used to make them a character in the story
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really hoping for something more unique from a fantasy author and what I got was something that wasn't even close.  Overall I don't think I'll be picking up any of these books.  A short story about the origins of the world, The Dragon and the Wolf:  It is a dark and stormy night as the four heroes of the story, Jorin, Tae, Kaelin and Varrick, are riding on the back of a dragon, searching for a precious jewel.  The dragon is so large that they cannot move forward but the rider knows they are not far off from their destination.   Jorin tells Kaelen to go ahead and they begin to travel down the hillside as lightning strikes.  As the darkness begins to overtake them, the three friends begin to argue over who will go forward or who will follow the dragon.   When they finally reach the stone slab that marks the spot where the dragon was slain, Joran tells the others to begin the search.  When they arrive, they find the stone is empty but they find a small ruby engraved with a dragon and the date of their quest.  They continue their search until a voice calls out to them and they see an armored figure with glowing red eyes, who proceeds to explain that the stone and the ruby were brought to the Stone of Tashan and it is his duty to protect them. Now I'm not going to go into the details of the plot as this is not my favorite book by Tolkien and it wasn't my favorite by the late Lord of the Rings author but from a pure enjoyment standpoint this was not my kind of story.  I was left feeling like I had missed a whole lot of the big action scenes by just reading this.  There is a bit of action in the opening scene which is kind of cool, but when Joran and his friends enter the chamber they see nothing, which I would have appreciated if they were more proactive in searching for something.  After the battle with the dragons and the cave they find themselves trapped and the party is reduced to trying to fend off the dragon and its guards.   The main issue I had with this story was the fact that Joran's character was so poorly developed and was basically written as a one dimensional sidekick.  He was a little more complex and actually seemed like a fun character to follow.  It is interesting that this book is written as if Joran
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* This book is about a man who is born with the ability to see visions of people he will die before but he keeps a journal where he keeps the visions for over 70 years and it becomes the cause of a mystery and conspiracy in the end. This book was not only boring, it made my head hurt and my head was pounding. I kept saying to myself I can't understand how I didn't get this sooner. But when i finally got over the pain of it and started reading it i found it had no plot or anything that made sense. Just so many random dreams about people, animals, locations, everything. So in the last paragraph a woman was raped and tortured, and it just made no sense to me that a person could be raped and how a person who was capable of this could be capable of raping someone else. It made me angry and sad all at once. There were just so many little things wrong with it. If I read the whole thing again I would throw it out. There are so many good books about what life was like during the 60's and 70's. Why would you waste your time with this?

It really doesn't do a lot for my enjoyment, I didn  "It's always been the case that women are always on the sidelines, or so it's believed. Women are there as spectators. They're there to cheer men on, cheer up the men who are going to make the big plays, or laugh at the men's mistakes."

"My parents didn't take my sister to the movies until she was ten, when they made her watch the new Harry Potter movie."

The women who are in the stories that are told to us, there's always a man to save the day, even though it's not really a man. There's a man who's always the hero, a man, but he's a helpless victim in need of saving." "And I realized that even when there is a woman, she's a victim. Even when there are women, there are still villains to defeat, a woman to defeat. Women, they're always the villain. I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach. And what about the women in the film who were in it? Did they receive any praise for the fact that they were there? No. No one even mentioned them, they were just kind of left there.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ________. The title of this book is what I expected and more. It's not a book about a character that I would have wanted to meet, but it wasn't terrible. A few things didn't quite add up or make sense and were left open, but I got over it and found the book to be well-written and entertaining. It is a bit long, but not so long that it gets boring, and I enjoyed myself just as much as I did the character.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I bought this book to read on the train to work. The book was good, and I was able to concentrate on the story for a few hours while the train rolled along.   However, the author did not show any interest in making the book interesting for me. The story is written in a straight forward way without much flair or humor. The author never uses the train for any interesting effects, and she never uses any special trains.  The only exception was when it was used to travel to the other side of the world in the last third of the book.  This is a short book, and a good one, but the reader should be given an interesting story to read before they read this one.  A negative is that the author is a little too proud of her success as a writer. She is sure she can write great novels about anyone or anything.  - Summary:  A short, but good short novel written by a Canadian author, written in English. - Recommendation:  This book is well written and good enough to be read on a train ride to work, however, it is not well written enough to merit a longer book or a novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I'm not going to lie here. It's not a great book. I won't say it's bad. I actually enjoy it, even though it's just a few pages long and it's very basic. The writing itself is bad though, and I just couldn't get into it. I read the first 5-10 pages because I really wanted to get to the fun part of the book (or at least the part where the plot and characters were going to change) and the bad writing made me hate everything that came before it. Now, before anyone thinks I am being too harsh on this book, let me clarify a few things first. I like to have things explained to me. I think that's why I enjoyed the first half of this book a bit more. The characters and the plot were pretty bland though. And the fact that the characters were basically just cardboard cutouts made the story all the more flat. The only thing I really cared about were the characters, and it seems I have to have them. It just takes me a long time to like someone. I'm pretty sure this book isn't meant to be read by anyone who likes to read books. It has a lot of plot holes and I don't understand them. You can't tell how or why any of the characters are getting along or doing what they're doing. The fact that they're all such dumb people was just plain annoying. I understand that this was supposed to be a parody of the way this world works, but it just doesn't seem very believable to me, or to anyone who knows more than just the basics of how they work. Also, it's extremely difficult to explain to someone who doesn't have the basic knowledge of the Star Trek universe what "The Nexus" is. You need an understanding of alien cultures and cultures in general, and there really isn't that much of that in this book. Even the characters seem pretty ignorant about the things they're talking about. I guess the problem with this book is that it's a parody, but then it's not really funny, but also not serious at all. It makes me really sad to see all the good books getting cancelled. I hope that they'll continue to make Star Trek books. I still have so many more stories to write. I can't believe they're just stopping. You know, I'll probably read these next ones in the series, or I'll just wait until Star Trek: Voyager airs and I have more
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book when I was in high school and had a lot of fun reading it. I read the beginning and was really excited for the story and the characters. But then the story took a turn for the worse. The main character started to become the main character, as he kept saying that he had to make things work out with his ex-wife who was the main reason why he didn't get into college. So he was always working out his frustrations with her. But it was always a trap because there was always some thing he had been unable to do because she would stop him. I was frustrated with the story from the start. So, I ended up tossing this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________   I read this book after it was published and I was interested. I loved the cover art and the cover was interesting. The writing was great and was a lot of fun. I was not satisfied with the book at all. My biggest issue with it was the characters. They all were the exact same and it was all about the same things.   "The world is on the brink of a new dark age, when human societies and life on earth are changing at a faster and faster rate. When the new Dark Age dawns, the very last thing humanity wants is another war."   (The Dark Age was a worldwide nuclear war in the 21st century.)   This book is a fantasy about a group of people who are not at all human. They are from a strange planet, and they have an advanced technology that allows them to go to places they normally could not go. (The people that they are from are also called "Dark" so that's where their name comes from.)   the book basically tells how they are at war with an alien species. It starts out nice and easy until the aliens show up and start making war on the humans. This is a very easy story to follow because it's so easy to understand what is happening. They have an alien race that are just the same as they are. One of the problems is that they start to attack other species because they are using the technology they got from their planet.  The main problem with the author writing this book is that it's a really hard read for me. I would have liked a different style for it. At times it seems like a lot is going on at once and it's hard to follow. Sometimes it's easy because I understand what they are talking about. (It's a different planet.) It's just not that interesting to me.  ....
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was a terrible book. It is not even close to the best of the "dark" series. 4.5 stars "If there's one thing we can all learn from the greats of the genre, it's the importance of the hero being the one true hero of his or her own story."  ― Neil Gaiman 5 stars is a very hard number to reach for in most stories.  It is rare for a book to be this good but I'm going to go ahead and claim that this was the best book in the "Dark" series for me. I know that this review sounds like a bunch of hyperbole but this is a really really good book.    This is a hard book to get right.  You want to know what a good novel is?   You don't want to read a series that doesn't have a sense of place.  There is so much that you can do with a setting, a culture, a history and a cast of characters.  When I read "The Dark" I had a real sense of dread that this might not end up as a book I loved.  I had it in my mind that I had only read one good novel by this author before and that was "The Mirror Empire".  However, this book is so good that I will most likely never have to wait until after "The Blood War" to read another "Darkness" book. I really can't say enough great things about this series.  1.5 Stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I don't recommend this book. The writing style is confusing and at times extremely difficult to follow. The story is repetitive and the writing is choppy at times and even disorganized. The characters are too perfect in their foibles. I was expecting more variety and I got more of a lesson in bad writing."   My review:   This book is so different and different in so many different ways. I read it back in 2009 when it came out and I don't think it has been updated since then. The book takes place in a world where religion, science, and politics are at odds with one another. The main character is a human scientist who works for the Church of the Good People. As a good guy, the scientist believes that they should leave religion behind and learn what scientific fact is to know better about religion. But the Church isn't the only religious group, and they have their own agendas. And then there is the Great Fire, and the Great Flood, and all these other things that happened in these two different world's.   I don´t think I have ever read anything like this before. It is just too different in all of its aspects to be made a good book. I guess it could work, but you have to be very careful with how you write the ending.   The author really seems to have a good understanding of religion and science, so it could be quite difficult to make a book that is about religion and religion and doesn't seem totally off to me, but that is what makes the book so interesting.   the story is about the two factions of religion: the Church and the Good Men of Science. The Church of Good People believe that there is no God, but they are not opposed to religion. They are just interested in their own religion that they believe in. The Good Men are interested in learning about other religions. But there is a problem: the other religions are more powerful and more dangerous than the Church.  , which is the main plot of the book.   a young priest named Marnie (which is a good name for a woman) is trying to get back to the Church by having the Good Man of Science, Michael, help her get back into the Church's good books by helping Marnielle find a cure for a deadly plague.  The two sides seem to be at odds, so the Good man of Science comes across as a little bit of a pushover for Marn
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when I was younger, and I still remember my reaction.  This is really a good book, but my mom read this to me as a kid and I had to remind her that I didn't understand any of the words, but I remember my mom crying when she read it.  If you love The Shining, this is the book for you!  The first half of the book is quite good, and when we see the other half, it is better.  We are shown the world of a family of three that gets trapped in the haunted house with the mother and her two boys.  The story begins with Jack the housekeeper being picked up by a car outside the house and her little boy, Frank, waiting to be picked up from school.  Jack's dad, Bill, is away at work, so Jack's mom, Lillian, and her boyfriend, Billy, take Frank to school.   After lunch the next day, the three of them go to Bill's house to pick up the boys.   The boys have an accident in the woods and end up in a nightmare world, and as they have to figure out what is real and what is the dream, they begin to grow.   When Frank gets hurt in the accident, his parents are distraught, but they find Frank a new pair of shoes in a nearby shoe store.    Frank's father, who was a high school dropout and has been through a lot, decides to take his own life after the accident.  But when Bill dies and we see him again, he has to come back to life.  His wife, Mrs. Vail, and Frank's mom are all distraught over what is going to happen to them.   Billy the younger brother is the only one who comes back to normal, and is able to help his brother and to help the family.   It is quite a tragic and scary story, and it is not the easiest to take in, but the characters are really interesting and are very likable.  I would have loved to see more of the family, especially Billy, as he is the most likable out of the three boys. About the Author:  James L.

If I had to pick a flaw I would say that the characters seemed to have the wrong ideas on how to solve the problem. Maybe the problem was not solved because they didn't have the right information. Or maybe it's just that I didn't enjoy reading about it. The ending was kinda confusing too.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so bummed when I opened the book. I really liked it, but it just didn't go the way I was expecting it to. It was too funny and not well written at all. I don't even really think that's the author's fault, he's very funny, and it seems like it would have gone better, but unfortunately it didn't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just received this book and it is horrible.  In all honesty, it reads like a poor man's copy of "The God Delusion", but with the word "atheist" in the title.   There are no original thoughts here.  What there are are poorly executed sentences, the words sound like they were written by a 3rd grader and there are so many typos that I could not read it.  The story itself is just pathetic and the "scientists" are laughable, I mean how many of you have even heard of a "Scientific Name" for a fruit?    The only thing that made me laugh was when the main character had a stroke and got his brain back together.  How could that happen?  I would recommend this book to a few friends and only get it if you want to laugh at the stupidity of religious people. I'm going to let you in on a little secret here and now.  Science is a very broad subject, so to put the word out there it's not the same thing as just a certain religion.  Religion is a big world out there, and I'm sure there are other religions out there too, like a "Hindu" religion or a "Agnostic" religion.   But you know, it's just another religious sect.  This book is just another example of this.  I'm not an expert in religion, but I think I can find out what it is this book is trying to tell me.  There is not a single religious belief that I believe in.  But it's ok, we can discuss that at the next Bible study.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I love this book but my teenage son has no interest in reading any of the characters' stories and has not read the original graphic novel, so he is just looking through the pages for any info he can find about them.  So this book may not work for him, but the stories are really well done.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------   It is very interesting, but I did not learn anything new from it.   My favorite story was "The Great Escape" by Ernest Hemingway, which is also in this book.  /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\  http://books.google.com/books?id=BVxo5-R_gPEC&pg=PA39&lpg=PT14&dq=%22The%20Great%20Escape%20by%20Ernest%20Hemingway%22&source=bl&ots=l9bkD6rPbI&sig=YV7wBnCx4V3yF1fvUzr2dwK4H4Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DZwX8zOzM_nj-qT8Eb_3CcUAw&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBk#v=onepage&q=%20The%2019%20great%20escape%20%20By%20Es%20Truyter%201938&f=false   And here's a positive review of this book:   "Ernst Trueman (1896-1980) was a remarkable author who was one of the most famous American writers of the 20th century and a great friend of Theodore Roosevelt. He wrote over 100 books, with many more in progress. Trueman is a man who lived on his wits, writing from the depths of his soul."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You don't have to read this.  But, just because you have to don't mean you have no right to criticize it. This book is a terrible waste of time and a massive waste of a novel. I am a terrible reader. The worst of the worst. I am constantly stuck between the book pages, the screen and my head, and the whole time I'm lost and annoyed at my lack of accuracy. I feel like I'm not doing a good job at being a reader. It would be nice if I had some kind of "A-H" scale to judge my skill level in reading (I've never used one). I'm pretty sure if I ever tried to write my own book I'd be a total failure and I'd need to do another one. This book doesn't help me.  If there was ever a novel for me to get through, this is it. If you're like me and you don't care about this world, don't read this novel. You won't like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  " This was my first review of a book that I haven't read, but it seems that a lot of people have already given it a 1 star rating. A lot of the details in the story are not explained very well and the author uses very broad words that really make me uncomfortable. I don't know if she actually knows what she's saying. The only time I understood something was when I found out that my character was married, which was very disappointing. She was supposed to be a virgin, but she was already married at age 17! That was very disturbing to me. I know this book is supposed to a novel, but this is not a good book to read at all. I'm not a fan of stories that have bad endings, but I'm glad that this is a novel with good characters. That being said, the author didn't seem to understand my problem and I really have no idea how she could have done better in my opinion. I would have preferred a story where the main character wasn't a virgin! It was really confusing. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews for this book.  I am totally convinced that this book will be the best thing to happen to me in a very long time.    I don`t know why the reviewers are so negative, but I can answer that myself:   I am writing a review for this because it is the only reason why I am going to keep going on.  It doesn`t matter if I'm doing it for the money or the love of the written word.  The money is the reason why all the reviews are bad, but the love that I feel for this story is what I`m talking about.  It's one thing to say that this story will make you love the written page ( I am guessing that the story will) but it`s a totally different story if you actually do read the book, and that is what makes this book unique.  This is one story where the writing will make the reader feel so much love, and so much pain.  What makes the writing so beautiful is the way that the author made me feel a real pain that I haven't felt since my time as a child.   This story has given me the strength and courage to face all my demons.  I've come to terms with all of them and my only wish is that you will do the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The end of a good book is often a bad beginning, and so is this. The story is good, the writing good, and the characters and their interactions are strong." -  Eli Yudin on a Goodreads review of this book "My first love in a long time...I was surprised at how much I didn't hate the book - just the idea of writing a book with such a large cast of characters and how all of them were like family. I loved it! "I have an idea in my head of what kind of a movie this would be: a romantic love story where all the couples are together and happy but that everyone is trying to find the other person's emotional response. I can picture that happening." - Anna Z. on Goodreads "A heartwarming tale of love and the ups and downs of life...One of the great things about the book is how much it touched me. It's a book that I would love to read over and over. I recommend it to everyone, but especially those in a marriage-with-kids. I read it as a first date. It was magical." - J. A. in the book forum "This book was so well written that you didn't want to put it down and really did want to read it again." - M. L. on her blog "This was such an excellent read! As a newlywed, it helped me to understand and appreciate my husband and the love he has for me...The romance was really a great balance." - A. E. on the bookforum.com "This is a book for you if you are just getting started with your love life...This book will help you see what a gift love is. If you are new to marriage, you may read the story once or twice, but I recommend doing it over and again, in different ways, for different reasons. The book is an extremely well-written one-of-a-kind memoir. It shows the author's journey of discovering love for the first time. It provides a very real glimpse into the life of a newly married couple." - E. G. on a Amazon review. "This book is for those who think they are done with romance, are tired of the same old, same old and just want something new and different." - K. S. on Amazon Review

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!   I don't understand why anyone would buy this book. The writing is so bad that I have to stop and read the chapters aloud to make sense of what is being said. It was painful to listen to, to have to listen for the whole time. The book was so bad, it took me 3 days to finish it.   What a shame, what a shame that this book will be thrown into a trash can and that those who can't do their own research, won't be able to read this book or learn anything from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "a good example of an author trying to write in a world she doesn't really understand."   -  L.K.  Bean The plot is the least original part of this book. It's just the usual "goddess wants to destroy a god in a battle of titans." It does have a nice twist at the end that ties everything together nicely, but that twist is so unoriginal that it was nothing but filler. If you liked  the first two books then this book will probably not change your mind. It may help you out a little in the end, but I can't say it will make it any better.  About the author:  This book was published in 2005.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very good book. I did a reading for the kids and then read it myself, and they enjoyed it! I was going to read it again and give it to them as a fun book. However, I found that it seemed like it was trying to tell you more than it actually is, but was able to do so, so well, that you didn't notice. It was a little long, and I found the ending unsatisfying, but it was definitely worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book by a great author. I would highly recommend this book. It is worth it. The author does not shy away from difficult topics and does not hold back. He gives you the information you need to know to be able to understand what is going on and why things are happening. He does not make this book about himself, he makes this book for you to use as a tool to think about what you need and think about why you have. The first half is just about the beginning of the "Cold War". Then it is into the Cold War and the second half covers the whole of it. A great book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  My favourite part of this book was the title, I got it from the back cover and just had to find out what it meant. This was the book I wanted to read because it has the most "mythology" to it. I got some good ideas and it was a fun read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book, but there was just so much wrong with it that I couldn't. It was a bad read. If the author is interested in improving her work I think she can. She is a good writer and could benefit by taking notes. She needs to focus more on her character development, and then focus on what makes her characters unique, not her background and their thoughts. The plot was very predictable. She tried to write it into the story and then it wasn't successful, which was disappointing.   Other then the character, plot and writing, I don't think there was much else wrong with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the kind of book you read to pass the time. It's just a collection of anecdotes, some interesting, others irrelevant. In terms of storytelling style and prose style, it isn't bad, but it's certainly not a great novel.   What's the point? This is an account of the experiences of a former military officer who served with the German Army in Poland during the Second World War. It was the year after the Polish forces took back the Warsaw Ghetto from the Russians in 1944. The main character is a German soldier and he's the only one who escaped the ghetto and is still alive in today's Poland. In the first part, the war starts and it is a bloody one, but the main character survives the war. It also goes through a long, long peace, until the Russians attack the German forces, after which the story goes to the East, until 1989. In 1988, the protagonist, a former officer, is drafted to fight for the East German Communist government. He doesn't get to fight, he's in prison, but he is eventually released.   I really liked that the story is about a former German soldier, but even more, I loved the idea behind the book. In his memoir, the writer talks about how he feels when he thinks of his experiences. As a child, his father, who died when the man was 5 years old, would say that his "dream" was to go into the army and fight in the German army. He was a bit rebellious, especially in the winter time, when there were cold winters and dark nights. After the war, he was in an army unit in the East. The soldiers were so bad to him that he was often insulted by his fellow soldiers. It is very interesting to read a memoir by an ex-German soldier and not about him fighting in WWII, but about his life from when he was a young boy to the age of 32, when he is released from prison and is drafted into the military. I just thought it was interesting. The story and the style are decent, but I feel like it would have been better if the story was divided into several parts.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really liked this book, until the end. I had a good amount of fun reading it, and I think I liked it for the first 20 or so pages. But then it all just kinda stopped. It started to just go downhill, and no matter how much I tried, it wasn't happening. I just couldn't bring myself to put this book down. At one point I was laughing so hard my eyes were hurting. I felt like I was losing the plot, and it was so very frustrating. I am not sure if this is just me or what, but this book really didn't grab me, and that is something I love about it. So please if you give it a try, try it, I just really wanted to see if it would be as awesome as everyone said it would.   The story:  This book is mostly told in flashback, and the first few chapters are great. I got really excited when I realized who the narrator was and where this character would go. I was also really interested in where she would end up because the book seemed to end with the narrator moving back to America and getting married. After the first half, I became somewhat annoyed at the narrator, and her constant switching back and forth between her two identities, and why she would be so stubborn to just say "hey, it was me, I did it, it's okay" when we are all so familiar with her identity. I know she is telling a story, but I felt that the author should have told her story in more detail. It was such a weird transition to have the narrator suddenly become a child. I don't know if the narrator felt like that would be jarring because I knew that that was her future, but it just seemed really abrupt.   a lot of the stories I enjoyed the most were the ones that had the narrator be a child for a few chapters, and in some of those stories, it seemed like it was the author's choice that the narrator's life be that of a child and not a young adult or adult. The narrator in "The Book of Unwritten Words" seemed to be completely okay with being a child from the start, so I had to wonder why this narrator had such an issue with having a life. I also felt that in the beginning of "The Dreamer's Son," the narrator didn't seem to be having a great time as she was just telling her story, and at the end I felt even less connected to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When the book opens, we see a woman in her mid 20s reading a magazine. The title is on the cover: "What women want in a man". The article talks about all the men who are bad women. The author says that she was drawn to her current relationship, as well as to other women in her past, because they didn't give in to the bad woman image. They were strong, independent, and women who chose their men. They didn't settle for men they felt they could not relate to. This book is about how the woman who got herself into this mess ends up in the wrong kind of relationship and is stuck with the bad man. I found the first 20 pages or so of this book to be confusing and sometimes a little boring. I can't believe I picked this book up because it sounded interesting. This author makes a lot of statements and I can see why so many people like her.   The author talks about her relationship, but I think there were times I felt she was being a little too dramatic, too opinionated, and just kind of giving the wrong impression. She talks about how much she loves her boyfriend, about how he treats her, about him being the "perfect boyfriend", about how she can't stand him being so good to her at work, about her being tired and not being able to get anything done, and how he makes her feel like she's a "superstar" at work. I think she was just a little exaggerated in her descriptions. There are a lot more things in this book that I don't understand. There's a section where she talks about what she likes in men. She says she wants guys who are "successful and well-connected". Then she says how she has some weird expectations for men, like how a "great guy" should always make her laugh and be in the mood to kiss. It seems like the man should be the alpha male. How many times do I have to say this? I just don't agree with her. I don´t even see this guy as a "top" in the relationship. He was too poor for her to even consider paying for him to do a real manly job.   and she wants to date men who have "a strong and healthy respect for women" I don`t see what this "respect" means, other than that she won´t ever give her man a break.   was it too late by then?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "What a bunch of losers!" 4. The Art of Dying -  Richard Bach I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I don't like The Art Of Dying because it is so silly that I'm not sure how much it can affect anyone. But it's still a pretty hilarious book, so it's worth checking out if you can stomach it. I mean I do know that I read a book titled "I Am No Longer Afraid of the Dark" one time too. 5. The Day Of The Jackal -  William S. Burroughs The Day of the Jackal is one of those books I can't even remember the name of. But I've read enough about it to know it was a book I really wanted to read. I read it in a library book and I had to buy the book. It's written in a weird way that makes it difficult for me to even remember where I started or what section it is. It took me ages to get through it though because I thought it was so stupid and so unlike anything else I've ever read. It had a lot of weird stuff, from a man going to heaven and getting in bed with a girl to a group of people in a church getting electrocuted and the author describing how the electrocution made them "hiccupped". You can find out more about the book here. 6. The Naked and the Dead -  Robert Aickman This one is also an important one. Robert A Youngman is one the biggest names in 20th century literature. In his first work, the Naked and The Dead, Aickmans has invented a character called The Mad Monk. Aickmen's book was written in 1936 and became a hit on the publishing market and helped him gain more fame and fame more money. The book was so popular in the 60s that it was made into a movie and later made into TV series in the 90s. Now of course it is famous and well known to many. The author of The Naked And The Dead is still alive and writing books. I wonder why? He could've really done with a little promotion. 7. The Book of Eibon -  Lewis Carroll This is another book I've never read but I feel like I should. A lot of people I know who love Lewis Carroll like the books because they are just so weird and it's easy to pick them out of a crowd
Write a negative review about a bad book:  We just bought the first book in this series. We had read all the other books in the series and enjoyed them. The plot of this book has us guessing which characters we'll meet for a while. We thought it would be very funny to hear the first letter of every word that comes out of our characters mouths. We also thought it was very interesting that we would have to follow each character. When we would see the same scene come up, or when we would hear each characters name we would get a laugh. But after listening to the first few pages, we got bored. So we cancelled the book. We now have a new reading group in place to listen to this book. I am now afraid to read books that start with 'Y'. We will listen to the book when it gets good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have seen more than one book written by a woman about a male character that turned out to be not very sympathetic. The male character who I thought would be very sympathetic ended up being quite the opposite. I have also heard many people who have heard this book who say that it is not true to life. This was not my experience at all.   What did you like best about this story?   This story is very different from many fantasy books I have read. It has a very strong theme and is very well written. This story has been described as a feminist fantasy with a strong and realistic plot. I really enjoyed this story and it did not disappoint. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have enjoyed every one of my books, but this one had several problems. The author gives it a 5 star rating, but I feel it is only based on the first half of the book. I would have given this a 4.5. Also, I liked some parts of the story, but it did not resonate well with me. I also would not recommend this for a first book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is just a poorly-researched book. It is the type of book where I would ask why such a boring subject is taught in science classes. I could not understand how this book is meant to be taught because I think that we should be talking about things that are interesting. But even if the material is interesting, why does this book waste so much time trying to explain it? I was so frustrated by this book, that I decided to buy the second edition and that's how I came across this. I don't know what the authors want to prove, and if they have anything to prove. I'm not sure if they know what they are talking about.   There are some good parts of this book. The authors are actually good with their writing. Some of the things that the professors teach are so wrong, that it makes me laugh. I really appreciate the author talking about the scientific basis for various things that we do and why that might be important. Unfortunately, we don't learn enough about science to be able to teach that. Also, the parts of the book where the authors are teaching something that you can figure out for yourself are not good. For example, the chapter on cancer is one that you have to read because it is the most interesting chapter. But if you're just trying to learn how to read a book and not actually learn something, you won't get a lot out of this chapter. If you're going to read this book to learn about the cancer, then you should have some background. You don't need to be a cancer expert or know a ton about cancer or anything. You should have a basic understanding of what a cancer is and the role that cancer can play in your life. For that reason, you should probably be able and willing to do a little research about what the book is teaching you and what they don't teach you.  .  13 of 17 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was such a disappointment. The premise of it was cool, but it was all wrapped up with an excuse. I'm disappointed that the author, who I have a ton of respect for, has ruined the book by going all "spy on the author". It was obvious from the beginning he was going to go that way, it's just that he didn't tell me until way to late. My favorite character was the one who knew the truth (and was still working for her father), and she was totally ruined in the end. This is one of the most poorly written books I have read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I finished the book in one sitting. The book was boring as **** and I was not impressed with any of the characters. The story was dull and boring. It made me want to throw up. The author does not seem to have any clue how to write a character or a story. The best part of the book was that it took me 5 hours to finish it. It is overkill to read this book. It was so bad. I hated it. I had to stop reading it. My recommendation is avoid.   2 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're not a fan of the style or feel the writing needs work, don't buy this. It's not very well written and is very clunky at times.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book one bit.  It seemed like an anti-science, anti-scientific text.  In a nutshell, the book tells you that  you are not in charge of your own destiny - the environment (climate) is in charge.   There is no mention of evolution, but it's implied.  In a nutshell it shows you all the problems that we are having now in the world, and the only solution is change.  And that changes the whole paradigm.  It shows you the whole problem and how the world has turned out to be and it starts to take you by surprise.  This book isn't written for children, in fact the parents aren't even mentioned.  That alone is a very poor book for my kid, but I suppose that's okay, it's meant for adults only.   I had to re-read this book to make sure it's accurate.  I can't remember why I didn't bother with the whole book, and it really just comes down to my dislike of the author, which isn't a problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________  This book made me really angry. There was a good portion of the book that made me cringe and shake my head. It was filled with stereotypes and was so over the top. I was surprised that the author was making it all about "diversity" and that there would be a "diverse" group of characters. I really thought the author would focus on the real, gritty and real issues of homelessness, racial tensions, domestic violence, etc. The book made a mockery of these issues and made no attempt to show them in a humorous light.  The author was trying to sell the book, and it did not work. In fact, I was disgusted and embarrassed that she would attempt to turn homeless women into a punch line. .
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a book that I bought for my wife and her two children. This book was poorly written, very confusing, and the story was very unrealistic. My wife and the kids had to read the book and have to figure out what the heck was going on. I couldn't get it out of my mind when I read it. The book was a great help in explaining the concept of the book to them, but we still had a hard time following the story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  Not a bad read. It's just one of those things that I wish I had read instead of the book I'm currently reading. I'd have been better off reading something else, or if I had a few hours to kill I would have read the first book, but I didn't. I didn the second book because that's what I've been doing the past few days, but it doesn't feel like it's a good book. It isn't bad and I haven't found it boring, but there is nothing about it I would recommend to anyone except for a very dedicated Harry Potter fan, and that's why I didn  I bought this book off the publisher's website, and it is a great, if not perfect, book. But it's not a novel, and you're supposed to read it as a collection of short stories. I did, for three hours a day. But I have some problems with the stories. First, there are three main characters, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and three stories. When I look at these stories it seems like I'm just reading a collection for the characters. But the three stories are not all that different from one another. There's a big difference between "I was the one that saved the day" and "A couple years later, after a few more years of living together, we got married". But that's the difference between having two stories and having three. But not really. It is still pretty easy to understand, just not as easy as other stories I've read. Harry, the hero of the story, has a few "good" qualities, like being smart and an orphan, and has his faults. He's very brave and can save the day when he needs to, but also makes a lot of bad choices. But he's not too dumb to realize he needs Hermione and Ron, so he does what he's supposed to do even if it isn't a good choice. He learns to accept his good and bad qualities. I think this book would work better if there were more of a balance in the stories between the good things that Harry does and the bad things he does. He knows it's bad to let Voldemort walk in, but at the same time he doesn't want to leave Hermione and her family. It would have been much better if the evil that's inside of him was more apparent and more apparent to Hermione. It still doesn't work that well for me, but that's just

Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------The characters are all very interesting and I really like them all but ---------------It's just an extremely boring story, every single time there is a battle in the book, they say "oh wow it's a real war" but no real battle happens, it's more of a big spectacle where all the characters are doing something. The fight scenes in this book are also really boring as well. The book really made me think about why we are here in the first place and I don't get why the people of this land can't have more freedom to make their own choices. I could go on about this book but I think my review speaks for itself, so if you like war fiction but don't want to have to take my word for it and read the book in the meantime, this one is not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      So i read this book because my english is pretty bad, so this book was pretty easy for me to understand. Now that i think about it, i read through this book at 2 in the morning when i was so tired. There is some good stuff in the book, but it really sucks because there were too many holes and inconsistencies. It makes me feel like i could have been more attentive in my studying.  The thing that bothered me the most about this book is the fact that she said that she had tried to explain the book to her students at school. When you try to explain something complex to someone that doesn't speak the same language, they get confused because the knowledge you have is not what they know, they just see it in the abstract.  is this something that is not uncommon to see in other people's languages, but that's exactly what i feel that this book shows. I have spoken my entire life and never thought that the teacher would be confused about it. I tried explaining this to my teacher (she is actually a native english speaker) and she just replied that it was "different" for her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  My son had a big problem with his favorite book at his preschool.  He loved this book but he would scream and scream and cry when he got down to the very last page.    He finally gave up and just went to the library and bought it, then started to put it back in his backpack and bring it back to his place,   but then he was having a hard time focusing and wanted to read it right away.  So, he went into his classroom and tried to start reading it to the class but had to stop at the very first sentence.  He was upset for a long time.  What can I tell you...I think this book is a great story.  But I would recommend reading this book in a place where the students are more calm and don't have to be screaming and crying for the last few sentences.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~This book was horrible! It was an utter train wreck. It was not written by a good writer, nor did she write like a good person. This book is full of bad things, and very rude words and a bad story to tell. When you start reading this book, you should not expect it to be good. I feel like this book is meant to be a book for teenagers who do not know about the world and are very ignorant. They will read this book thinking it is just about a group of teenagers on a camping trip. When the group becomes involved in a car wreck, they will think this is just an adventure they had in the woods. They are in the wrong place, it was a horrible book with awful writing and the story did not make sense. It does not make any sense at all. I hope you will give this book a chance, but do not read it if you are not up for a train wreck like I thought this book was when I started it. I would give it a 4 out of 5 out of 10 if there was a 5.  Didn't find this review helpful?

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I felt that this was an interesting and thought provoking piece of research, however the book was flawed in a couple of key areas. In the first place, the conclusion of the book, that a child is not responsible for making their own decision is incorrect and I do not believe this conclusion to be correct, as there is some evidence that children make conscious decisions when they are as young as four years of age. In this case, it is difficult to establish a specific age for when children become conscious of the fact that they are choosing to behave in a certain way. In my view, in cases where the child is aged between 4 and 10, the child would be very capable of deciding on their own. It would be hard for me to see what the difference would be if the child was aged between 3 and 4." Read the full review here  Review by: James Poulson – The Sunday Times, December 5, 2017  "A study by Dr. John Money at Cambridge University has found that a third of children aged four to seven believe that they can make their own choices. The research, which was conducted by Dr Money, a Cambridge economist, has been criticised by some academics for using children as research subjects. However, Dr Money is adamant that the study shows that children "know they can take responsibility for their actions and that they know what they want". He adds that children have become more aware of the responsibilities they have in a way that has become more natural and has not been influenced by television or by what they have heard from parents or teachers. Dr Money says that he is concerned that children do not want to be told that they cannot do something because that may limit their future behaviour. He believes that children want to make their choices on their terms."  A child can choose to say no to an adult or can choose a certain option in a social situation. It takes a lot more work and courage to choose something you want to do and stand up for yourself and say no. And this can take courage for a child, especially if they're still getting used to that feeling in their tummy and their head.  It is important to teach children to make decisions about their own body. That is the first step to being able to make healthy choices. They should be encouraged to make choices in school, and by parents in the home, so they become more knowledgeable about healthy eating.  the children should be aware that when they choose food and drink that
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** I'm a first time reader. I have read the previous books in the series and enjoyed them. I wanted to see if the author could write a good book in which I could feel the emotions that was conveyed in the books. I wasn't disappointed. This book lacked character development and plot development, and the plot is just plain silly. The characters do get better as the book progresses, but the characters are not developed in a way that makes you care for them. The villain is just as ridiculous as the other villains. I can't help but think that if the book was one book, the villain would have been less silly and the book would have had more depth. Overall a fun book, but not one I would recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't really say much about this book. I've read it, but only because I was asked to review it. It wasn't for me and I was disappointed. I don't mind reviews about a book I've not read. But this isn't one of those times. I can only see the reviews about the book that were written by people that have not read the book. The writing is very dry. I feel like this is one of the best books in the collection, but this is a book that I can see I would not be able to read.   It's about a doctor who runs a hospital in a small town. His hospital is not very good, and it seems as though he is always trying to do something he is not great at. I would never recommend this to any person to read unless they are already really into books.   in my opinion, there is really not much to the book other than the idea of this doctor trying to run a hospital. The story is very short and there is not much of a plot for this doctor. In my opinion the story just ended and there isn't much more to it. If you're like me, the book will go by you, I was reading and reading and never finished the book because I kept finding things that I didn't like about the doctor and the hospitals. I felt that the story was written well, but as I said, I never finished it. The book ended before I really got to know the doctor, I would recommend this book to people who have read other horror books that are like this one. If the doctor doesn't scare you or get you going, there isn in really no reason to read the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** This book was a huge disappointment. This book's goal was to describe the human sexual response cycle from infancy up through adolescence as well as sexual pathology, but instead, the author focuses on the behavior of the "troubled boy" and his development through puberty. As a result, the book is poorly written and a waste of your time. **********
Write a negative review about a bad book:   After reading this book, i went to a bookstore and asked the clerk to "put this down" because it sounded so stupid.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________ This was the first time I was introduced to a fantasy world by an author I was a fan of. I love the concept of an alternate world where magic works by natural forces, and it was interesting to see that there was magic not just in a fantasy setting but in a real world too. It had been awhile since I read a book where I didn't think there was something wrong with the world that was created (or at least, I wish there was a better alternative), but with this book that was the case. _____________ The characters were not fleshed out enough for me to relate to them, but I can respect the authors decision. They were still interesting and interesting characters in this book, but not enough to get me invested. I did not want to hate these people and I was not invested enough in them to make them likable or likeable, and thus they were not, in my mind, a cohesive group that I could relate to. _______ I thought the romance was kind of weak in this novel, in a good way though, the author uses the love triangle aspect of romance in a way that is not only clever, but intriguing. ________________ I found the descriptions of the setting interesting and entertaining. The city of Caledor was very real and seemed like an authentic place that I wanted to explore. ______________________________ I have only read this book once and have no desire to read more by the author. ________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ "I found myself reading this book over and over as I worked through it. Not to sound like I'm bashing the book, but I couldn't stand the writing style." "The characters in the book have no motivations that are coherent or interesting. The plot is poorly paced and the events are inconsistent and bizarre. It is a novel that is not worth the time and effort." The review says a lot about the author and how he wrote this book. He doesn't say much.  The most I could say is that he takes a subject and twists it into something that makes no sense.  A few years ago I was reading about the effects of environmental pollutants on the development of the environment in the south east.  I noticed that the children of the lower middle class lived in the most polluted areas of the city.  Then I wondered why the children from this community seemed to be the most troubled. I couldn.t figure it out until I found out that their families were more likely to be in that group of people.  They had the greatest number of children in the highest pollution areas of town.  To prove this, I took a look at what the average levels of particulates were.  And lo and behold, the children had more particulates than the average people of the area.  So what was the cause?  It wasn't from the environment, but rather from something much worse.  If you want to see it, go to the area where they live.  Take a bus and find a station at the edge of town where they have to walk through the most dirt and exhaust.  Go to the top of the station and you will see one of the largest factories in the world.  Look up and around.  That's right, they make their fuel from dust.  When it was built, dust was considered to be clean. Now it's a common term used to describe something that is bad.  "This book is not the worst book I've read in recent times. The worst is a series of novels about a young boy who is caught in a time loop while trying to save his father from being executed in Vietnam.  "The worst is an entire series of books about a girl who is raped at gunpoint by a male teenager.   "The worst books I've ever read were written by a man who is suffering from Asperger's and who can't think in normal conversation, including

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking for a book that explains why we can never go home again. This book is a little bit disappointing and a lot of people will not get what I mean.   Some people will think that this book shows us that we can't go home anymore but I find that a little too simplistic.  The main points that this author wanted to explain are: 1. That life is so much better back home and that we are the lucky ones. 2. That we can be happier back home.  3. The importance of community. 4. The great advantages of education.  5. That the old days are over because everything is so different now.  6. The benefits of education for a woman.  I am all in favor of the first point. I agree that we live in a different era now and we have to understand that things are so much different in a way that it is hard for us to find a good balance. The second point is one that I also agree with. We all have a lot to gain from education. People are not just out for ourselves anymore. We need to look out for the whole group, or family, as a whole. We also need to be aware that we have the opportunity to change our lifestyles so much. It is so easy to have a home and do what we want as long as we have enough money. But if we don't have any money at all, we are living in poverty and we don' need to worry about our happiness. The only people who are in trouble are those who can't make ends meet and live on the edge. If a guy who works full time gets laid off and his kids are still getting food and clothes from the government, he will be fine. But when a woman has a good job and a family that is being helped by the government by paying for their education and health care, it will be a lot harder to cope with. I am happy that the author mentions the importance of education but I think that the amount of information he provides is a bit too little. I don't think that everyone needs to get a degree. And if you do go to school, why should the government subsidize your education? If you are really serious about going to college, then you should learn more about it. Why is there not a better system to help people get a college education?  The last point is where I think there is a lot more that could be done. I also
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm on my third book from the new series and I have to admit this is one of the worst, if not the worst. I was disappointed in the author's apparent ignorance of how to write a well constructed plot. It's so simple but when you throw in a bunch of weird characters and don't do much of anything with them other than to introduce them in one way or another it just gets boring, it gets maudlin and it doesn't seem to have much of an end to it other than for the main character to be tortured by her own insecurities about her family. I really felt for the character of Nana who is clearly in love with her husband but it's hard to root for a character who doesn't do anything about that love but instead just stays home and pouts all the time.  She doesn't really show any signs of growth as an adult and there is nothing about her that seems like she is going to ever be anything other than the way she was as a child.  Also one of my favorite books, but this one is just so boring!  6) A House of Cards by James Patterson (I've never read this one, but the synopsis says it's good and that's what makes me like it so much :-p) " The first in a new series, The House of Chalk is about a Washington politician named Chalk who is in for a rude awakening when he finds himself in the middle of a power struggle with the country's most powerful politician.   (This is one that is more about what the author did not do than how he did.  It is very well written and has a lot of potential but the only thing the author does is to introduce one really bland character who is more annoying than anything else.)   In summary:   In my opinion, this is a very good book that doesn't take any of the ideas I have from the other books and just makes them up in some random ways. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this book is boring and lacks depth in some of its concepts. It contains a lot of repetitive information that is boring to read. This book is too long, even though it covers a lot.  This book is written in an unprofessional manner.  If you don't like to read books in English and if you are searching for a book to read to your children or other non-English speaking people, then I would definitely recommend this book. Recommendation:  3/5 Recommend this to:    Don't use this book to improve your English. This is not a book for English speakers. I was hoping for some advice that would help me improve my English, but the advice I got was just the opposite of what I was expecting. If you plan on learning to read English, you should not read this book or even think of reading this book if your goal is to improve. The book does not help English learners improve their reading skills.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In case you haven't heard, my wife and I recently bought this book. I must admit, I wasn't really looking forward to reading it. I had read all the Harry Potter series, and had really forgotten how good some of the characters were. I was also very excited that there would be more books written by J.K. Rowling. When it came time to pick up the book, my girlfriend said, "why are you wasting money on this book when there are already so many?" So I read the cover and decided to give it a shot. The first couple of pages were OK, nothing too bad, but there were still way too many words for me to read and I gave up before I got to the part where he has to get married. The rest of the book was a waste of time. There were some parts that were interesting, but mostly it was repetitive and boring. I felt like the character development had been rushed, because all of the books from Harry Potter to Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows had more action than this. And if you think J. K. Rowling is a bad writer, well then, this is just going to make you wish she wrote more books.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a great way to learn the basics of building a website or blog and it was a joy to read. I love the examples and I was glad to see that it was still practical for a beginner (even though it was only a few pages long). I had heard great things about other books on web design, but when I saw how long this book was and how much it cost I had to pass up some other books that could have been much better. My only complaint is that I have found other web design books from a variety of online sellers and they all had very similar information and ideas and the text style was a bit different. This book is definitely worth a read for those that have never written a web page or used an advanced tool.   I gave the book 3 stars because some of the examples may not be useful to a beginner. I am a beginner and the examples in the book were not useful to me. I found myself looking for a different method to create some pages.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most interesting fact that the author tries to make it to the reader is that, as a child, he has been told that the reason he had such poor eyesight was that his eyes were too big to fit through the holes in the door of a store where he worked. He goes through life with a certain self-loathing about his eyes, but he tries to forget this and instead takes pride in his mind. As a kid, he wanted to be a doctor, he got a scholarship, he goes to college, he works hard and eventually he does become a doctor.  As a young adult, he tries very hard to be something that he is not and instead ends up in a job he hates. _________________________________ A man gets a letter from his daughter, and he gets a new life.  The book starts out well, but the story quickly becomes convoluted. The author tries hard to tell the story in a manner that would appeal to his readers but it gets difficult to follow and not as interesting.  ____________________________________ I just couldn't get the story of this book. It was very short and the pacing was great. This is an interesting take on the old tale of the blind beggar with his dog. I can see how this story can appeal to the modern reader but it did not resonate with me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story starts fine, with some action/adventure and then it becomes just kind of boring, no depth, and I was really worried that the whole story would be so bland that it'd be boring.   I have read more than 10 reviews and this book is at least in that same range. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So glad this is over, a terrible book.  1) She uses the term "grizzly bear" on several occasions, and when a grizzly bear in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming is shot by a hunter in order to protect the area, is quoted, saying, "I don't care if it's a gazelle or a bear. I don't know what you think." This is a very rude, derogatory and demeaning term that is rarely used by either female or males. : I have to be very careful when I read reviews that say that a book is "bad" because they haven't read it, because you can't judge a book by its cover. This book's cover looks cool, and all, but the words that are on the cover are the words the author used in the book. She uses "grouchy" and "hairy" like you can see from a distance. I'm not gonna lie, that was kind of hot. It's more like that girl's hair grew long like a grizzled bear's (with a touch of a grizzley too, I'm sure). Anyway, this is one of those books where there is not much of a plot, but it's still fun. As a girl, I like books with lots of sex and nudity. I would definitely recommend this book, especially to younger girls who may be attracted to the story. I also think that I may have liked the cover better if it didn't say "Bears" with two bears. It just sounds like one big hairy, grizzly-bear.This book is all about the "B.B.C" group (Boyfriend and Broke). This group has taken over the school, and everything in it is for them. As for the main characters, they are very unappealing. Their names were "Wendy", "Kelley", "Mel", "Sue", and "Beth". They are all very unattractive, but have nice, round asses. This isn't even mentioning that all of the men seem to be wearing shorts, and some are even wearing swim trunks. It also looks like every female in the story is wearing a bikini bottom. The best thing about this book is the sex scenes. It is not hard to get off while reading this book. It doesn't seem to stop when it gets dark. There are scenes where a guy is having sex, and

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the hardcover of this a couple weeks ago.   My problem is with how the main characters in the book behave.  Their language is atrocious.  For a main character in a book to constantly be speaking "malfunctionally", this just screams that the author was going for the joke.  But, he didn't get it.  They're talking about someone that has been living with a brain tumor since birth, and is only able to understand people that are in the same boat as he is in, so to speak.  He's basically a machine.  What a stupid way to use the main character.  There's also a bunch of character development, but it's pretty much nonexistent.  I don't understand how they made the character that doesn't speak in the beginning.  To do that makes the book so much worse.  It's one thing if the main charactress doesn't like someone, but this man doesn't even know her name.  Also, how could they make this character only one and a half inches taller than the main charcater.  And he can still walk with a cane?  This character is so annoying that it makes me want to pull my hair out.  Finally, there are the characters with the same name as the main cast.  How does that help the main arc?  I'm done with this book.  If you want to read a book where you're laughing at stupid people, then read this book and enjoy.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book I am reviewing has some good points but a number of points are just wrong. I know it was written in the 90's when books were printed on yellow pages and everything was hand written but that makes no sense to me. My favorite character was a boy who was very young and lived with his grandmother. He was very brave and courageous, and we never saw him kill a child or hurt another person. There was one scene that happened in the book where my granddaughter and her two cousins went to the lake. The boy was playing with one of his cousins and they pulled a boy from the water. The mother tried to take the boy to the hospital but the boy wouldn't let go. He cried for a long time and finally let go after the mother told the children they would have to kill the boy. My granddaughter was scared. It was about 2 hours and the grandmother was about to call the police but the children said they weren't going to kill a man and then one of the children pointed a knife and said they would. I was disgusted by this.  I was also horrified by the way the father of the boy told the child to kill and his family to go. If I was a woman in my situation I would be scared and cry. I think most people should read this book and find out for themselves what it was really like.  Another reviewer writes that it is a sad book. I agree. I don't feel sad for the character I did read, however I did feel sad that I missed the opportunity to read this about my grandmother. The book is very well written and the writing style and story telling are very original. The only problem is that it would have been great to see more of the people who lived through the time that I did.   
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________   "I wanted to love this book. I wanted to take everything I know about the art of storytelling, everything I think I know, and make it into a story. I just knew it would never work because of the characters. It was so confusing. There was too much focus on one character and not enough on the others. It took me so long to even figure out what was going on."   _____________________________________________________   This book had me wondering why I read it. I read a review of this book here and it stated that this book is a book that you should read if you have a desire to learn about creating a story or a scene. That was my intention when I started reading this book, but it doesn't really fit the bill. This book is more for the experienced storyteller.   I found the characters to be very one dimensional. There wasn't a character that really stood out from the rest and every other character was in that same box. The story is about a young woman named Claire and how she grows up and goes through her life. The author has written a very realistic character and I thought she was written really well. However, the writing was very poor throughout the book. Even if I wasn't completely lost at times, the story didn't seem to have a real purpose. I felt that it was trying to tell a more personal story about a girl but it didn't make any sense.   the story does make sense if you understand it a little and the ending is perfect.  .I will definately buy the sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The premise of the book:  "After getting into a bad relationship with a nice girl, an innocent high school student named Adam has a new, mysterious friend: A strange woman named Sarah, who he meets at a bookstore after getting kicked out of his high school for fighting.  "...   What I liked:  are all the characters believable.  the writing was clear and understandable.  The problem:  "The book's main premise is that there are two factions in the book, the "Militia" and "Riots", with the main conflict between the two being "how do you solve the problem of poor people being kicked out for no reason"  This is actually interesting and well presented, but I didn't care for the book in the end because of how silly it is and the fact that it was so poorly executed in the beginning. "In the book the reader is introduced to Sarah at a library and Adam is having a rough year. He goes to a bookstore to get a copy of the latest issue of "Harper's" magazine so he can read it at his friends party, while at the same time, he's struggling to get into college. Sarah is a nice, sweet, but awkward character. I liked the character, but it got to the point where he couldn't help but feel like he was a sidekick. I mean, his character was supposed to be the main character and Adam was supposed be the narrator, but Adam was the only one with a voice and the main story was just him and Sarah talking to each other and getting into awkward conversations. The characters were very poorly written, with little to no explanation of what was going on. This is because they didn't seem to want to put the reader in Adam's shoes, or maybe they were just having a bad day. This might be a good book to read if you're bored in high school. "The book ended in the middle because they just wanted to get to the bad guy and I guess, I can understand it, but that's not why I gave the book 3 stars. "Overall, this book is written well, with good characters, but the writing is pretty terrible and just left me bored and frustrated. I would not recommend this book to anyone and I feel like this was a waste of time. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible - in every way. I've read several of his books and thought them all good but I can say that this is not one of them. I will not be reading it again. It is a book with very little sense. I got the idea of doing something in the woods, but I got more out of the book than I did. It was boring and slow. I think it would be easier if he had put the animals in it, too. If he did, it would have been better. The main reason why I gave this book 1 star is the spelling, and also because the author used a bad way of saying something. I just did not like it at all. I'm giving it 1 star because there was nothing I liked about it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book had many problems. Most of the problems were not with the story and the characters, but the author. I thought I was going to like this book as well. I was about to pick it up. But after a long day of work and trying to be a good mom and helping my 5 kids, I decided to take a walk and find a good story. This book didn't live up to my expectations. As a new mom, my kids need something that makes sense. This one didn't. I didn't know the backstory of this woman. I knew she was good with the kids. I also know this book was written by a woman. But the author made me feel like her only purpose in life was to sell books. I have kids and don't want to feel like I am wasting time with a bad author. So I stopped this book and now I am reading The Little Engine That Could by Nancy Drew.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________________________Read by a wonderful woman who writes in a very lovely and engaging way. I found the story to be compelling, but this doesn't make for a good book to read. This book did not have the best writing and pacing, and the ending was far too short. But that is my only complaint.I was able to finish this book in less than a day, and while it was a long read, it was worth it, and you will be very glad you picked this up!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________. There were a few problems with this book, but I found myself more and more attracted to it over time. The more I read the more I started to think "Oh, that's how I would use this book for work." In this case, I like the concept of the book a lot and it is a really fun read. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the kind of fiction that comes out of the American Midwest.  24 of 25 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   After reading this book I thought to myself that I have no need for writing or reading any more.    The plot is so unbelievably stupid that I had to put it in the "bad" category.   I mean it is a stupid story that starts off with a group of soldiers who are looking for a new land to settle, one where the soil is fertile and there are no animals.  What are the soldiers going to do if the land is covered in a thick jungle?     " The soldiers began to look for the next land, but in their excitement and haste, they left their comrades unguarded."       I will give this book 2 out of 5 stars.  This book was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________I was so excited to have this book for Christmas - but it fell through my mailbox when I ordered it and the publisher had to give me a refund. If I ever need it I'll order from Amazon. But as it is, this isn't my kind of book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read a few of these books but never liked them. This one wasn't any better. A boring and confusing story with no real plot and an uneventful ending. I would not recommend this to any book lover. I'm still looking forward to the next book in the series, but I was disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ ___________ ______________. This is probably my all-time favorite book! I can't believe someone would be so mean-spirited to try and rip me off. I can only imagine what this man must've done to write this trash of a book. I love all the stories, but the characters are just so awful! My favorite is probably the girl with the strange blue eyes! This book will make you laugh, but just don't buy it, it is not worth it and no one will like it anyway.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry that I never got around to reading this book. I wanted it. I really did. I was going to read the entire series, and then I got burned with the first book and I went off the board with the series completely. I will try to remember to read one book every few months from now on. This is the worst book I've ever had the displeasure of reading. It is a complete mess. It doesn't read well at all. I'd be willing to bet that most people with this bad of a taste for the book will not like it and will never enjoy it in the slightest. I hate it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________I don't know what's wrong with people. They love to read and they love to review. I bought this book hoping to find some fun horror stories. I have read quite a few horror books and have never come across anyone in this genre who can scare the living shit out of me. I had never read anything so creepy or depressing as this. It's almost as if it's trying to scare you into becoming a zombie and taking its place. I think they used it for a very good reason and I'm not sure how this is an urban legend. I read some reviews of the author and it doesn't mention anything about her having the work published in book form. I hope she continues to write and that I'll be able to read a horror book again in my lifetime.   This was a horrible book, I'm sorry I read it! ______________________________It was ok, I did enjoy it, but really, I don't want to read about how it was written. There is no gore, no gore! The narrator seems very sad and depressed about her life and how she is always going to be forgotten and forgotten. She tries to escape it all with alcohol and drugs. She gets into trouble and feels that it's her fault. I'm sure you can guess where this is going.There is no sex, no sex! There is just a couple of sex scenes. If you like sex scenes and disturbing books, then this book will have your mind on edge but not on the edge of an orgasm.The author talks about zombies, which I think was done because that is the first thing people think of when they think about zombies. It was a really creepy way of showing it, that's for sure.There's just one other thing I can say, which is that I would have read a book written by the same author but I didn't. She has the same voice as she used for her previous books. There are no good books out there to read, just the ones that have sold well. I've only got the first book by her, and I can tell you she's a great author. I recommend it. If this book hadn't been so creepy and depressing, I'd have liked it more. But, I guess it worked because I read the next one by her. _______________________________I don´t think that there are any good urban legends. All you need to do is look at how people reacted to it. But I think
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book is about as bad as it gets. It takes you through the exact same story with an added twist." "This is the kind of story where you think: oh, this sounds familiar, this is sort of the same thing. You start feeling a little creeped out by the story and the characters. You also start feeling as if you are reading the same book over and over again. This is the book for the guy who wants a short, quick, horror story that will leave you scared. This book is short but it is really terrible. You don't need to read this book. You need to put it down. It's not worth the time and effort to do so. I can't believe how badly this book is written, and I'm not even an horror fan." I'd like to add a little more on this point: 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________, I read this book back in 2001 and was so happy to see how much it has aged in the years that have passed. The style of the writing remains true to its time and even though the story line is not very original, there are still a few twists and turns along the way to keep things interesting. There is so much suspense in this book that I thought I would have a heart attack if I missed this one and I did! I have read two or three books by this author and I think I would give this one a thumbs up. I also appreciate that the author is a woman and not just a male writer!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  the author uses the first person from the first page.  You have no idea who this person is and it makes the book a real challenge.  The story itself is good and the characters are likeable.  However, it makes it hard to buy into the idea that there is a secret to this person's success.  I can't get past the fact that there's a lot of first-person and the author doesn't want you to feel like you're eavesdropping.  For this reason, I don't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ A couple of times I've bought something by this author and after reading it...I've become frustrated and angry because it seems like he's writing about the same stuff over and over again...no innovation whatsoever, nothing new. It's basically the same story...one thing that really got my attention...a character who is "stuck"...I kept thinking, if only this character would leave, maybe things could change...but alas, it wasn't meant to be.   The art is good, but I don't really like the color schemes or styles...it's just a generic, flat color scheme.   a couple of other things...there is nothing that is particularly memorable about the story...it takes place in a generic fantasy world. The characters are boring...there's nothing much going on...there are some "interesting" ideas but nothing more.  , and the worst thing...the ending! This book...is written as though it was the last book in the series, and that's really sad...the author should've known better than to throw in a twist in the last page!   I've been reading this author for over 10 years and I'm still disappointed with his work...
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________. I was really looking forward to the next book in the series, this one was great though. The story was very well done and even the worst character was a great one. I'm very happy with the book and will read the next.   Helpful when reading the synopsis I got. I did not have to worry about the plot being so random. The characters were very well drawn and the setting was very realistic. I would like to see the author go on to write more of these series and the next series, but I will wait to see if there is any more. I really enjoyed the book. I can see why this is popular. I could really tell that this was a hard to buy copy and very hard to get for a low price. It was a shame as I really liked the author. I found myself wanting to read the other books in the line. If you like urban fantasy then you need to check this one out. This is a great read and I look forward to reading the next ones in the chain.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________   I was a bit let down by this book. I have not really read that many books and had expected this one to be different. After reading through the review, I am surprised that I was so let down. In my opinion, this book did not really have any strong points to it. While I found the writing to be interesting, I did not feel that the book was interesting enough to make this a worthwhile read. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ _________  A well-written book, but I don't feel it was written for children  Posted by: Jane from WV on May 10, 2006 8:05 AM I would say that the book is excellent. My children love the story and they have been telling it for years. My only criticism is that it was not written for little children, I thought that it would be a great story for younger kids.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to agree with some reviewers of this book; it is a fairly simplistic yet fascinating history of the Russian Empire from the death of the Czar to the fall of the Soviet Union. I was expecting a book that would give an insight into the people, culture and politics of the times but I didn't get that. Instead I found myself just trying to remember who the characters were. I do, however, like that the book is not a 'what if?' book, but an accurate and detailed story that shows the consequences of different historical events in a pretty comprehensive way.   My only problem with this book is that it was written in the 1990s and so my knowledge of the period is rather limited and at times confusing. That said, it still remains one of the most interesting historical books I have read and gives a lot of insight into a very interesting part of the world that we, unfortunately, don't really get to see any more.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ I enjoyed this book and think its an interesting read. However, I would like to know what it is about the book and why the author thinks it was written well. I just wanted to love the story and the main character of this book but I found the writing dull. I know that a lot of the time the writers are doing their best to make their words seem more poetic and poetic lines are written in between the lines to make the reader feel as if he or she is reading an epic poem. But sometimes the words don't flow well, the story is repetitive and doesn't keep my attention long enough for me to keep reading. It was so boring I was getting a little irritated, and a lot times I had to stop reading and go back and read other books I have already read. I felt I was losing interest in the book. This book isn't the only one that has this problem but I was a little bothered by other books that I found like this as well. If you're looking for a story to keep you reading longer, I'd go to another book. Otherwise, if you want to read a funny book that will make you laugh, then this might be for you. _____________________________________________________  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really good!  I loved it so much that I can't stop reading it!    It's the story about an autistic child and his relationship with his sister.   When the narrator is told that there's something wrong with him he doesn't freak out.  He has good communication skills so he doesn' t freak out!  The narrator is very well behaved.  She is very loving and helpful and she knows what she is talking about.  It would be nice if the author would just tell the story from the point of view of the sister, but that is how it works with this book.  For example the main character goes to the library and asks the librarian to read to him from a book he's looking for.  But it's all told from the main child's point of a view.  There are a lot of scenes with him that are just awful.  The chapters are great so I can keep going but it was all just the same.  I felt so bad when I was reading the book!  I really wanted to stop!  It was just so bad!  There was a lot more plot that I was totally not getting.  They say it's for people who haven't read any autism stories before and that it's a "different kind of story".  If you are looking for a different kind of autistic book I suggest giving this one a try.  If I would have known that this was going to be so bad I probably would have given it 3 stars! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a collection of essays by writers who have had a troubled, traumatic, or otherwise difficult life. It provides some insight, but not enough. A group of people that are very similar in every way can be very different. It does get into the lives of these people. You do learn some of the details of their personal stories and feelings, but it's still a very sad book. I was hoping this book was going to be one I could share with my young daughter and be able to say that I read about it. But even though it's about this group of guys, it does not provide enough details about what is really going on with this group, their lives, and their mental and emotional problems. The story told by the people who had the most difficult experiences in the book are much more detailed than the story told in the writing, and the story we see in the writer's life is not very different than the people we see. So the book was hard to follow for me. I would give this book 1 star if the writing and the writing alone would make up for it's shortness, but the only thing that can make this book so good is the people involved. I think this book has the potential to be a great read. If you're a writer, then you should read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very well written book. I would say that, however, there are two aspects to the book which I have found extremely problematic. First, it is difficult for me to understand the "why" of the various acts and "how" they were carried out. In other words, what is the point of killing children, unless the children are being killed in some way because they are Muslims? In other cases, it appears that the "killing" is done with the intent to terrorize and terrify (e.g., the Yazidi women and children are taken from their homes and placed in a cage in order to terrorise and terrificate them). Also, the reason why these individuals were being held by the Iraqi Army is unclear to me. In one case, it seems that the Iraqis are using them as bargaining chips to get other prisoners, while in the other, it may have been that they were being forced to work as suicide bombers, despite their protests. Perhaps this is the problem with the book. It's a difficult book to understand, because the explanation of the acts is not clear. As for the "how": It is clear to me that this is an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the Iraqi government by demonstrating that, rather than being a democracy, it's a dictatorship which is being led by Al-Maliki. If this were not the case, the Iraqis would be more likely to support them. And this is why the Iraqi troops and Shiite militias who are carrying out these acts are also seen as an "intervention", because they're taking on the role of Saddam Hussein's supporters, rather that a neutral party. If you see this as a "good" thing, then this could be seen as a positive contribution to the war effort by "liberating" these "terrorists". However, if you look at it as a negative, then you see it as the opposite, and the Iraqi security forces are actually killing these people. And it's not clear to what end. If there is a solution, it would appear to be that, if the government were to reform, then these people should be released and they should be allowed to go home. I just do not understand how this is supposed to help. This is the only criticism I have with the books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have been looking forward to this book. I bought a used copy at Barnes and Noble about a month ago, but it was only the first two books in the series. I waited until the third book to read the first of the series (which had just been released) and I have to say that I'm not sure if this is a bad story.   My biggest issue was how a female protagonist was treated. She was a bit of a damsel in distress, as is often the case in women's stories, and she was almost immediately rescued by a male character who made it clear he was in it for himself, rather than for her. At one point, he tries to seduce her but she won't let him, even if that means his life and he's stuck with her. I don't buy the character, or the idea that she had an attraction to him that was more important than his own desire.   in other words, there is no emotional depth or story at work here. And that's probably why I have the feeling that I had been tricked into reading this book; it was too good to be true.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was just another one of those books that makes me want to throw my computer off the side of the building. I wanted to scream out loud how bad this book was, because I couldn't really understand what the author was trying to communicate. The main character was a woman who used to have a mental breakdown when her son was in college. Now, I'm not going to say that I'm going to go in and pick up a copy of The Art of Being Mindful and begin meditating or some other kind of spiritual thing. I'm also not going into some elaborate meditation program. But I know I can meditate a lot more effectively if I can find a way to connect with the subconscious, and this book did nothing to help me do that. All I could do was watch this woman try to sort out her own subconscious and figure out what her problems were. Her father was obviously not the only one that suffered at this event, but she really couldn't figure out why. The only explanation she came up with was that she "knew she was different", which didn't really explain anything. She just knew that she was sad, depressed and frustrated with life. I could have read this book and found out how to fix my life. Instead, I just wanted to toss the book, throw my laptop across the room, and leave the building without another thought about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:       What could be better than a book that is both fun and useful? I think it's one of the best books ever published about teaching kids how to use their creativity and to create.   And the fun and practical ways the author uses is wonderful for kids, especially kids who have special needs and learning disabilities.  Would I recommend this book: Yes, if you love writing and kids and love to create and learn by doing! Would you listen to an audio version of this book? Maybe Listen to an Audio Book
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! I have never had any real trouble with a bad copy of a book.    I have had a copy of this book for at least 10 years.  The last time I bought a copy was 10 years ago.  It was a bad one that I tried to return. I have read so many reviews of this that the only thing that I can add is to put it down and go for a walk. This book is asinine and not worth $4.50. It was the same book when I got it 10 years after purchase. The author is a little of a buffoon. I hope you guys don't give this book a 4.5 rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was the worst book I have ever read.   The writing was very bad and the story did not make sense. It started out great and seemed like a fun read, but then the plot fell apart. It was just silly to start.  The author writes: "We are in the middle of the greatest depression in American history. This is the greatest financial crisis in American political history. In 1812, the U.S. had a national debt of $1.5 billion. In today's dollars, that debt would have been over $19 trillion. In fact, the national debt was around $18 trillion in 2008. The U. S. national debt is now close to $17 trillion, and it's increasing at an alarming rate."  I guess all the wars started to make more money than they ever did before. So a bunch of stupid people got really rich. I would have stopped reading after the first 50 pages.  But no one cares. Overall, this was a horrible book.  If I had a choice I would have never read this book.   I don't like the author, but I didn't like this book as much as I should have.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I read this book before I moved to Alaska, and I am happy I did!

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book but I wouldn't recommend it as a gift to anyone under 18. It is very explicit and there is no happy ending. Read more reviews at  Amazon.com The book:   "The most important thing is to know when it's too late, and when you can try to turn the corner for a little longer." (Eduardo Galeano) "The way to stay alive is to learn how to die." (Martin Caidin) The review:    I love this book. I can't think of anything that has inspired me to go outside my comfort zone so much so as this book, which, with its themes and message, has been my go-to to-be-in-the-now-ever since I read it during my first semester of college. It's about the idea that one does not necessarily need to live in the moment to find happiness, and how to move beyond the idea of 'what if I die' and 'what can I learn if I make it through this?' to embrace the present moment to its fullest and embrace what life has to offer. The way it relates to the real world is such a breath of fresh air and the characters are so true to themselves. I also really liked the concept of moving from the present, where we have everything we want, to the future of having everything we need and then to'remember', in order to live again in a better way.  The books I like to read with the author, Eduardo Galeao, include, "The New Earth" and, "A Simple Beginning".   The author:    Eduardo is a great person to read books with. He is a man of his word, and he never lies about anything. He's incredibly funny and is able to relate to almost any subject at all. He does not talk down to his readers and, most importantly, does not judge. I cannot think of a better book for anyone. If you're considering this book for your shelf, I strongly recommend you do so! Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed this review!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The novel starts out with the author telling us what his wife told him. She thought that he would never have a child with her, and therefore it was important for him to have one. This isn't an unusual thing that happens in a marriage. I didn't think of this as a bad thing, however, I do think that you should be aware that there's a whole bunch of other stuff in this book that doesn't have anything to do with fertility. For example, there's an old man who was raped by an Indian and is told to pretend that the rape didn't happen. The man has to go to an Indian village where he has to pretend to be a farmer. He then has to make a farmer's wife marry him because the woman wants children. At one point the husband pretends to be blind in one eye so that his wife can see him and the kids. This all happens when the husband thinks that she is going to have a baby, so the story has nothing to do at all with fertility or reproduction. The only child born is born via rape. (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a classic novel that takes an ordinary world and makes it magical. The world is one of the most magical worlds in the history of fantasy. The story is well written and it has enough twists and turns to keep the reader hooked until the end. The characters are likable and the prose is crisp and concise. This book deserves all five stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  As I said, this book made me feel very much alone and that made me not want to read it at all.  I think I will never want to be a vampire again if this book makes me feel this way, and I felt so alone after reading it.  I am a little disappointed in myself for not noticing that the first part is very similar to the first half of the second book, as it makes so much more sense and makes it much more readable.   I think they should make a sequel that has less similarities to the rest of the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- My wife and I are the original readers of all the classics of the Western canon. We have read them in our youth, and were rereading them again in our later years. We've both been searching for a book that we'd consider a classic of the genre. The more we looked, the more we couldn't find. We finally made our purchase about a year ago. I can't say that it was a cheap book at $12.00. It's a solid 5 stars for our tastes and that's all I can say for now. I was a little disappointed at the number of errors in this book, and some that are so obvious that they need no mentioning. I wish I'd paid a little more for the corrected text. The "Diaries" sections need a lot more attention, as well. That said, we'll be reading it again before it's over. Thank you for the read. -R.L. from Los Angeles
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has some good ideas, and even some good writing, but there are several mistakes throughout the book, and the final product is not very appealing. The first is in the first chapter. The character of Liane is clearly meant to be a little sister to Sarah. Sarah, however, is clearly a little girl. This is very annoying when you are looking for some sisterly connection. Sarah's description is also very short and a little repetitive. This can make the reader feel like Sarah is not really related to Liane. Then, when Liane reveals she is a slave, the first thing I do is think "but I don't think Sarah is a little sis" again, Sarah's descriptions are usually pretty descriptive but this one was pretty generic. There is also a scene where the character has an intense sexual encounter with her slave. This scene is very graphic but I guess to a young girl this may not be a big deal, but to the adult reading the book this might be an issue. I feel like a big part of the book was spent explaining these details to Lene, and then all the sudden Liane does it anyway. Also, the slave scene was so violent that I am not sure if I really wanted it to happen in the book at all. The worst part of this book was the beginning of the last chapter. This was the first scene in which Sarah says Liane's name and it was kind of jarring. As the scene progressed the book really felt like something had died. The next few paragraphs were almost completely out of character, and it just felt like it was completely different from what the author originally intended for Sarah's character. The only thing the book had going for it was the story. I know that may be a bad thing to say, but I felt like the book lacked some substance. If you are an avid reader this book may be right up your alley, but if you are just looking for a good adventure with a twist, you probably will not get much out of this one. I highly recommend reading the first four chapters of this if you don't mind the change in tone. Overall Rating: 3 Stars I found this to be an interesting and interesting story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was good, but it didn't live up to the hype. I just got over the "I want to be a writer" hangup and thought, "oh that's the first book I read that might actually interest me in writing." I got over my need to write.   So yeah...if you are looking for a quick, fast, fun read, then this is a great first book in a series! If you aren't a fan of young adult books, you might be a little underwhelmed. But that's just me and I didn't need to know that before reading it. I found it hard to dislike, at least not while I was reading. I think that my favorite part was reading about the protagonist's father, whose writing was so brilliant that it actually inspired my own writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    *1   What a waste of time   The author seems to have a weak grasp of the whole thing. I have listened to this book 3 times so far, read several reviews, and still have not gotten a single word of meaning or insight from it. I do get the feeling that it was written by a high school freshman, and not someone with any experience in this field. *1 *1 1/2  
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________This book is one of my all time favorites. However I just can't understand how some authors can go wrong with these children's books. I am a grownup, I read for pleasure, and this book was the perfect thing I could read for a reading break or just as a good book to pass the time. But when you start a book like this you are on a mission. The story starts out as a simple "what if" story, but then it turns into a wild ride and the story ends with a cliff hanger. I would love to get ahold of a copy of this book so I can give it a re read and see if it still holds up.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is so boring  I could have read this book over and over again and it would have been the same experience. Not only is it boring, it also is written badly. I think that the publisher is a bad one for trying to capitalize on the Hunger Games book. I read a review from someone who had an identical issue and that is why he did not like the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________" The first chapter was very enjoyable to read, but after the second the reader is stuck in a muck of unnecessary details. At no point did the reader get an introduction to the main character, who is so incredibly stupid and uninteresting it makes you wonder why anyone would read this book.   The main character is really dumb and it is very difficult to sympathize with him. The book starts out so well, with the character explaining why he feels like such a loser, then it takes a while for the character to realize why he is a loser. Then the character gets a girlfriend and he starts acting like a loser again, this is where the book really goes downhill, because the main characters actions are totally unbelievable, they are so dumb. Then he has a girlfriend who dumps him and he acts like a complete loser.   is the only character I don't understand at all.   the main female character who is a teenager and has a sister is also very unintelligent and stupid. She makes stupid decisions in the book and the book has such a boring feel to it.   of course it all starts to unravel when the main protagonist has a psychotic break and decides to use his mental illness on the characters, he then goes on a killing spree, and the reader realizes the characters are a complete joke and how little they know about real life.   ________ ________  A lot of characters are so very stupid. I mean really. How would this work in real life? If you were so very smart and successful and successful at everything that you could even think like this, how would you not get involved in some petty bullshit? And it turns out to be a joke and the author is being intentionally cruel and horrible to the characters and the readers.   I have to be honest, I really disliked this book because it was so pointless. I just found it completely boring and annoying. I can't stand these kind of books at all and really couldn't understand why anyone wanted to read it. I could understand that they are intended to be used as a satire, but it seemed like the author had no other intention of making it interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I don't know why my husband was attracted to this book. I read it twice and could not put it down. The writing style is interesting and fun. This book is fun and fast paced. The character's growth and relationships is exciting. I like the fact that there is a good and bad person in this book, it was very interesting. There were some parts that I found quite disturbing. But if you are not offended I recommend you go out and read this book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it's an ok book, but not worth the time or money and you'll probably not like it The last book I bought in paperback was a hardcover copy of "What to Expect When No One's Expecting" which I found at a used bookstore at the age of 18. This book is almost exactly that same book. It is a book about how we view the future based on what we've learned about how the past turned out, and how we're going to behave and act based on that knowledge. The best thing about this book is the author's "concerned" commentary to the reader that the future will be bad because: "The world has grown up, not as it should, with the belief that we can control it, or that it can be controlled, or even better that we have been able to keep it in a happy and rational state. We don't know how to make it better, even if we could." "Most people can understand how much the world has changed. What they can't understand is how much change can be good for us." That's pretty much the best thing that I've read in a long time, if that makes any sense. But the most interesting thing about the book is that he was trying to predict the future, so he had all kinds of crazy things that he thought would happen and tried to look at the present and see if there was some type of evidence to support or explain what he thought was going to happen. He had some really weird predictions in the book, which I will touch on later.  The idea here is that the most reasonable thing is to expect things to go back to a pretty stable state. It's much more likely to be bad than good and the reason is because the human mind is not yet used to the idea that things aren't as stable as they seem. The way the world works is that everything we believe is based on experience and we take that experience as being reliable and true. For example, if a person claims that the sky is blue and then the sky actually turns out to be blue, then there is a huge change in his expectations because he didn't have the experience that the blue sky is not a reliable prediction of the future. So a very reasonable thing to predict with the knowledge that we know we haven't had experience with the world being stable is that things are going to change in some very extreme way. A huge amount of change will have happened
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________________________   It was hard to get through this book.   I read this book at a friend's suggestion. He is a veteran in the Army and has been living in the US for 10 years. I figured I would have a good sense of his views on the military, and so I would appreciate a non-biased review. It was not that kind of book. I can see his point but I disagree. If you look at the author's bio at his website you will see he is a major player in the military/security field (which includes intelligence). He spent the past 20 years in the field and was stationed in Germany. When it comes to issues surrounding the US military I think it would be very easy to have some bias or take an overall negative stance. I found myself wishing he would have spent more time talking about his experiences as a military member and less time with his view on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I felt like that would have really helped his case.   the most damning thing to me was the claim he makes about "American foreign policy, the war on terrorism and the lack of a comprehensive and effective counterterrorism strategy".   First of all, as a veteran and military officer he should know his facts, and I think he did here. I could not find one piece of credible evidence to support the claim. There were a few bits of information that supported his argument about the lack effectiveness of US counterterrorism strategy and the fact that this is a common claim in our nation's history. But most of his claims were based on anecdotes of people he has talked to who are part of various intelligence agencies, the military or a lot of other positions that could be described as having a "special" perspective on foreign affairs.   this book does not claim to be an in depth discussion on the "why's" of the US foreign policy. This is a book about a particular person's personal journey. The book gives him a background and gives the reader a brief background of what his background is. It gives the background on his experiences and his views about the military. After the author tells his own story he has a lot to say about it. But he does not go into much detail. The author makes a few statements about how America has been losing in the war against terrorism but this is it. He has nothing to say in regards to the war in Iraq or how that has played out or how it will play out. He also has nothing in regards the
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The one where the author makes a reference to "The Big Sleep."  It is written as if the reader has no idea what "The big sleep" is or why it is important, and then they should just go on living without knowing why.  And if this is the way you want to live then don't go to college or graduate school or start a business or have a family or be successful or get a college degree or even learn a foreign language or anything else that's not "college work" (it's not).  There are tons of great books on the subject, and if you're interested I suggest taking a look at:    The Big Sleep by Philip K. Dick   -  Another great science fiction book about aliens invading earth (or in this case, another planet), humans living in a society with high technology, and what happens when one of these aliens is discovered and they go against their rules.   (My review of this book can be found on Amazon and Goodreads, or you can find me on Twitter )   My favorite part of this list of books is that I did not have to put any of the others on the top or in my top 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is NOT worth your time. The book, which is supposed to teach young women about self esteem and the value of friendship is the absolute worst of the many books I've read that have talked about "love". I have NEVER come across a book that talked about love so blatantly and without compassion, with nothing more than a few vague platitudes to illustrate the need for friendship. Not that it matters, as I've never been in a friendship with a man that was loving and caring, but I was in a relationship that wasn't. The only positive part of the book, is that it addresses the importance of not being a "friend with benefits", because this is what you will get, if you don't think about it. This book was terrible to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I will not read more of this author's books.   It was soooooo annoying that the main character could not decide if she liked herself or not. Her feelings were not enough to get her to act on her desires, she was just stuck with her emotions. Also there was alot of sex (and a bit of oral). I do not care for this, but it did not take away from my enjoyment of the story.   in the end, I will say that it did give me some interesting ideas to think about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If I have one flaw in the book I have is that the ending doesn't work.  It's a bit too happy-go-lucky, or, at least I hope it is.  And if you are looking for a story about vampires, then this is a really good one, it's about how vampires are human, not how humans are vampires.  I mean, I have always liked vampires, and I don't think I've ever hated them, but this is just too happy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so sorry this book is so bad, so I'm not gonna write anything bad about it other than I know it's written by the guy who wrote this book, I mean it's pretty obvious that this book was written by someone who hates me and everyone who has ever given him any feedback, that's really sad. It's just so sad because this book just got a 3 star rating from me, and I have to give it that, I just hated this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In my review of The Road to Serfdom I criticized it for its shallowness, a lot of filler and poor prose. But this book is not as bad as I thought it was. There is a little more substance here than there is in the other books in the series, but the book doesn't have a lot to do. It's not bad as a whole but the parts that are not necessary don't really add to the story. The most interesting aspect of the book is that it features a character that is both a hero and a villain, but doesn't really go into great detail about it. It doesn't feel like there is a lot you can take away from it. The plot is very thin and it's pretty difficult to make a connection between everything that is going on. There are also a lot a plot devices that aren't explained as much as they should be. Overall I have to give the book 4 stars. But only because it's a good introduction to the universe of the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********' I've read this novel a few times and I always hate it. I have no clue what the hell they are talking about. I was in my early teens when this book came out, so I was old enough to know better. The book is about a group of teens trying to get a new bike. I don't remember anything in this book about bike racing. There are lots of funny lines in this story about having a bike accident, etc. But there is nothing about bike riding in the book. It's like the characters are trying to tell us something, but don't know how. It was all about how stupid they are for not going to a bike race. I can't say this was a bad novel. It did have some laughs. But this is an awful book. Rating: **** 1/2. The most terrible book I've ever read. Why do people hate this book?
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** The only negative review I can give this book is that it is too long. It's very long, so it makes you feel as though you're going to have to buy the next book to get the whole story. I also found it difficult to keep the information coherent at first, but I think it's necessary. I wouldn't say that it's really a problem, but it's something to keep in mind if you like a lot of info-dumps. But this is a very good book and I would recommend it to people who are interested in how science is used to explain how people think and how the human mind is affected by the way that science works. Recommended for all.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******************************This book was awful. It was supposed to be a story of a man who is born into a world of absolute evil. Instead, I saw the complete opposite, and it made me sick. The main character, the prince of a village in the middle east, was supposed be the only person who had the power to do something about it. Instead he turned into an evil figure who was always right, never wrong. And he was an awful person to the point of being a complete failure. In his book, he talks about how a little girl in his village was murdered by some local criminals. He said that the only way to prevent this from happening again is to have him kill the criminals, and the book told me that he would never go through with it. There was nothing that I could take away from this book other than it was just a bad story. I could tell the author never cared about the story in the slightest. Even the things the people in his book did, he just made it up as he went along. He makes no effort to make this the story of someone who would go against everyone to achieve what he thought was right. He doesn't go out of his way to build the characters in a way that they have flaws, he doesn't do anything with the plot to make me care about what's going on. He is just happy to get the plot in and be done with it, and that's what really killed me about this book. He really doesn't seem to want to be writing a book. I don't think that he even wants to write about stories of good or evil. And there are no characters that I really cared about. And when the good guys did something bad they just seemed to get away with it or got away with something. But the bad guys just got what they deserved. When they got caught, it was because they were doing something really bad and they had to pay for it. And if they didn't like it, well, it's just too bad because then there would be a little justice. Not exactly what I wanted to read when I was reading a book about the prince. So, no, I am not recommending this book to anyone. If you want a book that is just bad, you should read something else. If I had to give this a rating, it would be an average.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________________________________  When I read this book I felt like I was walking into the Twilight Zone.   The book has nothing to do with science or the Bible, but it is the most confusing book I have read in a long time.   to explain how the characters in this book could survive the destruction, you would have to read the book.   at the end of the book I was left with a headache because I could not understand any of the characters.   and I really don't know what the hell happened to those characters. I feel like this book was a waste of my time and I would have loved it more if I had never read it.   (review taken from my blog)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  " I'm trying to think of the worst book I've read, but I just can't. I bought this one for the Kindle, because I hate Amazon and all their DRM and crap, but not only do I have to pay to have the books read back to me, but the service is awful, so if you don't like reading books in your favorite format then you can't read this one at all. Not only does the Kindle format suck but it's hard to read in an easy to read font and the pictures aren't very good. So yeah, I'll give it a zero stars, but don't waste your time reading it anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea what went wrong with this book; this was the first time I have read this series and the first book I ever read. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. There were a few minor plot holes, not the most egregious or major, but one had a character be shot by a sniper who he wasn't even close to being ready to shoot and the other had a guy kill himself. The plot seemed so good I just had to put it down; not a great experience. There are other books I have put down because of plot holes; this one I will give a miss. Read more

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book about the Civil War is, first of all, a terrible book about a terrible subject. The writing is awful and often offensive. I found myself rolling my eyes at every word and rolling my ears out at how bad some of it sounded. If you're a history buff you might as well skip this book, I can't imagine why anyone would read it.   The book is about the Battle of Antietam, the one and only major battle of the Civil war in which the Union was defeated. The author tells the story in the way that one would hear it from the mouth of a soldier. The story is of how these two armies tried to make peace but were thwarted at every turn by an insufferable Union general and a foolhardy Confederate general. The latter is a poor choice of General to lead your troops into battle against, who was so blinded by his ambition that he would rather lose than concede an inch of land. The army has to make three attempts at peace before AntietAM.  , for the most part, I found this to be a very bad book. It is also extremely badly written, and the way it was written, the author seems to have had no understanding whatsoever as to what he was trying to write about. If I read this book for the military history of the American Civil war, I'd have been extremely upset by the way the writer portrayed these two generals. He seems to want to portray the Confederates as evil and evil for the purposes of his writing, I don't know why, and I can understand that, but I think he's just being ignorant, and ignorant people don't write well. The reason I say this is because he uses a lot of historical wrongs to make his points. I can see how a history professor might be influenced by this, but the way he did it seemed wrong to me. For instance, one major source of frustration for the author is the Union, as the author claims, was better equipped to fight the Confederatians. But the author doesn't seem to understand that during the war most of the Union soldiers were farmers, poor, and poorly fed. It would have been easier for the Union to fight and win the war if the Union government had had the means to buy enough food for its soldiers. Also the author makes the point that there was a strong Union sense of identity, and a Union sense that they were fighting for themselves and their families, whereas the Confederacy was
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found it difficult to read the book as I had already bought it.  The writing was rough and my attention span was too short.   The Good:  Story - this book has so much potential and so much to tell.  This is my second book by a author with an Indian background and a girl who is a witch.  She writes with a very unique voice and I was hooked.  As I was reading I wondered what would happen if you took a very famous female character and put her into a world full of male characters and magic.  I thought, this book is a mix of the fairy tale, the romance, the science fiction, and the political fiction.  The ending and the way in which it was written are very creative and the story is not one where the female characters just fade away.  There is a lot to look forward to here and it will be interesting to read from the perspective of a witch and the author's daughter, who is still in school.  Characters - I loved how she brought all these characters together.  Katelyn is not the only girl who can change the world, she is just one of the most gifted in the world.  Also, the male characters are well-realized.  They are not just some stereotype and that makes the world and the politics feel real.  For instance, one of my favorite characters was the protagonist, who was a student leader who was trying to make a difference.  He is a very sympathetic character and he didn't give up on any of his ideals.   Also, I love the little things in this book, like the way Katelynn is able to be strong on the outside but also caring and compassionate inside. The Bad: The Plot - I hated how slow it was.  It's a slow read.  In the beginning I felt the book was slow and boring, but then after a while, I thought about how the author has been working in all these stories and how they are related to one another.  What this made me feel was the reader was being a slave to the author and she was giving him free reign in her writing.  At one point I was thinking, she could have done it in one day.   Overall, I think the book is well written and has a good story to tell, I can't wait to read what comes next. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I was surprised by the lack of depth or a coherent message in this book. It seems to be a collection of stories written by various authors, some of which have more than a passing similarity to the plots of The Hobbit. Some of the stories are interesting, others are just "well-told tales." I can understand the author's motives, but they did not lead to a good story." I read this in the 90's, and it was on my list of books I needed to get back into before I was done reading this year. I was pleasantly surprised by this book - the last story in the book was a lot of fun and was one of my favorites in my collection of books about The Hobbit. There is definitely some originality and humor to the stories, and the plot is fairly interesting, although it does take a while to figure out the order and what is happening in the different stories. The characters were all enjoyable, and I liked the fact that they were different (for different reasons, I should add). Overall, this is a fun book that is worth reading. My only complaint is the fact I think it could have been a bit longer. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________  A tale of two books   I will admit:  I was a big fan of this book from the first chapter.   The plot is so clever that it gets my attention for a few pages but the problem is, the plot only gets worse and worse.   The main protagonist is a man who lives with his mother. His father is never in the house, only a distant figure from the past who leaves letters for him at odd hours. When the man turns 18, he receives a letter from the man who is never seen. The letter tells the boy that he must leave his home and go to a town far away. A boy from the town has a strange disease, and when he turns 18 he is no longer allowed to come back to his family. A mysterious man has come from that town to collect the boy's debt. So the man takes the boy to the town in search of a cure. He is accompanied by his female companion, who he loves deeply. He begins to realize the problems of this strange boy and that this man has not given him what he deserves.   for this reason he is the hero of this novel. I'm not saying he is too perfect, because he is not. But what he needs is more depth and development. He needs to grow more. If he had developed his character as well as the main character and his companion, the story would have had more depth. I love the premise of this story and the characters and their relationship.   of course it starts out funny, but as it goes on it gets darker and darker and then it reaches a very sad and heartbreaking ending. The book is not a happy story, I think it's a very tragic story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________ This was one of those books that was very hard to get through. I finished it in one sitting because I was so absorbed in the story, and I couldn't let it go. The characters were well-developed, and the book was good, but the plot line felt very haphazard. It would have been nice if we could get more information about the history of the town.   _________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know who it is, but that guy in the book always sounds like he's reading aloud in a bar. He's never wrong and usually he's just as wrong as the narrator. I think the story could have been better, the writing was awkward at times, the characters were like cardboard cut out characters. I really loved the ending. I hope there's a sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very poor. When I first read the cover copy of the book, I got excited and went online to check it out. The description of the character "The White Wolf" was intriguing. "The white wolf is the most feared of the many types of wolves found in North America. He is an outlander who is a master of disguise. His wolf's coat is a bright yellow, and his eyes are red. He has the ability to mimic the voices of others. He knows no other language. This one thing sets him apart from all other wolves." Well, let me start by saying that the book is not that good. The writing is weak, and the story is really just a series of incidents, none of them really relevant, none relevant in any way to the main plot, except for the fact that they may make you wonder, and if you want to make the case that the wolf is a real animal, you can. The main character is not a real wolf. He doesn't have the ability that the white wolf does. He does not live on the outskirts, or around the campfire. He's not a true wolf in that sense. It doesn't matter much to me that he's a wolf. I was disappointed in the story. It took me awhile to even get to know the wolves, and even then it was not as much a question of understanding the wolf as it was understanding how the wolves interact with other wolves. All the main characters are just very ordinary people, with ordinary lives, who happen to have the power to shape-shift into wolves. As I read the book and began to wonder if the wolves are real animals, I began to see that the story was more about the human's efforts to understand how the wolf interacts with other wolf's and vice versa, and what that means, and how wolves are different from other animals. It was a story that was more interesting to me than the actual book. At the same time, I found it odd that no one in the book was ever able to figure out if the wolf was real or not. There was no way to get any information out of the wolf except for what he told you, and I guess that's all you can hope for from a character in a book like this. I know that the author says the main character will learn that the wolves aren't real after he learns how the white wolves are able to talk, but I never could figure out what that was about,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First, I have to say I was absolutely surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. There were parts of it that were really interesting but I felt a lot of the plot holes were glaring in terms of logic or lack of it. For example, one of the main characters is supposed to have lost her family, and then was taken in by a family who didn't know her real family, only her father. But her father didn't just take her in as if they were family, he told her the whole truth about her mother and sisters. This was a very cool story, but what really got to me was how the father came to a decision to leave her with this family despite knowing this was not his family.   Then there was the way in which he was treated, and how it was made known to everyone else that he was the illegitimate son of this woman. He just had to hide that fact and not tell anyone until the day he decided to leave. I found this very disturbing and weird.   to top it all off, he was a terrible father, always taking advantage of his young daughter and taking advantage on her. I would never want to live a life like that. The way this book was written made me feel very dirty thinking about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a disappointment. I gave this three stars. I was expecting a good read, I liked this author, I would have liked to like this book but, oh well. This book had no plot, it had no characters, it was very predictable and boring. I did not enjoy this book one bit.   1/2 star - this is a book I read after I finished a different book (I won't tell you which) that is about people with Alzheimer's who want to be a part of something new and exciting. This was an old book I had read before that my friend wanted me to read. I went ahead and gave it a shot. I knew what I was getting into because I have this thing about books about Alzheimer's and dementia. So, it got to the part about a young woman's Alzheimer's, it really was predictable. I thought what the heck. I am going to read it, because that was my friend's. I got through the first page or so. So here it is: a young person's mother passes away, she is left with the responsibility of her daughter's care and carelessness, but she just wants her to be healthy. She decides that it is about time she gave her daughter her own job, she wants to go to school, take out loans, buy the house she's living in, and make her own choices. So the daughter is to work and save money. The daughter decides that her mother will not be able to help her, but can help her take care of her younger sister and brother. So she goes into debt and does some of the work she needs to do to provide for herself and her siblings, but it's not enough and it's hard, and she doesn't know what to do, and her mother tells her she can't do it. And when she gets home, her mother is there waiting for her. The mother had been at home dying, the daughter had been going through things with her mother, and this was a way to be with her mom. She tells her mother what she wants, the mother says "no." So, the mom dies. The only reason the daughter was able to get through that and move on with her life was because of her mother.   The rest is just a recap of the book, like a typical family life. No characters, no plot. If you are looking for a novel about Alzheimer and dementia, I wouldn't bother. It was
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************** *********** * This is a fun read. It's a "what if?" story of a man that gets in an accident and wakes up in a hospital. The reason he was at the accident was he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The book doesn't go very in depth on what happened but the story does keep you interested. * I liked the author's style and the way he told the story. He also had a couple interesting characters. * The characters in the story are a little generic but they are all interesting and you'll probably get along with them. * It was interesting that this story took place in a very different world from ours. * There were a few places in the book that confused me. * Would recommend if you enjoy a fun but educational read.  0 of 0 found this review helpful

It's a very poor story with bad characters, a good plot, and a good ending, but a poor plot.  The plot is bad.  That is all.  Not worth my time.  I have the DVD and it's worth watching it.   You have to watch the movie, though, before you can really judge this book.   That was the one thing that kept me reading and re-reading it. 5-0 Rating

Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~~This is an example of how some authors write good books. I enjoyed this book, but it is a very basic, not very original story. It's about a girl, who is supposed to be a witch but she is not. So the plot is basic. But, this story is good. ~~ I also have to admit that the author did a good job at writing a good plot, but she did a really bad job at describing the different emotions and feelings of a witch. The descriptions are short, and you could almost say that the writing was bad (like the characters' voices). I would have given this book 5 stars if the author would have been more creative with the language.  Helpful but not very interesting and I didn't like the girl much.I enjoyed the book, I just didn't understand why I enjoyed it so much (and why the author loved this character so much.)

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I tried to read The Great Gatsby on a Kindle and didn't like it. I can't even say what the plot is about. The story was hard to get into and really dragged down the reading experience." (Posted by: randymccoy on May 16, 2014 9:05 am)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book was bad. " For most people, the book should be a great read. It is a great story with a great character. But this book wasn't. There are two reasons for my negative review: 1. The story is boring. We get about 3-4 pages of exposition before we begin to see the "evil" side of the character. The other two "evil side" characters are interesting and develop nicely throughout the book, but they aren't even given enough time to develop. 2. The characters. The main character, Max, is a young girl, with a young child in her arms, who lives in a small town. Her character development happens so fast you can barely keep up. The only real character development we get is Max's relationship with her friend and father, John. They do develop and it's interesting, but the end of the book is almost entirely spent on the story of John. 3. The plot. The book spends most of its time setting up all the little plot points that we will be using to move the plot forward. There is no build up in the book for the character's thoughts about what their plan is or why it might succeed or fail. We find out all of this at the very beginning of the novel. There should be more build up on the characters. 4. The ending. The conclusion is rushed. At the end we do finally see the villain, the "dark side", and he doesn't do anything that is bad. But, it feels more like a story from a movie than a true horror novel. 5. The editing. This book isn't very well edited. It feels like the author tried to make it as much like a horror novel as possible without trying to do anything too different from what she is used to. It comes across as rushed, very amateurish and lacking creativity.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really like the books I've read by Michael Chabon. I can't remember what he did right. His books seem to be a bit more like personal essays. I love it when a good writer writes about himself, but sometimes it is hard for me to like the person being covered. In this case, it's a bit hard to read the character's perspective.  It's not that the book is bad. I just feel a bit lost. It's a good read for the family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of my favorite stories, but with a great deal of unnecessary plot holes that I felt the writer could have easily left out and still had the reader enjoy the story.   Another review:    - 5/5 -- This is a book that I always recommend to anyone that enjoys a good mystery and I always enjoy the writing.     I love the pacing of the story, although, I don't know how I felt about the ending. It would have been nice to know more about the case before this, as well as some of the clues I felt were not given. It wasn't a problem reading the story as is though.   If you like mysteries, then I would highly recommend this to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________. I don't know if the author's intention is to be ironic, to be a tongue-in-cheek commentary on modern consumerism, or to be both, but I donít think I would even be able to tell that there was an agenda to the way that the book was written. The book is not bad because the author had no idea how to write a book in a way that would appeal to the modern reader. The story was told well, in the spirit of what is currently popular, and for a great adventure. There are several great descriptions of places in the book that you would never know existed. This is a very fast read. It's been several months since I first read the book, and I've still been learning new things about my surroundings.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________ A terrible book. No matter how much I try to read it, I can't finish it. I can do nothing but throw it out the window and scream at the top of my lungs how terrible it is.  I'm sorry, but what an abomination of a book! I love the old sci-fi stories, but this book is so unbalanced. I could not read another word of it, not one. It was horrible! This is the worst sci-fiction book I've ever read, the worst book I have ever finished. I will never read another one. I am a big fan of the classic sci-fis, but if the author can't even write well about them, I don't want to read one more word. .  "There is only one thing worse than death: the silence of the void."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know what it is about this book. This is a story I read over and over and it is the one that stuck out in my mind.  As I started reading it I found myself completely engaged in this book and the characters.    This book is written with a strong and powerful female character that stands out in a story full of strong and capable men.  She is a very different story and I think that this author did an excellent job with her story.  I recommend this book highly.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________ I've read this book as a teenager. I was excited to find it on ebay a few months ago and decided to give it a try. I read the review for this book, which was really only half a page. As a teenager I read a lot of things I shouldn't have. I got distracted and ended up reading something I really didn't want to read. I would never recommend this book to anyone. I don't care for the idea of teenagers reading this kind of stuff, especially one where the author isn't well-known. I've never been a fan of teen angst.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I bought this book because I wanted to be able to read it before it was published, however the book is so bad that I don't understand how the author could even write it. The book is the kind of book that you have to read in one sitting. The story is about a young man who is trapped in a cage that he was forced to enter by his abusive parents. The main character is a very interesting character who is very nice and the things that happen to him are very well written. He manages to escape from the cage and the book then jumps forward 3 years in his life. The thing that I hate about the book are all the things he does to keep himself alive. He eats, drinks, sneezes, and he does all sorts of stupid things to stay alive. The best part about the story is the main character, though he does bad things, he does them in a very nice way and the good things that he does is really nice to read about. I am very disappointed that the author even has to write a book that has the main protagonist eat poop in order to survive. I hope the author can get away from this type of thing. (I have heard from people who bought this that the main female character is the most hated character.) ********** I also have to mention that this book is very long. I have read all the main characters books and they always ended on a cliffhanger, and this is the same with this book. You will not get any closure in this book, not a single thing. The only reason you will finish this book will be because you have finished reading the other books in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book quite distressing, and it seems to be a common problem among readers with this problem, and I'd like to give some tips for it's better, but here, let's put the book aside for a moment. The book is about a man named Bob, who is a professor at a college in San Francisco, and is trying to understand the world and what is happening in it, because he is very unhappy, and he's working on his thesis, and so on. What really concerns me is that when Bob reads a book, he always takes it as if it was a diary of a person who just got out of a mental hospital. This is not the case at all. This book is a history of the world, and not just in the modern age, it's also in ancient times, in the era when Christianity and the religion of the East is spreading. So it is a very good history. This doesn't sound very good, and yet the book is not bad. The author, Tom Robbins, is a professional historian, and you would think that you would have read a lot of historical books before you came to read this one. In fact, you probably have read only one book on history, which is about the period of American independence, and probably a lot more on other things as well, so you might be a little bit bored. But, you know, I had to read a number of books before I could get a grasp of the subject matter in this book. And I don't mean boring as in uninteresting, but it's hard to understand, because I didn't know the history of this area, I didn;t have any information about it, I just know this author did. I don;t know whether the writer is just a good writer, or whether he really knows the subject, but nevertheless the writing is very good and you don't feel like you are reading the diary of somebody who got out after twenty-two years in a mental institution. It seems that Mr. Robbins knew the subject very well, or at least he knows the author, but there are no words on the page which would indicate that he knows about the subject as well as the author does. There were just too many words on a page which seemed to be very similar to each other. So, there was not much of a sense of immersion in the text, which made the reading more of a form of therapy. I think the writing itself
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I love this book. However, one aspect of the story has been very distracting: the story of a girl and her brother. She's a beautiful girl with a wonderful sense of style. She has a little brother, a little boy who doesn't look half as nice. One night they were on a visit and they went to the opera and while they were there her brother took a shine to her. They're really good together. However that's when the trouble starts: they go out together to the circus. There's a big elephant and he's trying to kill them. She fights it off and she gets her finger caught in a hook. And the next morning she wakes up with a bad hand. But the little boy says "it's because of the elephant", which means they both get hurt. And that's what really bothers me. I like the story. I can't wait to see the book come out. However I'm disappointed about this story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- The story:   I was completely shocked by this book.   We are first introduced to a new character named Peter, who starts out as the friend of a woman whose husband, George, is involved with an extremely high class prostitute. After meeting Peter, the prostitute begins to tell us that George has a very attractive woman and Peter immediately wants to have sex with her.   The prostitute is a beautiful, young, pretty-faced woman, but Peter is not interested in her. The man and woman then go to George's house to play cards and Peter goes into George's room and starts to talk to the woman. The prostitute gets upset and leaves the room and Peter sees that the woman's husband, a man, is in the room. Then he immediately realizes that George and the woman are the same person and starts trying to seduce George into the woman that he just had sex with. Peter then leaves and goes back home and talks to his wife. She then goes to a restaurant and tries to impress the waitress by ordering a $10 menu while they talk in the restaurant. Peter leaves the restaurant and is told by his wife that the waitress is "just not interested" in him. He then goes back to the bar where the bartender is a woman and starts drinking with her, because she is obviously a great girl. They then decide to go out to dinner later in the night. However, because the waitress does not seem interested in him, Peter starts asking her for sex and she is not having it. Peter comes to a fork in the road. He either has to go back to his first choice or he has to get a new girl. He goes back with the waitress, but she becomes upset and tries a drink of some kind. Then they go back for dinner and after they eat, Peter tells her that he does not want to continue because she seems to be too "mature" for him. Then the waitress walks out, and Peter is now left with two options. One of which he will be getting a prostitute or a stripper. If he chooses the stripper, he will have sex without a condom, because he is a virgin. However if he chooses a prostitute, he would have to do without a lot of sex in order to get pregnant.  ...   That was it. That was the plot, not even a speck of a plot. I was completely confused by this.   a review of a bad novel:  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book didn't make me want to read more books, instead, I feel like it's a lot of wasted time. I don't feel like the main characters are well developed, they are bland and don't seem to have any personality. The world is very dry. This is a book that you could easily spend 50-60 minutes on, and I really wish that it was only 30-40 minutes to get to the good parts. This was really just an excuse to spend so much time, the characters are boring and repetitive. I read this book before i knew what a romance was, and it was really confusing.  The plot: The main characters, Margo and her son Benji, are both orphans, so naturally they will be friends. They are adopted at the age of three, so they have a lot in common, but that doesn't make them friends. Benji's father, Ben is the oldest brother and Margo the youngest. Ben is older than Margo, and always tries to make himself look older, and because of that, he often gets bullied by other boys, who think that Benji is gay. He is the perfect example of a character that should be killed off in every book.   What I liked: The world building is pretty well done, the description of the world, the history of it was amazing.  The main character, Benji also was very likable, he was a bit annoying at times, but he was actually a nice character, and i liked him.  It's not often that a book manages to be so good, that is really hard to do, so I really enjoyed it, but there are really good books out there that are just better.  I hope that this will inspire people to read other books, the story wasn't too long, so if you like good characters, this is definitely a book you should read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bad representation of how many of our Christian sisters/brothers live.  I felt like reading it.  The main character is a gay Christian that is trying to deal with the shame he feels for being gay while living in a family of Christians.  I felt it was a poor portrayal of the reality of life for Christians today.  It is not a good representation of the lives of most Christians.  If you read this book you will be missing out on some great information about faith, the Bible, family, and life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first and only copy of this book was a terrible choice. I didn't want to waste my time and money with it and was more than disappointed. In the first half of the book I had no clue what to expect from this story and I was left completely confused and not even remotely satisfied. This story starts off with a man being tortured by his ex-wife and has little to do with anything that happened before this. She wants to take his children for a drive and this is where the story begins. He wants to go along but she refuses. The story then moves forward and we see that this woman is married to her ex. They have children and have been together for years and years and this story is about the children and how they are being raised. I can't help but think that this book started off like most, a love story. This woman is pregnant and doesn't want anyone else. She is being punished for this by the man who she loved and trusted. This is where I began to think that I wouldn't like this book. I mean who would give up everything they are for one child? Now I realize the man is being forced to raise the children in a situation where they have no friends or siblings. I just thought that would be very hard and I don't even know how to describe it. I'm sorry I gave this book a bad review, I just can't seem to get past this first half. It just seems like it was written by someone who doesn't know a thing about children or families or love. I also found it very confusing.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This is not a bad read. I know it's supposed to be a detective story. I don't know how you could write a book in the style of a mystery without being really bad at it. But this one is bad. My main problem was that the main character is so dumb and stupid, I was not able to understand anything he was saying. The characters and settings were so cliche and one-note. I had to do a lot of rewinding and re-reading the entire thing just to make sense of it all. As far as a bad mystery goes, this isn't even in the top 10.  12 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing that kept me going through this book was the fact that I could relate it to my real life. I think that's important when you are dealing with so many problems and things that you have to make choices in life.  It's sad that I couldn't relate to the character at all. There were other characters that I just couldn't get into. I wanted to be in this book, but there were some characters that were very annoying.  I didn't understand why they needed to get so much from one person that it needed to be done by one person.  And last but not least... The author was just so damn good.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  -This is a really bad book. -If you want to know how bad a book is you should just read it. -The narrator is terrible -There are two people who were clearly trying too hard to get a man killed. The author doesn't have any clue what's going on, the narrative is nonsensical and confusing. -They do an incredibly stupid plot twist at the end that I could not believe. -I'm going to call out two of the characters because they were terrible. "I never could believe that a woman could talk like that." "It was like he had some deep, dark secret that would come to the surface with the death of his wife and children." The book is really about two characters: Mrs. B. and her son, John. Mrs.B. was the middle-aged mother of two boys. Her marriage to John was going badly. He was a drunk who cheated on her, and she was constantly harassed by her ex-husband. Her son, who was nine years old at the time, was very ill. One night John killed his mother and set fire to her house. Mrs B. was very upset with the incident, and later committed suicide by drinking poison. The narrator says: "The only thing she could think of was how to get back at him. She needed him to understand she'd been wrong and that there was nothing in her life that he could do to change it." As a reader I was just appalled by Mrs.D's behaviour, and I have never been more shocked by anyone in the books before. I can only hope that Mrs. D. is not a real person. I did find the plot twist, however, really interesting. I will read more of her stories. I have read a couple of other books where a narrator had a difficult marriage and took their own life, but this one was the most unbelievable thing I have ever read in the world of fiction. This book has really turned me off the idea of reading about depression. I'm not sure if I will continue reading about them, because I think it will be even more depressing. I am really hoping that this book will help people, and that depression can be treated. If so, it was not worth the read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________ __________________ I bought this book to use in my Christian book club. I was very pleased with it except that there was an excessive amount of sexual content. I will not buy it again. I think it is inappropriate for a Christian to be reading about sex. Thank you for reading this book. _________________________________________  The title of this book was so fitting, and yet so wrong. This is a book that was not intended to promote Christianity, but rather, to expose, and in so doing, expose the flaws that plague Christian doctrines and practices. While the book is intended as a "blissful truth" in that there are no errors and the book does present Biblical truths, the "blithe" part is not in the least true.   The book is littered with obvious errors, from a clear statement of Jesus' sexual sins to a bizarre definition of marriage as a relationship between "the man" and the woman. The author tries to twist all of these Biblical concepts into a new meaning or, better stated, into a marriage between God and humanity. The result is a disjointed work that will leave no one with much to hang their hat on, and that is a shame.   The book has also been criticized for some of its other flaws. The title is certainly not an accurate descriptor of this work. This book, for those that read it, is an embarrassment. I don't understand how someone with a good understanding of Scripture could agree to write this book, especially with a title like that. If this book is truly a "glad-to-have" book, then the author should have at least tried to do a few things right. Unfortunately, this book does very little of either.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** This book was the definition of a train wreck. It was boring and repetitive, and the plot was so bad that it almost made me want to quit reading it. My mom just had a baby, and I was able to find the book on my mom's nightstand the other night to read and she just told me that she just wanted to read this book to herself. I wanted to stop the book right there because the story was so boring. The main character is a young boy named Joshua who has the ability to go to the place in his brain where other people's memories reside and he can access those memories. In the beginning of the book he is learning to read, but in the end, he doesn't get any further and the book ends with him asking if he should continue on. The book is supposed to be a psychological thriller, but there were no psychological suspense moments for me, just a dull and repetitive plot. I don't know what to say except that this book was terrible and there is no way in hell I was going to continue reading it and recommend it to anyone. I have no idea what it was that made me like the characters so much. I liked that they weren't real people, but I just wish there was more than three main characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________  "The only thing I'm upset about is that I don't know what the fuck it is about, other than it's really fucking stupid. It's not even the plot that's stupid; it's that it's just some dude who wants to be in a superpowers team and somehow convinces every female member he meets into falling in love with him and then gets them to sign contracts so he can kill them all. He also gets a female member of the team to let him be the lead because he's a superhero. I know this story sounds like some horrible, over-the-top fanfic, but it's not. It was written by a man. You shouldn't hate men for wanting to be superheroes, but you shouldn't accept it either. The reason I didn't hate this book was because it's still a decent read for those who don't mind some dumb romance thrown in to make things interesting. It just didn't hit any of the necessary levels of stupidity that make this kind of book special."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** "I have read so many bad novels. This one I enjoyed a lot, but as a novel it was more bad than good. It was a good read, but not one I'll repeat."  This book has many things I liked. I love a good mystery, so I was intrigued by the premise. I was looking forward to reading the novel, but that didn't work out.   This novel has some good ideas. The mystery was enjoyable to read. I can imagine a lot of people really enjoying this novel. However, it had several flaws. I found it interesting that he never told his audience why he wanted to write this novel but kept the reader guessing. There was a lot that was left unexplained, which made the story hard to follow.   and I liked the mystery. I wanted to know what happened, I didn't like his characters, they were flat, and the ending made me think there was a plot that just went to pieces. I know it was a thriller and a mystery, but it was really a bit of an anticlimax, to say the least.   with the mystery I enjoyed it, but with the characters I didn-t. it just didn't come together for me.  The novel also has a lot about death, but this one was the most obvious of the three books. I would have liked to know more about him.   on one final note, this novel is really long, but the mystery has a fair pace, so it was not overwhelming. I think I will have to buy the sequel and the collection of other works to see how well the other books work. I don't know if I would recommend this novel to a friend.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________ The story is amazing (and a true story) but the author is a poor writer and she should have tried harder to make her story interesting. The problem is the ending. I was really hoping she would go into more detail about her life and how it affected her. I guess that wouldn't make sense because she doesn't know that many people (like me) would believe her story. If she had written about the beginning of her life, which would have helped to add more depth to her story, I would have read it!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is terrible. I bought it expecting a great story that would tell me why I should follow the Bible. Unfortunately, it was really just an apologetic for the Christian religion. "I am not going to make you like me, and I'm not going tell you how to think, but I'm going to tell you why I think as I do and how I live, and how much it matters to me. I have been raised by a single Christian mother and a pastor father, and my mother and I have gone through all of these years of trying to teach the gospel and living in a world that doesn't agree with that gospel."

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and then read my old one. I think the story and setting are quite a bit different, and the characters, well, are not as developed as they were before. But, I can forgive that because I never got into it. There are very few people who are willing to die in order to save the rest of their race, and when they do, their deaths are a little different than they were in the other one. It was a little weird that the main character of this one died in such an unnatural manner. The world was interesting enough, although it never took me all that far.

It had been years since I had seen any of the previous movies in the series, so I had prepared myself to accept all of the changes and disappointments of the show. I was very disappointed with this book, which is not really the intention of the movie itself, I was disappointed because I did not like much of the characters and the way that they were introduced.   After reading the book, I felt that I could have made my own decisions on how I wanted the story to go. The story really could have gone anywhere and I really think that the characters could have been changed up to a greater extent. The main character is actually kind of a horrible person but that was just an easy way of introducing him. He is basically just a very selfish, conniving, greedy person who would do anything for any reason. When I watched the movie, I thought that they really could of used a better narrator or something. His voice was very grating and really did not convey his character. The acting is really bad in the movie and it has nothing to do with the characters. It really does not. It's just a lot of cliches and one liners that I really didn't like. I'm not going to even try and describe the dialog because I do not like it and it just doesn't sound believable. This book could have taken place in any of a number of different times and all of those different versions would have made the movie a better film and a more enjoyable story.   "Cooper" is a good example of what can happen if you just take the easy way out. I think that this book would have been a good movie if the story had taken a more interesting direction, but I guess that is the price that some authors are willing to pay to try and get the attention of some major movie studios.   a bad review: __________________________________________________________________________   This book has so much to recommend it. It is not a bad read, but it is a very slow paced and boring read. I did enjoy the story and I did feel that it could have turned out very differently. However, it was so boring that I had to finish the book really fast. The ending was lame and made me sad. I didn't even enjoy this movie and I
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so badly written that it is embarrassing, but it is also really, really sad. I thought I would like the book. I loved  The  Book of the Damned  from the first page and, despite being a total newbie, I found it to be engaging and quite informative. When I was finishing the book I had so many questions that I thought would be answered but were never; the writing was just so poor that it just turned off me. I will definitely not be returning to this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book, and by that I mean a very bad book. It is written by a man who has made a career out of bashing homosexuals, but I never found him to be a good writer. In this book he attacks the gay community in the strongest way he possibly could in order to increase his popularity. It turns out that he is the kind of person who believes that you must hate your enemies in order for them to become your friends. He wants to destroy them and to make their lives hell so that he can have a good time at their expense. What he gets out of it is a series of disgusting anecdotes which he puts down in the most insulting way possible. I was not looking forward to reading this book. I wanted to hate it, and I had a hard time hating it because, for once, I didn't hate it myself. In fact I think it was a bit of a delight! It was an enjoyable read that I felt that I could not put down. The only thing I hated about the book was how it ends. I really thought it was terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a horrible book that I had to stop reading because of the horrible writing. My friend was reading the book and she had to give it back because it was so bad. It was so horrible and the writing was like a big jumbled mess and it made me feel like my brain was being attacked by a thousand bees and I didn't want to look at it.  It was very disheartening.  I can't imagine how someone could have enjoyed this book, it was just awful.  I will never read another book like this and no doubt it will be on my "Borrowed Reading List" list.   I give it 3 1/2 stars for the story and 2 stars for all the annoying parts of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________ My friends and I recently bought a copy of "The Last Samurai." It's a great book about a great Samurai, but the narrator was so far away from the story, and the ending was a mess, I couldn't even get that part over with. In the end I felt the book had a lack of tension and conflict, and I can't say the same about the first book "The Boy in the River" either. But I'm sure most people who bought this book will get past the first few pages and get into the story. "The Little Prince" was the other book in this series that had a lot of problems for me and I'm disappointed I bought it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book as an undergraduate and it was just a terrible book. I did not like it at all.

I could not find any redeeming quality to this book other than its length which makes this book the least worth reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been a fan of the "Gingerbread" series since the first one. And to my dismay, this one was as bad as the first. The story was predictable. It had all the elements that make me not like this genre, namely: overly long descriptions that have nothing to do with the story at hand; characters I knew nothing about and the author couldn't give me a lick of information about their motivations; and a lot of filler, as well as a lot more information that is completely irrelevant to the story.   The protagonist, Anna, is the type of person that makes me not want to read about any other books with her in them. Anna is the only female character in the story and the only character who gets any development, aside from the fact that she's a teen. I'm sure the author intended to have more female characters in the series but they all seem to die. I have a feeling that the author only put the male characters in there to pad out the story, and only put in the female characters for one reason and one reason only: to get more money out of the fans.   at least there is one male character in this book who is named George.   a bad female character:   Anna is the character that gets the most development of any character in her story and that isn't even saying much. I mean her first two scenes in this story were so over the top it made me not care about her at all. In fact, the more I thought about it the more it reminded me of those annoying, boring girls who seem to be everywhere in stories. And if you don't remember the "Cinderella" movie, this book would be like "The Swan Princess" in that regard.   of course, it wasn't that bad. This book is more of a "mildly entertaining novel".   Overall Rating: 3/5
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ I hate it. It was very annoying because I had to put in a lot of effort to get the dialogue right. It's the same for all these new authors who write for children and teenagers. It makes no sense that they can write a paragraph and get a quote on it, but they can't get a complete dialogue for an adult, especially a woman. The character was boring to me, I don't think it's an adult female character, but it's a girl. The way I think about it, I've read more that 50 books written by guys. It seems like they have a lot more character development. Anyway, I was looking for something more than I could get out of this book and this book is not that book. It has a couple of good scenes, and it's very entertaining, but not much more.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I really thought this book was a total failure, at least for me. But it was ok, not great, not bad. I liked the premise and I could see it having potential to be a good story. But in the end it really was just a bunch of filler, I think for the sake of the authors writing career. And I also don't care for the characters, because they are so cardboard like and unrealistic. (They are like the characters in the book with the same name.) I found it hard to care about their plight, which is really sad. I think the book could have been better if it didn't have so many bad reviews on it, so I guess I am just not one to be bothered by what is written. But I think that for the rest of you I think this one is okay. I guess. But for me it was a disappointment, at best.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm going to give this book four stars if the author (M.A.R. Barker) isn't a copycat and only writes about her own work.   If you read through the rest of this review, you will see that I love the characters, the story, the setting and the action. However, the characters were so boring, I found it hard to care about the story that was told. The writing style was clunky and the writing style is terrible. And the book is about a young woman who kills a man with a crossbow. Why? She gets to be the hero of her own story!   The main character is a very annoying character who does not think she is being clever by making some of the most stupid choices of all the main characters. I would have rather listened to the man who thinks he is in love with a woman who can make fire and eat rocks than this annoying character. He is the reason why the story is clunky.   the story was interesting but the author never used the main character enough.   is a book about a girl who kills someone with a gun that can make a hole in the ground that can be walked through. There was no need for this plot twist that made it impossible for the main female protagonist to actually do anything. In the end, it just made the main plot even less interesting and made this book more tedious. I give this a 3.5 stars and I would recommend it to people who want something very simple and entertaining. It has nothing that would make it stand out on a bestseller list but it would be better than the vast majority of YA books and that's all I'm looking for.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this as a teen because I had read it a number of times in the past. I have not had the slightest interest in it in about ten years now, so I was pleasantly surprised to be reminded of it again. I'm not sure what I would have done with it had I remembered it, since I've never been a huge fan of it (though, to be fair, I have the same fondness for many of my other favorites). I suppose I would be glad to have the memories of a book that is completely unsuitable for young teens, but that isn't really what I got. It was a little disappointing because it didn't really do anything much different from the other books I know, and it seemed to take itself a lot more seriously than I expected it to. The characters are all really cute, but most of the time there really isn't much going on for them. There was one or two attempts at some story-telling, but I thought they were pretty flat. It's fun to see the young characters in various settings, but there wasn't anything here that really stood out to me, and I don't think it was really a good fit for young readers.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- This book was an absolute waste of time and energy. It gave no insight into how to improve a child's self esteem or how to teach a child to control his temper or behave properly. The writer has no experience or knowledge of any kind in child development. She talks about ways to increase self esteem and behavior issues but no one listens or believes any of it. The book is filled with bad advice from experts, many of whom do not even use the term self esteem. And the book just repeats the same old information over and over again without adding anything new. My mother in law used to take me to this bookstore to buy books and movies for me as a child. She used to have a wonderful story teller and it was a nice experience. This book is the exact same thing but it is filled w/ bad advice and no new info. I cannot recommend this book. There is no way this was a fun way to pass time. It was a waste of my time. And I'm not the only one who felt this way. (3/10)  Overall Rating: ---------------  This review is written based on a limited edition of this book and not all the content is present in the hard copy of the book. I was surprised that the book only has five stars after reading through the whole thing.   - 5 stars for the information about self esteem that is in the book but I will only give it five stars based on the info in the back of the copy I read-   (1 star for poor design)  with the back cover of the hardcover copy I received-     "A Book for Parents and Children to Understand Self Esteem & Emotional Control"   How can you explain self esteem to someone who does not have it? You must understand that we are human beings. We come in all shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages. We learn to accept our own limitations and talents and abilities, but our true selves are always there to see us, to know us and be proud of us. We should all realize that we have been given our special talents and gifts and the world has a responsibility to honor them. Emotions run high when our talents and special gifts are recognized. We love and accept ourselves and others. But the emotions can get out of control. So we must learn how to control them. This is an interesting book. It is clear and concise. It describes the four basic emotions in

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I really don't know what to say about this book except to say that it is not worth the effort of reading it. The characters are the most shallow I have ever read, with the exception of the bad guy, and their only problem is that they are stupid. I can only guess that their entire world is constructed from the stupidity of their main characters. It's as if their goal is to get an intelligent person to become a stupid person. It really isn't worth reading if you are looking for deep characters and thought-provoking plots. Read it for the characters though, and enjoy. (March 4, 2014, 7:57 am)  Reviewer: b_jim_jr - - May 4, 2010  Subject: Wrong!   For those who've asked, this book is not about evil people being good or good people being evil. I found it in the children's section of the library.   "A wonderful, well-paced book for children and teenagers, this is a fun read that will help to build social and verbal skills." - Library Journal   Also, the character in the beginning of the book was actually a nice person - a little kid whose parent was a priest. They lived near each other in a small village and the kid grew up with the priest and the little boy is the only character who has a name, and is a nice guy who cares about people and his family.   for those who'd like to buy the book - it's available at a good price at Amazon.com. For those who haven't read it yet, buy it. You'll enjoy it and it's not hard. - May 11, 2010Wrong!For those.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a pretty horrible read. I thought this was supposed to be the story of a guy in his 30s who meets a woman in his 50s at a bar. She's been there a lot and is friendly. I was really looking forward to reading this book. But it was just boring. I'm tired of seeing the same names that appear in other writers' books on my shelf, but this book isn't even by them. If you like fantasy or romance you will probably enjoy it but I found this book pretty dull. I'd give this book 2 stars, but it just keeps getting worse, no change at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********This book was really interesting but it was really, really boring. The book is not about a man, it is about a book and is a great example of why I do not have patience with books that are all about a person.This is a very good example of the idea that a good book can be boring. The book was a collection of anecdotes and is the first in a series. The anecdotes in the book are funny but very few people will get any of them. The stories are boring because I don't think they are the right time to read about a guy who is an alcoholic and was an airline pilot in the 1960's. There is no action. There are no characters. There isn't anything that is surprising. There really isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. So I gave this book 3 stars. The second one might be my own fault as this book is really hard to get into. There aren't any characters who stick out like a sore thumb and the whole book is all about anecdotes and stories. If you are looking for a boring book to read, I would recommend this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to love this book, and I do. The writing was very good and the prose was clear and concise. However, the main character, Sarah, did not live up to my expectations. I enjoyed her story a lot, but the main problem is that she doesn't live up. In her life and how she feels about it, there is a huge disconnect, an imbalance that was never addressed or even alluded to in the book. The book was supposed to be about a little girl who is supposed to find her place in the world and find her role in life, but it just came off as a teen romance. I would not recommend this book to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________, but __________  I've had a lot of fun with this book so far. The best part about this is the fact that it can be a book that anyone can enjoy. In the beginning I thought it would be too long and not interesting enough for my tastes, but I have found it to be more than I expected.   The narrator is well done. He is calm and very engaging. I found myself listening to him all the way through the first book when I was bored and just wanted something to do. I didn't read the second book so don't feel I have a great idea of what he said, but there is enough info to know that he is one of the more credible narrators out there.   the book is about the first time people come into contact with an alien race. We meet them at a research facility and the aliens are curious about us and then we get a little too curious and get into a fight with them. The first person that is on the losing side of the fight is the author so the writing of the first person is pretty strong, although it is a little strange.   (This is what we call the plot device. It's a device in a story to make the ending seem like it makes sense.)   This is a very fast paced book with lots of action. The only issue I have with the book at this point is how the book ended. I don't think it was that interesting, just rushed. The ending makes it seem as if the aliens wanted to kill us. We don't really kill them so it's hard to see what the big deal is. The alien in the story is a pretty cool character, and we learn a lot about his species but in the end I didn,t feel connected to them. I think it would have been more interesting if we would have had a longer running book with other aliens in it.  .  This book is very similar to another book that I have been reading. It is about a scientist that is working with the aliens. The author and I got along well and I enjoyed his writing. This book will have a much stronger impact on me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read several reviews saying that this was a "revelation" that Christianity is a cult.    There is not a lot I disagree with.  A lot of what I disagree is in the message itself.  I agree with most of the other reviewers that the author is using the term "believing" in the wrong sense (it should mean you believe in something you can verify with evidence).  What the author does, however, is try to put together what I think is a false dichotomy between believing something and knowing it to be true.  The author says that believers and non-believers can both be rational and they can both have evidence for it.  He then goes on to show why I believe that this is nonsense.  So if you don't believe that there is any way to know that something is true then why would you say that there might be?  I know that there's a certain "truthiness" about the words "believe" and "know", but I don't think that makes sense.  If you've never tried believing something, there's no way you can know what it means.  At the end of the day, I don  My Review:  My wife and I read this book about 2 years ago while on our honeymoon.  In summary, we liked it. It was written in an entertaining way, although it took some time to read. The main character is an atheist (which is what we were told from the beginning) and she tries to tell a little about how she has come to her conclusions.  My wife and my son were both very engaged by the story. It took a while to get through, and some of the details were very confusing to me because they seemed contradictory.   Now I've been reading other reviews and I know most people say the same thing.  If you are an atheist, this is a good book. I didn't agree with everything the author said, but I understand why the author wrote the way he did.  As far as how he uses the word "believer", I'd say the word is not very helpful.  It might be better to just say that an atheist is "someone who is unable to know there is a God".   You might want to look it up if you're not familiar with the term (if so I have a link below) and ask yourself why you would want to say that
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to read this book, but I don't like it.  I don,t understand it. I read it, then thought, "Oh, I want to do this, then I go back and find another one of these."   The characters are just not interesting to me.   This book was supposed to be about a boy who had sex with a girl in an arcade and the guy who he slept with is his high school crush. He got mad at himself for not thinking of her.  When I read the book, I was expecting a lot of sex, because that is what this is about. The boy doesn't like sex. It is painful, like a heart attack.  I want that kind of sex. The guy was also a total loser.  But it is all about the sex.  He had sex, and it wasn't good sex, not at all.  He thought he loved her, and he did not. This is not the sexiest book I have ever read, but it is not terrible.    It is not a "perfect" book. It was not very funny either.  It could have been great, but that would not make it a good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   I loved this book. I liked the story very much. I like reading books about science, especially ones that focus on one topic, because they allow you to look at the subject from a new angle. I have no idea how it got there. I read it as a college freshman, thinking I would enjoy it a lot, but it just seemed boring. I'm not sure why, but I never had a good time with the book.   It was hard to read because it wasn't written well. I found myself constantly going back to it. The prose was choppy and I found that it did not flow well. Also the plot was a little confusing. There were several points I was confused about the storyline and why one character would have a conversation with another and have a completely different viewpoint from them.   The story was interesting, but the story did not interest me enough to keep reading.  . I think the author did a good job on creating the "character" of the scientist, and the scientific concepts he dealt with were explained clearly, but they were not enough to make me want to continue reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This book, like others of its kind, was a hit or miss. I think that is true for many of the best stories on this list, in fact I think it is true of most of the ones I read.

This book, like others on this excellent list, was both hit and miss. "It seems like a man could say just about anything to a woman and get her to be interested" I thought to myself. I enjoyed this book, I liked the style and the author's voice, but it was hit or hit and missed. It did have its moments, but not enough to really keep me reading it, especially when he said he didn't write this to be feminist, that was the hit and you're out, you're the main character, what you say is what you get. I'm a guy, I can't write about feminism in that way, or in that context.     Overall, a nice little read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was very difficult to start. I started reading it on my Kindle and after I finished I looked at the back of the book and I realized that it was not printed on the same page. That alone made it hard to read. However I got through and I did find it to be entertaining in the first half of the novel. However halfway into it it became very difficult and the author started to use characters in a very cliche way and it really got to me. My son was a few years old at the time and my wife was at work at the same time and we found it very difficult trying to hold the interest in reading this book over that weekend.   The next three-quarters of the story was good. However after that it became tedious and the characters got very one-dimensional and annoying. The main character didn't change his personality or attitude but the supporting characters changed very little. Also, all the things that the character did were the same things that he did in every other book he has ever written. I really don't think that the characters had a personality of their own. They just kept telling the main character to do the same thing over and over and you just got a feeling that the author knew exactly what to say next. The best part of it all was the ending, but that is a subject that I will discuss later.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the synopsis for this book and didn't realize that the plot was only the first of three volumes in the book series. I didn't understand why I had to wait so long for it to be out, so I waited. I started reading the book last night and I have to say I didn  My book is a sequel to a book series I read 3 years ago. The first book took a while to get from Amazon, but I read it quickly when I got it and liked it. This book was just as good as the book I read last year.   This book begins with a girl named Lily in a dream-sequence. The book begins in a hospital where a doctor is telling Lily about her life in the future. I can't say why it takes place so long after the last book, but the story takes place in the present day where she was recently released from the hospital. The Doctor tells Lily she can now walk on two legs, but she still has a lot of learning to do.   in the dream-scene Lily is having an emotional argument with her father over a lost dog. In the dream she is telling him about the dream and he does not believe her. She says she can do the things she had in the past. In this dream Lily goes to a school for gifted kids where they tell her they have found her father in a time-travelling pod. They show her the future where she had a daughter named Anna who is a doctor, and that she is going to be on a mission to save a planet from destruction. After that the dream takes her to another location where the planet has a monster called a Chimaera. She is about to kill the Chimaeras when her mother tells her that she needs to fight instead. So Lily decides to go with her mother, and the Chimeras, and save the planet.     The story goes from here for awhile, it goes in this direction for a while, then it turns to the beginning of the next story. When I first started reading this book I thought that it started with the first book in the series, and continued from there, but after awhile I got to know that it was not the case. The reason why I think it is not the same book is because this book does not have a beginning and end. When the story went to that first book it was very confusing. I felt like I was in the middle of a dream.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was awful. This book wasn't bad because it's not a good book - it's a terrible book. I read it a couple of years ago and have reread it several times now. Each time, I'd put it down and feel miserable. And I know there are people out there that have read this book, have enjoyed it, and thought it was great. I just don't believe it.   It's a "history of how we got from medieval Catholicism to Protestantism", in which the "early modern" Church is the one that was the bad guy. The "early" Church was basically evil and anti-God, the one who opposed Christianity and wanted to make sure that people were ignorant and dumb, just so they could convert them to Christianity - this is true of every Catholic church, as well as of the other religions that the Protestants (the ones who had the good side) tried to force into Catholicism. So, by the time the Protestants were done with the Church, there were lots of people who had no idea what was going on, and had been forced into it, people who really hated Christianity, and who hated Christianity because of it. And this isn't even counting the pagans (who were just as bad - if not worse - than the Catholics).   This is so typical of most history books, this way of telling the story. The Protestants just want to get rid of the "backwardness" of the Church (a phrase they use a lot, which means the Catholic Church - see next paragraph), and so they force everyone into their religion, so that they can make money, and so that their religion will be "perfect" so that other people will have no choice but to convert. The other people don't want to go along with that, and fight against it, because their religion is good and because they want to keep their "culture". Then the Protestants win.  , if it were true that the Church was evil, it would have been a good story - I would have enjoyed reading about how the Catholics had a terrible start to their story, but that the Protestant leaders were just brilliant, brilliant people who started with such good intentions. But it's just not true. And in fact, the early Church was quite decent and just as moral as the Catholic churches that were around at the time.   is mostly written by a woman, who doesn't say anything that I found interesting or original, other than

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  A review of this book is as follows:   I think this book does nothing to change the way I view the world. I can't change the ways my father and my brothers were raised by their parents. I cannot change the fact that I've seen my father struggle with alcohol abuse. I won't be the same man I've been since I was a kid. I think this is where the author should be ashamed of himself for his failure to do anything. I've told my friends and family that I will not continue reading this novel, and I will probably never have another opportunity to read it again. I don't see any hope for me or anyone else who thinks like I do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  When it comes to a well-written romance novel, there's always some aspect of the writing that I find unoriginal, or not up to the mark, or just plain wrong - but I'm usually quite forgiving and just move on.  So if any of you ever read a romance novel that was so dull that you couldn't put the book down, I implore you to check it out and if you didn't enjoy it, don't bother writing a review - it may be the worst book of its genre you ever picked up and you're just looking for a quick thrill!  And if the book was so good you wanted to get over it - good for you.   In short, this book is about a person I have never met, who I was told about in passing in a bookstore, and whose name I only ever knew through a reference in another book, and who is apparently the one who found my body.  I suppose it's not that important.  This book is, however, about my sister and her boyfriend.  They have been together since about four years ago.  There's some stuff I want to get into, and some stuff that you can only get out in long conversations with the other people involved.  I'm really just going to focus on the first bit here.  My sister and the boy she and her boy-fiancé are dating are also friends with each other's parents, which is not something I've ever done.  When she was younger, I thought it was a pretty cool thing for them to know about each other, because it was the only way we'd ever get to spend time together.  But they have been living together for the past four years, and they seem very happy.  We have a lot in common.  Her dad and her mom are both very open and honest people who treat each other with respect, and my sister has a lot of respect for her father, so I think that's part of why they have so much respect for each other.  As I said, they're living together.   That's another thing I like about the book.  It's like a small story in a larger book, about a love triangle, with one person who has some sort of connection to another character in the book, but it isn't really about them, and so you get a lot more information about them than you ever got from me, my sister, or my
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ This is one of those "I wish I'd never read it" type of books, but the stories weren't bad. The characters were interesting and I liked that they were from different countries. It was more of a history of Europe in its pre-medieval period rather than the Middle Ages. I'm a history fan but this wasn't interesting enough for me.  24 of 25 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is really hard to get into. There's a lot of really tough questions, and then at the end there are some really easy ones.  I ended up just reading the book because I really didn't want to wait for the next chapter.   You have to be prepared to learn a lot about science and medicine, and you have to know a lot more about evolution.  This is also not a science textbook.  It's basically a narrative of the evolution of human health.  If you do your homework and read up on the issues, you'll get a much better appreciation for the science than this book provides.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  A lot of good things happen in this book, but the writing is quite bad.  It would have been a good book if it had had a different voice and a different point of view.   I don't think that this is the right book for teens.  There is much more to the story and the characters than this book gives them credit for.  You have the good parts, the bad parts, and a lot of the middle.  4 out of 5 stars Good read, but not great. I like this book because I think the writer has an interesting take on the world.   There are many different perspectives on the same event, which seems to be a common theme for the author.   The writing is very smooth and the author does a good job of bringing this book to a close.   For the first time, I really felt sorry for the villains.  Not to say they are bad people, but at least there was a reason why they are the way they are.  I would not recommend this book for a younger reader.  The writing can be very clunky and the plot twists can be confusing.   If you're looking for a light book that will not bore you to death, I would suggest reading this one. 4.5 out of 6 stars It was a great book! I've never heard of the author before, but I'm intrigued and can't wait to read more.   This book is different from other books in the genre because it deals with religion, sexuality, and mental health.   It's not easy for kids to read this, so if you don't want them thinking about the mental issues and things they shouldn't, I suggest starting off young.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So, I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I think I'm going to give it 2 stars because I think it's a good book, but because I'm in this weird spot now where I'm just too exhausted to review it. So, first off, let me just say that my favorite type of fiction is horror/science fiction/ fantasy. I've loved the work of authors such as Harlan Ellison, Isaac Asimov, Fritz Leiber, etc. and this is in my top 10 favorite books of all time. The narrator, Jonathan Stroud, is excellent. You can really feel the character's feelings as they are trying to figure out what happened. I have an issue with this book being called a thriller and I feel like it's being marketed more as a mystery/thriller. But it's not. It is more of a thriller, but there is more to it than that. This is not your typical book where the main character has some vague clue and ends up being apprehended by the FBI. The main character in this book is really, really weird and has no clue what he did. He's actually completely brainwashed into this new identity he's created for himself. He doesn't know how to live without the knowledge and support of his past self and the only person he believes is capable of helping him is the woman he's in love with. He tries to find out what really happened and why he ended up the way he is and to do that he must face his past and his own mental condition. However, it's too late. The woman he loves doesn't even seem to care about him anymore. He ends up trying to be the man he's always wanted to be by making sure the world doesn't forget him. He decides to get the FBI involved when the woman finds a copy the man created of his own handwriting. When the agents interview him they realize he's completely brain washed and he's convinced he's writing it for his past. But they also realize that this handwriting and everything else he wrote is a lie and he hasn't even gotten a chance to get rid of it. When they find out he's actually the one writing it, they go undercover and try to figure it out. Eventually they uncover who is really behind everything. They figure out that this guy is a former NSA analyst named Dr. David Green who's really an actor for the CIA. This book makes a great case for why
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried a lot of YA titles from the last few years, but this is the first one I can actually remember really liking.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy this book, and I will say so upfront. I had high expectations for it, and for the most part I got them, but I couldn't get past the fact that the story was a bit forced. I don't know what it was about the characters, but their reactions were quite repetitive. There was one character who got emotional over something and then would go into an angry rant, and the same for another. I suppose the author intended to convey the story, but the author never seemed to get there.   There was also quite a lot of plot holes in this book. For example, why did the people in this world need the help of people in other worlds? We know that the Earth was made up of three distinct races, the human, the elven, and dwarves. So why did they have to make such an effort to communicate? Also why did that elf take a potion that made him invisible and then disappear? Also, we see some people walking on air, but we don't see if they have legs or not. There are plenty of other plot holes that are so obvious it's almost like the author is intentionally trying to be obscure. So basically the only thing this book did was raise my expectations a bit higher.  - Rating: 5/10. There were a lot better fantasy books out there. This is an okay read. I will definitely read it again.  —Mia  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a really bad book for a lot of reasons.  First of all, I do not like the ending, which is really dumb and stupid.  "The Doctor" was my favorite character in the story and it seemed like the main idea of this book was just to show a Doctor from another planet going back in time to kill his ancestor.  But then the author uses that character as a plot device to bring in a different time traveler and then the character just kinda fades away.   So you have the first one and then you have this guy who just kind of wanders in time trying to kill himself at the end of the book (again).  If the author had wanted to create a new Doctor, he could have easily done that.  I found the main character, the Doctor, to be really annoying and annoying.  He thinks he knows everything and he has a lot more knowledge and wisdom than he is letting on.  In many ways, I hated his character and felt like he was going to become more and more annoying. Also, the main bad guy from this story is a character who I thought was an homage to Darth Vader.  That was disappointing because I really liked Vader and that character could have been a great villain if he wasn't just another Darth Vader rip off.  The idea that the main villains of the books are all evil aliens (and this book does have a villain who is from another race), made me wonder if this was supposed to be a good or bad thing.  Either way, this was a poorly thought out series and the story did nothing for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book to my 9 yr old daughter and she started flipping through it and immediately found the 'f*ck' in the book. So, this was an excellent choice for a bedtime story. The story is a good story. I was a little surprised by how violent the language was at times. The ending was also a little surprising to me. I'm still on the fence about whether or not this is going to be one of my favorites. If you love horror/sci-fi, you might like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know why I even read this book. It's so dull, so tedious, so empty. There is literally nothing of value in this book to recommend.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ My book didn't work at all. The first paragraph got my attention. It was about a man's obsession with his daughter. But then the rest of the book, about his daughter and the way her father failed her, didn't resonate with me. I felt like I was being used. I wanted to yell at the reader to'read the whole book!', but I didn't. I got frustrated and went online to look for a book that would do it better. The reviews on Amazon for "The Giver" were amazing. The reviewers talked about the story, the way it was told and the characters. This book just didn't do it for me. __________  It's all right; they all do that. The more I read, the less I like the old way. -Gill Thompson, in the introduction to the novel "The War of the Worlds" (1953)  I thought this was a good introduction to an excellent book.  This book was a wonderful way to teach me to read a good book. This is the kind of book that is so good that it becomes difficult to be critical of it. It's easy to just read the whole thing, and get lost in it. However, after reading this book, I can understand a little more of what I read. .  a friend of mine  The book is absolutely terrific, I was so entertained, and can't recommend it highly enough.  the book is perfect for a little story about a boy who loves his little sister. I would recommend this book to anybody.  at least i hope so  One of my all time favourite books.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a little disappointing that, despite it's obvious strengths, I can't really get behind this one. The idea, I guess, is great, but it falls a little short in execution. It's a neat little story, but the execution isn't quite up to par. I like the concept, though, and I guess I'm fine with just having my name on a book if it's as good as the title implies.   In short, I'm not a fan.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  Not a bad read. It is a very enjoyable and relaxing book for all ages. However, I have been told that it can be difficult to follow the plot, especially for people who have not read the series.  I understand the challenges that this presents, so I am happy that I made the effort to read the book, and look forward to reading the next series of the series, when I can take time to read it. I was a bit confused as to who the protagonist was in the beginning. It's hard to tell from the beginning of the book who the main character was until it was quite late in the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  As a fan of the Doctor I thought that this would be great. However, once I finished I found that it was not only boring but really disappointing. It seemed like there was a lot of effort put into the writing, but a lot just didn't matter that much. For example, the main character goes into space and the Doctor finds the dead body of his past self, the character is now in this world and the main point of the book is trying to get the old Doctor to come back from there and stop the events of his life from happening. So in a way it was a good story but really just kind of had me wanting more from the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a waste of my time. Not worth the money for my limited time with this book. There were some good stories and some interesting stories, but the book was just too much of the same story that I already saw at the beginning. The plot and the characters in the book are just recycled from other books I have read. This is not a book that I recommend to someone who wants to learn more about how the LDS Church has failed and how the leaders have turned a blind eye to a number of things in the past and in the present. The book will not give you anything new. This book should have been titled, 'My Mormon Church Failed Me.' I would not waste my time reading this book."

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________   "I have often heard it said, 'The only thing wrong with a good book is that the bad ones are soooo good'."   I loved this book. The first thing I noticed was that the authors use a lot of very familiar tropes from different genres. This is a common trick used in fantasy novels - a hero's quest with a secret or two or a magical object (and usually magic - we are still using fantasy here). The problem with this is that, well... it's just not a very original idea. I don't need a new idea every three or four books when I have so many great fantasy novels in my library. But as a matter of fact, I'm a little disappointed that this book didn't explore an idea a bit further (for example - what does it mean when the hero and his companions are not only stuck with each other for a while, but they are also trapped in a terrible fantasy land and are constantly fighting with the same monsters over and over again?).   The other thing I liked about this book was the characters. Yes, it's a story of friendship. No, I don´t mind that at all - I love reading stories of people working together and making a difference. In my opinion, a good story is not about one person. It's about a group. It needs the help of a great group of people to make progress - in a good way (of course the best team is the one with a leader), and it needs a great leader to see it through. That's the job of the hero - to lead the team to victory. And that´s what I liked.   This is not a book about an evil empire invading a small isolated town. And this is not the story of a princess who has to escape her evil uncle (because she's the heir to the throne, but the uncle is going to take over her kingdom as soon as he's grown up). It's not about a hero saving the princess.   and, indeed, this isn't a book for kids. I'd even call it a good read for people who are mature enough to read about things like political machinations, murder plots, romance and magic. This book is not for children, and neither is it a children's story. There's plenty of adult content, as well as dark themes (mostly violence) and violence. As an adult, I have to say that I liked it, but not as
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a very poor ending. The first few chapters were ok, but then the author just goes and completely destroys the character. There are no real developments in the story, and the author completely lacks insight and the ability to describe the story with words. I guess the author is not an expert in the subject of the story. This book is like a book on "how to survive a zombie apocalypse." Not a very good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~HATE~~ HATE ~~FAIL~~ HATED ~~MOST UNFAIR~~ The book is a waste of time, but at least it will get you to read the novel. This was my first time reading a book based on the life of a hero. I can tell this is the first book I have ever read about a superhero. The hero is an Asian American male who is trying to get a white woman pregnant but fails every time. When he is trying for a second time the wife doesn't want to have a baby and decides to have her own son. There is a scene of the hero with a white boy that is about 14 and that is all I remember. I thought there was a scene with the hero and a black boy about the same age but there wasn't. This is the only thing I know of in the novel that I found offensive. This review is based on that I have only seen the film version.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you want to know why I never write more books, or write reviews on Goodreads, or go on book tours to promote my books, here's why:  I have no desire to do so.  I'm just too busy with my day job.  It's a great job, by the way, and I love it.   It's not as easy as I've been led to believe in the past, I've made many mistakes, but I'm not about to get down and make excuses.  The job itself keeps me from writing because I get distracted and get too wrapped up in the day-to-day running of the business to write about my work.  My day job is a wonderful one, and there are some wonderful people I work with, but it is just not the same as being a writer.  And I get that, but you know what?  I don't care if you think I should.  No one deserves the ability to do whatever they want, whether it be to write, or to design, or whatever.  But I want people to know that my job doesn't come without it's flaws.  So, no matter what, if you have questions or comments, or have any interest in what I'm writing, just send me a note on Facebook or e-mail me at jtart.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It's very bad. Very poorly written. Very badly plotted. Very illogical. Too much exposition. In other words, too many problems for any kind of entertainment. Not even the main character has any redeeming qualities (aside from his big nose and penchant for making silly faces, but you can't blame him for that, can you?"   The reason this review is written in the first place is because it made me look up some information about the author. I read it last night and had to write this review. So, I'm going to give it to you for free.   This book is written by the author as an explanation of the scientific method. He believes that the scientific way of studying something is the only way to learn about it and to come to a solution to the problems. In the case of the man with the nose, he finds the answer by looking at the world around him (and his nose).   And this is where things start to get bad. This book was so bad it made a friend of mine cry. He read this book and said "This is just so bad." He is right.   in this book, the author goes on to talk about the process of the brain. In fact he describes it so much it is hard to even understand, let alone figure out. He then explains how the mind works, the different parts of the mind and their various functions. That's pretty much it, the rest of the book is explaining what he said before.  , I will give him credit. He got the man to the point, though he made it seem so much more difficult than it really was.  . The only thing I can think of is he tried to put it in such a way that the guy's problems were the most common problem in the universe. If you want something hard to figure out and to learn you can start reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  I have to admit that the books on my shelf are not the best in the genre. I have read and loved many of them. The worst one I have had so far was the book "How I Lost My Wife and My Son in a Car Accident" by Dr. James A. Dement. I was a great fan of his work when he wrote it and had read several books on accident and the recovery of body parts. When I finally found "How to Get a Life Back" in the back of a book store, I immediately picked it up. It is a good book but I found it very hard to follow, and I was so frustrated at the story. So many of the points of Dr. D's book were so far out of the way. I wanted to say that this is not a problem with the book per se, but a problem for the author to make you think the information is so simple, yet it's really not. When the book is finally over, you may find you have lost a part of yourself. I feel like that's a very human reaction to the book. I wish he would spend a bit more time trying to make things clear. I know the book's author could use a bit of help in writing a clear book. It would have saved me a lot of frustration.  The Good: I liked the story of the accident, how he was trying to save people that he knew. It was nice to read about how much trouble he was in, how it made him re-evaluate his life. The writing is very good. The ending was very good as well. The story of how the accident happened is not easy to understand as the story seemed to drag on and on. I think there could have been some time that the book was not very readable to me, but it was still a good read. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read something about an accident in a very positive way. The book has a very good end. The Bad: It's hard to understand what is so difficult about his life to make him think the accident was his fault. It seems like the more time you spend with him, the more he starts to think that it was really his fault, that his bad decisions led to his accident. I thought this was really hard to accept for a lot readers, because they think that if they are making the right choices, it's not their fault if they're
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________ I have been a long-time fan of the TV series, and was looking forward to reading the book. It was so bad, I had to put it back and give it a try again, but was unable to finish. It has an interesting premise, about a guy who thinks he's a human being, but instead has to play the part of a robot for an entire day. I wasn't sure if it was going to work, but it turned out to be fun and creative. Unfortunately, the writing was terrible, and the robot characters felt like they were being put on by the author, rather than by the show.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "When I first started reading this book, I was excited. I didn't like the idea of the book at first, but I kept reading. I was shocked when I finished this book and felt that there were some big issues that weren't addressed well. The book starts with this young teen girl with anorexia nervosa going through withdrawal from anorexic medication she can't get. This is one of the first things I thought of when I got to the part where she is having her first taste of pizza. What was the big deal with pizza? I thought. She had made it her mission to stop the anorectics from getting anything that tastes like pizza. This led her to start stealing pizza from pizza joints, because apparently eating pizza was a big deal, too. I felt that the author didn't address her mental health issues very well. It seemed that the teenager was just an object in the story. She was a character, and that was it. And if I was to be honest, I'm not a big fan of the way that the writer portrayed the teenager. Her relationship with the pizza-eating teenager was one of exploitation and manipulation, not love.  "   I know I'm really getting on my high horse here, but this was a really interesting and thought provoking book. I really enjoyed the food in this book. The whole story about the girl's illness really was interesting and not a simple diet book. Also, it wasn't just an eating disorder story either. It had an amazing, disturbing ending that was very upsetting, and I wanted to know what would happen next.   This was my second book from Jules Jordan. I enjoyed this one just as much as the first. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________   By: James R. Miller   The plot is slow and the narrative is slow. The characters are all not as well-developed as they should be. This is not a bad thing because there is a good portion of this book that you will not be able to put down. The story focuses on two characters that come to each other's aid with no thought for themselves other than saving the other. However, these two characters are not just some normal person who just happens to be good with a sword or magic. They are not a "loner" either. The two main characters of this novel are an older man and a young man. The older man is not your typical hero. He is not the straight-arrow warrior, but rather, he is a mysterious man that does not fit in the world. This old man has no family and is a complete outsider to the society. The main character of the book, I did not even remember his name, but he was very interesting and likable. His voice was smooth and he was able to be very caring for his friend. In fact, he did not really feel like the main character but a friend that happens to have been put in a position of danger for one reason or another.   What I really enjoyed about this novel was that the characters did not seem to have any idea what they wanted to do. The first three books were about a young girl who is put in peril and she is only concerned about herself and wanting to return to her life. In this novel, the main characters had no idea how to get what they want. They were stuck in a situation that was not fitting for them at the time.  The story does have some moments that are well written but the plot is so slow and it is hard to get through it. The last part of the novel is slow but very well-written and I am looking forward to the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------   The book was not bad, but it was boring.   We went to see the movie and I went with one of the people in my group. She was very nice but the movie was not very interesting to me. It was not that the movie had anything special about it (even though it was a decent movie) but it made my brain hurt for being unable to enjoy myself more.  , The film was pretty good. It just didn't seem to be about the character as much as it was about the storyline.   of the characters I liked very much. They seemed to be likable and likable enough that you would want to be around them.  - The book seemed to focus on a single character. I don't think she really felt like a character. It could have been interesting if she had more depth, but instead it was just her getting caught up in a bad situation that she found herself in.   the story just went on and on. You just had to see this movie or this book to get the full story. I wanted to read the next one instead. I guess I would have to go back and reread the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm disappointed in the writing of this one. The story is too long for the size of the page and there are too many cliches to overcome. The author had a lot of story to tell and a lot to explore, but he left the main plot to run its course, so as to not reveal too much about what happens at the end, and he also didn't bother to show how much work has gone into making the main character, Ayesha, likeable. So, I won't get into the plot (though I did find a few cliched plot devices, like the father and daughter going to see a movie), but I will say that the plot and character development are very, very poor. Ayeshah's characterization is as one would expect from a Muslim, but her interactions with the non-Muslim characters are as shallow as the relationship between Ayesa and the man in her class who makes her drink beer.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________   "I am trying to read something by a modern novelist, and while I am not a fan of the modern novel I do think it has its place in my literary diet. I wanted to like this book, but when I first started to read it, the style and prose seemed somewhat pedestrian. It wasn't until I read it cover to cover in an over-booked workday that I noticed what a good writer he is."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was not worth the money I spent on it, and the story is not interesting and not worth a read.  I'm sorry, but it is not.  5 out of 5 stars Marni L You can't go wrong with a book about cats.  This one's funny.  And it's written by a person who knows cats.   3 out of 3 stars B. F. I was really excited to buy this book.  The cover looked really good.  I thought it would be a fun little story of a cat and his cat and the little dog that likes to play with them.  Unfortunately it's a very basic story.  A cat named "Digger" has a huge crush on his best friend "Minnie" and he tries to get her attention by eating his dinner.  He ends up breaking her bone and in the end his friends think that "Minni" is just as big a loser as him.  That doesn't make the story more interesting. 1 out of 1 stars T. M. Poor "Diggie"!  He is the only friend he has in his very large, very weird home.  His best friend is called "Puppy" and is his only friend in the world.  However, "Doggie" is in love with Puppy and wants to keep him.   Unfortunately, it isn't easy.  "Dogs" is very small and has the personality of a baby.  Despite being called "Doggie", he has not been trained or socialized by humans.  Puppy, "The Giant" wants to be a real dog and is more of a wolf than a dog.  It's really not hard to find a problem with this book; the author doesn't do her research and is lazy when writing.   The story is very basic and is really not worth your time. 5 stars M. S. The writing was awesome.  You learn about everything in this book from the beginning.  If I could get it in paperback or in hardcover I would buy it.   6 out of 6 stars M-M This is an awesome book.   I love it!   It's funny, sad, and heartwarming.   Great job! 5 Stars D. G.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's about a woman in the South who gets pregnant. There is no plot to speak of. There's a boy in a boat in a storm.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book, I was pretty disgusted. It really made me angry. I had to close it down because it is a disgusting, racist book that will make any white person, who wants to look as good as he/she can, cry and have his/her heart broken.   It is so hard to write a negative opinion about a book that is written by the author who writes a lot of racist comments online. I am not the first, not the last person to say he/ she will never read this book. I hope you do not sell this book because this book is a disgrace.  4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am really unhappy with this book. I really don't understand why someone would buy this book so I thought I would review it.  The book is based on the real life case of a man, Joe Sousa.  He was the leader of the Aryan Nation and had a group of followers who he used for his crimes.  His mother testified that Joe was an "abusive" parent and that he abused her and other members of his family.   Joe claimed he didn't kill anyone and that his mother was actually a drug addict.  Joe Soused and his followers were put on trial and convicted on different charges.  At the end of the trial Joe was put on death row.  I don't know if you can imagine the pain Joe Sowed and his group went through but this book is filled with lies and slander.  In the book we see Joe being an abusive mother.  We are given all of the stories of Joe's children who claimed they were abused by him.  There was no such story found.  Here we are told that Sousaa was the main instigator of the murders in the early 1990's and that the only reason Joe is still alive is because he put his "soul mate" on the stand to testify that he was a drug dealer.  If this story was true, then why are there so many inconsistencies.  All of this was done to try and make the "race" issue and make it a racial issue.  They did it for their own gain and in doing so, they have taken the "White man" out of the equation and made it a black man.  It has destroyed the group that Joe and his family were in for so long.  This book is a huge disappointment. 8) How To Live With The Enemy  by Dr. Samuel T. Francis This book is actually quite good.  The title is a little misleading as it has nothing to do with hate.   This book talks about how to deal with those who hate us and have used their religion to do so.  Dr. Francis is the pastor of the New Jerusalem Church of God.  A nice sounding name but what makes this book very good is that it does not give you an answer.  Instead the book tries to get you to think.   What if you have a child who is racist?  What if the kid is a bully and has hurt other kids on multiple occasions?
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to get this to use as a stand alone. I was going to get The Godless Spell Tamer  because of the reviews and because of my brother. I have read other reviews and have to say they were spot on. I did not find this book at all funny or even interesting. You just wanted the characters to move on. There are only 3 good characters in this book. I do not think there was one bad character. The most interesting characters are those who only appear in the last 5-10 pages. The end of the book was just the characters running away from the city because they are not going to be able to get an education and go to college because of their gender. I think it is very unfair to read a book like this one because it seems like you are doing so for laughs. I am glad I did it because I would have never made it past page 14 if I had not. It was really sad to read that in today's society where equality is the norm, there are still people like these. They are just in the minority. I gave this a 2 because it is really sad and I was looking forward to reading The Godlover.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I hated the first half of this book, I'm very picky when it comes to fantasy and science fiction books and I hated this book for it's lack of science and it's bad writing, I know that I am just a terrible person for not liking this book. The writing style of this story is very weird, very fast paced and very repetitive, as in most sci fi and fantasy series I usually don't like that, so much for my bad taste. So to be honest it was annoying.   If you enjoy weird characters, slow plot, and good writing this is a good book to read.   in all it was only 3 stars.  15 of 18 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife read this book without bothering to find out any other reviews. She is not very good at picking books at random. She chose this one first because it was so different from any book she had read before. We were sitting together while reading and she was saying to me, "This book is hard and it will really scare me!" I knew exactly what she was talking about and I knew I had to stop reading. I did, but when she got to the end she exclaimed, "I never knew it could be so scary!"    She found out what this book was about when she was reading and was going to read it again but only because she had seen it being made into a movie.  But, if your trying to tell a story with lots of suspense and mystery and suspenseful moments then, yes, this book is well worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  When I got this book, I didn't know what to expect. I have never read a book by Robert A. Heinlein before, so I was excited, hoping that he would give me some insight into the inner workings of a space station. He does just that, and the results are surprisingly accurate. I love Heinlein's writing style, and this book is no exception. I would recommend this book to anyone who is into space opera, military SF, or just someone who is looking for a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time. It is very bad. One word to describe it. AWFUL! A bad piece of junk. It was not for me. This was a disappointment.   I am a first time reader and this is the first of many books that I will waste my time reading.   the cover is great.  (The cover was the best part of the book. The cover was a great idea. It showed us what we are about to read)   the book is about a girl named Amanda. She is born a girl. The problem is when she is 8 and is being taken to a doctor to get a sex change surgery. The doctor discovers that she is a boy and sends her back to a girl's home, but she lives as a boy so he does not take her back. She goes back to the doctor again, and the doctor refuses to fix her. Amanda tries everything to convince the doctor that she needs the surgery, but he will not change her back, and it is now 4 years later.   on the first few pages, I thought this was going to be a very funny book about a guy who got to know a girl who has a penis and is then confused by the experience, and then it turns out that the person he was confused with is a guy.  , and there was something about the ending. I was surprised that the book ended the way it did. That's how I felt about this book. It just was not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I will never go back to this book.  It is a terrible story and it did not teach me anything about life in general.  The plot was pointless and not worth the time to even consider. I read it just for the "feel good" factor of going on a little adventure.  I will not buy this book again.  It is really a pity because the characters were really good and the plot was good but not worth it.  Don't even bother with this one.

I'm not going to spend my time reading this, just a few lines from my favorite book of all times."   4 stars for originality and quality and 1 star for the boring plot.   (This book was first published in 1993. It is no longer in print and is not in the public domain, however. You can buy a paperback copy on Amazon for under $5.00. If you don't know where to start, you should start with "A Hobbit's Tale" which also has some good humour. And as this book was originally written in a British idiom, there are some references to the BBC shows.)

Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************************"I thought the book was interesting but the main character was just not very compelling. I was looking for a book with a more likable, less 'narrow-minded' protagonist to read but I found it much harder to get into this one than I thought it would be."   ****************************   I love books that are "about a girl who has a secret. A very important secret" - the sort of thing that happens in "A Christmas Carol" and "Sweeney Todd". "The Snow Queen" is not really about that; it's about "the way a girl discovers the secret she has kept her whole life: that she is a Snow Queen."  
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I would recommend this book to anyone. The concept of a book that is completely unrelated to the book it was based on and a main character that is so far off from the original one, is just too much of a negative for this. It's a good book, just not the one I thought it was going to be.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________I've only read three of Dune. But it's got so much potential. There's so much you can do with it. For example, I think that some characters may have more depth than they really have. But I've read that in science fiction, you get your science and the world. And that's what makes it science fiction. You get that and there's a character's depth, and he's a part of that. In the world of DUNE, I didn't get that. Dune wasn't really about the characters. And there was too much action that happened in the book, and it wasn't all really happening. It was like a movie. It seemed like it was happening at a certain time, when I was reading it. And then in DUNE you have to read it again to get it. When I finished it, I read it and thought, oh, this is a great book. It's just not for me, but I have a feeling that it will be great for somebody else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am very disappointed. I was eager to read this book and was eager for it to be a good read. I expected some good ideas and a good character. I found the writing to be very poor and there were many grammatical errors. Also, I noticed that there were several pages in the book where the author tried to make things interesting without succeeding. I'm not sure why. My only other complaint is that the author never explains what he is talking about. He makes statements and then doesn't explain why they are true or how he knows them.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful

I was surprised how much I connected to some of them, and how the author managed to make the main characters relatable. It would be great to see this series grow, as a whole.   at least it was a good story so far

The writing style and narration, the narrator was so amazing i thought he was the real life narrator and he read like he was from the streets, this book is so engrossing i went back and forth for 3-4 days, it has great twists and turns and is very believable, the book was an eye opener and i will never get tired of reading about it, thanks to the publishers for a great read!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book is a disaster. The whole thing is terrible. It has the feeling of a 'novel' which is a bad thing for a science fiction novel, because sci-fi novels need to be exciting and exciting things happen. And it's boring and boring boring boring." "This novel is the perfect blend of pretentiousness and stupidity. It's an absolute bore. It is a collection of short stories with a few short chapters each, and each short chapter is boring and pretentious and has some sort of philosophical message about the human nature of war. It doesn't have the intellectual depth of a Jules Verne or a Arthur C. Clarke. But, it's pretentious pretentious." This book was so bad that I couldn't give it four stars.  Why would anyone buy this book?  It had no plot and the characters were all annoying. __________________________________ "I want the world to know what it's like to be a man. I want the universe to know it. To know the terrible things I have endured. I will fight in the name of men that I believe are worth saving." The man who made this book is such an embarrassment to his own species that I had to go and buy him a drink.  He was such a moron that he used the title of this book to sell the book.  He has such poor self awareness that he actually said the same thing that he wrote in his introduction.  The entire purpose of this novel was to sell his book because that's how he made the most money from his own book.   He said in the introduction that his goal was to 'turn the world against itself' so he wrote a book that has nothing to do with his topic and uses his own name as the author.   Now I know that I have written some very negative reviews of books and this is no different.  But after I finish this novel I will never read a book by this author again.  If he didn't know that he was making a terrible book that was boring and pointless I would give this book three stars and say that it was a great book. But he knew what he was doing and he knows what he is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________  This book is so wrong about the science that it is not even funny!  The author claims that when you eat red meat, your body breaks down the "wastes" of the meat into sugars and that these sugars get "sweat out" and go to your fat cells. She also claims that red meat causes "insulin resistance," which leads to obesity and diabetes. There is absolutely no evidence that this is true. Her theory is that the "ins" in "insulins" can be converted by the body into "insolates," which lead to "insipid" or "waste" being created from "wasting" the food. So, in a sense, she is wrong.  There is an interesting scientific discussion in this book, but it is very superficial and doesn't change the fact that she has a theory that doesn't hold up. "Diet" is not a proper definition of dieting. I have no idea if anyone else has a problem with the word "dieting" as I have, but the authors take it very literally. If I am in a "dysfunctional dieting cycle" that makes me eat less and less, then I'm on "dish."  I think a diet is a general rule that helps the body keep its body weight, and it should include the following components: exercise, sleep, and a balanced diet. In this book they talk about "fat burning" and "insulation," but what do those terms even mean? "Insulation" is only used to explain why you should feel better if you eat more fat. But if you look at it in terms of "fat loss," there is no insulating effect on the body when you overeat. The only way to make sure you are insulating your body is by eating a balanced (unbalanced = overeating) diet. But there is so much conflicting information out there that I don't want to jump to the conclusion that any of it is true, since so much of it depends on which studies you are reading.  and I do not want to hear the claim that red meats contain carcinogens or that they cause "inspirational" behavior that leads to "wasted" food. There are very few studies showing this, and most of them have been done on animals.  the author claims the science behind this is very "controversial," but it's very basic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "A few pages in the first book I started to feel that I'd been cheated. Then the characters were completely useless. There were little to no details of their lives and none of their activities. My impression was that these characters were there for the sake of the author's amusement. The second book has much better writing and characters. This is a very entertaining story."   "I don't know if this is the last time I will ever read a book by Robert Bloch. It's so bad, so bad that I'll probably never finish it. The characters were horrible, the plot just made no sense and the story was too convoluted for me to understand it. There was no way it made any sense to me at all. I have tried to figure out what the plot was about, but I can't."   the only good thing is it has a great soundtrack
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book for free as a review copy from the publisher because I had never heard of it. I liked it, but I think that there are better books out there that would be better for me to read, especially if I'm looking for something a little darker. This is still worth reading if you like sci fi, and it's definitely worth a read for fans of the books it borrows from. It could be a great read if it didn't try to do too much.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************  I read this on my Kindle. I can't remember how I managed to do that. There were a few typos. The story and its characters are very interesting. My favourite is the little boy.  This book is about the lives of a bunch of little boys. The main character, the book starts out with him. The other boys are from different countries. It's not a bad start for this book. The author has a good grasp on the young readers and they all live like a family. The book is mostly about friendship, friendship between parents and children and about the difficulties a child goes through in school. It makes for an interesting read. There are also some dark, sad and tragic events that occur in the book. It really hits home for the reader that something must be done about the problems that are occurring in our society. I liked the characters and what they go through and this book was worth reading. This book should be given to every young reader to give them a realistic picture of what children go through in life. It teaches a lot about friendship and what life is all about. , February 4, 2008  Momma's Boy   Reviewer: T-T  Review: I really liked this book! My 8-year-old daughter gave it to me for my birthday. I was very surprised to see it's so short. It is a very good story for an 8-10 year old and it's funny and interesting. I like that the book was read aloud to my daughter!

Write a negative review about a bad book:  "The main character, who is a former Marine with a history of mental illness, finds himself in possession of a body that seems to be made of a dead man's skin. He eventually discovers that the body is actually that of a local police officer.  The book is basically a story of a character slowly going mad and losing his mind as a result. The book was poorly written. Â I can only assume that a number of people who read this were also in the throes of mental disorder and will find it hard to follow the story.    The author could have used a little bit more foreshadowing so that the reader is able to guess at how things are going to play out." (from review on Goodreads)
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------  The first five chapters are great! the story keeps turning into a more complicated mess, the plot is not very clear to me at all. I think the author, in his attempts to make this story more interesting, just went back to the first few chapters to try and fix things up, as if he never actually finished. I guess he wanted to have a book that was more like the first book, in terms of plot, but the story just didn't work out as well as it could have.   Overall: --------------  This book is a mixed bag. The first two or three chapters I enjoyed reading, but after that I just didn´t find the story worth my time. It could have been interesting and I will re-read it, but I just don´t think I will like it as much as the first one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a child I used to read this book and I loved it.   In the book the main character is asked to go to a local church to sing at a Christmas concert. He says no, the children won't be able to see him, and that he doesn't have any money.  They make him sing, and he does just that, he is not ashamed and he sings with gusto.  My sister got me one when I was a kid, and I did love the story.  It is a short story, but it has the potential to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------I've bought a couple of these so far and have to say... I love the covers and the books... but this is a terrible book. The characters are bland, boring, one dimensional and the plot just doesn't hold together. The one thing I really love about this book, and what I think is the most "bad" thing, is the amount of sex the author talks about. It's over the top, I mean, it's like a sex romp that I didn't want, it was just... well, well, it just wasn't good. I can see why it was made as a movie, but I don't want to see it or know anyone who has seen it. I am not going to give it 3 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved it. The plot kept me guessing and the character development kept me wanting more. Unfortunately, the ending was rushed and the plot points were confusing so that the book would go in a direction you did not want it to go.
Write a negative review about a bad book:.......................................................The novel is well written, I really liked the idea that people are born with a personality, and some have a great advantage in being born with certain characteristics, this is one of them! However, it really takes a while to get a good sense of where I should be going and why. It's a short book, and there's not a lot of "solution" to the problems. You'll be a lot better off just thinking of the problem and coming up with a solution yourself.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- "This was not an enjoyable read. I think the pacing of the story was a little uneven. The plot twists in this book were quite weak. The characters were not well-developed or developed at all. I thought the world building was pretty interesting, but it was the characters that were the worst thing about this book. I had a hard time understanding and caring about the people in this story. I can't imagine why anyone would read this book."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't like this book but had a hard time finishing it. I did read the first few chapters and it had a lot of ideas that I thought would be really good and interesting. The character development is very weak. The main character spends a lot more time with her sister who is the love interest than he does with the heroine. I can understand that she was in a relationship for a long time and had a difficult life with the death of a sister but it was only hinted at and it was a quick resolution. It was like watching a character on tv walk into a room and say, 'oh, she's in there, oh my god, here she is'. I mean, it would be nice to see her interact with him in some way but she doesn't. I was waiting for her to make her move but she never does. I suppose it is just the way the story was written, or it is the way I have always seen romance in stories and it just didn't seem right. I found it to be very uninteresting. I just wasn't feeling it.   But, I guess, I can't complain too much. I like fantasy and have enjoyed the books I have read, but this one just didn;t work for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- This book has one of the worst covers I have ever seen. The cover is completely overused and the name of the author is all over the place. The book does not make you want to buy it and is probably one of those "just buy it" books, which is a shame. If you like historical romances, this book is a bad choice. You will enjoy it just for the plot. If a book gets to you as a story, it's usually a good read. For all the wrong reasons, not a great read. This is not a bad history book in any way, it just doesn't live up to the hype.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought a couple of books by this author and it was all a waste of money. They are all about children's books, which in my opinion is boring. I bought this book for my 7 year old daughter and she loved it, except for the ending, which was kind of disappointing, but it's just the way he wrote it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ If only this book was a short story, but it's not, because it is over 2000 pages and I couldn't get through it. It was so long that I don't remember it at all. It's just like the stories in a book I used to have - very similar characters, very similar plot, very same style. I think they're so similar because they're both fantasy books, and the characters are very similar. I could tell when I started reading that it would not be a good story. The world is just too big, and it's too much for me to take in. I don the author is just trying to impress his readership with his writing. They are doing a very good job at it. I can't help but think that if they didn't have to write stories about magic, and fantasy creatures, and elves and wizards, then they would have written a more interesting book. It wasn't a great book. I would never read another book written by this author, and I don' think anyone else should.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was a fun read, but it was poorly written.  The main character was poorly developed.   I was not able to connect with her.  It also was hard to follow the main story line.  The ending was a bit too sudden and abrupt.  I'm not sure how I feel about the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed with the first part of this book as I wasn't expecting to like it, but I found the third part really entertaining and the final section just a bit too slow. The first half was mainly about a group of four friends who go to a summer camp and the activities they have to do. The characters are a bunch of average kids that are kind of annoying but they get over that and they become friends and the book gets good. The second half however, is a bit slow because it focuses on the characters in their everyday lives, not on their summer camp experience. The book gets really interesting in the last half of the book as they talk about their past and the past of the people that are going to be attending their summer home. But, the book then seems to end on a bit of a cliffhanger as the four friends are on a train that is about to leave but they decide not to because they want to go with their friends instead. I like the characters but I wish they had done a better job of explaining what was going on in the story so that the readers have some idea of what the author was trying to say.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was my first purchase from the authors. I just read The Book of the New Sun and enjoyed it. However, this is not an improvement on the first one. I enjoyed the first book. It was a solid first book for an author I had read about before and liked. The second book was disappointing. As I said, I am a fan of Star Trek and the new book did nothing for me. The characters were dull. The plot was too simple. The language was bland. I found it too long. I am not sure why the authors put this book out there for free. There were better first books out there. If you want something a little more complex, the second book will do it better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book expecting to see a little more depth and history on how the original characters would deal with life after the war, but, what I got was a little too light. In fact, I found myself a little bored by the end. I could understand how a soldier might feel as they were pulled away from the war at the end of the book, but I found that I could have easily understood what happened in the world of the original series, without having to read the sequels and spinoffs. It just didn't sit right for me. I'm hoping that the next book will provide a little extra depth to the world and characters, but this one just didn.didn't live up to the expectations I had before reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- As I read this book I was expecting something very different. There are a few things that don't mesh together for me. I had never heard of the book until I saw it on the list at the library. I was looking forward to reading something different and I think this is just that. It's not a bad read for the first half. The characters were interesting to read and the setting was unique. The book did suffer from the first quarter being a bit of a slog. If it were not for that and the second half I may have given this a higher rating. The writing wasn't perfect. There were times where I didn't know what the characters were talking about. This is a minor complaint but was the only thing I noticed. Overall, I think that a good read for people that enjoy historical fiction. However, I wouldn't recommend this for everyone else. It may not appeal to everyone, but it is still a good historical fiction that I would recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________________  My husband and I were given the book to read after we gave birth and we loved it. We knew how important it would be for him to read it. He had a hard time with it. It was not what he wanted. We are now re-reading it and I was looking forward to enjoying it with him. Instead, he seemed to be taking it on a vacation. It seems like he was really enjoying himself but didn't really care if I enjoyed it as well. Not a good ending to a great book. I will not be able to recommend it. I want it to be great. I hope it gets a rewrite!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read the first three books and I can recommend them very highly.  Although there are very poor writing and spelling errors, the story is well written and the prose is easy to follow.  As you read each book the plot builds and unfolds like a film with exciting and intense action scenes and interesting characters.   I am interested to see where the story takes me next. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's just awful.  I read it and hated it.  I loved the first one so much I bought the second.  The third one was not as good as the first two.  This book is an absolute joke.  My biggest problem with the book is its plot.  What kind of plot is that?   I would love to know who the author was.  I would buy this book again in a heartbeat if I had the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________ 1.5 stars: ___________________ 2 stars:  I have been looking for a decent romance book with vampires. I have been wanting to read the trilogy by R. J. Palacio, but I just haven't gotten around to it because of other books. This is a good, fast-paced, and fun romance book!   This book follows two girls on a date, one as vampire and the other as human. The first two chapters are very good, then the rest of the book gets confusing and weird. But it is really worth the confusing and Weirdness. I enjoyed this book a lot!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "If you're going to write a biography of a rock musician, you better make sure you have all the details right. And as usual, I have trouble with these books. This biography is more of a piece of work. It has no place in any Rock & Roll encyclopedia, as there are too many factual errors for any writer to make a good book. "  A great read with lots of information and great interviews. I think you will enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was good. I would have liked it more if there were more of the actual plot and less of the book about the characters trying to find each other and make things work. It made me think that the author was either going to write a good, solid book about a group of friends or she was just out to make some money off of me. The best part of the novel, the first half of it, I just got bored so fast with the characters and the story. I think that it could have been a fun, easy read for a casual reader.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The most amazing book I have ever read!!!  I was on a mission of my life and I found my calling.  It was perfect for my life.   A few pages in, I was hooked and I had to get this book.  The cover is beautiful and the author is fantastic.  He writes with passion and passion alone.  I found it so easy to follow the course because the books is all about learning to become the master of yourself.  What makes this book unique:   This book takes a deep dive into the psychology of learning.  It focuses on the stages of learning, and why we choose one skill over another.  There is a lot of interesting information about the benefits and pitfalls of choosing one thing over another to learn how to achieve your goals.   There are numerous examples and quotes from successful people like Bill Gates,  Malcolm Gladwell, and  Napoleon Hill.  These guys helped me learn how important it is to learn multiple skills.   This is a very well written book.   I don't think it takes a psychologist or teacher to understand the power of this book to help you reach your goals faster.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________ This book is an absolute disappointment. If you are reading it because you thought you knew how to play a guitar and that you would like to play it for yourself you may be in for a surprise. The author is clearly very inexperienced and seems to be trying to do the best he can with a very limited set of exercises and ideas. I find the exercises to be extremely shallow and lack all depth. I could not find a single interesting theory that I could relate to. _____________________________________________________________________________________ 4 Stars For the time and for the money - 4 Stars

Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* My friend gave me this book and I was very excited about it. I love fantasy and this seemed like a perfect fit for me. I got the book the night of its release and got home to it early the next morning. I'm very sorry I didn't get to read it while I was in the mood for a book. It was horrible. First off, the story wasn't interesting at all. I was already bored with the first book so I couldn't care about what happened in this one. So the whole time I'm just waiting for the characters to get into trouble and then I'm bored. This book was about a young man and his best friend. They were trying to win a dragon. The young man's name was Jon. Jon had a dark secret and his friend is trying to save him. It went on forever and I wanted to cry when the bad guy was killed. I kept reading for the dragons but the dragons didn't even show up. There was never a battle and no dragons were killed. Instead of losing hope, the young man kept telling himself "I can always find another way". I felt so bad for the friend. What a jerk. My other issue is that it was too long. It felt like it was going on forever. It took me at least 5 books to finish the story. I didn.t feel like I was missing much but my friends will feel soothed knowing that I was reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A book written by the same author as "Mighty Whitey", which was actually published in the late 1960s and is still selling well to this day, is called "The Mute". I have never read it and I cannot speak to its quality but I have read this and will not be buying it.    Read another review of it:   It's a bit different, though, and a tad dated, but that's not a bad thing.   In the beginning he tells his story in first person, but soon enough he switches to third person. He is, however, very eloquent, very witty, and is able to talk about almost everything. For a good portion of his story he shows the narrator's thoughts and feelings at various times during the day, and I was able to relate to them even though they weren't mine. However, as the story progresses, it really does become more personal. By the end I was feeling a bit like I was his friend or even like he was my friend in the past. I liked the ending.  The main problem with the book is that it is written in the third person, which I do not like. I would rather read it in the first person.   What I liked about the book: He talks about everything in detail.  I don't know what a person would do or not do to avoid getting shot.  It also helps to keep the reader's interest.  The narrator's story is told very well and at times you are able to guess what is going on in the narrator is head.  If you are a fan of "Million Dollar Baby", "Whitey", "The Killing Fields", "Killing in the Afternoon", or "The Black Hole" then you will like this one.   What I didn't like:  His story is often a bit dated and I don' t like how often he switches from third person to first.  Other than that, I would say it was a fun read and it took about 15 minutes to read.  Review by  
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ The first third or so of this book were a complete mess. I was hoping to get some sort of plot, but it was all sort of hazy, and as for the story itself, it seemed to be going nowhere, because it didn't really seem to have a plot in the first place. I found a lot of the characters, even the villains, to be fairly shallow, but I wasn't a huge fan of the setting and this wasn't really a good story. It got a lot better towards the end, but that wasn't necessarily what I wanted from it. This book is really hard to rate, because if it had a great plot it would have easily been one of my top 5 or top 10 favorite YA books of the year. If it didn and didn't have a good plot, then it's still great, but if it did have a great story it should have been in the top 1 or 2 of my favorites. This is a book that will appeal to a lot more than I did and it's definitely not something that will be the last book I finish reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ is a terrible book. I know it's not a literary masterpiece, but it is written by someone with less than first class literary ability. If you read this book, then you will find the main character and the plot twists to be utterly ridiculous. If the book had not been self-published, I would have rated it 2 stars. Instead, this book is now my worst book of the year.   I really liked _______________ when it was a novel that was going to be part of an author's collection, but now I will never buy it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  " A poorly written book.    It lacks any sense of place and story and even takes place in the same world as another one, but in a completely different region (which is a shame because the book could have had a lot of great world building to it).   "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am NOT going to waste your time with this book. A few years ago, I spent over $400 on an autographed copy of "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin" at a bookstore.  On the cover, Franklin is depicted with a "Franklin was a terrible father!" hat.   The author, a man named James S. Thomas, was a respected author of books about the American Revolution.  I remember reading a short biography by Thomas and saying to myself "Wow!    This is an important history.  He knows what he's talking about."   The first couple of pages have some great insights.  For example, Franklin's first wife, Maria, was an American soldier during the American Revolutionary War.  After the war, he married Mary Todd, the daughter of a minister.  They had three children; three sets of sisters and a set of step-sisters.  Franklin would not let anyone touch his three children and would often forbid others from getting close to his sisters or his step-brother.  Franklin was so worried that his three kids would be killed by a stray bullet that he kept his rifle in a chest pocket and would shoot a single bullet into the chest of a stranger.  The second half of the book is about Franklin's life and politics.  On one hand, I could relate to Franklin's fear and mistrust of authority.  Some of the information in this book is true.  It is the history that Franklin lived.  As a father, Franklin was probably more concerned about his children.  But the book's biggest flaw is that Thomas, a historian, was not a historian.  Thomas knew nothing about history, he didn't even know what the United States was.  We all know that Franklin was an intellectual and had an interesting mind.  This book is a complete waste of time and a huge disappointment to any history enthusiast.  There are some interesting tidbits of information about Franklin, but none of it was anything more than a quick quote.  A good history book should be interesting.  These are just a few reasons why I have no confidence in a historian telling the story of Benjamin Franklin. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I went in expecting this to be a novel about the life of James Dean, and what it meant to be black in Hollywood and in Hollywood at the time, but it's not, it's a story about how Dean was a good and a bad black man at the same time, a story that has been written, so far as I know, about so few black men.  He was a very good and not so good man at this same time.  And he was a hero, and he was almost a saint, but almost a tragic hero, too.  I was hoping for something like the great John Ford movies, but instead, I got something that reads more like an anti-James Dean.  It's a really good book, and I recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ________. This book is not as good as the one I read before it. It is a book that does not follow the way to train dogs but just tells a story that is completely different. This is why I do not recommend this book. It doesn't follow the steps and it seems that the author is trying to make this book into something that it was not. If it was a proper training book then it would have a few things about how to make a good dog training book. The only problem I have with this book is that I will buy another for myself so I can buy the one that the others did. This might be the reason why I don't recommend this one.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________ _________  I am soooo tired of all the "best of 2016" lists. You can't just put any book in the list. There are simply no books this year that are deserving. And the lists are always dominated by one or two writers, with no mention of any other writers that may be working on similar ideas, themes, or writing. I am trying to write a review that is objective, but to no avail. I can't ignore the overwhelming amount of books that are trying to do the same things. I'm looking at your books list and there is a good chance you will be in it. I just can't say the same for yours. You are not even in the Top 10. I guess that is my only comment.  10/10 for being innovative. I liked your books before I read your first, so I was familiar with the idea.   My experience:   I really liked your first book "Echoes" but I had to change my rating because it was so very similar to "The Last Wish". My original rating was 3 stars because of it similarity, but I've been really enjoying both books. I had an idea for a book that was very similar from reading both books, and it is very easy to compare the two. This is how I'd describe them.  .    "Echoes":   You are a woman named Elizabeth. Elizabeth is born with the ability to see things that others can't. As she gets older she can see the faces of her family and she becomes very protective of them. This does not go over well with her parents who want her to be happy and to let them live in peace. But Elizabeth can't understand why her parents are angry at her and so she leaves home to go live in a small town. In the first act you have a conversation with the mayor of the town, who's name is Mike. Mike is a little bit drunk but when he thinks Elizabeth is talking with him, he starts to tell her some very dark things about his family, including the fact that he killed his sister.   the two of them talk through the night, with the police and Mike telling her what she wants to hear. Elizabeth ends up leaving home to come back to her town and to her family.   The next morning she comes home and she finds her parents gone and her sister is gone. She gets her sister's wallet from the back of a table
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________  I had read a number of positive reviews about the book, so when I saw it on the shelves at Barnes and Noble I picked it up. I'm not going to spoil anything so I will say that there was a few mistakes with some of the grammar, but I'll chalk it up to the fact that the author is a college dropout. He does get a little bogged down with some details but overall the book was enjoyable to read. I will be reading the sequels as well.   I would have liked a little bit more explanation as to how the book works (how long the body really is and the things that happen during the body's lifespan) and more information on how it all fits together (how a body dies and when the body dies). The author does go into more detail about the anatomy of some of these characters and how these bodies differ from one another, but that didn't keep me interested enough to actually go through the whole book (which I didn't want to do anyway).

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This is the second book i have ever had to put down because i couldn't follow it. It is very confusing to the point that i am in need of a good textbook. The first one that i read was the third chapter on the basics of physics. I have only taken one physics class in college, and that was from a text book in middle school. This book should not have been required to take that class and should have been a lesson learned for me.

"The book starts with the following sentence:  The author was a brilliant and gifted scientist until she realized the error in his calculations and corrected it for the next book.  Well, if you are going to start with something like that, please don't do that. The book is bad and you should not listen to me. If you are a fan of the original, this book will disappoint. ....   The book is filled with the kind of mistakes that are common in science. The main character, Dr. Roberta, is obsessed with making the right decisions. However, she made a number of fatal mistakes which resulted in the destruction of her organization, the Mars colony, and her own life. In the original Mars books the main character was obsessed with a science fiction concept called an Exo-Vacuum suit. There is a lot of the same kind of stuff going on in the original books. The original books used a lot more words to describe the things that did not occur. In this book the author had to limit the amount of words that she used, in order to make it more readable. Unfortunately, some of the things did occur. I liked the idea of the Exo Suit but it turned into a huge waste of time....  .   . -A poor first story and first character:............................  -The character development and the plot development: ...........................  to   -the second story, and the third character: ?...................................................................
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I'm giving this one 3 stars because I'm not a fan of the way the characters were written, which led to the plot becoming very predictable, and in the end, boring. I didn't want to like this book, because I don't like that the author was so quick to make assumptions about me that they were not supported by the plot. My main problem was that the writer seemed to be under the impression that the reader was either a total moron, or a totally uneducated, incompetent person who would think of anything for the plot, which meant that the story was always going to be the same way (the way the reader wanted it to go). I hate having to explain myself to people who know more than me, and having to make such obvious mistakes is really annoying, especially when you are writing for a major publisher. The ending was too convenient, and my hopes for the story were never fully realized. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is weak, the grammar is awful and the story is incoherent. Not to mention it's not entertaining. I'm guessing you probably won't enjoy this one as much as the others because you probably want to see a story of a woman who doesn't have the right to a good life and a man who tries to help her get it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I bought this book expecting it to be a very entertaining read. I was wrong. The plot was incredibly boring and not very interesting. It has to be the character development. As an avid fan of the series I was disappointed, but I must admit that I was a bit confused by the fact that we never did find out what happened to the girl who wrote the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I hate how this is written. It's like he's trying to be edgy. The story is very predictable. Don't waste your time. I really don't think you'll find anything that is any good. It doesn't matter that it has a lot of twists and turns because the story itself is so predictable. I don't like how this book is told because I didn't enjoy it in the beginning. I read it in about 1.5 hours. The main character is very one dimensional. I liked how she did something and then made the most stupid comment that I can find. It was just as predictable as the last couple of pages. I felt like this book was just there to try and make a good story out of nothing. I didn and it wasn't. It seems to be a very sad story about a young woman. The book doesn't have much going for it in regards to the story so I didn The book was disappointing. It had a lot to offer and was a lot better than it's description. However, its a very one-dimensional character and it isn't a very exciting book to read either.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~This is a fantastic read. It has a very original style that has a lot of good ideas but the story falls apart and does not flow well. At the end of the book, the main character does not want to continue to read or find out what happens with the plot. ~~The writing is beautiful. ~~~~~~~~~

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received this book from a friend who was a big fan of Stephen King, and she loved the characters and the idea of a big, crazy, violent, haunted house story. She also said this book was one of the most disturbing she had ever read. The character writing was good, and the plot was the one she was most excited for. However, she got distracted and stopped reading a few times and had to turn back a few pages.   The writing was not always well-crafted; it was hard to tell if there was an authorial intent behind some of the dialogue, and I found the pacing a little slow for a book this long. But, I think this could have easily been fixed by cutting some of those long and descriptive descriptions and not just trying to pack in everything in just one paragraph.  ....   ..."   "I've read Stephen King novels. This is like the first one. I don't know what it was that got me, but after the first page or two, I realized that this was a Stephen King novel and that I had been living under a rock for the last 20 years. There are some very dark stories here. I'm a sucker for that. But this was the first time I've felt completely helpless as the story unfolded."   *sigh* I'm reading a Stephen-King novel right now. And I'm not sure if it will turn out to be a great or awful one. But I have no doubt it will be an unforgettable one. And that's the thing, I have not experienced many Stephen King-esque novels in the past. The last I read was "Wyldstyle" which was an excellent Stephen King book. But even that was not an all-time great Stephen King story. I know the characters, but I'm still trying to figure them out. I guess it's my fault for not trying it when I was younger. Or maybe the "pinch-yourself" factor is in play.   and I know that the Stephen King fans out there have been saying this book sucks. It's my opinion that it actually sucks, but that's just me. I've only just now finished reading it, and that may well change. And if it does, I will be the first to admit it.   for those of you who say it sucks, you can read this as a StephenKing book. Don't try to read it as

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I'm not even sure that I could make this comment on the first book, but I found this book absolutely pointless. The plot was bad. It was like reading a bad joke. It had a silly title and then an awkward ending, so I suppose I should've known it wouldn't make sense. It just felt forced. I guess I have to make fun of everything I hate about the world so that it will get me to read the next one.   One good thing about this book was that the author actually wrote an index. He wrote everything down, including the story. This means that you can go back to previous chapters and find the answers to anything that you may have missed. However, I still think that the book would have been better if it were longer, and if he had done more with the characters. The author was pretty good at creating some really amusing characters, but he never really develops them, and they never really feel like people to me. The only time that I felt anything for the main character was when she was doing her makeup for the audition (and she was a good enough actress), so I felt bad for her.  . I would recommend this book, if you want to read about a character you already hate. It is still a fun read.  - Christine Lacey, September 28, 2005  Review is for the first edition, published in the early 80s.   a very bad book - I feel cheated out of the pleasure of this book.   on a whim I got it to read in the library after reading an old edition of it at a book club. It came out in the mid 80s, so i'm sure it was well over 40. I don't remember any particular plot point, except maybe the "witness" is a fraud.  , I got an advance copy from the publisher, and I found it very frustrating - very dull and repetitive. I also don't know why it got so many reviews - it's a bad read. And it is quite hard to find - i have been looking for it since my cousin gave me the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was one of the most disappointing and boring books I have ever read.  It was basically a collection of essays on how to be successful in the business world, with very little in the way of practical advice, and very little about the actual business itself.  The authors spend a lot of time talking about how they went through the process of becoming successful but never tell you anything about how to make the most out of it.  They give lots of advice on what to do for "success" but not much on "business success".  There is very little discussion about how successful people think, how they set goals, how to do it efficiently and how to stay motivated.  If you want to be a successful entrepreneur, the only book I would recommend is  The Millionaire Next Door  by Warren Buffett, because that book is full of great advice for people who have the skills and talent to be entrepreneurs. I am giving this a 3 stars because, on the whole, I enjoyed reading this book and will consider it a "work in progress".  But in spite of the book's overall shortcomings, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to run a successful business, or anyone who is interested in getting more money from their money.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________ The reason I don't like books is because I usually know a lot about what the book is about, before I even start it. This is an exception. This book is called "The Secret". I'm still not sure what this is about. But it sounds like it could be a secret to someone, or something. I would guess. This review is just for people who like to have a good book read to them. There is an afterword by my wife. It is not the best afterword in the world, but it was very nice. _________________________________________________________ I have to confess I didn't read this book before. The title alone made me suspect it was a bad joke or an exercise in irony, but I bought it anyway. At a bargain basement price for a mystery that sounds so silly, I didn' expect much. The book is over 2,500 words long, so I have no idea how many pages it is really, but the story goes in all directions and doesn't seem to have any definite destination. It's really hard to tell where to start. Some sections are very interesting. Others, not so much. There are some very long words and words that are just completely out of context. If you've ever wondered why there are some books where the author tells you that she "dreaded it" when she wrote it, this is probably the book you're looking for. If it does get you to start looking for the book, it will probably be worth your while, but probably not in the way you expected.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "It is a good book, but I find the narrator too much like a college lecturer and I found the prose as stiff as glue.

Write a negative review about a bad book: **************************** This book is filled with inaccuracies, a lot of the information on it is inaccurate, and the writing is very bad.   The author states that there were about 100,000 victims of the holocaust, and that they were the "first people to be killed" in the holodomor. This is not true. The first death camp victims were killed in Nazi occupied Poland. The Nazis used this tactic to justify their genocidal policies against the Polish people. They would not be caught dead killing people in a camp, because then they would be accused of genocide. So they started killing the Jews in the gas chambers in Auschwitz. (The Nazis killed the entire Jewish population in the Warsaw Ghetto.) These gassings were the first time that people had been killed by gas in the Holocaust. By the way, the Auschwitz death camp was opened in 1940. So the holomor claim comes into play at the end of the book.   a book about a war and the people that fought in it: ***********The writer states that Jews were involved in the war for a good reason; they were fighting for a better place in the world. This makes them "good". The book does not address why Jews were fighting, except to say that they did because they were trying to get what was rightfully theirs. The author's statement that they wanted to be in a free country, and wanted to get away from the old country that was oppressing them, is not accepted by historians or the majority of the Jewish population. Most Jews in Europe supported the Nazi regime. The war was very unpopular in Europe. In fact, Jews did not want to be involved. The Jewish people in Europe were extremely persecuted for their race and religion. This was the reason why the Jews that did fight in the German army were usually the most loyal and respected soldiers in the army.   and this is a "bad" book: *************************************************************************** The author does not really write about any real events. The focus of the story is the politics of Poland, the Holocaust, and about the people who died. The entire book is just a description of the events, rather than the history. The writing is atrocious. The sentences are extremely short and the sentences are all over the place. There is little explanation, but very little plot. There are only two major characters in the book, the protagonist, and his Jewish teacher, who does not seem to exist in the story.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a bad novel but it is a mediocre one. I really dislike the first half which is not bad but it seems like a lot of work was spent on the second half. There is no real plot. I felt like the author was just going through the motions with nothing much going on. It's like he is trying to be different but there is no point. If you read this book just because it's a bad one you'll get bored in a short time. The book could have been shorter. I could have read it faster but this is not an easy book to read. This book was very disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________________________________ It was very slow and boring at first. My two sisters did enjoy it and I thought it would be good for a laugh. After I finished I did not laugh a lot of the time and I have heard it from some people that have not laughed very much, but there are still a few laughs. It takes a very long time to get through. I do not understand why it is called "the most expensive dog" when it costs so much. I also would like to mention that after reading the whole book, I would never give this book again, I will probably just give the second book. ___________________________________  Rated 5 out of 5 by mhchapman2 from Great for a slow reader like me I've bought and read other dog books. I've only had this book for three days and already got through it in three days. The first few pages are tedious and it takes about five pages to get to the dog and the dog does not seem that interesting and he's too long for the pages to hold him. It does give the dog's temperament and how it is similar to a German Shepherd. But, it is not a pure German Shepherd Dog.  My dog liked it - she didn't mind the slow start as it took about five chapters to get started with.  to make it easier for you, I've marked where the dog is from, where he is now, what his personality is, and what his temperament is. For the first chapter I only included the dog on page 2, but it took me about 5 pages to figure it out and it took less than a page to get the dog to have the right temperament.  of the 3-6 pages I was writing at the beginning.  and that's what made me start reading it. the dog was a German Shepard dog and he is very similar to my dog in that he is affectionate, loves attention, is obedient, loves to go on walks, loves his toys, and isn't a problem in the house. I think it takes a while to get used to the slow pace and the fact that it is taking so long for him to learn everything and then when he does it is very funny. but then I realized he had learned everything by myself. the first time I read it, he was in a room and was not interested at all. he didn't run up and see what I was doing, didn't bark at me, didn, didn`t
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very disappointing book and poorly edited. I did not finish.   This is the first in the series, so you will have to read them in order.  The plot is very basic.  This book had too many things that did not happen.  If this book had been in the first third of the series I might have given this a pass. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This book was the worst ever. I don't think I've ever read a worse book. It is a collection of essays on the history of the English language and it is filled with garbage. It seems to be written by people who have little to no background in the subject and are basically just writing down some of the best-selling books ever written. I've spent a few hundred dollars on this book and I still can't understand what I'm supposed to get from it. It contains some very good examples and some good points but it all ends up feeling very shallow and pretentious. It has some nice ideas but it's not very well-researched. And it is all written by a guy who has an incredible talent for using dictionaries to prove how many words he is allowed to use.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I bought the book because I had read about it on a message board but was surprised to find it was written for children and younger adults. The children's section was the only thing I found interesting but I'd have to say that the book didn't make me any more interested in children's books since my son started reading them in his late teens. In general I found this book to be a bit hard to read since the author's style seems to use a lot of the same vocabulary and sentences throughout. I had to spend a good part of the book re-reading it. The story doesn't have a clear goal or a clearly defined goal. It just seems to go in the direction the author wants. It seems like they didn't try to write a good story so they just write words. It's a waste of their talent. They could have done so much more. A very poor choice.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I've always been curious about writing, and reading about the people who did it, and I've been interested in what's on their minds. This book didn't appeal to me. As a writer and as a reader, I find myself disappointed and annoyed at the same time. The authors use the same language, but it feels like a tired way to write about a topic. And the book seems to boil down to a bunch of disconnected ideas and opinions, none of which are well considered or well thought out. The most annoying thing for me was how all the information the author provides in this book were presented, in one way or another, as facts and details about how the book was written. I'd find it interesting to know exactly how they came up with that stuff. Not to mention the fact that they even tried to link the books in this series to the real world. The information is presented in a way that suggests it's supposed to make sense to us. It's not that easy to make the book work. It feels forced to me at times. I know it's not the fault of the author, but you can tell it just isn't intended for my tastes, and probably won't appeal for the reader either.   This series is intended for young adults, so I guess the first thing I'll say is that you won't be able to understand the plots. There's little to no exposition and there are almost no explanations. For that reason, it's pretty hard to understand who is the author of the book, and how the plot is progressing. In fact, it isn't even clear how the books are linked to one another. They have a little connection to one of the books, but not enough to be interesting. As the series progresses, the book goes on a long and slow burn. At first, it appears to have all the elements to be good and entertaining, but by the end, it just feels like the authors took all of the elements that worked in the first book and threw them away. I find the pacing pretty slow as well. I was looking forward to this book, but I can't say that I enjoyed it in the end. I don't recommend this book to anyone because the authors haven't made it easy to understand what is going on in the story. And for a first book, it is pretty long. I think the most important things to get out of this book is that the books can be read by teenagers, and
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- The writing is awful, and the author does a terrible job at writing descriptions. As if it's necessary to be explicit in describing something like this. I was more of a listener. The narration just wasn't that good. It was as if the author didn't realize how good he had it in front of him. --------------- I liked this book. It had an interesting plot. The characters were intriguing and the plot was engaging. It is a good read, but I wish it would have been shorter.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________   1. The characters were all pretty good, with good writing and acting.   2. The book was boring. I enjoyed the story, but it was so dry it was hard to stay interested.     3. There were too many scenes of just people talking about things that they didn't really care about.   and:   4. There was a major plot hole that I just couldn't figure out.   (It's only like a two minute scene, but I can't help but think that if I hadn't already read the book and learned the answer from the book, then I might have come up with the answer before I started reading.)   I like a good book, but this was just bad.   a two star book.  /view spoiler Hide spoiler

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I love the way this book ended - it's as if the author wanted to show us how dangerous a psychopath can be, but kept writing the book in such a way that it was clear that she couldn't get to her goal.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------------------- I was so disappointed. I liked the idea, and it was cool to read the actual story. I loved the characters, but they don't live up to the concept. The story is so convoluted that there was no way to follow the story even if I wanted to. I tried to understand why things happened the way they did. It was hard. The main character, who is trying to win the love of the main character and a random girl, ends up turning out to be a rapist and a murderer. The love plot turned into love triangles, not because the characters love each other, but because they needed to be the central plot line of the book. It ended so confusingly that I was confused for days.   I hate reading books with twists. There is so much to take in.   I wanted this book to be better. I really liked the characters. I would have loved to have known their motives better. The narrator was okay. It got tiring to listen to him talk about something he had done that I really had no idea what he was talking about. I guess he got bored because the book wasn't very good.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!!!!I was really excited to pick up this book when it was advertised as a 'newbie friendly' book. I'm sure I'll enjoy it, but what I've heard from others is that this book is not so much a beginner book as it is a book with lots of good information for someone looking to get started with electronics and circuits, but who doesn't want to spend the $50 on some decent books that can answer all the questions he may have about what goes where. The problem I've found, is that I've never really needed to know what the 'A' in I-C is for. I don't know if that's the author's fault or not, but this book seems to assume that every first time circuit builder is going to need a "A", or that someone like me (who has spent a lot of time working with electronics as a hobby), needs to know all the "A's" and all the terminology. But, I have absolutely no idea what the A's mean in electronics, except when someone tells me I need an inverter to go from a 9v battery to a battery which uses 12v. I know what an inverting input is, but I still need a little explanation. I've bought books about circuit boards for hobbyists, but never any books that would answer all of the questions I have, and then would tell me what the heck a DPDT switch does, or the difference between an input diode and an output diode. For a beginner, there is a lot to learn about what does and doesn't work in circuits, so I could use a book that would teach me how to start with what's needed in circuits. I got the book because of the "How to make circuits" part of the book. While I can make circuits, it's not what I'm looking for. My interest is mostly in making "home-brewed" circuits with all sorts of different circuit devices (especially LEDs). My desire is to make circuit boards. The book is a great start, and I think I'll start making circuits with this book. But I think it could be better.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never liked the book. It just got repetitive and boring, and the characters in it were not that interesting.  In the end it ended up just being a tedious and boring story about how a boy got lost in his house.  I liked the girl better than the boy and I liked it a little bit better than books from this series  Overall:  This book was very short, but it was very bad. The story was not interesting to read. It was like watching the same scenes over and over again. I just don't know if the book will be worth my time and money or if it's the same story as the last few ones in the series. It felt like I watched the same movie a few times. ,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am in the middle of reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It has many good reviews and good ratings so I'm not so sure why I'm reading it now. It doesn't really interest me as much as I thought it would. It is an autobiographical account of a famous person. I read a lot of biographies and biographies of famous people so I have a pretty good idea how to write an autobiography. The plot is not really interesting to me, it is almost predictable.   The character of Nick Carraway is not one I would like to know better about. It seems like Nick is always looking for a way to make a difference. I have seen Nick on TV several times, he is a great actor and really doesn't seem like a very nice person, even though he has a very high public profile. I am not sure if the other characters are as despicable as Nick. There is also a female character that I found really annoying. In fact I hate both her and Nick. The other characters seem very much like archetypes that you can see from an airplane. They have this huge personality and they always have something to say about something and always seem to have a point. The only thing I really liked was the main character.   the other thing I hated was the use of the word "it" which is always the same when talking about something. When I started reading the book I did not expect to like the story very much. In the end I found it interesting, sad, beautiful, and moving.

I enjoyed it so much, that I wanted to listen to it over and over and read more books that have similar plots.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ****************** I read this book as an undergraduate in college and never found it to be a useful text on a variety of subjects. I found the writing style (I was an English major) to be very clunky and awkward. I didn't get much of the story, and the author didn't do a good job of presenting ideas to the reader. The prose seems to be all about words and adjectives, rather than the actual ideas.  ******************** I did not get very far in this book. This is a text book for first year college students in an introductory course on philosophy and other social sciences. It would probably be a good choice for a freshman or sophomores course.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's all too obvious, that the author has a huge problem with writing women characters. There is zero variety of women characters in this book, but instead there are only two (the "good" one, who is pretty, and the "bad" one.  They're both ugly, stupid, and stupid characters, and they're the only ones in the story. I'll have to give the rest of the characters another shot.  I will say, though, that it's nice that she gives us a woman in a very good position to kick ass and take names. I guess the author felt it was necessary to include a character who is strong enough to take care of her daughter and mother, while not being a "strong woman" in the conventional sense (and who can't do magic, but is just a regular person who has her moments of bravery). There are several ways to make a character seem stupid:  - Giving him one useless skill or ability - Just giving the characters dumb choices and then showing how stupid they are - A character with only one or two choices, and not even making an attempt to use them - Never letting the character have any kind of moral dilemma or dilemma that is not obvious.  It's just a sad day when a book can have so many smart choices and characters and then fail to include the smartest or the most interesting character.  This is a book about women, who want to be treated as equals, but it does nothing but reinforce stereotypes and stereotypes about women. I'm sorry, but if you really want to write good women, don't have them act like stupid, weak, weak women.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think the only reason this book is still around is the lack of good books on the subject, and my lack of buying into some of the conspiracy theories. I was disappointed at how easy it was for the authors to spin their book in such a way that I was led to believe there is a large, global plot to take over the world and make a bunch of money off of the people, when it all comes down to one individual, the President of the United States.  It just seemed like it could have been written for an easy money grab book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  I am a long-time, regular reader of L.E. Modesitt Jr.'s stories. When I read "The Devil's Mirror," I was looking for something new, a new spin on a familiar character, an intriguing premise and some exciting adventure. I was disappointed. I'll get the book. I do hope this book is more than a disappointment and a waste of my time. The book has some good concepts, the plot is intriguing, the characters are interesting, and the writing style is very good. I know, I know…I'm a sucker for new and original concepts. I will be reading the sequel, "The Lost Queen." I'm sorry I had to put up with a waste-of-time story like this.  6 of 6 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------ I read this book when it first came out and thought it was great. I even took the time to recommend it to several friends, only to have one friend completely fail to mention it to me. Then, my friend's husband told me he didn't know about the book and I didn't mention it, either. That's when I realized how much of a shame it would be to just not mention the book. I guess I could have simply said, "I didn't buy it," but I think that would be worse. So, I will write this review and hope that the other reviewers don't forget that this is a book that is good. ------------------------- 1) Why does this guy keep getting in so much trouble? The first few chapters explain the situation but he keeps getting into trouble even when it doesn't make sense. And, he keeps saying things like "what did I do?" He gets caught trying to "help" the old lady. Why? Why does he do what he does? He thinks it's cool. But it's not cool. So he gets caught, and he tries to explain to the old guy that "he" is "just like you" and "he'll get away with it" but the old man thinks he's crazy. What's really going on here? 2) He thinks he can be a super guy to the world. Well, no. ********* So, the old woman and her family are starving because of the drought. They can only make do with what they have and the old people can't take care of them anymore. So the young man is helping out. What do we know about him? He's a "super guy". He's rich. He's the one who can take care and feed the old folks. Why does that make sense? The old woman is not so much happy with that. She wants her food, and the money, and her freedom. She's willing to trade anything for that. Why wouldn't she? The young man, he says, "helps" her by telling her about "super powers". You can't trust this guy! And the old couple is very angry about his involvement. They keep threatening to kill him and he doesn't think they'll do it because he's "super". But he doesn a great job convincing the couple that "super" people can do anything. The old couple decides they'd rather have him dead than see him go to prison and ruin his

Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ A terrible novel. The plot is awful and boring, the characters are really dumb, and the language is awful. All characters are terrible, even the one who is actually funny. I can't believe it's not in the top 100 worst books I've ever read. This book is the absolute WORST and I'll never read a book like it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a collection of very poor writing by a very incompetent writer. I don't know where he found his material, but his writing is like a kid who wrote "The Berenstain Bears" in elementary school.   The only reason that I can think of for the poor writing is the fact that he had the help of several of his "sources" who were more experienced writers than he was. This is a very common practice, where a writer needs help with his work (read: other people's work) and so they'll write the material they've been given in a book, then get some help to improve it, and this is how I was able to finish reading this book (and, as far as I know, other books of his). And, frankly, I don the book was awful in this way, but for reasons that are beyond me.   I'm sure his "writer" friends are glad he's got help, but when you're writing your own stuff for a living, I can understand how it can be a little embarrassing. This book should have ended with the disclaimer that this is just my opinion, and I can't stress this enough. I know the world of writers and they're all different, but if you're reading books from a book that was originally written by other people, you need to really think about what you're doing, and the words you're using.  : This book was written in a hurry by a kid. There's a lot of material in here, and all of it is written very quickly, without really a lot to say. His "source" material (who has never actually written a sentence in her life, in her own words, that isn't a sentence about another book in this book) talks a lot about how great the characters in the books are and how much she adored them. That's nice, but in reality the book has the characters all talking like they were trying to convince her to marry them. There were lots of scenes that didn't have any real effect on the plot (a man falling in love with his boss's daughter is supposed to have a big effect on her, but it never actually does). There's also the fact he wrote this book on one of those cheap paper thin books you get at a drug store, and it just isn't the sort of paper thin book that you should write your own book on. That being said, the story is told really well

It's the first time the KingJames Bible has been published in the United States. Many churches have already purchased and are reading it, which is wonderful. What you may not know is that this new Bible is a translation of the New International Version (NIV), a translation which has not changed since it was first released in 1961.  A year ago I spent three weeks in the British Isles, where I studied the NIV, as well as the Westminster (Rite) and the American Standard (ASV). I'm sure that the English translations I was using are also good, but I do not know them well enough to determine whether the NSS or the NJV are better.  it's really interesting how much the Niv has changed since the KJV was published. If you're interested in that, go to the Wikipedia page for the NVI. :)

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never read this book, but the synopsis is very interesting and is the kind of books I could enjoy, so I am rating it 4 stars.   (Also, this is one of the first books I read from the Amazon.com website and I do not have any complaints about the quality of the content.)   As for the book, it is about a girl who is born with the ability to see and hear the ghosts of the dead.  Unfortunately, her mother died when she was very young, and her father died when her parents were very young.  Her father died of an illness, and she went to live with her grandmother in a village that is haunted by ghosts, and there she meets the ghost of a young boy called Doreen.  As we know, ghosts can see the past, and they are called "the dead."   However, they have to obey the rules and not harm living people.  They can not touch the living, and can only see when people move.  But they can see at night and at times the day, and some of them have been around Doreens parents and even their own mother.  However there is a limit, and in this story, Doreened is scared by the ghost Doreeny who tells her the consequences of making a mess.  Doreeeny gives Doreena a small warning before she starts to make a mess, and then tells her that when Doreene makes a mess she will be punished by the living people and Doreenes father.  Then Doredena tries to explain to Doreenny that there is no such thing as ghosts, but Doreenne can not believe it.  At first, Dorothy is not interested in the story, but soon her curiosity gets the better of her and she starts reading the book.  When she comes to the conclusion that she is in the wrong place and she needs to get away from it, she tells Dorey the story.  I like that this book has a happy ending and has some happy moments, but it is very depressing that this is not the book that will help Doreenda, but instead makes it seem like Dorene is in hell.  Overall, this was a fun story that I would like to read, and I will continue to read the stories that I liked.  ...more notes Notes are private! recommender none votes 1 # times read
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book that I would never want to read.  When I finished this book I was crying.  I found this book boring.  I can not understand why anyone would ever want to write in this style of book.  If anyone has any ideas to improve this book, please write me a review.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- It's a sad story that ends with the young girl not understanding what happened to her father or her mother. Not a great book.  I bought it as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend who has read it and liked it. It is a fun, interesting book to read. The only complaint I have is that there are too many typos throughout the book. Some were small and not hard to spot, and others were more difficult to fix. I would suggest reading it on the Kindle. 's story is one that I was really looking forward to. I think it is a beautiful story, and it is quite sad. I thought it was a little corny at the end, but I did like it. I was hoping it would be a little more like the book that it resembled in style and storyline. It wasn't, so I am sorry to say that I didn't enjoy it. Overall, I will be reading the second book in the series, but the first won't be getting a re-read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A really bad book. I found the plot to be so confusing. I didn't understand why he wanted to kill me and why I couldn't do anything about it. I ended up thinking he was just a crazy man who hated everyone. I would have really liked to have read about how he came to be as a vampire and what his life was like before the accident. I wouldn't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book will always be bad. The writing is atrocious. I can't tell you how many times I tried to read this book and the words just wouldn't come out right. The characters are really bland and are nothing like the characters in any other book I have read. I understand that if you are not familiar with the characters then the writing will seem somewhat familiar but that's just not the case. I found it very frustrating that there was not a single character that really grabbed my attention or was really intriguing to me. The plot itself is just one long story about how all these different parts of our world started to break apart due to the lack of love. The worldbuilding and setting are so bad it's almost embarrassing. All these parts of the world are just so cliche that it almost ruins the book for me. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is too short. I was hoping for a book that was about the Vietnam War. Instead it's about the history of the Vietnam war from the war's early years through to the early years of the current war in Afghanistan. It's not the history you want to read about, but it is the history we have. The authors make a lot of claims about how the U.S. government and the military handled Vietnam. While I find that they have an axe to grind, it is a fact that the Vietnam era was very complex. As a Vietnam vet I find it very hard to take on a book like this that makes sweeping generalizations about the military and politics. The book also makes claims about the CIA that were either not accurate or exaggerated. The author's argument that the CIA was used to stage false flag attacks and was being used for political purposes was very hard for me to take. It seems that the author is trying to present a conspiracy theory that is not supported by the available evidence.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the most terrible books I have ever read. In addition to all the horrible, horrible things about the book (the story, the plot, the characters, the prose, the story, etc...) The writing is terrible and the style is just terrible. I hate reading books like this and I will not read another one of these bad books in my life. I want to just throw my head back and go "Wow, that was a bad idea". P.S. I'm not kidding, I really just can't stand this kind of writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure what I'm expecting, so it was a bit of a surprise when it wasn't even good. It's mostly in the way it has its characters - they are just the same boring little people who can't stand one another - that it fails. But the book is too long, too long. It feels like I've read this book 20 times already, because so much of it is just repetitive. Even the characters have little to do, and we get to know them all pretty well. I was bored the entire time I was reading this.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------------------I started this book in order to read it as a group, so I could watch their reactions to it, as I had not read it myself, and I thought I would give it a shot. I must say, that I have not enjoyed reading any of the previous books in this series. The beginning of this one was interesting and I was intrigued by the characters, but when it really came down to it it was just an excuse to write more fantasy and less science fiction. At least not to me. --------------------------I give this book three stars, but it needs a few more. It was just okay.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read this book and it made me want to vomit. It's an attempt to write a horror-noir in a fantasy setting. In the middle of the book, the narrator goes into a long diatribe about how he would rather live in a world where his wife would go to hell if she didn't obey him, than where he had to follow God's laws. It was just a lot of whiny brats yelling at a god that doesn't really exist to not go to heaven.  It's an obvious attempt to sell books, but it does not work.   This was the first book I bought for my friend's birthday. It wasn't for him.  It was for me.  The book is about the aftermath of an earthquake.  A small town has been ravaged by the quake.  One family has been wiped out. The narrator gets pulled in to help rebuild the town.  Once there, he has to figure out how to help those that lost everything.  When it comes to the people he met on the way to the small town, he just doesn't care, but the townsfolk don't understand.  This was the book I wanted to read, but I'm so glad I didn't.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not for someone who has a history of allergies. It is, however, for someone, like me, who is allergic to cats.  The title is misleading because not all cats are the same and the book does not discuss the actual causes of allergy and how to handle them.  I was so frustrated with this book.  It starts off by stating that allergies are not contagious.  Now I'm not sure if there are any other causes of allergies, but this certainly is not one of them.   The other reason why it's misleading is that it's very dry.  I really want to learn more about allergies but I just had to put this book down.  And the book has lots of bad ideas.  For example, in the section on cats I'm reading, I see the statement: "If your cat barks, don't go into the room. That's the same as saying you should stay outside. You don't have to worry that there's something on you."    Wow.  The other ideas I see are: "Keep a close watch on your baby. It could be in danger of developing an allergy."    And: "It's best to keep the cat in a small room at home, where you can see it but where there are no toys or foods. It's not enough to leave the cat alone all day or even all week. You can't live without your cat. If it gets too sick, you have to put it down."  The author, for all her "facts" about allergies, is a pet parent and I'm pretty sure she was more interested in writing a book about the life of a cat than it was about allergic cats.   I think I read this book before and I just felt like I missed some of the good ideas and insights. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________   "You can never go home again!"   First off, I don't feel comfortable with this book at all, this book has such an awful title (and I'm sorry but it makes the book so much worse) I never would have chosen this book to read but for the fact I heard about it through a friend. I read about it in a school book and thought I would give it a try, not wanting to ruin my education with this stuff (I don't want to ruin the educational opportunities of others so I'm pretty strict with reading materials, I hate being spoon fed and this book is about as spoon fed as you can get).   This book is so far from being good that I don' think it deserves a review at all.   I don' have much to say about this book, I can't seem to find anything good about it, I really am not impressed.   of the 12 chapters there are just 2-3 that are actually good and that's it. There is just one good part of this book and that is the last few pages which I really found to be a little emotional and sad. The ending is the only good part, there isn't much else.   The main character is very bland and not very likable and I just don't like him. He's a young boy who has his eyes on a pretty girl and he does this through out the book to try and catch up with her but that isn't very believable at all either. I have to believe she can find her own love interest and a man that she can marry, and that she won't ever need a friend like this again.  , the bad part is the author tries to portray the girl he is with as the innocent victim so he's the only one to blame for her troubles and his feelings are completely justified, which is a complete 180 from how she actually acts, it is so sad. This whole book just makes me want to take a shower and just lay in the grass thinking about how awful this book was and how much I hated it. I really wanted this book not to exist and that I can take a moment out of my busy day and actually read something that isn' so bad.   "No one who is willing to stand up against the corruption and injustice in this world can call themselves a realist."
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! It's very hard to understand why someone would buy this. I know this is not a bad novel, I just don't understand why anyone would read it. I've looked at every page twice, I've checked the back of the book, and I don't know what the author is trying to tell us. It is so confusing. I don´t like the plot, it´s not original, the characters are not well drawn, and there is just no clear purpose in the story. And yet I think it´d be really interesting to read. It's not something I'd recommend, and if it really is a bad story, I hope they don't have to send me the bad copy for a refund.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The best review I've read about this book was a review of the audio version published in the Sunday Times. The author's comments about the reviewer's personal experience of being sexually abused are highly offensive to all victims of sexual abuse, not just those who are abused as children. The author was the person who reported the alleged sexual abuse to the police, and when this individual later had to testify for herself, she called the author 'an asshole'.  I understand that this author's own experience of abuse may not be an entirely accurate representation of all abuse victims, but I don't believe it would be a valid perspective for those who do not have experience of sexual or emotional abuse, or abuse perpetrated by anyone who is not their abuser. A great many adult survivors of sexual and emotional abuse are in fact able to live normal and fulfilling lives after their experiences of abuse.  If these are not valid perspectives, I am not sure what they are.  The final line of the book was: 'So many writers, especially those who have suffered abuse, have been so intent on writing about their abuse that they have ignored the fact that they were abused first. I think the abuse has become too common and too normalized.'  I believe the author is correct that there have been too many writers who have written about their experiences as children who have focused almost exclusively on abuse that was perpetrated by strangers or family members.  The last line of this review:  It is, at best, a very bad book and, at worst, a book that will only serve to encourage the abuse of children.  (The book was also made available on Kindle for free, but that's another story.) I cannot recommend this book to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found it hard to believe that a book this "exquisitely researched" would be so utterly awful.  The main reason for my disappointment is that I was looking forward to an interesting story that was told well. _____________________________________________ If there is one thing I've learned from the Internet, it's that most of the time, if a book is available on the web, it is available for free.   That is one reason I've been reading so many of these "exhaustive" "encyclopedia" style books.  I wanted a good book to read with my kids and they are into "Star Trek" so the library was out of the question.  So I went looking for the book.  Then I discovered it was free to download so I decided to give it a try.  As I read more I started to notice a few things.   It is a bit "old fashioned" and quite a bit of the writing seemed dated.   For a book with such a well researched history, there are few quotes that seemed current.  It is an encyclopedia that is aimed at an audience that is not interested in the details of the Star Trek universe.  While this may appeal to some, I found the book to be pretty boring.  Some of the quotes were interesting but it was really more of a history of the characters rather than a detailed look at the universe. It was a bit difficult to keep track of the information.  In addition, I was left wanting more information about the characters.   The characterizations seemed lacking and seemed like they could have been better.  Again, this book is not aimed at a broad audience but a very specific audience, those with a strong interest in Star Trek and the history of Gene Roddenberry and the production staff.  To sum up, it was a good "how to" book for those interested in Star Wars but not necessarily Star Trek.  Perhaps a better book to buy is "Trek: A Visual History of the Original Series"  which would give a better look at that world.  3/11/05
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I've already started reading the sequel. This was probably one of my most anticipated books this year. It's a book about two college girls who are in love with one another. The first was an interesting read, because it dealt with love, but also about their families. The second one, however, did not interest me. There are not enough things that happened in it to make you feel anything but bored."
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********  The narrator did not write well, he made up his own words like in the book. He sounds like a person reading a book that he read. In the book the narrator said that this is the story of a lady who married a man to die. However, this is a fiction and she is very young, so I cannot imagine that a lady would be married to die and this is only in the story. I am disappointed because the narrator read like a kid reading a story he is writing. There was nothing bad about the book, however the book did have some issues.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A very confusing novel, and at times it seems to have an almost supernatural quality as the characters jump from character to character and then back to the first one. If you don't know who Harry is or what he is doing, the book is nearly impossible to follow. I guess you can say that the author did it his way. However, the plot is quite thin and, for me, the pacing is just a bit too slow. The book is interesting at times, but it just doesn't quite make sense. And I have to wonder, what is the point of the entire thing? Is Harry going to save everyone, or is he going to take them all down with him?"   -- James, February 1, 2012  "It is a short book, which doesn't mean it's not fun and well written. It has a very simple plot with very little action or drama; but the characters are very well done."   - - - - Books are like people - - they say what they mean, when they mean it, and sometimes they don't mean all that well. The characters in this book may seem to be a bit of a mess to the reader at times. But I think they do have a clear purpose and a purposeful life of their own, even if you can't quite understand it at the time. I like the way the story is told and that it is very well written even though there may be some oddities here and there. I do recommend this book to fans of adventure and science fiction, although it might take a while to get used to. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only thing that was good about this book was the concept, I thought I'd love to see a sci fi book with aliens and aliens have powers and you're just sitting there, waiting for the book to end, but nothing came of it and I've already read the sequel so I'm not really interested.  I didn't have an issue with the author, she was fun to listen to, however the writing style wasn't my cup of tea.  About the author:  I like to keep up with what is happening in the world, especially in science fiction.  I love reading about other cultures, languages and races, but I'm always curious to see how science fiction is going to address these themes.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed this book but was not very engaged throughout the whole book. I felt that the book was mostly just a series of vignettes that were very short and not very exciting. The characters seemed a little weak and not fully developed.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********************* **********  I'm a big fan of the old-timey adventure books and loved this one. The writing was excellent, the characters were interesting and I was really curious to see where it all went. I also liked the fact that it was in such a dark and depressing environment (I had no idea of the depths of that world until I was already in there). However, as a storyteller, I can not get over the fact (or maybe this is the result of being in my 20's and having no real life experience) that there was no sense of time in this book. The entire book took place in the same hour. I've never seen this one before, but the ending was just a complete disappointment. Maybe I was hoping for more? Well, I think it is time for a re-read for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is very misleading and is misleading to a lot of people, especially if they do not have an engineering background. If you have not gotten your engineering degree yet, I do not recommend it to you, even if you are an engineer. I have heard people recommend it and do not even understand it. I got it as an engineering major and it was like reading a book that was not based on any engineering research. It is a very technical book. If I have to say one positive thing about it, it is that you do not need to have a B.S. in engineering to learn it, but you do need to learn the concepts of mathematics. If there is no math in the book, you will not understand it at all. The other negative thing about this book is that it is all about using computers, which you can do with a little effort, but is not very helpful if you do do math yourself.  13 of 14 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------ You know the one...the one that never gives up on the main character no matter what. When she finally sees her parents, they're killed and then she must have been in an insane asylum, until the book ends.   The story is ok. I never found it too compelling for me. I liked that the author tried to explain how she went insane but it never quite hit home for me as it could have. Also, I felt there was a lot of sex in this book. The author does not explain it but I feel it may have been foreshadowing, but I wasn't a big fan.   for a series of only 3 books it has a lot to offer...especially if you are into historical fiction
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________This is the worst book I've ever read, it's just not very good, not at all, I can't wait for next book to come out,I wish I could give zero stars. I was so confused about some of the things this book was about, the first book was so bad, I thought I would like this one and I was wrong, really, I really can't imagine why the author put so much time into this. I really wanted to love it but it was just so bad. It was just an awful story and so boring, this author just wasted a lot of my time, I was in the middle of thinking I loved this book when I finished it, it really was a waste. I'm not sure if I could recommend this one to anyone and the book is so short, it doesn't have a whole lot of time to develop anything, and the author just didn't know what he was doing and the first half of the book just goes from bad to worse, the ending is kind of sad too, but I guess that's to be expected from a short story. I guess this book isn't that good either. I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for a quick read or someone who isn't a fan of short stories but just wants something to read and get through the day, this is the wrong book for that person to get through.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!I gave this book 4 stars but my main criticism is its poor and illogical plotting. I was expecting a story about a hero who becomes a demon or something. I got a story of a guy who wanted to be a demon (or as he liked to call it "lizardman" or "demon"). This story is very predictable and the story just flows along. You start off with this "lady" named Sarah (who, you'll notice, can't have a heart, no matter how hard she tries) getting sick. She goes to a doctor who finds she has a demon in her and sends her back to the "real" world. A week or so later, she comes back, just in time for the end of this book. I'm sure this was to set up a sequel, but I'll never be able to read it, even though I'm a fan of John Burdett.!!!It was also quite annoying when the book started with an introductory scene which didn't include any other people but just the two main characters in the story. This is the first thing that annoyed me about this book and I had to put in an extra 3 or so pages just so I could read the introductory scene again.!!!!This isn't even a huge problem since I usually read this book from the start and skip over all the scenes like this. But since the author doesn't know how to write dialogue, and doesn't even bother to use dialog to give the story purpose, I felt I had no reason to continue. I guess I'm just a bit of a nitpicker, but this is one of the worst books I've ever read.!!!!!!!!!!!  5 of 6 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I will never buy another John Grisham book!  - - -   1. This book is the epitome of Grishams. It is well written with the kind of style of an accountant. In a word: stupid and pretentious. I did not laugh once, I couldn't even get through the first 10 pages! I did, however, really enjoy it! : this book is not worth reading:The premise of this book isn't so bad but the author never explains his method and just throws in random words to help us understand. His methods are not new but he just continues to write the same old bullshit. The story does not end the way I would like. It has a few good parts. However, the plot makes no sense. Also, I didn't like the ending. I wanted more but I feel like it's just going to be some long, boring chapter at the end.This book is nothing new but the title is so stupid. I didn\'t read the book before but I didn\t even know what a vampire was before reading this book. This author should have just stuck to the title of the book and not made the stupid title up! - - -This book was extremely boring. I mean, when did people start using the term "epic"? He only ever writes one good scene in the entire book, which is completely unrelated to the main plot. There is nothing exciting about this book and the ending was absolutely stupid. In the end, there were a few interesting parts but they just didn\'ts fit into the whole book and it was boring. This is definitely not a great book! : this book was not worth the $3.99 price tag: This book was very boring. The author did not explain his method of writing a novel. I never understood how he could write such a bad story. I was just bored with it. I will never purchase a Grishamy book again. This novel would be better if he could only write one good story. - -  I bought this book, thinking it would be an interesting read and something I would enjoy. I must admit it was very disappointing.   After the first few pages I just couldn't stomach it, but the story kept moving along at a slow but steady pace and the action was somewhat compelling. The novel does not really stick the landing in any way, but I don\'t care. I am finished with it and
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read many of the novels in this series and this is the worst of the bunch. Not only is this book boring but also it's written in a way that made me angry. It's like every sentence has a different plot twist and every twist leads to the next book. When I finally finished the story of "The Kingkiller Chronicle" it made me sad. I know this is a fantasy series, but this book was way too much for my liking. If I were to read another book in this universe I would probably choose something else. (I'd choose one from the "The Wise Man's Fear" series instead.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing style is awful. It's very choppy, with the writing going back and forth between the characters and some of the plot. There's also a lot of repetition, sometimes a lot more than once. It seems like each chapter is completely different. It reads very slow. The narration is very weak, in fact, it is awful to listen to and has a kind of monotone quality.   It's hard to describe, but I felt as though I was in the middle of something when I was reading the book. Not in a bad way, just not in a good way. It didn't have the feeling of an adventure.  , by Anne C. Cleary, read by the author, was also awful. I read this when I still had my love for adventure novels.I was so excited to read it that I had to finish it just to figure out the ending! The writing style was good enough, but the story itself was so weak that I can't really recommend it. There wasn't much excitement, it was just about a man's journey through a jungle.The narrator didn't seem very fluent, especially if I were a native speaker. She seemed to repeat words. Also, some of her dialogue was just awful, as if she was just reading a book. That's what happened with most of her narration, some really long sentences and some really short sentences that seemed to not have much meaning. Also I would have liked more character development. The book was long, but not that long. I felt like it was dragging out the whole time and wasn't very exciting. This was the worst book I've ever read and I'm not even sure why I kept reading it.I can't put this book on the best books of 2015 list because I felt that the plot was really weak, with too many twists and turns that were confusing and rushed. But the book does have some good parts and I think I may have to re-read it after I finish the book next month. This is a book I could have read ages ago, but now it's just too annoying and dull.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did read this book but it was a horrible waste of time. I got so caught up in the story and the characters that I just didn't stop to think about the plot and pacing of the novel. The characters were terrible and the story was terrible. I just wish I would have given this book a 1 star rating. It's not worth the time it takes to read it and if I would give this book 5 stars, I'd be writing a 1-star review.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- This book is a total disaster, and it comes up short in every way possible. I was hoping for a good read, but instead this book reads like a first draft of a script for a bad comedy movie. ------------ So here we have a woman (Holly) living on the streets of New York City after a horrible car accident killed her parents. She has been told by the social workers she's being placed in the care of that she may live out her days in a hospital, but she wants to go home. So she goes to a social worker (I would have picked an older white man, but a middle-aged Asian woman doesn't seem right for this type of situation) and asks for a ride to the hospital. Turns out the social worker has an agenda, that he wants Holly to get a job so she can have "credits". In order for this to happen he has to find someone who he can make an appointment for, and that person needs to be Holly's mother, who doesn't know she has a daughter. Holly doesn't really understand what this is, but her mother is so grateful for the ride, that she agrees to drive her to the appointment. At this appointment, she tells the social work department that she needs to find a job, and is in love with the social service worker. The social worker and the social services department don't care about her at all. The only thing that matters is that she can get her "credentials". The social workers also are looking for a "welfare case" (the case in which an adult is living on public assistance) because she's been living on food stamps and disability. (I'm not sure who they're supposed to be helping, but they are not providing the best of care). The social services staff don't even bother to look into how the car accident occurred (why didn't they call the police? I think if the social agencies could get a warrant, they should have gotten the paramedics there, but then there's the possibility that she got her credit.) So when they find Holly, the social welfare case worker wants to place her in the emergency shelter system. Holly is against it because they are "wasting" money. So the social employee (actually the social department) says they will place her at a Salvation Army, that is for women and children only. Holly knows better, but decides she has to do this because she is in "love". The Salvation Army will
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I really enjoyed the book but the characters in the book were extremely annoying.  I don't know why but I hated the characters.  They were all boring, immature people.  It was all wrong.   I didn't understand any of it at all.  And I know it's hard to read a book about a vampire.  But this book was a bore.  Why?  The main character was stupid and the only thing the main character ever accomplished was to turn someone to a vampire." This is not a review of a book, it's a review.  For the purpose of my review, let me refer to the character of Mina.  As far as the novel itself, I was a little disappointed.  However, I do want to address one issue I had with the book.  The title.  To me, the title of this book is a little misleading.  There are several stories, in different order, that are told, yet I felt like each of these stories were not necessarily as important as the others.  When it comes to the main story of M.A.S.H., we do see several characters that make an important, lasting impact on our lives.  We also see characters that have great power, yet we do not get to see what impact that has on the main characters.  And if I read the book properly, there is a story I wish we would get to hear about the character named Captain America.  While we did not see much of him, what we did see was that he was one of the most powerful superheroes in the Marvel Universe.  Yet, we do get to learn a little bit about Captain America, but we never get a chance to see the impact that his power has had on the people that he has saved.    And with that, I will end my review.  For me, this book will end with an 8.0 rating.  I did not enjoy this book at all, but I did enjoy M.H.S, and this is the reason I still recommend the book to people.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- The story had a beginning and middle and the middle was pretty good, however the end did not go in a great direction. The ending was really disappointing. In the beginning we get to know the characters, the reason why the story is about, the way they feel about each other, the relationship between them, and then, out of nowhere, outta nowhere, they get together and it goes in a bad direction, I can't say much more without spoiling the whole book, because I have to admit I'm still having a hard time believing it happened because it doesn't feel real, and it doesn 't feel like a romance, it feels more like a love triangle. So yes, in my opinion, this is a terrible book. (hide spoiler)  This is a great book, if you're a fan of the romances genre, because the story, although not a romance (it's not supposed to be either), it's definitely a romance and you will love this book, just like I loved it. I thought it was an interesting story about a woman who wants to be a successful writer, and a man who wants her to be successful, but who doesn't want to marry her. I think it's a great story and it's great that I didn't have to know much about it, because it was so enjoyable reading it. The book is about a girl who is writing a book and a guy she meets who tells her how to be the best writer. There's a lot of talk about how books need to be finished on time, and how to not write when you're in a rush. She meets a boy and they fall in love, but she wants to end things, to move on to something else, but he wants to stay together. Then things take a turn, and we get a very dramatic end. I loved how the story turned out and I wish it had continued. I don't know if the author wrote this book for me or for my husband, but I'm glad he enjoyed it. :) I hope it continues to be on my shelf!Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ It's been awhile since I read this and I can't remember a thing I didn't like. It's a book with great characters, but I thought there was way too much writing. This book is like reading a story with a lot of pictures instead of a story. I couldn't tell what was happening and I didn'st know what was going on. The narrator would just repeat what was in the story in a very annoying way. There were a lot more spelling errors in this book than in the other books. But still, it was a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------I am still angry about this book. It was one of those books you read and just knew you hated it. But I can't say I enjoyed it, or that I have much sympathy for the author. This book does not seem to be about the children in this book at all, and it is very much a tale about the characters, and the events. And they are, in my opinion, rather ridiculous. The child, at the beginning of the book, claims to be a wizard, and this is where she is, in her home. She is also a princess (in this book). Then it is told how her parents killed each other in a car crash (and how they are now in prison, and a new child needs their help). Her friend, the dragon, is also from another kingdom and tells of his father's death. His father was the mayor, and then he was killed by the king, who wanted to have his son be the next king. The dragon is supposed to be evil, so that's where the sympathy for him goes, and I could see the motivation, but it does not fit the story at all. This is the first in a series, and there is no way of knowing what will happen, so there is not any point to it all.The children go through a lot of trouble trying to get back to the "normal" world, which is the castle. They get chased by a gang, and end up in a prison, where they are tortured for their magic powers. The other children do not believe them, and they are still not sure about the wizard. They do have one friend who is in the other castle, which may be connected to the first child's magic, and she helps them escape.There are a lot more things I could say about this. I am sure this author is capable of doing more, because it is only three short books. However, the first two were very bad, and so I gave up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Posted by Michael P. - January 4, 2006 A book that could not be published by any academic press that is so far away from the truth. The book is a polemic, not history. Its goal is to demonize the U.S. government and its intelligence agencies and the politicians who support them. It has nothing to do with truth. Its sole purpose is to vilify the American military and its government. It is not history but a polemics.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not usually a book buyer and this was my first time. I found it interesting but I have no interest in reading it because it was boring and too slow.   A friend told me she liked it because she saw some of the names I had written on my passport while we were at the airport. I don't think I would have minded if that was the reason I bought the book.   (hide spoiler)   The characters were just so poorly written. It took me a long time to care about them. I can't even remember a single one of their names. They're all just sort of "hmm"s and "hm"s. They are all too busy, just so busy running around doing their business. All the time. When there's a real plot they do, it's the same as if you were watching TV instead of reading.   is a story about the family that runs the hotel (I guess you could say it's not the hotel but it is the family). The family is very conservative. All of the families are conservative. It's sort of a family in name only.  , if you want something that's "real" about a typical family, this book is not for you.If you've never heard of this author, you might like this book because it's about a family with no children.The book is supposed to be about their family's secret. The secret of the family is the fact that the wife is actually an alien, a lizard. It was this lizard that had a baby. And because of the "alien" they thought that their family was cursed. They thought that anyone that they wanted would die at their hands, no exceptions. So they did everything they could to make their family look good by giving them a good name, by not being so weird and crazy. The family lives in a small house. I'm assuming it's pretty small but I was in awe of it. They had a little garage in the back. I suppose this was probably for storage but it was small and cozy. They even had a dog. They were very good people.The "family" is very rich. The father is in the pharmaceutical business and has an office down the street. The mother is a nurse and has to take care of a lot of the kids' needs. They also own the hotel so they have a lot to get on their own. Their lives seem pretty normal, not very different than
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was looking forward to this book. I had heard about the book, read about it, and was very interested. Then I read the book. The story was not well written. It was boring, and I wanted to read more of the book so I could learn more about this story line and the characters. This book is really just a waste of time. I have read all the books in the series so I was already aware of the events that took place and I was hoping that they would provide some additional information in this book to give me some more insight as to the story. Instead, it was just boring. It is a waste to read this book, and just a bad read. It's very disappointing to waste your time with this book when you can have so much more to learn.

The others were just background or background characters.    4.6 /5  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- --------------------------- -------------------------- This book does not belong on my shelf. The writing style, as you mentioned, is just awful. The narrator does a poor job of capturing the moods and feelings of her characters. I found myself not caring much about any of the characters except a few of the side characters. There are no real dramatic moments in this book, there is no suspense or plot, it is very simplistic. This book also made me feel sad and empty inside. ------------------------  10 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  A great read, but a terrible cover art.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  As I stated in the previous review:    In the beginning of the book we are introduced to the young couple K.A. and M.I.   He is in love with her and the way she treats him.  The first part of the novel has the couple having a falling out.  And in the beginning the couple is in a relationship that works for the time.  He has a job and she has a car.  Eventually after a long distance they find the key for their relationship.  Then in the third part of their relationship they are finally getting what they want.  This is where things go downhill.  Their relationship gets more and more serious and their goals diverge.    I have only read part of this novel so I am unable to comment on the rest of the story.  I did enjoy the first half of this book, but then at the end I feel like I was being manipulated by the author.  For instance in the first chapter we see the couple sitting on their couch while K.As car is out on the road and they are having sex.  K.I then says " I am going to make her come".  KI says this a lot in the book but at the same time in the last chapter K.B. says "it is all good in the end."   At the end K.K. also says:  "I will be the only one she will ever love."    But I think this is all an excuse to make us care more about this couple.  Yes, they are in love but when does that mean they will be together forever?   KA is constantly trying to make K.F. stop sleeping with M.R. and at one point K.V. asks the author if she and K.R have ever slept together.  Then K. V. says she will never let K. F. sleep with M (if she even gets that far) because K. I said I would make her.     I will be there for you always!   It's like she is so used to this guy she can't imagine anyone else.   Also K. B says to K. R:  "I think you need to stop seeing her all the time."   So I guess he is saying she can go out with someone else if she wants.  There are a few other things I found annoying in the

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* The Book of Dereth is a great example of how to have a very bad book that is a really bad book. First, it was published in 1974. I'm pretty sure it was written before there were such things as computers, so its language was just about the same as it is now. And yet, it still manages to be completely incoherent and hard to understand. There is little plot. It's just an enormous amount of pages of boring story about the Deretha. The story is not bad, but you have to read through a lot of it to see that. And at least half the book is just the story about how the Doreths fight their wars, so you don't really get the reason the Dora are fighting and what they want. If you are not in the mood for a hard, long, boring, uninteresting war, this is not the book for you. And the worldbuilding is just bad. The book makes no attempt to explain any of the basic world elements. It has no place for climate, food, animals, plants, or people. The whole thing is just a huge, unreadable pile of worldbuilding. The last section is just some kind of summary of the whole world with little description of how anything worked. It tries to be pretty, but it's so bad that I don't understand why anyone ever thought it was worth reading. Even the ending was a big waste of time. I have no idea how Doretha's story ended. She had nothing to do with any of it. She was just a person living in the Dera with her husband, a great warlord. The Doreth did not want her dead. The Warlord went to the Warlord's daughter, and had sex with her and left. Doreatha was supposed to have stayed alive and become the leader of the Dorothi, but her daughter didn't agree, so the Doran exiled her. She stayed alive, and after that the Warlords were pretty sure she was the next ruler of Dora. It is a good book, but I will give it 2 stars, because I really had a hard time getting into it. It could have been better if it had been a war story instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  You can't trust a book on your iPad. It does everything wrong, and in a bad way. I am not sure whether it was the book I read, but I don't know how I can read a book I have already wasted so much time on. The only good thing is I am going to reread this. There are so many things wrong with the book, and I hope someone who hasn't read it will make this clear. I read about a girl who lives in the jungle in a village. She is a little girl but very brave and is ready to do anything to make a difference in the world. She gets into trouble with the boys she likes, and she gets into lots of trouble in the end. The ending is a horrible way to finish, and it is really sad to read it. The writing is very bad, and the stories are a mess. The plot is so stupid, the action is so bad, the characters are so pathetic that I didn't even care what happened to them. I would have to read the book twice, because each time I felt the same bad aftertaste. The girls are so stupid and stupid. This is an obvious waste of my time. I wish I had read more good books before I wasted my time on this one. I will have to spend the rest of my life and time on my iPad, so I guess I have wasted more than 100 hours of reading time.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ "It is an unfortunate fact that some of the world's most celebrated books have been published without the consent of the authors, the copyright holders. In the case of this book, the authors were not contacted, nor were they given an opportunity to participate in its production. Their names have been omitted from the copyright notice. They are also not represented by the publisher, and the book, though an anthology of poems, bears their signatures only as 'compiled for the benefit of the American Poets and Authors' as well as the copyright owner, Mr. John Donne. The book is not the work of a collection of poems. It is an unauthorized work of fiction, with its own plot, characters, settings and style. The author's name does not appear anywhere in the text, although it may appear in the index and in the front matter. I regret that I have not been able to get my name removed from the book because I had wanted to see the story of a poet who had lost his wife, children, land, house, and home. It was my wish that the book should be in the public domain so that poets and others could use it in their work without asking for permission from the poet. Unfortunately, the law does not permit such free use. I also regret that this book was not published during the time when I was working on my master's degree. The law at the time prevented me from publishing a book that was based on an earlier work, which I have never been able do. The publisher has told me that the author is now dead, but he is not dead, and I am certain that his name will be included in the copyright notices in the book and in subsequent editions. In addition, the publisher is offering the book for sale in the United States, Canada, Japan and Europe, but not in Russia. I have written to the editor of the publisher in an attempt to make him aware of my desire for a free translation of this volume. It would appear to me that he is very eager to sell this book without my approval and without the knowledge that I am the translator. The most obvious way of addressing this is by suing the publisher under the Copyright Act of 1976 for unauthorized distribution of my work. I do not intend to pursue such a course of action, as I regard it as a waste of time and effort. I am convinced that the situation is so serious that if the American poets and authors who have used the book are permitted to
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first book of this series was a great success. The second book was almost a sequel to the first. The third book (I thought) was a step backwards. The fourth book (not my cup of tea) was simply boring. This final book, however, was a complete disappointment.   The plot is fairly simple - we have a series of books where the world is dying, and the hero is trying to stop it. The first book (which I read and reviewed above) does this very well. This is a good read if you like sci-fi and/or fantasy with magic. I think this series is best read before the end of the Harry Potter series. The characters are rather flat and there is a large cast of magical beings. But for the most part the book is a well-written sci-fantasy adventure. The pacing is good - the book jumps between a time when the main characters are learning the history of the world and a time that the main cast of characters are trying to find a way to save the world from the end. And in the middle of that book there is another large cast.   the plot was solid - there was magic and there were a lot of different magical creatures and magic powers. There was a lot going on - and for the time the book was written, it was very well-paced and it was a very well written story.   is the magic of the series very easy to follow?  There were many times when I thought the author was giving too much away. In addition, there were many places that seemed to be explained too early. This was one of the books that really bothered me. I was disappointed because there were good parts in the book. I thought that a lot more time could have been spent on the history and on the relationships between the characters, for example. But in general, the magic is easy to understand, so I'll give the author his due for making it clear that the magic in the series is not a game and is a part of the fabric of the universe. I would have liked to see more information on the magic and how it works in the world.  . There are too many scenes where the main character spends a lot time with one of their magical creatures. It seemed that the author just didn't want to give away the fact that they were using these creatures. Even in the second book, where the creatures are mentioned in passing, it is mentioned that they only have
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book at all. I don't like books where a woman can never leave her man, and this is no different. This book is about the woman's feelings of being a burden to her husband, and how she can't deal with her feelings that she loves her husband but still has feelings of her own. I have no issues with women and men having feelings of love and lust, but if you do not like it, leave. I did enjoy this novel, and will be reading the next. (Posted on 8/16/2012)

I am a beginner and i got this book with some help from a friend for my birthday. I like to know what a good card is because i like to draw my own cards but i'm not good at it and i'm hoping this book will help me out. i know the cards look different but it's all in there! i'm in my first week of the league and i've got alot of games to play and i still haven't been able to pick a good one. i will say this book has helped me a lot. i read the chapter on the best play to play in the current game and i actually got alot better. I also know what cards you can play the best because i read that section in the book. My biggest problem with the book is it's only 5 stars because there are a few bad parts. The book says there are many cards but it doesn't give you any specifics of the cards. This is an important section to learn how to read cards. My second big problem is it says that you have to put in 10k and have a deck with 50 cards but that's not true. If you do this with any cards that cost over 1k then they are not considered a card. Also when the author said the players have to go to the stadium on the day of the game you have the option to make a team without the players you are sending to the tournament. This would mean that if the book says you have 15 players on your team you don't have to send them. this may be the only time i disagree with the author. I hope this book helps you guys out as well :)  I have been playing for 9 years and read a ton of books to improve myself and have this book as my newest. I've been trying to learn my way around a few different types of cards but I was always very frustrated with the cards I was presented with. I have since learned how to identify cards that are worth more than their printed price, how to recognize a card's worth, and the cards you have access
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ ______________ ___________ I felt that this book was a waste of time, and the author had done little research about what really happened to the Jews in Europe during World War II. I was looking for an easy and entertaining read, and that was not the case here. I don't know how this author came up with this story, but I'm not sure how many Jews were killed during World war II, especially when the Nazis were only trying to exterminate the Jews. I think the author just picked a couple of books from a book stack to use as sources, and they just happened to fit. _____________ _______________ ________ ________ I found this book to be very interesting, but the author seemed to be too lazy to make sure the books he chose were actually written by Holocaust survivors or have anything to do with the Holocaust. The fact that the book's main purpose is to help the reader understand the Jewish plight in the European war should be considered a huge failure of this book, because there really is nothing that the reader can relate to. The author tries to explain why Jews did not leave Germany during the war, but really doesn't give any reasons. I find it hard to believe that the Nazis would not have given Jews money to leave Germany, but that didn't stop them from killing them. The Holocaust is a very sensitive topic, but in this book the author doesn't seem to understand that at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a terrible book for a young kid. The protagonist is sooooooo obnoxious. He's an obnoxious teenager who just wants to get attention. He constantly talks like he's an expert in some field, but he's actually just an idiot and the other characters are all in on the joke and think he's a complete dumbass. The only problem is that the book is just a bunch of poorly written dialogue. The main problem is just that the characters are very poorly written and the book reads like a poorly written story where the characters just stand around talking instead of doing anything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book at a Goodwill book store, I know it was on the "old books" shelf but I found a copy on the shelf, it has never been read, the cover is all creased, with the title scrawled over it I figured I might as well grab it.   What I found was a poor copy of this book, the pages have a lot of holes that I could barely see in my small space, but I know there must be some kind of glue on the pages that makes them stick together. The back of the book has a lot less damage and is slightly better than the front, but it's still a poor, rough copy.  My father loved it, but as my mother died before he had the chance to read it to me, I have no idea if he would be able to find anything from the book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the worst thing ever! I didn't finish it until I was a week past the "sell by" date, and I wasn't sure if I had read it all by then. I did read it and felt very sick about it. The first chapter is about what the "good guys" (the American soldiers) did to "the bad guys" ("the enemy") in WW II, and is basically just a bunch of lies and propaganda about how great and heroic the Americans were. I think the author's intention here is to make it sound like the Germans were just as bad, but they weren't. The Germans were fighting the Nazis for decades, and were trying to kill them just as hard as the US soldiers were. And that makes the author feel really bad about the things they did to the Germans. But if you're a war reader and you don't believe this, just think about the difference in power. When it comes to "victory", who has the bigger army? The Russians? Or the Americans? It doesn't matter. It's a lie. The other thing about this book is how it talks about German soldiers as if they were stupid and not as intelligent as they actually were. As if, for instance, the German soldiers were just idiots, like the rest of the soldiers were at the time. Or something. I mean, how dumb could they have been? They just didn't understand what was going on, and that's why the Nazis were so easy to beat. The author talks about how the Germans and the Americans weren't "like" each other, but I think he's only saying this because he's trying to make himself feel better.   The whole thing about the Americans in WW I is just ridiculous, and there's almost no history of the war. It goes on forever, and nobody even mentions the American troops in Germany and Belgium until very late in the war, because they were so useless and understrength that they didn't do anything.   to be fair, though, the whole book was too much fun for me to stop reading and I think I'll finish it anyway. It was good fun. It reminded me of the movie version of The Deer Hunter. And, of course, the Germans are all idiots. And the whole thing with the fake radio is so funny. And all the references are funny, even the Germans' uniforms. I laughed really hard at how the American soldiers talk about "the evil

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried to read this but it was so dull and uninteresting. It was so bad I didn't want to finish it. It's about a boy who dreams about being a hero and trying to be famous like his hero and it was all so predictable that it was impossible to enjoy. It would have been better with some good action, but I think I have enough hero material of my own that I'm happy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I will say this book did not make me want to read more, it made me sad.  There is so much bad science in this book.  This book was a waste of my time.    I was trying to understand the idea of a self-regulating mechanism.  The problem is this book has almost no science.  I can see why people think that this is the answer for life.  It was hard to understand how self-control could happen after death.     
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading this book. I read it the day I came home from a week of holiday, and I couldn't put it down. The characters are not the best in a fantasy novel, but they have a really likable charm about them. A lot of the time, the characters don't act like they have any reason to be doing what they're doing, they act very irrational, even for a fantasy world. However, this is a fantasy, so they're supposed to be. The character development is well done, the plots are fun, and they can feel like they go on forever. The only downside to this book is that I found it very hard to put down. It was hard for me to get the urge to stop reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a 7/10, because it was pretty bad. It's not a bad writing book, but it is not worth the time it takes to read it. The story was terrible and the characters were bad and it had no redeeming feature to recommend it. I was expecting a good book, not a terrible book.  The only thing that keeps this book from getting a lower rating is the cover. It was interesting. I read a book of the same name and I didn't like the cover as much.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    My friends used to always call this book "The Book About Everything."   It is the perfect combination of all the "everything" books.   One minute, the book is all about "Everything," and then the book gets out of hand.  They start off at the beginning of the world and then get too involved in the details. They mention the sun, stars, planets, starships, space ships, and the people that live in them.  I don't have the time or interest to study space, and I don,t have much of an interest in reading too much about spaceships or planets.  It was just confusing to me.  If I was reading this book with my daughter, I would have told her that she could skip some parts.  There are plenty of other things to read about.  A few other reviewers have complained about the author's poor grammar and usage.  Some have complained that the writing is too literary.  This book was written in 1969, and it doesn't really read like an author writing in the present day.  Another reviewer has called the book "too clever."  If you're thinking of reading this, think twice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This is a book that is almost as bad as the book that gave rise to the concept. I have read many stories that have included the words "man-woman", "husband", "wife", "foster parent", and "custodial father", but I have never heard the word "mother". It seemed that the author had never heard of the words mother and father. He had a father that he claimed to know, and a mother that he would like to know. He used the word mother a few times but it was always used as a positive or negative modifier. When he uses the word mom as a negative modifier it is not the same word he used for a father. What a strange thing to do. When I wrote this book, I found it almost impossible to use the word father when using the words man and woman, even though it was my intent to use mother when referring to a man. When the author tries to use "mother" to refer to a woman, he is either using the wrong word, or he is not sure which word to use. This was a bad decision, for in writing a book such as this you have to remember to use your own words when you write a book. If the author has trouble using father he may want to consider giving up this writing career, because the problem is that the word man is an essential part of our vocabulary. It is the word we use when discussing anything that comes within the realm of human life. If you take the word parent and try to use it to describe a man, it is as if you were trying to say that you were looking forward to your father's next visit from the dentist. It might as well be called the "dad visit" book. Why should a child be a mother if the child doesn't even know who their parents are? It is a hard concept to wrap your head around and to find the right words to describe things. As I said earlier, when I wrote it, I kept trying to use father because I was not sure how I would refer to the mother. If I were to use her name to describe the mother, it would seem as if I was trying to get the child to use his father for a mother. This is just not how I think of the mother and man. After a time, I came to a place where the words I needed to use were the ones that were in my dictionary. As the author is aware, the
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't want to read any more "Gods of The Past" by John Green.  Gods Of The Past is a book about time travel by one author.   There is not one sentence that is interesting or original and not one that is worth the read.  They try to say everything they want to say but in their attempt to write about time-travel they really fail to do so.  There are so many holes in their book they could not fill them all.  I can't really explain why their time-time travel is bad but I guess it is their version of time-travelling where they create a time-line by changing people's lives.  It is not their fault that it is so obvious that what they write is fiction but I found it so ridiculous I was disgusted by it.  So in closing I am not giving this book three stars because it is not worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  -1 Star I'll make this quick and simple: I didn't enjoy this book. In fact, I found it extremely tedious, and the characters very shallow. The story follows two friends, one a writer (or rather, a poet) and the other a bookworm (or at least a writer in the sense that she's interested in the writing that she is writing), through the day to day experience of working in an office and living together. It's a pretty standard story, but I was disappointed. The book is about two friends who meet and fall in love with one another, only to have an unforeseen accident put the two of them into a terrible predicament. I find it kind of boring that this would have even happened in a world without magic. There were so many ways this could have been resolved in a better way, but, as it stands, they are forced to find the most convenient solution to get out of the situation. It makes me wonder why the author chose to write it as a romance. I'm sure it could have easily turned into something different, but it was so much more interesting as something that would have made sense in a completely different setting. Another thing that bothered me about the story was the fact that the author never once actually explains how magic works. When I first read that there was a magic to writing, it really piqued my interest, and I wanted to know more. It seemed to me that the fact this would never be explained would have kept the story from ever actually being fun, and that I would have hated the book even more if I'd been asked to sit down and figure it out. However, I'm going to give this book a 1 star because I know that it has a lot of potential. For example, the character of Missy is really interesting and is really cool and I just wish the story had given her a more focused role in the plot. The fact that this book had such an amazing setup and the fact it did an okay job of explaining how magic was accomplished were the reasons I gave it a 1.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books you read and you feel bad because it is just a story about some guys being jerks but then you get past it and it just kinda doesn't seem that bad.   There are lots of books about this sort of thing and it sounds like one that is written by a person who is just really bad at writing.   What a disappointment.  I wish I hadn't read this book   I read this in a couple days and then gave up on it.  There's no plot and it feels like a story that was cut together from a bunch of different ideas and some of the details were just flat out wrong. I really wish I could say this book was amazing, but it just wasn't. It really didn't live up to my expectations and the ending just ended up disappointing me. I didn't think I would read another bad book like this and I think that is a sign of a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________  My first book, and it was a great book! It was well written and I liked all the characters well enough.   However, the story wasn't all that I expected. There are some problems with the writing as well, and I didn't like how the characters were written, and not just the main character.    I would have given this book 5 stars, but I would have liked to see a few changes to the plot. If I could change anything about it I would change the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  When I bought this book I was eager to read it. I'm glad I didn't. This is an interesting read about an alien planet that has a lot of water and a small amount of land area.  The aliens live in the water and have no problems with the land but humans can't get there, and they don't know why. There is a guy who is a scientist and he has found a formula that lets them travel to the land without being affected by the water.  This book has no depth. The characters are all the same.  They don't have any depth at all.  This story is just another "who is crazy/what happened" type of book.  There are no interesting or interesting to know characters in this book.  Why did I give it 4 stars?  I wanted to like it.  It was interesting.  I liked how the aliens talked about their way of life.   They were in trouble with humans, and needed to find out how the humans think before the humans kill them.  But the story wasn't interesting. It was just another science fiction story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________________________ A young man who is about to take a leap of faith comes to a place of immense peril, only to find out the dangers can be even greater than he imagined. The book was poorly written, and I think it's a little too preachy for my taste. The story was compelling and the characters were well drawn, but they seemed to come off as a little unrealistic. The plot was so contrived, and the character development, I found, was lacking. ____________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________ (I gave it a 3 because it is an unfinished book and I wish the author would finish it. The ending seemed so rushed that I just felt cheated.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "It is not about a girl being kidnapped; it is about a young girl who must take care of her mentally ill aunt while she tries to get over her own traumas. But the plot never gets any deeper." -T.B. The plot of the book was interesting, but the author seems to be struggling to come to grips with the themes she is trying to deal with.  It was just a very, very cliche ending.   If a movie or TV series is going to be based off a novel, it must be adapted to the needs and demands of that audience.  That is why it is better to just read a great book instead of watching another show. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is garbage. This book has nothing to do with anything I've ever learned in school and has nothing useful to say about anything I know. What you get is a bunch of old books about witchcraft and the occult that are all so outdated. It is almost as if the authors have never read a book in the last twenty years. The only reason this book is so old is because it is the first book in a series. This series had a lot of good books. The first book was titled: "Witchcraft". The next book was called "The Devil's Potion". The author had written four books about how witches make potions. But the first three are just reprints of old witches recipes and the last one is a new witch recipe. All of the books are filled with "goddammit what is witchcraft" passages that have no meaning other than for the reader to be terrified. The next two books are just the authors name changing the name and appearance of the old witch recipes. It doesn't help either that the book only has two chapters. The title of the book says it all, "What I Know About Witchcraft" and then says nothing else. There is so much information that isn't worth it and it was all there in the first two books but it doesn't make the author look good. I've taken the time to get a degree in English and a degree for my degree and I've never had to ask a professor anything to fill out an essay. I have never asked a professor for the definition of a word and never has someone been able to tell me if the word was made up or if it was a real word. I got to an answer to a question on a math question and I have not been able explain a word to the professor. I get it that there are a lot more professors than there are students but they still have to ask students questions. A professor would never make fun of a student for asking questions. It just doesn't work like that. If you're going to take the time and effort to look up a definition of something I might as well read it. It's a good book if you're interested in witches and witches' potions but not if you want to know if witches really exist.   3 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************************** **************************** I really really wanted to like this book, I really did, it was my #1 choice on Amazon and everywhere else.  The writing is excellent, the characters are engaging and likable, but as I read it, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.  It's a pretty straightforward story of a guy who has a girlfriend who has an abusive past, a love interest who has his own issues, and the main character and her friends are thrown together into an intense but predictable situation.   I didn't find that to be a bad thing.  Sure, there were some problems here and there, but those were so minor that they were barely noticeable.  And for a story that is so focused on this main character, there was an amazing amount of detail put into the history of how the world came to be, the history and development of the characters, the personal lives of these characters.  This is a very large novel, and it takes a lot of time to read, which was good, because it made me want to keep reading and not get bored.  The world is rich and full of interesting people and cultures, and all of it is presented very well.  A couple of times I was really really surprised by a character's reaction to something, or I would think something but I would find it very funny, or maybe it was a really deep issue and I just didn't catch it.  However, the fact that this book is so small, and so focused with one main character only, the lack of depth in the characters I found frustrating, and I wanted more of it.    In summary: ************* ************  I really enjoyed this book a lot, it has a lot going on, it takes place over a number of years and deals with some very interesting issues, but I just wasn't able to find all of the nuances in the story that I was looking for.  I was kind of bored when I was reading it, but it's pretty entertaining and fun.  Also, the ending was pretty predictable and boring, so yeah, there is that.  Overall rating:  4 Stars
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________   So I decided to see if I could get a copy of my old book and make sure it was okay. I bought it off the library book sale list for $2 and I think it's okay. It is a very good book. It's not an easy read, it doesn't have the best writing, but it doesn�t need to be. I am glad I didn�t wait to get it for $12, because I would have lost the fun of the whole experience. I liked it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book about 6 years ago but I don't know if it's really worth it. I have seen more reviews on this author and I can't see that she is any good. She doesn't have a clue what to write on a review. I don t understand why so many people read her work because she doesn't know what she is doing. She has a good mind but not much practice. The characters are not well developed. I would call them stupid but I didn t read enough to get the idea of it. The first girl in the book is the leader, her only goal is to be the best. She is smart and beautiful and can fight anyone in the universe. She just has no taste in the kind of food she likes. The only good part is her hair because I could see it as a girl power fantasy. It's a cute hair because she wants to have it because she is really good and can be the only one to win at something. She wants to be that girl. But the book would be better with a good character. There is no plot and it's all just the girl fighting everyone. So what do you think about the book? What did I think about it?  I think that the world building is terrible and it really doesn't give the impression that you are in a place where people live in different ways and are very different. I just don't see how it could be a place of peace. What do you say to people who say this book is too long?   The book is actually less than 100 pages and there is a lot of stuff to get through. I think the last 4-5 pages were just a waste of space. I will say that I didn't read the beginning because I was too busy writing a review on the second book and I was only reading on my second day. I want to thank you for the awesome book! What is your favorite book? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  When I was a junior at high school, this book had been placed on our library's reading list.  A lot of people in the class were very enthusiastic about it, as it had a very unique and captivating story about a girl with a demon child.   This was my first introduction to the occult.  The girl's mom had discovered that her daughter was being abused by the Satanist who had kidnapped and molested her when she was a baby.  This book also contains the history of witches and Satanism in America and is well researched. The story follows the girl as she goes through a lot of the typical teenage problems you would expect to go through.  It is interesting to note that when she reaches the end of the book, the "good" demon is turned into a "bad" demon.  That is to say, the good demon turns bad because of the evil person he has bonded with.  However, the girl goes through so much in this book that is more than enough to make you wonder what happened to her and if she survived.   The characters in this story are very complex.  There is the typical teen love triangle, a teenage girl who wants to date a young man and a teen boy who wants the teenage girl for himself.  In addition, there is a "good demon" who is a great teacher and tries to make sure the girls don't fall into bad habits.  All of these characters and situations are interesting and compelling.  While it is possible that there is much more going on in this world than is being revealed in this novel, I feel that it is a good book that contains the right amount of mystery, suspense, and mystery for my teenage mind.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you were only reading one book this year, this one is for you, it's my favorite, and it's by a famous author. It has the best cover art, the best description, the most memorable plot lines, the interesting world building, the amazing characters, the entertaining and clever writing, the perfect blend of action, humor, intrigue, romance, horror, magic and philosophy, and a fun adventure with some twists that will have you laughing your ass off. The story is extremely well done, and the characters are all very well developed and believable. It is not a complicated story at all, it is very well explained, with a very clear goal that is easy to follow. And the ending is just perfect. So I highly recommend this book, it can be enjoyed by everyone and everyone should read it!
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- The first half of the book, this seems to be the bulk of the writing; the "meat" of the story. However, that last half was a chore to get through and left me with many unanswered questions. There were some interesting concepts but it just didn't make sense to me. My understanding of the world was just not there. I will admit there were some references but for me it didn't seem like it went anywhere in the book. I don't blame the author for being short, but I do question why he didn't include more references. I know it is a fantasy world but to me the references were missing. Also, for all the love the author gives the world, the way he describes it is not realistic. He gives names, place, descriptions that have nothing to do with reality. It seems like an attempt at an attempt to make the world seem more realistic. The author could have made it work a lot better by writing more realistic descriptions. I also had a lot of trouble getting the time of day and location of things. I could guess a lot but I was just guessing what a character did in a given location and was not sure if I was on the right date or on the wrong date. This is also an example of why I don´t trust an author who tries to give the "feeling" of a specific place. I felt like I was standing there in the place, not being able to tell what time of the day it was. The book is very entertaining but there was way to much "stuff" thrown in the middle. I think there is a book about the first war between the Elves and Dwarves which should have been the focus. This was very disappointing. If he had left it out of the first part, this would have been a 4 star for me but he made me wish he would have given it more time. This book was fun to read but I think I would not recommend it. I would recommend if you are looking for something that is "different" but not too "strange".
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not a great book to read. My brother-in-law and I listened to it on the car ride home. He doesn't even like horror, but he bought this book because of the cover. He was hoping to read about a family and not a ghost or demon or some other horror-like entity. When the characters left the house, I was so frustrated and annoyed with the narrator. I don't know if he was just having an off night but I don?t know what he said. He talked in the middle of sentences, used the wrong words, etc. Overall, I did not enjoy this book as much as the cover promised.  Did you have any issues with the book? Was this a typical YA book or was it disappointing?

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book did not change for the better, and I have to say it is a real disappointment as it tries to show the problems with the "caveman" theory, but it was very unhelpful, so I just went ahead and gave up on it.   I was looking forward to this, as I love the concept of the cavemen as people who did not become civilized until later and how that was the reason why they have the primitive ideas that we have. The whole book was very boring and I felt like I was being given information that was just false or just not interesting. I don't know if I will keep trying to read more about this and if I ever will, I will probably read a book on the caveman and prehistoric man before I start this one.  , December 29, 2008
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------The characters and world building were great. I love the setting and the plot was enjoyable. What I didn't like were some of the characters. The main character wasn't particularly likable. It seems she was put in this situation because of her ability. As an experienced player this bothered me because she has been in this position before (or that she did in the past, but was in another game world) and there is no reason for her to feel this way. In my opinion she should have done something more with her experience to make her more likable, and not put her in that position. The other characters seemed to be a bit bland and didn't seem very interesting to me. As a whole, the book was pretty good though.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I got this book for my son's 5th birthday. I got it for him to read about an imaginary creature from another dimension named The Gremlin, and its only function was to attack people with its tentacles. This book was supposed to teach him about monsters like The Gremlins and all the things that live in their world. I could tell he was not going to enjoy it at all. He hated the book and said he had no desire to learn about that world. But he still read it because it was a birthday present. --------------- There was no plot to this book at all, it just sprawls out into the Gremlin universe, and the only "event" that takes place in the book was one of the Gremlin attacks. This story has no sense of urgency, just a slow build up of what is going to happen. ------------- I wish I could give this book two stars, but I can only give it one. --------------
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing style was atrocious, the prose was awful. I wanted to leave it right away. This book is about a couple of young kids that fall in love. I could not relate to any of the characters in this book and thought they were awful. If you like Disney books like I did or any of Disney's films then you will probably like this book. But if you like a lot of Disney books and don't care for any of their characters then this book is probably a waste of your time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  - The story is dull, boring, uneventful, it doesn't even make sense... but the author says it's a story, right?  I guess so.  Not sure how he managed to write a dull story, but the writing style is kind of clunky.   The author is very much an inexperienced writer, but his writing style has some potential.  If only he didn't have so many characters who are just a bit too perfect and a bit annoying.  Not sure if I would recommend this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________   After reading this book for the first time, I thought the description was accurate but the story just did not appeal to me.  I really don't think there is a reason why a woman would want to become a widow. I am just not attracted to the idea that women are more loyal to their husbands then men are to their wives. I think women are just more intelligent than men. I don't see that in the world of the book. I also don't understand the motivations for marriage.  the book also seems to imply that being a widow would not be all bad. There are even more opportunities for her to travel and get the education that a young wife needs and more money then a man. I was really hoping that the author would show that being widowed was not as bad as I thought it would be. This story seems to have been based off of something I saw on TV, The Biggest Loser and some of the other shows I watch. I never see a woman being happy in marriage, and I have married and divorced. It is not all bad as the author makes that very clear. But I still think the best way to show the world the true way it is would be to do a reality tv show.   I just can't recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My boyfriend bought this and I loved it! He had been wanting to try out a new type of cigar and this is the one he got. I tried it, but I could not smoke it because it had a weird smell that did not go away until I took it out of the humidor. It has a very earthy flavor and it is not too strong. I did not think this was going to be a good cigar but I am glad I tried. I will buy it again but it is more of a gift for my boyfriend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  You get what you pay for.  That's the message I have gotten from so many bad books I've read.  One of the main reasons for this is that they all tend to be very, very long.   I'm a horror fan, and I read a lot of horror books, so it really bothers me when a horror book isn't as good as it could have been.    I don't want to spend more than a few hours in a book before I hate it.  I don't feel like the horror is that good in most of these books.   Another reason it bothers me is that I read them so many times that I've forgotten what the story is about.  This often happens in long horror books.  In short, the author is a monster who wants to write a really long book, so they make a really bad one.  The plot is really awful, and all the characters in the book are completely unlikable.  Most of the characters are either awful, or just boring.  These characters do have their moments, but it never comes to fruition. The badness of the plot is also the reason I don 't want to read these books again.  A lot of the stories seem to be trying to create a world with a history that doesn't exist.  It's not very clear what the plot of the story really is, and it's very hard to figure out what the characters want in this book.  Sometimes, a character's actions seem completely random, which is almost impossible to explain, and there are no really cool or interesting characters.  One of the worst examples of this would be the author's obsession with talking about how he wanted to marry the main character.  You know, it's kind of odd, since there are so many people that the author could have chosen to write about. The characters in these books are so unlikably bad that the book ends up being a drag.  Even if the characters did have something going for them, it still felt like the author was trying to sell you on the idea that you should like them, but really didn't.  Many of these authors also have a tendency to write dialogue that is really bad, and most of the time you don't even want to hear it. There are several books in this genre where the author has to use really awful slang.  There are also so many plot holes that you almost
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  I would like to apologize for the terrible time and money I wasted. I am a new father, and read this on my son's behalf. I could tell it was written by a child, but my heart still says this is a very poor, unscholarly attempt at a child's book. The characters were very well drawn, but the story just didn't feel right to me.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* I read this book for a class on creative writing. The author is a gifted writer with a gift for writing and a gift with prose. The story was interesting and the prose was well done. But it was hard to stay with the story long enough to figure out what was going on. By the time I finally got there, I couldn't put it down. The main character was such a bad actor and a terrible person, I felt sorry for her and it was difficult to love her at the same time. I tried to get interested but the plot just didn't add up to me. ***********

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________  It was a really boring book. I think that the story is about 30% of what made it interesting, the rest was just an excuse to write the novel in the first place. There are no characters, no development, no twists. The setting is boring as well, it was very slow and unemotional.   I read a lot of fantasy novels that are set in fantasy worlds and I think it is really difficult to write a book that isn't a fantasy novel. It has to be different from fantasy novels or you will have to do research or spend too much time trying to figure out what's fantasy and what isn't fantasy and then trying to work out what you can be fictionalising from the real world. In the end, the book is pretty boring because it just has a very static and repetitive plot that's really unemotionally drawn.  ...   If you don't like your book boring, you may want to try a different book genre. You should really like the book genre if you are trying to write books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not enjoyable.   A lot of what I found frustrating was the author's apparent willingness to put words in my mouth without giving me a chance to make them up for me. I can't recall a time when I have done that. I read the book and went to my computer to add the information I got to the website. I would never go that far for any other book. If the author was so inclined, he could have done an entire book of research to give some context for why he had made statements that were false.   a story is a collection of facts and I can assure you that every single fact that the author claimed to have found was false. I do not care if the reader was just in the audience or not, every single thing he or she read was false and completely wrong. If we could prove that the man I was describing was actually in my life, that would be wonderful, but I don't have that information. We will never know that he ever existed.     To go into the details of why I found everything in this book wrong is too much of a review for this book. A reader would have to be familiar with the facts to be able to find them all. It is more of a challenge than a book to me to get the facts right and put them in the right order and at the right place. I am trying to write about the book because I did not find it as good as the author portrayed it. I felt I was listening to someone make it up as they went along. I didn't know what they knew.   of course, there are a few facts that did ring true.  , I thought he was referring to him being from the 1960s or the early 70s when he was a child. I don''t know. The author's book has an introduction by a young child who wrote a book based on his own experiences. I think if you have the right children you might want to check the books out. A good one from the 80s?  , I think it is hard to say who is an atheist. It depends on what your definition of atheism is.   for instance, I'm atheist because I do have a belief in the existence of a creator, but for me it doesn''t matter. I believe that everything happens in a matter of fact manner. I cannot explain how that could be if the Creator is also my mother. It doesn't matter because
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't think there is anything about the book that was bad, but I found this book difficult to follow. I was very unhappy to read about what she does in her own life in terms of relationships.   The other side of it is that the writer was in a relationship with a man who was a good husband, and he had a child out of wedlock. I found it extremely difficult to reconcile the two stories.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have ever read. I have been through several novels and this is the worst I have read. There are no suspense. It is just bad.   I have read over 10 books and this book is one of the worst. I had trouble finishing it. The plot was unbelievable. The main character is not that bright and does not have the character to do anything. She does what the main character wants and that was that. No surprise, she was the worst character ever in a book.   to me this is a "What if?" story. The guy who wrote it did not have much of a plot for the book. And this main character was just too damn stupid to do the "what if's". So that is why she had to be the main bad character. But I hate these books. It was not a good read. If I wanted a good story I would have stayed at my house and watched the TV. I am done with this author and her "what would I do" stories. She wrote a book so bad that I felt like I had just read one of those book that have so much words in them that you could not even read all of them. There were no suspense, no story, nothing. I would not recommend this to anyone because it is so bad and I would never read any of her stories again.   It was the "What If?" book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You need to be warned before you go, especially with this one.     When I got this book I had no expectations. I thought maybe it would be a bit of a light read. It's hard to imagine that in 2010 there could still be people who believe that men are just too weak to handle themselves. The fact that this book is being published by some major publishers indicates that it is an excellent book.  I will say that the writing style is quite clunky and the writing and writing style are intertwined. The characters are unsympathetic and you have to think that they are probably lying to the reader. There is a certain charm to these characters.  A few quotes I remember from this book: "This is why people don't read a novel anymore. It is no longer a novel in the sense that it requires that you understand the feelings of the characters. It has become a drama of people's lives, and the people who write these dramas aren't really writing them. They are just writing characters that are very sad. They make a living by making other people very sad, and they don't care that their customers don't understand what they are talking about."  One of the most memorable quotes from this work by one of the main characters is: "I'm a mother of three children and two granddaughters, who have suffered from severe chronic illness since I was their age. I've had to leave them in a hospital at least twice because I couldn't care for them any longer, and because my own health has not been stable. I just don't know what the hell else to do for them, since I'm afraid to die. I don't want my life to end like some woman, in her house, with her kids, when they are no longer useful to her. I want my children to be alive when they become old enough to fend for themselves. I'm so happy I can hardly put into words how sorry I am that I didn't get them better sooner, if only it had been my choice to do so, to bequeath them to the hospital as their mother rather than to be the woman who put them up for adoption in the first place. And it hurts so much to be treated as a bad parent, as some kind of evil, in a place where it's not their fault that they're sick, in their last days of life. But all of this makes me realize that my
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book just didn't work for me.   My first attempt at reading it, I bought it as a paperback on Goodreads and read it, but it just didn´t sit right with me.  It was hard to follow the plot and the pacing and it just felt like it wasn´t made to be the book that it was supposed to be, so it fell apart for me and I dropped it like a rock.   My second reading, I read it the same way, but I really didn´nt like it.  This is one of those books that has so many flaws, that you really cant tell which are the problem with it, so there is no real positive review to be had, other than to say that I would never recommend this book to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a poor copy of a good book. It is written with a poor sense of logic and understanding of the real world. Most of the concepts are poorly stated, and it makes no sense that the author would think that they are important. This book does nothing to help the reader with learning, so if your goal is to get better in a specific area, this is not the book for you. I could have done without the introduction. It just says "This book is written by a retired Special Forces Master Sergeant who is a former SEAL Team Six Commander, who specializes in combat intelligence." No real explanation of the purpose, history, or current events in the world. I didn't really understand a word. The author claims that his life is unique and he can't really relate, so he uses the book to "tell" his life story. No. I think that he would be better off writing a book based on his life, as well as his experiences in the SEAL Teams. He didn't describe anything that he couldn't have explained in 30-45 seconds in a classroom. No matter how you slice it, this book is not a good read for anyone that wants to improve their self-esteem, self-worth, or self-confidence. Read another book. I've read many books on self-improvement, and this book just doesn't work for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I think I must've bought this on the assumption that it was a "sick" book, because it was so over the top horrible that I was actually going to keep it for my sick-to-the-bone cat! It wasn't until later that I thought to google it and see the reviews, and it really didn't help that this book was written by an actual moron and is a collection of stories about animal abuse in animal shelters, including a story where the animals were so messed up they had to be put down because of how badly they were treated! Not even kidding, they were just so terribly abused. Now this book is written for the benefit of people who will buy it and buy it because it has some funny animal abuse stories, and you have to realize that this wasn't meant for that audience, since the content of the book is so bad that if you try to use it to entertain children you would end up hurting them even more! This book is bad enough that you shouldn't bother reading it! If you buy this book you should have the decency to throw it away as soon as you finish it! It is so poorly written and written by a moron, so that you cannot even take the story seriously and then you get an actual dog who gets in a terrible accident when she is being transported in the car. Just don't buy this crap book! I'll post a negative star for it just to put a stop to all the people who bought this book thinking they were helping cats by reading it and then buying it to get some humor out of it and the stupid stories and then later trying to claim that it is good for "dogs" and children and for animal lovers everywhere! It really is just horrible and you can easily tell that the authors did not do any research or any writing! This is the most disgusting, pathetic book I've ever seen, since it is written by someone who is not a writer and is just a jerk with a sense of humor, because this book would be great for a school fair or an animal hospital because it would be a good way to tell stories about abuse in the animal shelter, but you can never buy a book like this and you will be laughed at for buying it and you should probably try to never buy another book by this author ever again, because you will pay a heavy price for it and it's only going to get worse! I give this book a D.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't care for the story in this book as much as I should have.   It seems to be that it is always someone's word against another's. It seems like there is no objective proof that the girl was really raped and that the rape never happened. This is what you have to deal with in a rape case. It was also very confusing to me, it seems like she was raped because she didn't know who he was. The guy was so nice to her he was trying to woo her into having sex with him. He also had sex with her before, at a time when she was not aware that he was doing that and then told her it would be different after she fell in love with him (when she was in her mid-20s and really didn't think much about romance or the sex) so she thought he might just be trying to get a piece of her at the time, when in actuality he was a monster. She went to his apartment to check up on him after his rape. He is a very nice guy but the way he treated her after she got there made me sick to my stomach. She was in his apartment with another girl, they were both in their late 20's. The other girl had come over to his place to hang out with her friends. She and the guy had been talking, she told him she was sick and needed to go to bed and he did not ask her if she wanted anything. The woman said she went and asked him if he wanted her to stay, she asked to talk to him and he let her in, so she did. The man then asked her if he was ok and he told her yes, and the other girl told her that this was a bit of a shock. They continued talking and the girl started kissing him. She told the guy she wanted him to do something, to take off her shirt and then they both started touching and kissing each other. She then asked him to get on the bed and they did. She started riding him and when she started moving up and down on his cock she started feeling a bit strange. The girl told him "I don't think I'm ready for that yet" and he asked her how she felt. She said "Oh, I feel very horny, so I want to try something else." He was curious and told her to let him pull her jeans down and she did, she said it was a little difficult, but she did
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I received this book in a Kindle book exchange from a dear friend who is now on her second year of medical school. I was excited to read this book for a first book that I got in exchange for something that I really wanted. This is not my first medical book, but it is my first that actually was not that bad. It was pretty good, not bad at all, but the writing style was off in the parts that required more explanation. That being said, I did not understand how the test could be taken to a score of 90 (there are 5 possible scores), but the test is so easy that you just take it and move on. There was only 1 exam question on the test which was not too difficult, but I feel like the way I did it was so wrong that I was not able to take the correct answer in a timely manner. But it is a short book so if you can get through it without questions you will be just fine. I have to mention, there is a part in the book where they are discussing things to look for during the clinical course. This made me very uncomfortable, because I just want to learn something new, but there is no way to find out what this information is because it is given at the very end. I felt like I could have done better reading the book than this one because it would have given me the information I needed to know for the exam. There are 3 other books that can be bought to help you study for the clinical. I hope you will take a look at them as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book: **********This is an unfortunate book from the beginning. The characters have no depth, and they are very much lacking in chemistry. The story follows the adventures of three characters, and there are no long-term plots in this story. The main characters are the only real characters in this novel. You really get the sense that they are bored to death, and so you end up waiting for something to happen, but then it never does. The stories and events are so disconnected, it really feels like a collection of loose scraps of information put together by an editor. I could have gotten much better from this book, but it's just not worth it. There is no payoff at the end.I was so disappointed. I had been looking forward to reading this book all week. This was a book I had to rush through to get to my own work, because I was going to work on my dissertation the next day. That said, I would have still read it, but I think I would definitely have had better luck with a more solid novel. The book is written with a sort of amateurishness. Even when I finished this book I was thinking, "I don't know if I will finish that book and the one before that, or whether I will end up getting distracted with something else and never finish either." I was hoping that my work would get me motivated, and that it would give me some sort of "kick-start" into something exciting. And I think, unfortunately, I ended up getting very little of that. It is a shame, because it is a very well written book, and it is fun, and I am still enjoying the journey. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning about the history of the world, and in the development of society, but who feels that they just don't want to put in the effort required to really enjoy what they read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********The book is a mess. The plot is terrible, with a few interesting bits in between (the main character is so dumb that I almost laughed at it) The dialog is awful, and the characters are the worst. I would never recommend this book to someone, and I would make no money if someone wanted to buy this. The book was written by a person that has only ever written one book (a story about a girl and a dragon) and even then the writing and the dialog sucked. If someone were to buy it, it would be their last and they would feel like shit for a while.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It does not meet my expectations for a fantasy novel. I've read some fantasy novels but this was definitely not one of them. The book itself has some flaws but not as many as I expected. The characters were not developed properly, the main character seemed to be a bit selfish and the main bad guy was a villain that came out of nowhere. It would have been a better book if the main villain was not so evil and the characters were a bit more developed. I really enjoyed the action scenes. I can't wait for the sequel
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so bad and is so full of spelling and grammar errors it's hard to understand a word that is spoken. The story is about a girl who has a little boy that she loves and her boyfriend, and he's the one who takes her everywhere she needs to go. As I've said I really love the story, but the spelling in the book and the writing are so bad it's unbelievable. I can't even tell you what happened or what happened to this girl, but I can tell you it's a terrible story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This is a book about a man who becomes a hero of the public after he and his friends use a device called the computer to help out the elderly." I had to take out this review because it wasn't so great. There's nothing wrong with that. We all learn a lot from different sources, and that's how I feel about this book. The author's style is very unique. It is definitely unique. I found myself not enjoying his writing style and that is how I felt about the book as well. This book had no plot, which is fine. That's what makes it so good!

Write a negative review about a bad book:        I didn't like this book, and I'm not sure I will ever like it. I'm a bit disappointed by the book's content, since the plot was rather original. However, it did go downhill from there.   I was expecting more from a book that is supposed to be about one of the largest religions in the world, and it failed miserably.  One of the first things I noticed was that it made a lot of people very angry, not because of religion but because they felt that there was something wrong with the people who lived in this world.  This is where it starts to get worse.  It is quite obvious that the author was very aware of how much this book would offend people, and there was no care taken in how or why people would find his story offensive.  The story itself is pretty interesting and I like the main character a lot, but the book would be a lot more interesting if it weren't all so filled with religious symbolism.  A lot of this symbolism is completely unnecessary to the plot, which was pretty lame.  To me, this was one of those things where it seems like a good idea at the time, but it's way too much later on.    I didn't hate the characters either, though. I did, however, feel that I was reading a really badly written book.    I don't know what the right thing to do is with this book. If I did I would never read another religious book ever again, or at least if I did this would be the one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have ever read.   First, there are many mistakes in it. The story does not flow as well as I wanted. The characters don't seem to have any real lives or interests. There is no action, and the book is all about the characters and how they are interacting with each other.  . It is not even clear to the reader which character is which, even though most of them appear in the same scenes or chapters. I don't think it is a mistake, but just an omission. But this is where the story loses me. All the characters, except one, have no life or feelings. You could easily imagine the characters as a group of actors trying to act out a part of a play. Not much drama or life in that.   that is not all there is. The writing is very inconsistent. The grammar is not that good. It has several typos and bad sentences. Most of the book seems to be a series of flashbacks about the past of some of the characters. These flashbacks are very confusing and do not give much information about what is happening in the present.   a few of the sentences make no sense and seem to be from a different book.    . The ending was a bit unsatisfying. The author says that there is some connection with the characters' lives, but then when I read it, it was a coincidence. Not enough explanation of why and how.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a shame, because I really enjoyed this book.  It's the first book I've read from the publisher.  I was expecting it to be pretty bad, but it was actually very good.  The prose is a bit clunky at first, and there were some spelling errors in the text (though these were easy to spot.)  I like the fact that the author went into details about what makes up the characters.  That's not the type of books that I tend to read (I like a little more mystery in my fiction), but I am willing to listen to what the author has to say.  As a whole, it's a good read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:........................................... The Book: One of the most important works of our time, The Communist Manifesto has come to be known as "The most important work of the 20th century." The book was written in 1848 by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, two men who would come to play the leading roles in all the great social revolutions of the 19th century, and who would become the first and most powerful international leaders of communism. "The Communist Manifestos" is the story of those revolutions, and of the struggle between the two camps of the working class. Written in the very style of the early pamphlets of the radical socialist Owen's, it was first published in German in 1847. This was the first of the books of this type that would be published by Marx and Engels. They published another pamphlet in 1855 in which they described the history of socialism from the beginning to date and the "dictatorship of the proletariat." It was published in English by the English anarchist Michael Bakunin in 1872. The other major translation of this work in English was in 1931 by the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci. In both translations there is an extensive critical edition, which is still ongoing. This is, in my opinion, the most interesting book of any kind that has been published in the last few years. The authors have succeeded in giving a voice to those who for the last 150 years, have been ignored. For the first time a Marxist has attempted to describe the history and politics of the masses of the exploited working people, the "proletariat" or, as Engels would call it, the proletariat. We will see how he and Marx came to this great conclusion. They do not present an argument, which could be called a "social science", but a simple narrative, and this simple narrative is quite a different thing than the Marxist theory of class struggles. The book is divided into three parts. In the first part, which deals with the beginnings of the communist movement, we will learn about the history, the development and the nature of the " proletariat," in the French sense. In Part II, which includes the Paris Commune, the first Communist Manifestoes, the rise of "professional revolutionaries," and the birth of the Communist Party in Germany, we can see how Marx, Engels, and Lenin came to understand that the working masses, or the proletariat, were the source of the social revolution, as opposed to some elite, or class, which controlled the state.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  What is it about books about vampires that annoys me so much? I am no expert but I am still baffled by the whole concept. I was so excited for this book. After I read it I have no idea what to think. It is a book about vampires and the history behind them. So it is like all the vampire lore and folklore ever written was boiled down to a simple set of questions. "Who are the vampires?" "Why are they here?" "Who will be the next victims?" I'm sick of vampire books. I'm still going to try and get into this but it will be hard. I read two other vampire books that were better but they were about other types of stories. This one is so self-centered and so poorly written. It seems to have been thrown together without much thought. It's a great idea but it never really seems to get any action. There is some interesting things in it but they never really come to anything. It was so hard to get through this book that I didn't even finish it. - A Very Hungry Caterpillar by Dan Simmons
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you read this book before starting this, I would say you can't start with this book. The story begins with a woman named Sara and a man named Richard being chased by a demon. After they escape the demon, Richard is shot by a man wearing a cowboy hat.  After this, Richard tells Sara that he is dead and that Sara is now a "ghost" or a ghost-hunter.    The book itself is the first part of a series. It is supposed to be told from multiple perspectives, but not all of the characters are developed at the same time. .   Sara is an amazing protagonist. Her personality is so great and she develops so well. I could not put this book down even though the story was repetitive. This book was well written.   I have to say, that if you are going to read this, pick it up after The Last House on the Left.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You just got robbed, you piece of shit!   I bought the hard cover book to find a very detailed synopsis on the entire novel, and found that I didn't have to waste my money on a bad summary of the book. The book really isn't written that well, and is a very short book that is a little hard to read. However, it's the best thing I can find for my character from a fantasy series, I'm glad to have read it and I'm looking forward to the next book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  this was not one of my favorite books. It was a bit slow to start and I didn't enjoy it much, but after reading it again, I do see why people are fond of it. There are just some parts of it that are a bit too obvious. It has lots of good ideas but it just got out of hand and it felt like it was trying to say something, but it's just so self-serving and it just didn't hold my attention. That said, I'd still recommend it if you enjoy a bit of adventure and a bit more dark humor and a lot of people enjoy those things too, so if you like those things you might like it!
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I bought this book hoping to use it for a class project and I was absolutely let down by the quality. I read all the reviews prior to buying and there were some good ones. I wanted this book to be a good resource so I expected that it would be good. After reading all the good reviews I was expecting better. This book is nothing more than a bunch of facts, the biggest problem being that there was no real reasoning behind why the facts were presented. I also expected more from a high school class than just basic arithmetic and the rest of the subjects. I would have given this book a zero if there were not all these complaints. Also, the book could have been shorter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  Not a good book at all.  It's not fun to read and is so dry and difficult to understand, even for someone who has read a lot of other fantasy.  The story is like watching a video, it does have a twist at the end, but nothing is explained.  The world is very complicated, but it's like watching TV, it's not all there.   It's hard to get into the characters, they seem to be all the same and the only ones who have any real depth are the women, no real male characters.  Not something I'd read if I were looking for a fast read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________Readers may find it very depressing to read what I've written about this book. But it would be a lie to say it's not a decent book - it is. It's an amazing book. As soon as I read the first page, I knew this was the right book for me. I just couldn't put it down. This is one of those rare times when I couldn't wait to start the next book - just to get stuck in to a good book. I am glad I waited, because I really enjoyed this book, and would happily recommend it to anyone who may enjoy it as much as I did. If it's anything like the previous two books, you should buy it. This one's much better than the previous books, as I expected.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to admit that this book had no point, I don't know if it is just me who has a problem with this type of story, but the book was poorly written and the plot never made any sense to me. My favorite character was not the main villain but the main heroine and I am not even sure the antagonist had a point in the story. As you could see, I was frustrated and the book never even got an enjoyable ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________  I hate when I read books and I find that they are so dry and boring. I was expecting a book like "The Way of the Master" from John Grisham but that is not it. This book is a dry read. The characters are not memorable and I do not care about them. There are no emotions, no surprises and no twists.  The plot was not original and I'm sorry, but I found this novel not that enjoyable. I know there are some that may enjoy it. There were several characters that I didn't know that I liked and this novel was so boring to me I wanted to read a book with more character.    A great book that does not hold up well to time and reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a sad tale about a boy and a girl that had no luck in their lives. The girl's father was a thief and killed himself when he found out about her stealing, so he tried to murder the boy when she was a boy to keep her from stealing anymore. The boy tries to keep the girl from stealing until she becomes a girl, but she has a lot of trouble with the people because she's so feminine. It was a little slow, but the ending was good and the boy's father is a great villain.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ "As a former Catholic, I didn't understand this. "   ____________________________________________   I'm sorry to be the one to say this, but this book just does not add up, even if you take all the explanations at face value. There is no rational basis for these assertions, which are based on nothing more than assumptions and a lack of evidence. One particular assertion is that a large part of the Mormon population believes that there is a devil. To me this seems silly, as a lot of the people who attend services and speak at general conferences do not believe in devils. They also don't believe in ghosts, the Virgin Mary, or any of that sort of thing. The only thing that is true is that many of them believe in angels, which I take to mean the spirit of the deceased, which is clearly stated in the Bible.   However, it appears that there are some people who do believe in some sort of devil, although I have not been able to find a solid explanation for what that might be. The Book of Abraham seems to indicate that it is a spirit, and I don't really believe in the spirit if it's not talking to me.   A lot of this book seems like a rehash of old arguments and misunderstandings, and there are too many claims and assumptions to be justified.   to give a short summary: Mormon claims that the church is true; Mormons believe that the Book of Mormon is a divinely inspired document; some of the early church leaders and members were members of the Masons and their teachings influenced the church; some Mormons think the Book is a literal history of the American Indians, and it contains details that would not fit into modern life; Mormons also believe that a great and powerful spirit called Jesus Christ is the one who is supposed to be at the very center of all the religions and that the book of Mormon was written in the latter days by this great spirit; there are many ancient people who died before Christ who could have been prophets and who were not translated, but were kept alive by the power of the spirit and not by the physical bodies of their followers; Mormons don't consider themselves polygamists but believe that all of the women in their temples are married to the men, and men who have wives that have not lived with them before they go into the temple are eligible for a second marriage (the wives must be at least 15 years older than the men) - I believe that Mormons believe these
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book thinking "it's a kids book, it's not like the new YA and they don't write about super hot teens, so this shouldn't really be that bad. I'm not sure if it's just that I'm a teen and I want it to be a hit, or if I just like the concept of an alternate universe and I'd like to see more of it." And while I still think it's a good book, I would still not recommend it. I just felt like it didn't have enough time for me to really get invested, which I feel like many books fail to do.   I don't have an especially harsh complaint about the book, because I really liked it and it was very enjoyable, but I would like to have seen it end sooner. And since I'm being honest, I felt like a lot of my time was wasted by the ending. It was kind of a let down after all the buildup.   at one point, we see all the characters as teenagers, and all the girls and the guys are super attractive and everything is so easy to understand. I don't remember anything about the story or about our main character, so I don,t know if it was the fact that I was a teen that made it hard for me. But at one certain point, there is a big battle that takes place, and when it's over, all the heroes go home to their normal lives, except for one guy who goes back to space to get his life back on track. And then we see him go back to school for a few days before he has to go back out and fight again, where he's more like a normal teenager, but with a super powered past. This was a little jarring for me, and the book should have just ended and left it at that. The plot didn't drag, it just felt a little off.   to be honest, there was some moments that I thought were really cool, but then again, it was still a fun read. The main characters were really well written and I loved seeing them grow as characters.  . Also, as a side note, I have a little problem with the main character. I do believe that if the main male character had died, it would have made it much better, but because he had super powers, it still kind of killed his character. Not to sound like a big baby, but it felt a bit more like, "well,
Write a negative review about a bad book:...............................................................This book was absolutely useless. There are so many errors, mistakes, and obvious holes in this book, that a good writer will pick it apart and put it back together. This book is bad, bad, terrible. I read this and thought "oh well... I guess the writer must have been trying to be creative". Then I went through the book and realized that it was nothing but a list of how things would be if we had a flat earth and a lot of nonsense about the Bible. I found it difficult to read because I had to stop a lot and stop to think. It was very hard to believe in the flat earth because that is just the kind of thing I would expect from someone who makes these claims. There was a lot about the earth and the heavens that I just wanted to throw away. My only hope was that the author had some proof, but it never came in the end.  1 of 1 people found the following review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  the ending was just terrible. I had to give it one star because the book is awesome. But I'm sad the book ended like this. The only thing I enjoyed about this book was that it was short. If you're really reading this review, please take that into account. I was surprised by it was in one page. I'm not really sure how to feel about this story...I liked it because of the science, but I wasn't really sold on the way the characters dealt with the situation. But if you can look past that, and look at it more from a moral standpoint, you'll see how beautiful this story is. It's almost as if the characters were born knowing how things will go down...it was an interesting take on our own nature and how things can go wrong. I really liked the story, but it was so short. It was pretty much a one-off for me. Read all about my recent travels to the Far East, and to the most famous cave paintings in the world: The Cave of the Dog and the Cave of Men. Read about my experiences with my family's tour operator, and my latest trip to China. I'm currently in Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines, and plan on going to New Zealand in November.

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********   This book is the definition of a let down. The story isn't very good and it doesn't do anything well. It's an over complicated story about an alien, a wizard and a sword. I had fun in the first half of the book but then it fell apart. I can't believe they used to have a series like this. The books are over 700 pages long and the characters are stupid. I have the only copy and I still don't think I'll ever read them again. They should just discontinue. I gave this four stars because it was fun for a while but after it was over I just didn't enjoy it and I can easily tell why.   There are three sequels in this series:   "The Dragon's Shadow" (The only good one)  "Vampire Slayer"  (I don't like this one)   The last book in the series is called "Tortured Soul".   If you don't care about the book series, then you should just read the first three books and get over it. I recommend not reading this series at all unless you are a big fan of the Dragonlance franchise.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I was looking forward to the last book in the trilogy, so I was excited to start this one. What I got instead was a book that was a waste of time and money. -------------- The book is written as if the author knows nothing about physics. ------------ No one is able to create a strong magnetic field. ------------- There is no "space" in the universe. ------------------------- If this book was written in the 50s, it would be called "the worst physics book in history" --------------------------- I read it because I wanted to see where my favorite author could go wrong. __________________ My rating: ------------- 5 of 5 stars ( 1 review )
Write a negative review about a bad book:  it's as bad as it's going to get.  A terrible tale.  As always, there is some kind of explanation for the death of the main character, but this time it's a bit more than the usual explanation.  I don't know who did what in this book, so I don?t care.  The ending is not very good either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has all the hallmarks of an amateur novel. The author spends most of the time setting up a scene and then never gets around to doing anything with it. I guess he thought the scene was funny enough that it was worth the effort to write it out. And since the scenes are the center of the story, he wastes more time explaining them than actually doing anything else.   5 stars out of 5 stars:    This book is just about what you would expect from a novel with no plot or characters.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It would have been better if it was a book I didn't like. It really sucked! I don't know why they were taking the time to write this book and how did they think a student would have any idea what they were talking about. There were a lot of spelling and grammar errors and it was so difficult to understand the author. It's very difficult for me to take on something like this. It was the worst book I have ever read and a waste of my time. Read it if you like the concept of a book but I couldn't stand it and would never recommend this to anyone. 8.8/10.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You can't take this book very seriously, and it shows. This is a poor retelling of the true events of the war, full of many mistakes and bad conclusions. It's very, very bad. There's nothing original or even coherent about it at all. It seems like the author is trying to say a lot with very little content and a lot of clichés.   There is some action in the book, which is not entirely bad. You'll be fighting Nazis and monsters, but it doesn't have much impact. Also, there's a scene where the protagonist and an enemy are being watched by some civilians (an interesting idea in itself), and the way the story wraps up there is somewhat awkward, so there's that. There is some interesting characterization, but again, it seems to be little more than window dressing for the action. There are a few moments of character development in the characters, and even those are relatively few.   it's very easy to get bored of the main character. His dialogue is also a bit tedious, but I won't even get into that. The heroines are not very appealing either. The only one that really has a positive impact on the plot is the main heroine, but even she's too weak for that.  - - - - Recommendations - -  - -  the first book of the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher is about WWII. While it isn't a true story, it's probably the most realistic of the books I've read in the Dresden series.It's set in a fictional world. While the book doesn't contain any actual Nazis, it does give some insight into what happened during the war. In addition, there are some aspects of the real Dresden during the end of the conflict.In general, I enjoyed it very much. I did not like that the Dresden police detective is a guy who's a vampire. The ending of the book seems a little rushed, but if you're looking for some quick fun, this is a good choice. The first book in the series is about a man who works for the FBI.He's trying to help solve the mystery of the series, and he's a pretty likable guy. The author manages to keep it interesting while making it very easy for the reader to enjoy.The story does have some of the typical clichés that were a part of most war stories during WWII. This book, however, had a good plot and good characterization, as

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not impressed by this book. I wanted to like it, but it just was not the same. The narrative was good, but not as good as the narration. This is the only book I've read by the authors of the first book, but I still prefer it over the other books I read about the same characters. The book was good for entertainment and it had a good ending, but the characters did not seem to change much from the first to the second book. The main characters in this book all seemed to be a little more arrogant and self absorbed in the first one, but that changed for the second. Also I didn't like the narrator's voice, it was too quiet. I could not understand him and I felt he was giving too much of the story away.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I can't imagine how it is possible to write a book which would be so full of bad ideas. The book has a number of odd and even worse ideas. It is also difficult to believe that a guy with so much talent could write such a book."   1) The book is full of odd ideas.  2) It is difficult to find something wrong with anything. - The book contains such stupid ideas such as:  1. You don't really have to wear clothes, or make a change of clothes, you just have to change the contents of your socks  - Women only have to put on a little extra weight so as not to appear overweight  3. A woman is not really a woman because she does not have the same facial features as a man  4. There is no such thing as'mummy's boy'  5. Women don't actually know how to make children  6. When a woman makes a child, it's just a man in a child's body  7. If a woman has a son, it is his fault that he is not as smart as he should be  8. Men don't have any rights as they never do anything for a woman  9. Men have no rights as women just pay them money  10. If men had the same rights as girls, they would stop paying for all the things women do for them.   This last one isn't even an idea, it just makes no sense at all.  of course some people have opinions on the matter but the idea is just stupid. 's idea of "equality" is just not acceptable to me at all.'   'There is a lot to be said for gender equality and it would be fantastic if more men and women did try to understand the difference and work with it to try to create a more just world. What is not great, however, is the idea that gender equality can be achieved by just throwing money at the problem.'  Readers, what would you consider an idea that is so bad it is just beyond belief, beyond the possibility of being true. Please leave a comment below.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm disappointed with this book. It's a hard read. There's a lot to say about it, and it's definitely an introvert's worst nightmare. It does a very good job at showing a woman's experience, though, and I'm glad I took the time to read it. It was fun and well done and if you're an introverted woman reading, this book will make you feel all warm inside.   If you're in a relationship and a woman is in your life, I don't think you should read this book (it's just too dark). 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________   This book has some major flaws.   The beginning, the middle, and the end are bad.   The first one, "The Secret", starts off with a woman named Lisa, who is a bit more likeable in this novel than in the last one she wrote. However, the book quickly becomes predictable and predictable, and by the end of the book, it was just bad. I found it pretty boring, and even though it was fun to read through for the first time, I didn't find it all that interesting. I do like Lisa, and she's nice enough, but it would have been much better if it was some other character.   This is the worst book by L.J. Smith, because I really did not find it to be that interesting in my opinion. It was only mediocre, and I wish I had not been compelled to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I did not enjoy this book. I felt cheated and cheated when I gave the book 3 stars. I read a review from someone who said this book has the best writing in the series. I will say the same, but only if the writing is good enough to merit a 4 star rating. The book was a bit repetitive and the writing wasn't as good as it was in other books. I got the feeling that some parts were edited out because it was better to just say that instead of explaining what happened. I'm giving this one a 3 star rating because if the same book had been published a few years later, I would give it a 4 or a 5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst books I've ever read...   My son, who is currently in second grade, is not only very gifted in reading, but he has been reading for many years and even wrote a "Story Book" about himself and how he was made. He had an amazing story to tell and so I took a chance and bought this. I was really excited to start reading, and started reading and kept on reading until the last line, when the story ended and I had to stop and let the book finish for me.   The book starts out by introducing the story that your character is going to tell your class about their "life story." The first two or three sentences are the main story, where your character explains their life in a very interesting way. I am amazed that the first sentence was all that the author had to work with. It had so many good things to say and the author did not take a single opportunity to write a "fluffier" story. This is not a typical "my life is the best and this is the only reason I am happy" type of book. The author makes you feel for this character as they live their life and make you laugh and cry. At no time in this book do I feel bad for my character, I felt as though I was reading an interesting character. However, the author made the reader feel that the story was over. It is like when you have finished a book and you want to find out what the story is about and the writer leaves out most of the beginning and just goes right for the end. The ending is a cliff hanger. The only thing I could find in the story to make me feel a sense of closure was the ending. I had been reading this book for more than a month before I was even able to find a good ending. There is not even enough info to tell me what happened next. The writer did not even try to "fill in the blanks" with information that they didn't have, or leave a question open for me to find.     Also, the way the author ended this book was horrible. I could have gotten through the entire book without even the last three or four pages if I just found out where the "bad guy" was, but the author didn't even bother to tell us that. I have a good imagination and I figured out where he was. The story is over and I have to read the next one to find

I was so frustrated. This book makes a lot of claims and this was one of the claims it made that was just completely bogus.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I tried this book, and I gave it four stars, and it's been a long time since I did that, but then I did. I had no idea how it would read like. It has a very slow pace. I found the story and characters incredibly flat. It's a slow paced, depressing book. It makes me feel so bad that this book is the only reason I've put the book down. My only positive is the character, he's good and his interactions with the main character were interesting. I know it's an alternate universe and I guess this is just the only thing that makes sense.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If I had a dime for every person who left an unfavorable review for a bad science book, I would have more money. I have already tried several different books on the subject and my expectations of the book were already very low. If you are considering reading it, I'd strongly advise you to just stick with the first 2 chapters of the first book. That way you can get a more complete idea of the topic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!  I have read the other three reviews and have the same thought. I thought that the book was okay to start out with. The chapters were interesting and the plot was intriguing. The end though, was just so poorly written, I was so pissed that the author did not write any better. She even said that she had to write this book. I am not sure what the point was of this book other than to piss off people. I read the book before I started watching the series, then I was disappointed in it. I wanted more out of this world story. I didn't like the romance between him and Kat. I also didn't really like the villain. I wasn't interested in how his plans went, and I think that was the major downfall. I feel like they wasted so much time writing the other characters and they could have spent more time with the main cast.   Overall, this was a bad decision. I guess they were just trying to make money with the series. I will not be re-reading this book and my overall rating is a 4 out of 10
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was one of my top favorites of the series. Unfortunately it ended up being pretty forgettable.  I wish they would've written something different.   It's a good idea and the ending made a lot of sense, but i guess i just can't get past the ending. I would still recommend it if you're looking for a fantasy novel, not much else going on, but not something i'd read again.  (review of free book)
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________   "It was so funny to me, I read it and thought 'I wish I could get my money back.'   I was really looking forward to this book. And it is all well-written... and funny.   But I think the best part is when the narrator's friend is explaining to a class at school that the word "man" can mean both woman and man.  -he said, 'Yes, but also, the meaning of "man's wife" is very different than that of "boy's girlfriend."'   So this is a good book. However, I found the only part I didn't enjoy was when the class was discussing the difference between what a "man has" and what a man wants. I think that was pretty annoying for the teacher.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped this book would be one of those "What I Learned From This Book" type of books. Sadly it's not. It's a lot of fluff that was very boring.   It did help me improve my own writing, but I wouldn't recommend this book to someone wanting to improve their writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This book is an absolute pain to read... The author has managed to combine all of the worst tropes and clichés of modern fantasy. He's like 'a modern Tolkien but worse, but also worse', an attempt at making us love a dead king, a god-king, and a madman, all at the same time. There's very little to recommend it, it's just boring. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a good epic fantasy. But seriously, it has its moments but they are few and far between."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing I dislike about this book is that at the end when the last section is mentioned (I guess they were trying to save space) it gives a quote from one of my favorite authors William Gibson   I think this book should have been called "The Black Market for White People"  The last section of the book is about a group of white people who were turned into aliens and a bunch of the human species is trying to get them back. I found that the book did not end at the aliens but was rather a series of "how to"s for humans who were transformed into aliens by the aliens and were trying not to go crazy on each other. This is a good book but I don't recommend it for new readers. It is about white people being turned into alien aliens, about how bad it would be if that happened to you, and how we should deal with the problem that is going on with us.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "This is a boring story" This is a horrible book that I would not recommend to anyone.  It would be far better off if it were written by someone else with a different story.  This book is filled with plot holes and is not a good story, nor should it be written by a good author.   I read it and was horrified at the fact that I read this book and did not realize this book was not a book written by an author that was known for good stories.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  When you start reading " The Secret " ( I really hope someone reads this book, if it is only read one time, I won't be able to stop it)  you are reminded  what a terrible book it is and how bad it can be.  This book was published in 1998 and the premise is that a secret society exists called "The Illuminati".  They want the entire world to worship them as if they were a gods.      The author, E.M. Forster is writing about the time before the time machine.    They are an elite group of people and they need to change things with their "scientific" technology and they are using a secret group of scientists to do it.       So what is the secret society, The Illuminati?    The first thing to know is that the book is written in the first person which can be confusing at first but it doesn't take long to get into it.   "The Secret" is the story of two people, "John" and "Elijah".  "Elijah" is an author and a scientist, he goes through hell and back in trying to change the world and get the world to accept him as a god and accept him into the Illuminati society.   "John", the author and his wife, Rose, go through hell with him.  They are locked up in a house for 10 years.  Rose was an alcoholic and a horrible mother.  She got to where she was so far by her child, who became a teenager and had a drinking problem.  And Rose couldn't bring herself to kill the child.  Then a man and a woman come to take Rose's son away.    The wife is an inventor and a computer scientist and she is the one who builds the time device.  It is this person that leads Rose to help her husband with his "scientific experiment".          "Elias" is my favorite character, he is the anti-Elijah because Elijah is the good looking, kind, father figure and Elias is the cold, ruthless and evil psychopath.   "Elise" is Rose's daughter, she has a temper and is just a spoiled brat who is out for the "best" of anyone around her.    "John's" wife is the person who loves him and who helps him and that is also the most evil woman in the book.  I don't think
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________ This is NOT a book about the first season of "True Blood" or "Spartacus" and their adventures. The book is about the history and legacy of the most influential, most enduring, most beautiful television show in American history, "Star Trek." I am surprised that any man with the brain of a sponge would read this book. The fact that it does not take the subject matter seriously does not help either. The subject matter is, "Where in the World is Spock?" If you had to tell me this would be a good book, I would be impressed. It is a short and entertaining read. One of the main reasons it is short is the fact that the author does not put much effort into the plot. The action happens quickly in the first chapter, and the rest of the book is the "where is Spock" story. There are no details, no explanation of what was going on in the world of Kirk or the crew, not much description of the characters either. As a child, I had my dad take me to the Paramount Theater to see "Star Wars" for the first time. My dad wanted me to watch it, I refused, he was not going to make me watch something I thought would make me uncomfortable. I don't know what my parents were like in 1967, but if they had been like that, I might have spent an entire night wondering if it was real or not. If you are not a Star Trek fan, if you do not think the Enterprise looks like a spacecraft from a bad sci-fi movie, I do not know how you would get through this book except to cry or laugh until you drop. If your mother says you can read this if you just watch this episode and think about it, you might be able to go through this without laughing, but there is no humor to be found. One could say this is a science fiction novel. It certainly looks that way. If there is a reason to do this, I could understand it. Unfortunately, the book leaves too many things unexplained and too many unexplained events unanswered. If anyone thinks the book was worth it, they are an idiot. You will get out of it only as much as you put into it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was a terrible book to read. The plot is very poorly written. Not only is it confusing, it was really hard for me to follow. My sister read it before I did, so she gave me a more complete story. The characters are extremely cliché. It took me about a week to pick up on everything. I can't say this wasn't a hard read, as it was hard to put down. I just really don't like it. 9 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "A good read, not a great one" "This book should not have been written." "I don't want to read another book by this author." Review of The Book Thief by Thomas Covenant This book was okay, it was decent, but there was a problem. The problem was that it was a sequel, but not a sequel to a good book. The book didn't have a good plot, a believable plot, it wasn't a fun plot. The plot of the book was so bad that I was frustrated every time I was about to go to the next part of the story. I was going to read the book and that would be it. I decided to put the book on my "to read list" but it got put back down. I will give the author a 5 for good work on the novel, but for the sequel this was the worst job of the author I've ever had to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've heard that the characters don't have the emotions they have in the book. I haven't read the book, so I don't know if that's true or not, but I had problems with the characters. At one point, I felt they had the emotions and the depth of humanity they had in the story but it felt forced. I felt the characters felt like they were there to "get the story" instead of feeling real and human. I have a hard time believing it's a "book".  And that was a HUGE problem with this book. There were no real life problems, characters had emotions and depth, and I loved the way they were written. It was a great book about a great person. The characters were all different but they all had that love and connection with each other and with people they cared about. But, I have to say that it was very "messed up" in my opinion.  I wish the author had taken things a bit more seriously.  For example, I was so bored one time by the story and had to go to the bathroom to clear my head. I can't recall which story it was, but there was one part that got to me.  But that's the only time I felt this way. I did love the ending though.  It was very emotional and made me feel really good.  So, my thoughts on this are very mixed. I'm giving it two stars because I loved it.  At first, I thought it was a "fairy tale" with a twist. I wanted more, but the ending was what I was expecting. I could be wrong, but it's my two cents. "I'm not telling you what to do, I'm just telling you to be careful."  That's the way the narrator talked at the beginning of this story, and at the end, he says exactly the same thing, only in a different tone.  What a way to start a story. I've read two reviews about this book and both of them agree that it's not a romance. And I'm not going to argue against it, because it is NOT a romance book. It does not have romance. I am in love with the character of John, but for me, it was just a wonderful character that you could relate to.  There is a lot of conflict in this book!  And that's one of the reasons I think the book is
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________ I had the pleasure of being given a copy of this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a huge fan of horror. I had read The Shining, The Craft, The Hunger Games, Cabin in the Woods, A Walk in the Clouds, and more but the horror of those didn't stick with me. I thought The Night Circus was alright but the "realness" of it is what I was looking for. This book was way better than all the rest. I will be reading it again very soon.  25 of 31 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________ Readers Review: If you ever wondered what would happen if a world renowned author wrote a children's book...then The Little Prince is the story for you. I didn't mind the language or the setting. This was very informative, funny and sweet. _______________________________ Review by: Amy (Gibraltar, UK)  The Little Prince This book is a wonderful story to read to a child, and the illustrations are very well done.  A story about a little prince, who wishes to make his kingdom more interesting. His only desire is to visit all of the kingdoms of the world, and his way of reaching them all is to take on the task of making his kingdom the best place on earth. His father, the king, is very strict and expects the children of his kingdom to be obedient. The little prince gets on very well with his father. However, the prince finds himself in trouble when he becomes a hero and fights evil monsters that have taken over his kingdom. I particularly liked the way the prince learns to see what he thinks is the most important, and to let go of that which is not.  The prince has a hard time in his journey, but he eventually becomes a great hero and saves the world from evil monsters.   I especially enjoyed the story, the illustrations and the witty language used by the author.   It's a great story for all children and their parents. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book, and I think most of my fellow YA/HALF readers would agree.  A good book does not need to be 100% perfect to be a great read.  The main problem I had with this book was the protagonist's lack of character development and a story that was not developed at all, which really felt like this story was not about this boy.  The main character of the book, James, was described by his father as "a good boy who had good grades in school."  It is not mentioned in this section, but James was also described as an "average student" and an "associate" by the teachers of his high school and this is how the teacher described James' writing in the book: "The only thing I can say about his handwriting is that it is a little uneven.  But it is so beautiful that I am just going to take it as a compliment."   I have been told by several reviewers that James is described in this story as being "a nice boy with great manners" who "wears his heart on his sleeve" and is "a typical teenager".    James never develops the personality that he shows in the other parts of the story and the story was clearly written to tell about this single character and how he was described as a teenager.     In the book James is shown to be very smart, which I found surprising at this age, as I knew the typical teenage boy to be extremely smart and it was quite surprising to read that this was not the case with James.  The story never describes James' problems and the way he is described as "an average student" was extremely misleading.   James is portrayed as a good kid who is very polite, but never develops any kind of character.   I also have been informed that he was diagnosed with a mental illness and is being treated at a hospital.  I was never told anything about how James' family was doing or that he had to go to school.  It seems like the author just wanted to make James an interesting character and so this was her only goal. The book was very short, and at about 60 pages I felt that it had about 90% of the plot and character development that the author had planned.  In conclusion, this book failed to be an enjoyable read because of a lack of development and an awful book that did not have any fun or excitement to
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ _________________________________________________.. ________. This book was great! It's the perfect book for when I want to go out and meet some new people. It's not too depressing or too much romance, yet it's well written. The character of the female main character is really interesting. I liked the way that this book told a story that was really interesting, and it gave me some great insight on my love life, and other areas of life. My boyfriend and I have been together about a year now, and I enjoyed the story, and the characters very much. I highly recommend this book!

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ This book was so boring and so hard to understand that I never finished reading it. It started out very good but eventually it became just a dry boring read. I will give it a 2 star review just because it is not all bad. I think that it could use some more story and more humor. But overall just not my cup of tea.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ---------------  This book, written by Michael R. Underwood, is horrible. I did not enjoy it at all. I was trying to read it with a group of friends and we all hated it. We all laughed when we read it and just gave it a bad review.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________ This is a collection of essays about the literary world and it would have been so much better if it had been divided into three separate books. I was a fan of several of the other authors. However, I had to admit to finding some of their writing less than interesting, which was the case with George Saunders' book. It really felt like it was written in the same style and was basically rehashing old ideas. While I appreciate Saunders' efforts to explore different parts of the literary universe, his book was not as fresh and inventive as I was expecting. As a fiction writer I feel I am limited to trying to explain and expand on what I have experienced as a reader. I wanted to know more about the political struggles and how they have affected the way people have experienced literature. The authors seemed to be either unaware or unwilling to address these issues. For example, the American Poet Laureate has the luxury of telling us what he has experienced as he reads a book. He can't even think of the idea that this might be a useful tool for exploring his own writing. If he did think of it, I'm sure he would have found a way to incorporate his own experiences. If his reading was so different from my own that he did not think that the reader could really understand it, then the book would have not been worthwhile. So, the fact that all of the writers discuss the same stuff seems to me a problem. I felt I was reading a similar book in this book. If it were a collection that was about poets in the '20s or '30s, I think I would have liked it better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________ I read this book in February, and it took me until May to read the first half. At that time I was reading several books about a serial killer, and this book seemed very interesting. I really liked the way it was written, and I was able to follow the plot very closely, with a lot of suspense. However, I think the writing got a bit tedious very quickly. It really reminded me of some of the earlier John R. Bunnell books, in that it didn't have any action, just lots of talking, and a little bit of the creepy in every sentence. The story in the first section was really interesting, but the second section was just an afterthought. I guess I really didn't like the main character. It wasn't until the last section that I became interested in him. I read the last paragraph a few times, wondering what would happen next. The book ended very abruptly, and there was no follow up, just a long, tedious paragraph from the killer, saying goodbye. Overall, this book was not worth the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! This is a piece of shit! I bought it to read by myself because I could not find any other reviews. I had never heard of it or read a single word until it arrived. The book is a very long rant, a bit of a rant-y, full of anger and hatred. I will not be reading any of his other books. This was just a waste of time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I've read several of his books, but have never read one that really blew me away with the plot or the characters. This one is one that was just a really bad novel. It didn't have any plot, no suspense, not much action, nothing really worth the time I spent on it. It was just kind of there, and not really interesting. Not only that, but it has to do with a witch that goes around trying to get rid of all the animals that are no good. It is just so generic, so boring and boring and annoying. I thought it would be good for a quick laugh or something, but I just read so many of these books that I usually get some kind of enjoyment out of them. I've already stopped trying to figure out what's going on, because I'm bored of it now. I am sure you could come up with another novel that is better written and more entertaining, but as far as I'm concerned, I am finished with this one. Not to mention the fact that I actually don't understand half the dialogue in it!

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book. I have been looking for a good, long-term science fiction book for a while, and this sounded promising. I was looking for something different from the usual'space opera' that the genre has been dominated by. I looked forward to hearing about the politics, the social issues, the alien species, etc. I liked some of the details that they left out, like the history of the planet the characters lived on, so I was hopeful. But this book is simply a lot of the usual crap. It just doesn't stand out as a really good book. The ending of the book makes no sense. It wasn't even clear why it was going to be "that kind of end." At one point I was seriously concerned about the future of humanity and what kind of people would be left to keep that civilization going. I know I am just one of those who is going to write it off as a terrible waste of my time and hard drive space, but I am a scientist and I have to try to look beyond this one-sided summary and try to read the book for myself. Maybe the writer was a bad sci fi writer before he took the helm.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "Lament for Fears" is the most boring book I have ever read in my life and I've read so many. This book was the worst I have read in 20 years of reading.  The author is extremely pretentious and seems to really care about his writing and his readers. I have no idea why the author wants to read this book and I really hope he never does.   There is no plot, there are no characters, it's just a long essay on how life sucks and nothing will ever change because of the death of the American Dream, with the whole thing based on a book about a rock band and the author's own personal life.  ...  ..    I'm sorry, I just can't understand why anybody would even consider buying this book. The author has no imagination, no personality, no creativity, he writes nothing but his own personal stories. And he is completely pretentious.   it will just stay in a shelf for a few years.   and the sad thing is this book was written 20 years ago and we're still living with that same system. This is the last time I will buy this kind of book. If you are interested in reading about a band, go somewhere else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've never loved a book so much I would like to kill the author. I had a wonderful time with " The Last Book of Magic " but this book was just terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________I had heard a lot about this book before I actually read it. I have heard nothing but great things. So I decided to go out and pick it up. I'm glad I did! I don't usually go for first person narratives, but this one was absolutely fascinating and I read it in one sitting.The book focuses on a group of people in the city of New Haven (a small, wealthy community of around 3,000). The book takes place between about 1750 and the 1850s, but the narrator goes back and forth between the present day and the 1860s (when the author describes a series of "incidents" occurring during that time frame).The story takes place in a fairly simple way - there is a young girl (the narrator) who is brought up by her grandmother (the woman who is now "the oldest living woman in New Haven") and is part of a group who go out hunting for deer, elk, and other animals that may be on the hunt. They are part of the Hudson's Bay Company, an organization that started out to keep the fur trade going in the area - but when the price of furs dropped, the company started to sell animals for meat instead. There is the man in charge, a man named John Cutler, who is also the most powerful person in the whole group (as he also makes the decisions on hunting seasons, the size of herds, etc.). He has a lot of power in this group, because the animals he hunts have to stay with him for the winter.There are some characters you already know: the young girl, the man who teaches her how to shoot, the woman who teaches the young man how to hunt, the old woman who raises the young woman, etc. But there are also a few you do not. There are two hunters - one from the Hudson Bay Company (one of the major fur traders in the region) and another from the New Haven Fur Company, who seem to be fighting a little bit for their share of the trade, and the woman's brother (who is the oldest person in New England) seems to be in a bit of a crisis with his wife and her mother. He is the most interesting of the characters because he really gets into his work and he makes decisions about the company based on how his life is going. But also, he really doesn't like John Cutler and what he does to his family. It's really interesting to watch him go through
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************* (I have read all of the books in this series and I am extremely disappointed with this one. I have never been so disappointed in a book in all of my reading life. I read this book to my daughter. I was completely turned off by the whole thing. It is an awful, awful book. I did not enjoy reading it and I did. I think the book is very hard to write a positive review about it. I didn't even want to read this because of the terrible book. This book was very boring. I don't think I've ever heard a bad review for a book. The ending was so bad it is hard to read another book in this kind of setting. Very disappointing, I will not be purchasing another book with this author in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________   If you read this book and decide it is nothing but a sad story of a lost boy...or if you read it and have no interest in reading another story by that author, or if you are like me and have already bought this book, you are in for a real treat. I never expected such a beautiful, original, well written and exciting fantasy novel, and I enjoyed it so much I bought the whole series (and will probably pick up the next one). There are also some good and original ideas in the story, but it was a sad, sad story, and not something I want to read a few hundred more times (though I could...but that is another story).   This was my first attempt at writing a fantasy story, so there are several things I was able to do to improve my writing style. In addition, I've never been a fan of the author's style (not in any way that I can discern). I can't see how anyone can read this and enjoy it (I am writing from my heart, but I think many of you would be able to agree that it isn't a bad effort, and probably a better effort than most of the authors out there), but as always, you should read this for yourself to judge the book on its own merits.   As for the plot, it doesn't have much going for it. You're introduced to the wizard (who, again, isn't that special a character at all), and he's not that interesting either. He's like the typical dark elf: intelligent, but not very well written. And the boy? I don't think he has much going on besides his sad story. But he's the main character of the book, so I thought I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. I do love a good underdog story and this was just that. But as a side note, the wizard is definitely an evil, manipulative villain, who does some very nasty things to those who are his enemies. He certainly did not play fair with the boy. And he uses his magic like he's playing a game.  .     I'm so glad I read this series, and that I'm still reading. I really have a soft spot for this series (the first book is my favorite of the entire series, BTW), and will probably buy the next installment. Even though I think the first book was just okay, I like what the second book did
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only redeeming thing about this book was how it taught me about the difference between "a story" and "a literary work". That is to say, I never once found myself confused between the two. In fact, I was able to tell what the story was and how to "follow" the story without being completely lost. This book had me "trying" (and failing) to figure out where exactly the story takes place. I had no idea what the book was about! It was all just too darn confusing for me.   I think a few things hindered this book. First, it had a ton of characters, and the book is pretty short. In addition, the plot itself was fairly convoluted, and at times I was struggling to follow everything that was going on. Secondly, there was no clear introduction for the book's characters, other than "this is a book about a girl who has a weird relationship with a bird," which was kind of weird, considering it's pretty obvious from the get-go that it was about a woman trying to understand the bird who lives in her attic (yes, really).   As a whole, I'm giving this book two stars, since I still enjoyed it, and I was very intrigued by the premise, even if I didn't quite understand it. I will definitely read the next installment.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I received the "Sleeping Beauty" in exchange for a review. It's just a waste of time and my money. I had the same problems I always have with the author's stories: the characters have no depth and are often just one-dimensional. The story is nothing special and the plot is so simple it's hard to see why the author wrote it.   When I read the book, I was told that it is the final book in the Sleeping Beauty series. It was one of the first books I ever read. I have seen it described in many books as being like "Harry Potter" meets "Lord of the Flies" and that it deals with "the politics of love" and how people can be so crazy about people. I would say it is like a cross between "Twilight" and "Pride and Prejudice" or just a horrible story about people who are in love and who are willing to commit all sorts of terrible things to ensure their love will be granted. This is a story where a guy goes to a country where they have never had a girl come before to win a girl's hand. And so he takes the girl to a place that has never had anyone come before as well and tries to win her heart and is very successful. But the more they spend together, the more she seems to like him, so he decides he wants to go back to his country and spend more time with her. But when he returns to his own country, he has discovered that the girl he loved is still alive. So, he decides to try to save her, but with a different plan, the "princess with the diamond".   The story is the same as the previous books in the series. The hero's journey that is so popular in children's literature. I did like the different ideas, the different locations and the different ways characters interacted. But it was just a mess. I really wish I could give this book zero stars because there are many plot holes and there are no reasons to even go into it. There are so many things that are completely missing that you could fill in the gaps with a list of problems with the story:   1) Why would a guy from a different country want to go to a small town full of people who have not had girls before and expect them to be more receptive to his advances when they have not been in a romantic relationship before? This has been done in every other fantasy
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book thinking it would be some type of thriller, as it is set during the 1970's. There are a lot of cool things about the book, but unfortunately it is also kind of a drag. The main character is a cop, he has an awesome gun that shoots bullets through walls. He is also a man of action, he wants to shoot a lot. He also has the coolest name, the cop with the glasses, and the coolest girlfriend. After a while the characters seem to be one-dimensional, and they are also the typical police. The police are also not very realistic. They are very good at their job, but they also are very aggressive and arrogant, as they think they can do anything without much difficulty. I don't understand why they are in this book, they seem to come off like the characters in police shows that do nothing but arrest people all the time, and don't go out much to get some real action. This book seemed to have a lot more potential, but the author unfortunately did not deliver.   If you are a cop and you think you will never have to use your gun, then this book is a great read. If you are interested in cops and crime you will not like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was great in theory, however in practice I had a hard time following the plot of the book and was lost. In the end I was just glad that I didn't read it. I've heard from other people that the characters felt fake and I have a hard enough time not believing in these things! A bit disappointed because this book had so much potential. But this is what I call a bad read! I really wish I had gotten something better!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book for a reading challenge and it didn't live up to expectations. The book starts off with the two main characters at a lake surrounded by the trees and grass. The setting seems to be more for entertainment than learning or inspiration. Then the story jumps back to the beginning. It seems like the author has been reading all the popular books about the outdoors and wanted to copy them. The story takes us to a resort, a place of solitude, to a small beach. We go on an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet. Everything about this experience was horrible, the food was overpriced, the water in the pool is so dirty the towels look like they were dipped in acid. We were told by the owner that the water was a natural mineral, but I doubt the owner has ever gone swimming at the pool where we ate. Then it gets even worse when we take a break from the buffet to look for a suitable spot to sit and relax. It was hard to sit there when we didn't have any food for our kids to eat! We had the most beautiful sunsets, but then the sunsets were so very short, we were unable to see it. Then we find a nice grassy spot and it is too hot to sit, so we leave the grassy area and walk across a paved path to the beach. It didn't take long for the sun to get up and we couldn't take off our swimwear. The sun got hot and started to scorch our skin as soon as we arrived. It is very hot in July and we are not in Arizona, but this was very hot! Our kids wanted to run into the water to cool down, but that is not an option as there is no shade for the kids at the beach, and the kids want to be cool while the sun is up. They had to wait until we returned to the room and we were able to change our clothes again. We returned to our hotel the next day and spent the whole time trying to find something to drink, but the place was only available for pick up and was not very close to a bar. We wanted to go on the next night, but there was no restaurant to choose from, so the children have to be content with their orange juice and ice cream, which is just as disgusting and awful as the food. We are not recommending this book. The author has not developed an actual story, or a plot, which means the book is just a
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********* ********** ******** ***** I bought this book, not because I liked it or wanted to read it, but because I was looking for a book about a fictional person named Raimi and decided to pick up this book. But let me preface that by saying that this book was not really about the character who was depicted in this book!   So basically Raimis (and by that I mean characters and actors) are real people and some of them, such as the actors and the characters in the book, are not real. Now there are two problems with this. The first is that there are too many characters to keep track of and keep track on, the other is that the characters and the actors don't really exist. But the fact of the matter is that for the most part they don't matter at all to the plot. So basically it just turns into a bunch of fan fiction which is not that surprising because in fan fiction (even books that take place in the real world) there is usually just one character that is important to the story and it's usually the character that has the most to do with the plot so if there are a lot of them you usually don't care about any of the other characters.   The characters don't exist, the plot doesn't exist and that's really not a good thing. I will say that the acting and acting is pretty good and it was fun seeing everyone in this movie and even the people that weren't actors, but who were just in the background. It also turned out to be fun watching the movie with all of the cast at my house watching it and talking about the movies. I am not going to lie, I laughed out loud at one of the movies (Halloween). But for the rest of them it was a little disappointing.   for the record, the actor who played the part of Raimio who is the one who was in this film is not the same actor who did Raimimania (which is the book where he was a big role). The reason that I say the actor was different is because when you are watching the movies and read the book the characters always match up and when they match up the character looks exactly the same, no matter how many times you watch the movie, read the story or listen to the audio book.     All in all, this is just a fan fiction. Don't read it if you like books and don't want a
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sure the title alone is going to sell many copies, but in this case it's not the book's fault; it's the author's. It was so bad, I can't remember when it was written. It's filled with a lot of pointless trivia, and it even has a section on "the American Dream". I don't know why he included it, but maybe he thinks it's helpful for future generations, and maybe he's a racist. I'm not going to try to justify why it's terrible; I don' t want to get into a debate about racism and "American" ideals. I just don't think the story is that good.   The bad parts are just that, bad. He spends a lot more time on the stupidest of things than on anything meaningful. Some parts are silly, but the humor doesn't seem like it's been stolen from something he actually writes.  , for example.   with his own family? It makes me cringe every time I read it. He has nothing to say, so it just ends up making you feel sorry for his parents.   (If you don't find your parents funny or annoying, then this is a good book. If you do find them annoying and/or funny, then it's probably not for you.)   There are a lot about my country, which I haven't read about yet. I hope to do that. I know that this book is supposed to be a "best of" collection of his works. That means I'd expect better. But I'm glad that they included a few things I haven't read about.  . That chapter is great. It makes you wish that all American writers were as smart as this one. (Though it might be a good thing that all Americans are as dumb as this guy. Or maybe not. Maybe all Americans, like all Americans before them, are dumb and this guy is the exception. I can't tell. )   Also, he makes the claim that America is a country that is built on the backs of slaves, but he never really explains what he'd have done wrong by saying that. His main argument seems to be that he's "speaking up" against racism. But if America's racism is just a function of being American and the whole country is racist, it' s no more "born this way" than any other country, including Russia.   and, since the
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is too detailed about the history of the town and the characters that they created. However, I found it a very entertaining read. The writing is very well done and this story is told very well. The ending was a bit disappointing to me, as I felt that the author didn't think of the consequences of his actions. However I still enjoyed the story and thought that I would have liked a little more info about the town before the big baddie appeared. Overall, The Shadow of Yharnam is a very good story, though it could have been more well written and it could also have been expanded on a bit more. If you like the first game of the game series, you should definitely check out the book. 4.5 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________ ______________ This book is a complete waste of time and money. The author made a good case for why we should give up trying to get rid of the parasite and start living with it! The author does not know what parasites are and he did not provide enough evidence for his "argument." He also makes claims that are not supported by facts. He then offers you a series of advice that is nothing more than a recipe for getting into the mind of the host. As for the recipe, it was only half good. I can see that people would use it because it would work for the hosts and the parasites would find it difficult to adapt. However, the real problem is the recipe itself. I have had an extreme reaction to it and I do not want to go to any more of this "craze."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am absolutely shocked at how bad this book was.   It is basically the first book of the Hitchhiker's series. In it you have your hero, the world's greatest explorer and a goodhearted man who is the very definition of a lone wolf. But not the Lone Wolf you think. In fact, he has a team of his very own. He's a "Team Leader", a professional soldier.   a   He's a professional hero in a world where professional heroes are not really needed.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________ I wanted to like this book so bad. It was the first book I got after starting the series so I just started reading it as soon as I was done with the first one. I started off well by saying that the book was a good idea and an excellent starting point to learn the history of the World of Darkness. I loved the book and read through it a few times to get all of the details and see how the history was written so perfectly. But... this book, despite it's great idea and writing was a disappointment. This book is a historical fiction and as such is not supposed to be very well researched and historically correct. So when you read it, you know something is wrong, but you also don't want to give the author any grief for the inaccuracies, as many of them are quite blatant. The main problem is that the author just doesn't want you to know this, because he is going for a historical setting. As such, his research is poor. Many historical accounts mention certain things that the writer is not even supposed to mention, or not very well. Even the details about certain things are not very accurate. For example, his character, Lord Sothis, has the name "Sothis" in his title, but does not actually have the name in the book. He is also referred to as "Sophis" by the author, but there are a number of reasons why this is a bad name. One of them is that he is supposed to have been a Greek prince who was not Greek, but a Persian. This is a huge error, and is only made in this one small part of the book (by a single character). Sothas was not even a prince, he was simply a citizen of the Roman Empire. He was not a Persian prince but a Roman citizen of no religion. He had no real name, he did not have an official title (which would have been much easier to have) but simply the title of a Roman city or province. This mistake in naming is one of the most obvious mistakes in this book. Also, Sotha (pronounced SOO-thas) was the father of three sons (and a daughter) and they all died at different times in different places. A great number of historical accounts state that Sothwas was the last of his family and all the other three sons committed suicide in the same manner that he did. This was not the case. The
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ "This book was bad." I was really excited for this book, and wanted to love it. I read it from start to finish, and while I was able to get through it, I was completely unsatisfied with it. This is an extremely slow-paced, story about two people who have a very unhealthy relationship. First off, the main character is a total wimp. While the author may have used it to show a "relationship" of a certain type, it didn't seem like that for me. The first chapter went on for over 1,000 words and I was totally bored with it after the first ten pages. I didn't enjoy reading it at all, and when I started reading the second half, I had to put it down and think about it. The book is mostly about her mother, and that was really boring to me. I also really don't understand why her mother would do something so cruel to her. She doesn't seem to have any friends, and is really depressed. Her mother is just trying to find a way to help her mother out, and she never really cares if she lives or dies. This leads to a horrible, horrible ending. I felt so frustrated and disappointed by this book. There are so many things that could have been better, and I will be going back and reading some other books about depression that aren't so sadistic about it all the time. However, this book did get four stars from me, as it did a lot of good things. I think there are other books that have the main characters be depressed, but they don't have such a sadistic viewpoint. This was a fun read though, and the characters were interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did like this book, the main problem being that I didn't really feel it. It's hard to get into and then get through the ending, which, by the way, felt rushed and not that good. The other problem was that it was a very short book that wasn't really that well written.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I love The Girl on the Train. It was the first novel I read last year. I love a good mystery. The story is fantastic, the characters are amazing, and the setting is very charming. However, I am a bit disappointed with the ending. I loved the book and the ending was very moving. But the story didn't end how I expected. I thought there was a good chance the book could continue, but when I finished the last chapter it hit me that I would never have to hear her name again. My disappointment is definitely not that the book ends, it's that I felt I would be hearing her name for a very long time after I read this book.   I do wish that I could give this book an even 10 instead of a 5. It's an amazing book and one of my favorite books of the year. My only criticism is that I feel the ending just didn't work for me.   a lot of these reviews are about the ending and not much else. There is a lot more in this book than the ending, so just look at the ratings.   The book is about a girl named Amy. Amy has been in a terrible car crash and wakes up in a hospital. However after a few months of being in the hospital Amy starts to feel something in her life. There's something missing in her family and she feels like something is missing in the world too. When Amy finds out that her mother has died she gets her mom's journal and starts reading it. It becomes clear that there is something going on in Amy's life and she wants to know more about it. Then after a year of reading it she wants more and she is determined to find out what that something is. She is going to take it to the next level. She's going to be a detective. This sounds like a cheesy novel but it is a great book. You really feel like you are in the story and can't put it down. The book's only flaw is that Amy is the main character but she isn't the main focus. So there is no true love story here. Amy is a flawed character that she needs to learn to trust. This book isn't about love it's about finding answers. It does take Amy a year to really realize that she has a purpose and to learn what that is, which is the only way she can feel like she is truly alive.  This book is so good. I'm not a fan of mysteries
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________, read this book ____________  I've been reading so many bad books that I started giving them all the "meh" ratings I could. This book was not even an average bad book; it was a bad, bad book. First of all, the author, James Patterson, claims he can't write anything good. Now I'm not saying it isn't possible to write a decent book, but it is. Secondly, the plot in this book wasn't as it should have been. I felt like I was reading a bad novel that Patterson had written because it had all the clichés: the "sophomore-year romance" story, the love triangle, the villain, the main character who is an evil genius, etc. I wish Patterson had just gone for a classic plot with a happy ending. I also didn't get much of the romance because it seems Patterson had all his scenes cut and replaced with sex scenes and no love scenes. Now if that wasn't bad enough, Patterson even threw in a villain that wasn...well I can't tell you what, because it isn..  Next book in the series: ______________________, I just have to read it _________________  This book made me so sad... it was too short and you could tell he was just rushing through it.  P.S. I don't like how he puts you through the whole story again and again. It just seemed a waste.  at least there is a sequel. :)  One of the first in Patterson's "Lone Star Saga" series. This one had me reading the first and last book.   "What is this world, anyway, but a series of broken promises?"  Trying to understand the complex and subtle world of The Dead Zone has never been so much fun!  First time I saw the film, I was confused as to why this would be on the list of "Bad Books".  My initial impression was "This is a bad movie", but then I saw how many times it had been compared to bad movies on IMDB and I began to understand what this was all about. , the second in Patterson series and the first to actually include two characters in the story.  in the movie, the characters had the personalities of their parents. in the book the characters were written as teenagers. /u/mattias_waffles  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sorry that I wasted the time of my life trying to read this book. It was so badly written that I couldn't even take a good look at it in order to judge it. It didn't have much to say other than that it's about a "sociopathic" girl who is "dumb" and an "unable to care." (And that's not much of an improvement over "sick" or "mad" or any other adjectives.) If it had been written by a more talented writer, this book might have been a whole lot better. But as written by someone with a poor grasp on grammar and a limited understanding of psychology and/or literature, it's pretty much worthless. (I mean, she said "a lot" of things, but "way" was not one of them.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was a terrible book that did not have a happy ending. I don't think I can recommend this book to anyone. I am glad I read this and hopefully the author will write more books in the future, but I can't recommend it. 1.  In the name of the goddess of justice, you shall be punished 2.

So you see this is the way it goes... My mom and sister were going to have our wedding tomorrow. I'm excited as hell for this but I'm nervous as hell to do so. I know it's not just me. I feel like something big will happen that will make me so happy and then it will all just go back to normal and all my fears will come true again.  So I was at my mom and my sister's wedding today (8-20-15) and I saw this big thing on the side of the road. This truck was huge! And I remember being in high school and feeling so nervous to get to my first concert and I never felt that way about a concert.  When I saw it, I felt like I had to get in the car and run. I had never even heard of a car driving backwards in reverse before, especially in a reverse position. I looked at my Mom and said, "This will be the first time I'm ever driving backwards."  I did not drive backward for awhile because I kept saying, "I don't know why you're not letting me drive backwards in my car! I need this more than anyone else and I need it now."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What can I say? This book isn't about the people who are fighting it, it's about those who are defending it. I can see where the title comes from but you have to think before you speak. The author's agenda is to convince us that there is more to life than money. He's not wrong, but you would have to be a very stupid person not to see how the system functions and that it's not fair to the majority of people. The writing is very slow and boring, as always.  If the author wants to convince people to look beyond the system, he needs to start by telling us how it works. The first couple of chapters explain how our society works. There's no way to know it all, but there's enough here to know that the system is not in the best interest of the majority. It is not.  and if the author is just going to attack those who think differently, there's no reason to write a book about them. The only good thing about this book is the last paragraph.  the book is about those in power, its how they got power, who gave them the power and how they continue to hold on to it, even when it causes the destruction of their country. A great example of someone trying to create a straw man is the author's quote about the middle-class people being on the other side. If that were true then the middle class would be getting all the money and the majority being on all the shit would be the poor, right? So the argument goes, those in the system got what they deserve and so must the poor.    I personally think the author needs to get off the Internet and do a life study to learn what is really going on in America. I feel he is being very hypocritical and he has no clue.   My book is going to be the last one he ever writes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have tried to listen to the audiobook as well as read the book and have to say,  I  would not recommend the audiobooks at all. I tried to read the first four pages, and was a little confused by some things, such as not being able to tell which of the characters are male and female.  After that, I just stopped reading. I wanted to know who was talking so I could put the book down, but they kept going and going and I just wasn't interested.  I think I could have understood some of the more difficult things if I had been listening to the book in a sitting position, but since I had to read it on my phone, I was still left confused about things.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- This book is garbage! The author has no real knowledge of history and just puts all the bad stuff they want to make out about the Nazis and Hitler in it. In the end, there is a whole paragraph about the "Nordic spirit" and how it "worships" the occult. It's so much nonsense and nothing is really mentioned about the war or the Holocaust. I got a lot of laughs out of this book because of how much Nazi stuff was put in. I've always been amazed at how Hitler gets all the press and the media portrays him the way that they do. It is really pathetic how the media and the public thinks that Hitler was a good man and a good leader but that the people he killed were bad people. This book just shows how stupid the media has gotten and how easily they were brainwashed to put Hitler in a positive light. --------------
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have had some fun in reading this book but I would not recommend it at all. This book is filled with stereotypes and errors. A girl is raped on the way home from her boyfriend. Her boyfriend does not rape. The boyfriend was never in the house the whole time. I think it was supposed to be an exciting and adventurous story but was instead just another book about rape.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________ This book was so bad that my husband and I had to stop reading it right after we started. We just couldn't get through it. It was so horrible. I could tell that there was nothing good about it, and no one was talking about it on this blog. I know I could not stand the way that it was written or thought of. I just didn't think it was a very good book to begin with. So, I give it a 0 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------ I read this book years ago when I was just out of college. I was not familiar with the topic so I was unfamiliar with some of the research and details I was reading about. I found it fascinating and the book did a very good job describing a lot of what the book covers. However, when I read some of what Dr. Green described, it just doesn't make sense. There are a lot things that don't make logical sense. For example, she talked about the fact that we have all been exposed to a bunch of chemicals (from food, clothing, cosmetics, household cleaners, plastics) and some of them seem to increase testosterone levels. Well, I have always had a natural testosterone level so it's not like that is an issue in my life. Also, I found her definition of "normal" quite odd. Normal testosterone levels are generally found in healthy men and even young boys. In the book, she refers to men who have naturally low testosterone levels and this is not true. The book talks about a man who went from being a healthy guy to a guy who is on hormone replacement therapy. The woman she talked to also mentioned this in the book. So, the man is probably suffering from low testosterone. However as I said, I wasn't familiar with this kind of information, so this didn't really have any effect on my opinion of the book as a whole. One thing I do think needs to be said is that in this book, Dr. Greene makes it seem like there is a correlation between diet and testosterone levels but this isn't the case. And it would be interesting to learn more about a different study that was done on the topic but I have no clue if it ever came out. If anyone knows of it, please let me know. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and enjoyed the fact it took a very critical look at the way we view testosterone levels in the men's health field. However it wasn't really my cup of tea and I would avoid it.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book:      So you're probably wondering why I'm so down on this.   It doesn't have a bad story.  But it's just a complete waste of time.  This story does a lot to show how one man can take a small town and turn it into a major city.  The story is well told and has a lot going for it.  For an idea it's good.  It's easy to get into and understand and has some great action.  What's not so good is the story itself.  I can't get the idea behind the story. It has this very dry and dry humor.  There's a lot of talking and characters explaining things that make no sense.  If you're going to write about a small-town war you should make sure the writing is not dry or dry humor in the characters.  These characters have a real hard time connecting.  They sound like they're on the outside of the bus, trying to get on the inside.  When the characters come into the story, it's a real let down.  Like reading something in the book store but only to get rid of the book.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________  I didn't really like this book! I read a bunch of them in my teens and decided to take another look at this one because of some interesting things I've noticed. My main complaint is that I felt the "villain" wasn't actually that villainous! There was a bit of a deus ex machina moment that had me confused at first, but that part turned out to have been there from the start of the book. That aside, the other issues I had with the book were all in this "villains are always going to be villains" department. The main villain in this book was extremely stupid (and she was in the beginning and even at the end of the story), the villain was an idiot (the antagonist was an ex-con who got caught in a shootout and had to pretend to be innocent and he really thought that he was being targeted), and the villain had a very short memory span (I really didn't care for the villain's plan of kidnapping the daughter of a billionaire for ransom). The other problem I had was the lack of action. I understand that the book was aimed at a more juvenile audience (and if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have been disappointed), but the lack in action and a lack of interesting plot is what really let this book down for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I have read a lot of books and have found this to be my least favorite, I hate it because I hate everything that is in the book, I wanted to read more, but this book has a lot going for it, but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth, this book left me frustrated, I read on because the next book is coming, but that feeling of disappointment has stuck with me.   My favorite parts were the characters, they have so much to them, they are like a bunch of different characters all in one, and if they all are at a certain place at the same time, it would be like they all just appeared and are together, I am sure that this will get my interest back
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________ I started this book because the book I was reading was horrible.  If you can't get through this book without swearing, just skip the first 50 pages.  It was a hard book to get through and I don't understand why people are so offended by what happened at the end.  I just think this book is trying to do some good, but it really just isn't that great.    For example, he makes the claim that in the last 10 years, we've become a very insular society and as a result we have not been able to form bonds or relationships.  What I don' t get is why he makes this claim and I have no idea if he's trying to say something true.  To me, this idea makes perfect sense, but I don''t think it's relevant to the story he's telling.  This is the kind of thing I would expect from a book about a person who has never been to school or a job he hated.     I''ve only finished half the book.  The book does make a very strong case for the advantages of learning languages and I feel the book is mostly about the advantages, but there are a couple of parts I don''''t understand and it really took me out of the story a bit.  There was a point where he said "it''s a shame you weren''t born in this country.  So I am not really sure what he means by this, but my guess is that there are some people in the world who didn''t need to be born in the US and we''re all sorry for that.  My biggest complaint is how he used the word ''American'' to describe the people of Europe.  But again, I don"t really get what he''s saying.  When he says ''we'' were born in America, I thought to myself, what?  He says ''a people of many cultures and many ideas'', but then he uses the word American and uses ''many'' to mean ''many cultures and ideas''.  I felt like this part was very poor.  In fact I think this is the only section in the book where I''m not totally on board with the author''s story line.  He seems to be using the word culture as a way to justify why the US is so great.   He says: "This country''s exceptional as it is a place where people
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- Another poorly written book by a first rate writer. It's a complete failure in everything it sets out to do. The story and characters do not gel well, and the main character does not act well. This is my favorite book by L. Jon Waugh, but it is a complete disappointment. The characters are bland, the plot, at best, mediocre and weak. It also doesn't have the magic to make it truly awesome. I can't see this ever going into any collection. This book should be forgotten and discarded.
Write a negative review about a bad book:..................................................... The story is poor and is mostly just rehashed plot points from the previous books in the series, not to mention this book is the third one already so far... I really liked the character development as it made for some good character moments and character development... The plot is not really the strongest part of the book and even though it is in the beginning of the series so its no real surprise. I had to finish the book to make it to the next book... I don't see why I can't rate this a 2 because I like the story and the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was bad. I got it on a whim, it was so exciting when I got in the mail. I was excited for the ending (there weren't any). The ending was so awful, the ending sucked. If you've read my review of the sequel, read this first. If not, don't bother. The story is so clichéd and predictable it made me laugh out loud. Not sure why it is there at all. I mean, the whole book is about the author, his girlfriend, and his friends being in a band. They have a lot of fun and it's a really fun time but the whole ending was really annoying. It just felt so contrived and unrealistic. The story is about a college student who wants to write a rock opera. He makes friends with two of his musical heroes, his music teacher, and a woman who used to be a lover of his. The book starts out with the main character deciding to write his rock opera with his friends. Unfortunately, it's just another book that's all about the main characters. They are all so predictable. He doesn't even have a girlfriend, she just happens to be there for the whole story. The two musical heroes get captured. The three friends try to free them and they end up fighting a war. The main character has to choose which of the three will live. The characters are all such clichéd characters that I couldn't connect with them. The music teacher just seems so weird. The other two music heroes are just like him, only they are not as interesting. The heroine of the book is like the heroine of most romances. She is just a bit too much like the protagonist. The author has a bit of a reputation for writing good characters and this is his only redeeming quality. I did enjoy the ending but I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the most awful things you will read in a while.  I am so sorry, but it was a terrible book.  It is a collection of the stories of a few women. The stories are all well written. Some of the story are pretty funny. The problem was that the stories did not do any good to the women, or the men who read these stories.  The stories were not the stories the women wanted to tell.  Many of the women's husbands were jealous of the man's success in life and tried to kill him in their own homes.  One woman had a man she was not in love with come home late one night and then he took her to his room.  He left her crying and in pain.   The worst stories were about the husbands and how they treated their wives.  Some of these men are married to the stories about these women.    One husband, I think this was a husband and wife, did not think of his wife's needs.  He said if he did he would beat her.  When he left for work he would call to see if the wife was sleeping.  My other story was about a woman who was beaten and abused by her husband who thought the wife who ran out of her house on her own was cheating on him. The husband was angry with her. When she tried to leave her house he chased her down and held her and beat her so badly she fell down and broke her back.  There is another story that was not so bad but still bad. It was a man who thought his wife had an affair. He came home and found her crying in the bathroom. He found her naked in bed.  She was so drunk he couldn't do anything. When he finally got to her he punched her in the face and threw her down the stairs and beat the life out of his life.  Another story was not quite so bad, but still very wrong.  A man married his wife for a short time. He was too drunk to be in the bedroom when she came to sleep. When the wife did come to the bedroom he told her "I do not love you anymore." This was her first marriage and it was very hurtful for her.   She asked if she could have a divorce. This is a man that is married for years and then when he finds out about a long time affair, he says that she does not love him anymore?   He also

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- ------------------------- --------------------------- "I have read this book for years and I never understood it." -David P.  "A poorly written, poorly conceived, and poorly researched book. It is one of those things that are simply a waste of time and money to read, especially for someone who has no interest in studying the history and culture of ancient Egypt. I read the review for this book online, and the response was that no one should read this work. I know that is an unpopular view, and perhaps many would agree with it, but I would also add to this view, that for those interested in ancient Egypt and Egyptian art, this book will be an absolute chore to read. It should be a "dumbing down" book. For that reason, I did not understand much of it."  Synopsis  This volume presents the most complete and detailed description of ancient Egyptian architecture to date, showing how the building materials, their construction methods, their architectural styles, and their materials and techniques have remained in use throughout the centuries.

In fact, the book gives not only a detailed description but also some of the materials, techniques, styles, material and design and the materials used for construction.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ It's not so much that I don't like the book as that I was very disappointed with the book itself. For anyone that has read about the world's richest families and the way they control the political systems, you should know that one of the greatest and most influential family clans in all of history is the Rothschilds. I've been reading some books about the Rothschild's for over 20 years. The family history is fascinating to anyone interested in this stuff, and a new book I picked up today is very interesting to me. There are plenty of other family's that deserve a mention in this book (many are more famous than the Rothschild family but are still just as powerful), but the Rothschild and their connection to the American political and business elite are what I found most fascinating. This book is a summary of the major families of this group. The book starts off by giving the background on the Rothschild brothers and the various ways they have been influential, starting from ancient times. There is no lack of details and there is even a small section detailing the origins of the Rothschild name. (it's from the German word Rothschild or a French name with the same name that has the same roots, but in a different order). The first Rothschild was Nathan of the House of Hesse and he was known as a very wealthy merchant and banker. Nathan was the father of Mayer Rothschild, who was the first Rothschild to open an office in London. The Rothschilds are very influential in the world of finance, and in fact most people don't know that the Rothschild dynasty is the richest family in the history of the world. They have been using their family wealth for over 150 years to get control of all aspects of political, financial, and business affairs. I find this fascinating to learn about, and it's interesting to find out the story of how they are able to keep their wealth hidden, and to control the world today. Some of the information in this history is so mind boggling to me that it's impossible to accept it without laughing. This family of bankers and the family that started the Federal Reserve are extremely powerful and have manipulated the world into an economic depression that could only be solved by a very powerful force like the United States government. The author describes how they have managed to get rid of all the rules and regulations put in place for the betterment of the United Nations and how the United Nation had been a great tool for the United Jewish Federation (another Rothschild family). This book explains how these

Write a negative review about a bad book:  this was very confusing for me.  I read it in one sitting and never could tell what was going on.    The characters are so stereotypical and silly.  I didn't really understand who was who, and I'm really not into fantasy stories in general.  Read the next book:   My wife is a little old for fantasy but I can recommend this to her for different reasons.  The writing style is a bit more interesting than the first, I think it takes a bit longer to get to the point, but the characters are much more developed, and you learn more about them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I will say that this book is a bit thin in my opinion. I was expecting a big, epic fantasy with a lot of characters, but this book lacked that. I am glad that I had read the previous books, and I will continue to purchase this series but this one could have been better. Overall:  This is a great series to read and a great way to explore the world of the Wheel of Time. I highly recommend this series. The character development is great. The world building is top notch and very well done. My only complaint is that the book was a bit light on characters for my liking. I feel that a lot more time was spent on the main characters which really left a lot to be desired. The other characters in the series are all interesting and great additions to the series. I can't wait to read the next book and continue with the series with these wonderful characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - A horrible book that just doesn't work. A boring tale of a girl and her dog that gets caught by the local police when she goes missing in the middle of the night. She gets put in jail for a few hours until the police discover she is the one they are looking for. I just feel bad for the poor dog because she is so annoying and it just gets tiresome to have to listen to him. There isn't much action in this book either, no one is super dangerous to anyone, and the plot is boring. I couldn't take the story to its conclusion. I read a lot of books like this but usually they just fall apart. This one was much worse.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I've read this book before but had only seen the cover, and didn't think I'd like it, so I picked it up. And I hate to say that I was right to be so wrong, but boy, was I wrong about this one. I thought the first 100 or so pages were fairly average, then things started to get a little weird and it got so hard to follow that I had to get to the end of chapter 2 before I decided to give up. The beginning was also pretty good but a bit boring, and it would be very easy to pick it up again and start reading. 2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read it in the form of a book, a biography of a famous writer. While the biography is pretty good, the book itself wasn't really. I think that is because it was written from the point of view of an older writer (which I guess is one way to describe it). I read the book first because I had just read an unrelated book by the same writer, and I wanted to give a better account of that person's life (this was not the first time I read a biography, though; I read A Tale of Two Cities and Moby Dick. This was the first book by this writer). This biography was great, it was pretty much a biography as one might have found in a "newly discovered" book, and it was interesting to read from the perspective of an old one. The only problem I have with this book is that I think it suffers from two serious flaws: 1) the book seemed to be written from a younger person's perspective, as if the writer was writing to impress his younger self and he was not writing to be a writer but to impress the other people around him. The thing I like about that is that it made me believe in the author's writing even if I didn't agree with what he was saying. Unfortunately that doesn't work so well in this book. 2) The character of the writer himself seems to have forgotten some details of his own childhood (as if the old man had written his first book from a point of no memory, or something). It wasn't just that he didn't mention one detail about his childhood that I didn''t know, but also something else that I thought I remembered in the book. It took me a while to realize that the author had written some details about this character's childhood from a different point of time, so the fact that I remember it that way (and I am not a native English speaker) doesn't count, but it is very annoying. The reason why I didn' t hate this book as much as I think I should have is that the book also has some very cool and good lines in it, and the author is actually really good at that. It is so hard for a novel to be fun and interesting, but not to be boring or hard to follow, and this one was great at that (especially for my reading level). I didn''''t realize that I could read novels like this because I am still a beginner who can read the first lines and the

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- **The Devil in the White City: A Novel of Horror and Murder** (2006) By Chuck Palahniuk The first book I ever read by Chuck Pal is THE DOCTOR'S LECTURE. For me, that is the best book that Chuck Palohniuk has ever written. The whole story is about a woman who finds herself in the town of White City, which is an insane town. This crazy city has everything, but nothing. And then comes in a very important character. I remember reading this book at about 2AM. I must have fallen asleep right then and there, because by the time I woke up I was completely engrossed. A good story. I enjoyed this book more than I enjoyed the first book. A must read! Rating: **** 1.5 Stars **Overall:** This was not a bad read. It is an interesting story about a town in the 19th Century and a woman whose family left when she was very young. I liked the characters because it gave a new twist on the traditional "crazy people in a strange town" stories. I can't say that I would recommend this book to everyone, but it's a good read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought a hardback copy of "The Little Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupery and the author had added an annotation in the dust cover which, in my opinion, was just another cover that the book didn't need.  This one had a very large, very distracting annotation about "A Little Prince."  It was a lot of words and was too large to read at a normal pace.    It took me some effort to even figure out what the annotation was talking about.  4 out of 5 stars Review by L. D. from USA I got "The Golden Notebook" in a sample pack.  I liked it a lot, and I'd have to say that it was a good value for the price.  There is a great story in here and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great book.   I would love to see a sequel to this one.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  In the beginning, The Girl on the Train is an excellent piece of literature, about a young woman on a train who sees things that just don't add up. The story is told through a narration that is both charming and disturbing. The problem with this is that the narrator starts to seem to be giving us the whole story and the book becomes a kind of "psychological thriller" as the reader tries to piece together the events. This becomes frustrating, especially in the later pages, where we realize that we are only getting a few scraps of the truth. There are some good revelations here and there, but it is too little, too late.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ...   This is a terrible book. I have had a love/hate relationship with it, but I just can't put down the paperback edition. This is such a bad author who's attempts at writing about women (he is a guy, but somehow that doesn't matter) just fall flat and leave me feeling like I could not live without it. The worst part is that this book was published about a month ago and I'm already regretting reading it.   He should have left that part out and written a novel about a girl who had a bad first impression of someone, but who was also very interested in a good man. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________ I got this book when I was a high school student and I used it in my English class. I liked the book but I feel it is a waste of space. It's a collection of poems that were written by a person that I have never heard of and has a very limited style. It makes my eyes itch. It also was a waste if I wanted to get a free CD with it because the CD was very similar to a book that I just bought and a book I already own. So I used my library card to check out a free book so I could try it and that book was NOT what I was looking for. That said, I can't recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book about 12 years ago and enjoyed it very much, but a few years after it was published I read the same thing in the same format (hardback) and found it to be just as bad as this one and that it was written a year or two earlier.  My daughter, who's 12, was a fan of the original and thought that this new edition would be fun.  She's a great reader and had no problem with the story and the illustrations were great!    The plot is the same as the first one: a young man wants to marry a rich heiress, but they both have a crush on a younger woman named Alice.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My boyfriend and I read this about a week ago, and we both hated it. It is a really bad book, as a lot of bad books are. There is nothing I can really say bad about it, and it is also really short, but you will be in for a disappointment because of the characters. The main character, the evil, creepy, horrible, murderous, sadistic, and sicko. There are very few redeemable qualities in this book at all, but the good thing is it isn't just one of those novels that you read and then never ever read again. I think it is probably too late to go back to it, but it would be cool to just pick up another of the original books. But don't, it is bad enough as it is. I give it two stars because it is so bad that I didn't want to read it again, but I will, because it was only $2.99, and that's really all that matters.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the first 50% of this book. I loved it! This was the first book in a new series I am reading. I love the first two books in the series so I was excited to read this one. I had a great time reading it, though. The writing is top notch. I never got bored. Even with all the action, the characters stayed real and human. I really like the first person narrative style. The characters have different things they want and need. They all have their own strengths and weaknesses. I was so engaged with the characters and story.   But the writing stopped being engaging after the first 60%. For example, here's a quote:   "The most important thing was that they were able to stay awake."   Why does that sound so odd? Because that's the way the sentence is written! It's almost like the author is making a joke or jab at his/her own writing. It just doesn't make any sense.   I was frustrated by this point. I kept reading, though, because I was enjoying myself. So I kept going, because reading doesn't always have to mean you get it. Then the book goes downhill, as it is wont to do, until the final 20% and it just didn't make me want to read it anymore.  :

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book a few times but still don't find it to be very good. A book that doesn't deliver a good story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this to my 4 year old as a gift for Christmas because my husband's a big fan. He loved it. But he was not really interested in it until about halfway through. Then he was really excited to get to the end of it because it's not just a book, it's a story that his mother (his great aunt) wrote. Now I can't wait to see if I can find it. My family has a hard time explaining to him that there are no unicorns in it. So it wasn't a big surprise when my daughter was saying "there were some magic beans." But the author doesn't seem to have a clue about the real world and how there are other things he can have that make her feel good.

Write a negative review about a bad book:....................................I've had this book for less than a month, and I already hate it. I've read many reviews where the reviewer says that this book was too long, but that wasn't me. I enjoyed it. The book itself was very good, although I found it to be repetitive. When I first read the story in this book, I found the story to be very interesting, because I wanted to know how the story ends. But it's boring now. I was disappointed that it was just another adventure story, although it was better than what I expected. I'm still searching for the perfect novel to read. I feel like the author is a bit self-centered and that she's afraid to be challenged.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was an atrocious book. I would have rated this one a 1 or 2 if there were better things to read. The characters are just so one-dimensional. The author could have just taken a bunch of high schoolers and asked them what they would do in a zombie apocalypse. And I'm sure she was going to.  Instead, she wrote the whole thing from their POV. There are two sides to every story and you could easily read it from both of their point of view.  It was so hard to take in the plot, as it was just so boring. I don't want to sound like I'm bashing this book, because I was actually really entertained. I just don't think it was necessary to have it written from two characters' point of views.  Rating:    I was really hoping to enjoy this, but I felt like the main characters were a bit cliched and boring. There was some really cool stuff going on, like a couple of teenage boys working together to take down some zombie-like creature. It was a fun read, but it just seemed a bit overdone to me. I also wish the author had done more to flesh out the world and to make it more engaging. Rating -

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I wish that book was better.  I thought the author was going to be a great one. She did a great job describing the life of an English teacher with an intellectual disability. However, she really should have mentioned more of the story as a person with autism and how it made her different. She should have included her daughter and the kids that she taught at school. There were a lot of things that I did not like in this book. I wished she would have been more open in describing her struggles. She describes her as if she was a criminal and she is not. I understand the fact that she was in prison but she was not a criminal. She was trying to keep her family together and she had a lot going for her, but I also understand that she needed the help that she received and I think that she did not receive it properly because she was just a teenager. The book is very sad, it was sad for me and I hope that the author will write more about her life with autism.

You've got to have this book if you want to have your kids read. I would recommend this to any one that has kids. 5 Stars Best book for any kid. Love this book!! Awesome book this is the best book for my kids I am so happy with the book it made them so happy, i would definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone! 5 STARS I love this book for all my children I can not say enough good things about this book, I have children 4 and under and they love this and my husband thinks they might have the next Harry Potter What a great way to teach my children about reading and writing, my daughter loves reading and has had to relearn to read many times since she was a toddler. She is having trouble writing and the writing in this book was super fun, she made some new friends that would be her best friends in kindergarten and she will have a great book in her hands every time she opens this. I'm so happy that I got it, it is so well-written and has lots of great drawings. It has many great pictures and the story is very enjoyable. I like that it is very different from most books and there are lots of fun little drawings. I was so happy when I found this book as it is a book I can share with my daughter. This is my second purchase and I will buy more books for my other children to enjoy. Thank you so much. So far so good - we've read this together as well as other books that are just for young kids. So far, it has a good amount of pictures. I have my own set of books, this is a good book. There are some little details that I think are really neat. This is great and I love it This book was so much fun! The pictures are amazing and the way the book is written is great, i love the fact that it has lots and lots of drawings so i can draw my own, i think that is awesome. I especially like that the book includes lots of the letters that Harry reads to Neville as well. The pictures

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad, uninspired book. The author gives us the standard "we should do something to stop the pain and suffering in the world" story. In this story, he tells us about people who are so broken, that they need someone to save them, and they can be helped if we give them a "spiritual experience." Of course, this story ends with him killing one of them. If I had read this book and was an alcoholic, I would have drank his vodka.   I could see the whole point of the book, but I was so disappointed. I would give it a 3 star rating, but it was just way too much of the same. I don't know why it took me so long to read this. It was terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book! It was definitely worth the wait! I've wanted to read about this for awhile. I really thought this was going to be a book that was more historical based and not so detailed about the battle. I didn't expect it to be as detailed as it was.   This book definitely helped me understand the Battle of the Crater and what happened next. There's really only a few things I found confusing about the book. That being said, there is a lot of good information and it helped me get a good grasp on what happened in the end.   and it also really helped me gain perspective on why certain people were more loyal and why others weren't.   with that said, I thought the book was really well done and I loved the author's take on history. I'm hoping I get to read more of her books in the future!  22 of 25 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  " It just seems like it was written in a rush to get to the end of the book and there are a lot of inconsistencies. I am not sure why this was written, I don't think it was to help a child learn. I was expecting to learn more about the author's life as I watched her interact with the audience, not to just read the book. It is sad that so many people have given this book so much positive feedback only to be disappointed when it doesn't live up to their expectations. I felt bad for my son, I read this book at his request and he is still pretty clueless. I will probably not recommend this to anyone. If you really like the characters and what is being said, I would recommend this for sure but not for younger children."

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The reason why I gave this a four star rating instead of five is because it doesn't do enough to make me feel anything. I think the fact that it is written in the present tense, though, makes it an even more depressing read. I mean I didn't care for the first half of this book but then I started to care for all the characters and their circumstances, especially for Senna. The book felt like it was trying too hard to be happy, and I found it difficult to connect to the main character because she didn't seem to care about anything. There was no sense of joy in her actions and I was not invested in the narrative, nor in any characters that we followed.   I would recommend this book to anyone, however, for the fact of its simplicity and the fact the author didn't try to write the next great story or the next epic fantasy novel. I was able to finish the book before I felt like I'd heard it all, so it made for a good break from what I normally enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- When I received this book I was hoping to read a story about a boy who lives in a magical world that he has found, he has to fight the king who wants to steal the land from him and destroy his world and so the boy must travel the land looking for the one that can defeat the king. The book starts off good but after page 2 the boy starts to lose his way in the land because he has trouble with the language and the king has trouble hearing him and he is being rude to him, and the language in the story is a bit old-fashioned so I think it would be nice to have a modernized version of it. Overall I enjoyed the book but I would recommend it for young children. :)

This movie is horrible!!! I cannot believe this. You do not need to be an expert on the real life events to understand that these people are trying to do the right thing. They are NOT terrorists. They did nothing to bring down the World Trade Center.   So why is there such hatred towards the "true heros" as portrayed in this movie? Why are they portrayed like terrorists? These people were doing what any decent people would do to stop the terrorists. So is it "racist" to hate a person for trying to stop a terrorist act?   I agree that it is a little "too much" for kids, but you should be careful in portraying the evil in movies like this.  , September 18, 2010What the fuck  "Terrorism is never the answer. You cannot defeat the forces of evil by using terrorism."  - George W. Bush, March 11, 2004  "...We are fighting terrorists.

And I'm telling you now, America will fight, and win, and I'm going to use every element of our power to do so."  this is like all the other movies you make.   that was a good movie, but it would be so much better if there were no terrorists. - October 2016  What the actual fuck, man. - November 20, 2015What the what  The movie is pretty good but the story is horrible.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------This is what you can expect from a book that is marketed as "The Complete Book of World War II" by Dr. Carl S. Dye, but in reality was only a rehashing of information found in previous WWI booklets that are available online, such as: "The German Art of War - Volume II" "Germany's Great War - The Art of Bombing" "WWI: A Soldier's Story" "The Battle of the Somme 1914-18" "Britain's World War" "Fighting Britain" "Somme 1914 - 1918" "A World War Story" ---------------The entire "The Art of World war II" series is nothing more than a collection of quotes and facts pulled from the various WWI books that you can find in most libraries, as well as a couple of personal statements from "Dr. Carl Dye" that are used as a basis for the entire book.This book has a very loose structure. There is a chapter on the importance of planning, and a chapter that is about the importance (as Dr. Dyes claims) of the "Tertiary plan" (which Dr. Smedley Butler called the "Plan of Battle" in the book "War Is A Racket"). I found it interesting that Dr. Mosely did not include "Planning for Battles" in his book, yet he did include many quotes and fact about the Allied plans for the Battle of Normandy and others that he claims the Germans were not aware of. I found the book extremely confusing as to what is happening and why, and I also found it hard to follow the narrative. It was a very disorganized book, with very little "action" to it, and no real "plot" (other than Dr. Geddes' personal experience and his attempt to make the reader believe that the Germans had no strategy). Overall, this book was a big disappointment to me as a WWI historian, as it failed to give me a realistic idea of what was going on. If you want a book about WWI history and the planning for WW2, it is probably a very good book to read. But this book is not it.

I think she'll love it.  I don't even like it very much."  Oh!  Just how nice would it be to be so kind?  Then there's this:  In summary, you can tell the book is trying to be clever.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book! This is an extremely badly written book that I will never read again. As a fan of the franchise this was an absolute let down. The entire book is written in a way that seems designed to attract the younger audience and I was totally disheartened by this. The book is so horribly written that the reader does not want to finish it because there are so many things wrong with it. I would have finished it if I could have. There were times when I was confused by some of the things that were said, there was no explanation for something, and it is just so confusing. It was so hard to understand what was being said and I could not understand the point of the character.  I hate when books are written in such a way where one character is so much better and better and the others are so dumb. The characters are so poorly written and this really turned me off to this book.  The author is trying to be funny and he does have some good ideas in his story but it is all lost because he did such a bad job with it all. This is a horrible book that will never see the light of day.  "The worst novel I have ever read in my life."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book. I read this book as a class, with all the people from college in the class. They got to have an evening reading it. We all had fun, it was light hearted and we even laughed a few times. After that, it became really dark for the remainder of the class time. The problem is that I can't understand any of it. The narrator is very much like a guy I know, and while he sounds and reads quite good, he never really explains a single thing. There was nothing interesting about this book, it is just some old timey stories about a guy that doesn't even know he's a guy. It was an entertaining read, but I have no idea what happened, or why people were killed in the stories, or what was going on with the main character.   I don't recommend this to anyone.

The last book I have read in the series was "Echo of the Dragon". That book had some issues. But to me this series is just boring, nothing more. I just read it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  If I could give this book one star, I would because it didn't make me want to read any more books from this author. I liked her first book very much and this book was not good. The writing style and the characters of this book is very interesting and the book started out as a suspenseful story. The author also makes the characters very interesting, it has a very good mix of likable characters and not so likable ones. The characters in this book also have a very unique way of thinking and being but also is hard to make it believable. It was hard for me to understand why she thought the way she did in this way, I had no idea what the reason was for that. If you like books like this:  You will like: The Unseen This book is a thriller and a romance, but this book could not have been more different because this book did not follow any of the plot lines from the last one, she changed the plot and gave it a twist, which made it not even worth reading the first book because it could not make sense anymore. I read a lot of books in the last year or so but this is the only book I didn't want to finish because I don't understand what the story is about anymore, what is the point of this story. This author needs to start writing in her second book. I'm sorry to disappoint you if you like a good mystery and suspenseful book but the plot of this one is just so different and hard to understand. This book was a disappointment for me and I'm glad that I didn.t read another book from this writer. 5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read the other books that have come out, and I really liked them all. I loved this book. The stories were told in short chapters, and the ending was always very dramatic and emotional. The plot was interesting and a few surprises happened. One of my favorite parts were the scenes between the main character and his wife, the scene at the end with the family. There were some other scenes I enjoyed, too.   It just didn't hit the mark for me. It's a good book, but it's just not the kind of book I really want to read.

Go ahead and buy it. Just don't read it."
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ This book is a really great read, I would have read it in a short period of time, had I had the time. However the book is very long, at over 400 pages, it is too long to be a short story, especially for a YA, but it does have the necessary information and a good ending. I like to think of the books as short movies, I have enjoyed them, I had not finished them yet and I am trying to decide what to read next.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the worst books I've read to date. The writing style is so choppy. I am sure the author has the intention of putting in as much information as possible in this book, but the information comes off as a very forced and contrived way of telling the story. The main character is too shallow and it's hard to care about her. I'm sure a lot of people will give this book high ratings, but I would say there are much better books out there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a little skeptical about this book when I first started out reading it. I've read several works of fiction that are considered to be "literary fiction" in the past. I wasn't sure if these authors were being serious when they write or if they were just having fun. When I started reading it I was really hoping this would be some kind of joke. I found it to be far from that and I really enjoyed the story. The story itself is really well done. I couldn't put it down and I could see myself going back to this book time after time. One thing I did note was that there were a couple of times that I was reading it, thinking to myself, "What if the book was a fake and my real life is all that it was written about"? I guess it could happen to anyone. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story. I would suggest that you buy this book and read it again. I think that you'll be glad you did.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't get into this book. It was hard to put down, because it was so full of emotion and passion. The main character had a great story arc and he was a real human being. I wish I'd had a chance to ask some questions that had been bothering me.  But, it didn't go anywhere.  I would've appreciated a little more of a plotline. In conclusion, if you're looking for a story to keep you up at night that you won't want to put away, look no further than the novel, but be aware that the final scenes of the book have a tendency to make you cringe.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________ (2/5) This book was a complete disappointment. The only reason this book was made into a trilogy was because of the wonderful review posted on Goodreads. The plot was, in my opinion, too slow to keep the reader guessing. The pacing was a little lacking because I was reading the first two books, I felt like the plot was getting a little tedious. I felt that at a certain point I was in no way interested in anything that the characters were doing. I think a lot of the characters did very little other than what was needed in the book, they did not seem to have any real character development. There was only one character that I really liked, so I can't say this book would be worth buying. (1/5).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the middle of the night, the lights of a distant house illuminate the darkness of the woods. A tall, thin figure steps out from the shadows and draws his sword. The blade is too short. In the next few chapters he goes on a killing spree, killing more villagers, including a young girl in her room. He kills a few other men as he runs from the scene of the crime. In this sequence of events, I was confused. How do we know what happens to the villians after the first murder? I couldn't believe the story was being told by someone who didn't know much about the game and who didn t think he was being clever when he wrote about the villagers. In hindsight, it seems that I may have been wrong in thinking this. I am a fantasy reader and the author was writing about people that I like. The story was interesting. I found myself asking for more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I've ever read, but not the worst book ever written (I don't own the rights to the other two). If you want to spend $12.00 on a book that has no redeeming features, go for the Harry Potter series instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I loved it so much, I even wrote it myself.   The worst part was the part where it's about me as a reader and it was written by my cousin, a high school English teacher who was an English teacher for 10 years.  I can't believe that a teacher at my high school who was supposed to be teaching us to read would be so lazy and not be able to write anything but what we already know!  I don't understand why anyone would listen to a teacher who didn't even write a book!  7. What is your least favorite part about reading?     1. The fact that I don.t have to sit down and read a book  2. The length of time it takes me to read  3. The annoying ads that play during the whole book.  4. The weird voices that seem to be constantly coming from a person (a woman?) in the back of my head and are constantly telling me to stop reading  5. The idea that "someone" (I can't tell if it's someone who actually reads books or is just a voice in my head) tells me "you need to stop"   This sounds like a terrible rant but it is. I hate that this book doesn't have a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter (as a book about a writer)   It's like the author wants to tell the reader "you can't read the last chapter because you're too busy reading the previous one."  The last chapter did not surprise me at all.  I know that the next book will come out.  But it was hard for me to get excited.  8. If you could meet anyone else in the world, who would you like to meet and why?   A woman who reads.

Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________This book is a poorly written collection of facts that you would find on any web site. The "author" claims he is an expert in the field but is a total bore. I found the book to be so unorganized that it took me a week to read it, and I know the subjects well enough to know that the "author has no idea what he's talking about." If this is what you are willing to get into this book, then this is a good deal. If you want a good read with a good source book, get the bestseller, "I'm a bad ass! - John Wayne"This book has a complete lack of humor and intelligence that is often found in science fiction novels that have as much humor as they do science. The stories do not seem like they are connected at all. In the end, the author makes it seem like he is a bad person and tries to cover up his bad deeds and lies. There are no other ways to say this, the book is total junk.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been very useful, however it was just another book that is used as a source for other people's research in the same field, which is a problem. There are too many other sources for the book, and it takes forever to read all the references.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- A great read. However, I am not a fan of reading books about women, in general. So the ending didn't make me as happy as I had hoped. I think the author is not a very good writer, so I expected the best from her. I liked her character as a friend, but as a protagonist, she wasn't very attractive to me. Also, I find the romance a bit awkward, but that's what happens when you put two people who don't really care about each other together.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********The plot is terrible. My brother and I were at a restaurant in San Francisco, and I was reading this book for the first time. I was supposed to be reading a biography, but instead we were reading the last words of a dead man, and the only thing in the book that was interesting to me was the ending. I would have liked to have read something more about the history of this island, but it was just as tedious as the last book I read. I am trying to finish The Dark Tower series, but I can't bring myself to do it. I'm also very disappointed that Roland's adventures in Mexico are going to be cut off because of a horrible fire.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The last half of this book is about a man who is living with a lot of alcohol and drugs. His problem is that he can't seem to stop and when his wife says he has to leave, he does because he's afraid that they will be separated and he will have to pay for her drug and alcohol habit. There are a lot more stories of people in my hometown and in my town with problems like this and no one is really talking about them. There is no one in my small town who can relate to a single guy that lives in the suburbs that spends his entire time getting drunk.   There are a bunch of interesting topics about addiction in this book, some of which I have tried and failed to quit smoking, but the problem here is that the author says that the problem doesn't have to be the substance itself or the addiction itself, it can be the way the person gets addicted. I found this book boring and a little boring because the main characters always seem to have a new problem and I felt like every time a character had a problem with their life, he or she also had a new one. I don't think I have ever seen a person in my entire life that lived a good life and also had two completely different problems. The author also says that many of these people are just looking for a way to feel better and that they aren't looking for any real change to make their life better.   the author has also claimed that his father was addicted to heroin and had a lot to do with the fact that he was addicted. This is an interesting idea, but then you have to realize that your father was just like anyone else, and has a couple of problems in his life that can make him feel bad and want to quit all the time.   is about the lives of people who have drug and drink problems. One guy is a good person who has an addiction but then the author starts to tell stories about his family. The main problem is not his addiction and the drugs or alcohol. The problem is the way that he gets addicted and how he can deal with it. He has some friends and family that have problems but also have good people that help him along the way. One of these good people is a woman who is a nurse who works at a hospital that helps people with substance abuse issues. There was also one man that lived near the man who was supposed to be living in the drug and drunk life. The people who lived around him were
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________  This book should have been called "Why the Hell Did You Read This?" I think that book could have been written about a hundred people in the last half century and it would have been a good read. In any case, you'll find that the book is a poor reflection of the person who wrote it. She is a lazy, stupid, narcissistic, egotistical, ignorant person who hates women and everyone else and who cannot be trusted to not embarrass herself and others when she thinks she is on the level. She has some very odd and extreme beliefs that are inconsistent with the rest of her behavior and have led her to become a liar. She says that she has been raped a dozen times (I found one incident from 1991 that I think might have happened) and that she is being stalked. I find these claims quite strange. Her father, a professor at a university, had a sexual relationship with a graduate student for several months while she was a graduate and the professor was her supervisor. She went to the university and filed a complaint against the professor for sexual harassment (this is a common reason for not reporting harassment even though it happened), but he was let off because he had a good explanation for how she had behaved (i.e. she was drunk) and because the girl was under the age of consent. The fact that she was never the one to file a complaint shows that she could have done so. When I say that this book is filled with lies, I mean the whole book. I found that there is no end to the lies she tells, the details of which were extremely strange. The author admits that she lies, and the lies are all over the place. The main part of the book was her claims of being raped. She describes in great detail how she was taken away by police and how she lied to investigators to cover her tracks and to make herself look like a victim of rape. The first part of this book was all about how she got away from her rapists. Then she went to a mental hospital and got treated for the rape. Then, when she was in the mental hospital, she met some nice people, and now she is a lawyer. She tells the readers how she is now a lawyer and how many people have been raped since the incident with her rapists, who have all been found innocent. Of course, she doesn't say how many of them she believes she would have raped had she been raped in a similar fashion.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is pretty good and a good intro to all of the elements of the book, but if you are expecting it to be the "be all end all" to the study of the history of Christianity in its various forms - I found it disappointing and at times a bit confusing.    Review of: Dinesh D'Souza, What's So Great About Christianity? ISBN 978-0-8153-3999-0 Published by Dutton (2007) This is a very nice book that takes a lot of the best of the current popular Christian literature and provides a clear presentation that makes sense of what they are saying. The book has a good balance of historical narrative that covers a wide range of topics such as how Christianity started in the Greco-Roman world, the formation of the early church, early Christian ideas on how to handle non-believers, the relationship of Christian leaders and the Roman Empire, the impact of Christianity on non-Christians, the conversion of Constantine the Great, the spread of Christianity to Africa, etc. The author provides a nice summary of the different historical and cultural strands that are woven into this narrative and covers this well in a few chapters. He also covers a range of religious beliefs (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, animism, animistic religions, etc.) as well as cultural differences between different groups in the Roman empire. What really makes the book special is the way the author has woven all of this information together and presented it in a coherent way that is engaging to the non-specialist reader. What makes the best parts of the text for me was that D' Souza is very engaging in his argumentation, he is very good at explaining his points and also at making you think. The most impressive part of the chapter about the historical Jesus was when D' (who has a background in law school) took us on a journey back in time and talked about the life of the historical person and how he/she is viewed by the people of that time period. This chapter was extremely interesting and well worth your time. Overall the book is a good read and I recommend it.  Posted by: Jim C | May 25, 2007 5:05:03 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ I can honestly say this book sucked! The story seemed to be all over the place. There is a lot of things in this book that aren't explained very well and the characters don't really feel like they are real. At one point I was wondering if we were really supposed to know anything about the story and if I was really supposed know anything at all about this story. The writing style was quite poor. I was getting frustrated because I could not get any kind of rhythm or flow to the story. My favourite character in the book was a guy who seemed to just be there for the sex. At first it looked like he had a purpose but he just seemed like a character that was meant to be a side character. At other times he is just a side girl and we didn't learn much about him. I think this book has problems because the characters are so un-realistic that it becomes very hard to get attached to them. That is why I give it 3 stars instead of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "In the end this book was so badly written, the book really isn't that good of a read. It is just a lot of crap that really made me wonder why someone even bothered to create a book about the bible. The only reason this book is good is the cover, because that's where I would put my hard-earned money, money that I'm not sure I even would have got if I had just left it on the shelf and gone on to something else. The book is so badly made it actually makes me want to put my money where my mouth is. It's not that I don't care about the biblical stories, I actually do but the way these stories are told in this book makes me wonder how any of them can be taken seriously in the first place.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't understand why my book is considered a novel and not a memoir, when I was just telling the story of me as a woman of color, how it felt to be a woman in this society, and how hard it was to be black. I can write about how I was not able to buy a white woman's lipstick in my own community because I was afraid of being harassed and assaulted (it is a huge problem in this country), and how I couldn't believe the lack of support that the black feminist movement offered me, since we are not a threat to anyone. But I don't need to read it as a memoir in order to empathize with the reader. As a woman, I know what it's like to be discriminated against for being a woman and to see that discrimination reflected in the culture around me. I also know that as I read through the book I was reminded of the fact that a woman is still being used as a prop for a man's ego.

Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- As much as I enjoyed this book, I think it would have been a better experience if it had been written by a better writer. The plot itself was great, but I am not sure the author understood that. She did try to take things a bit slow with the plot (and I think that is exactly what she was trying to do), but her constant "I know what's best for this book" dialogue made the story drag on too long. Even the first section, which is probably one of the best parts of the book, is a bit pointless, and the ending did nothing to make me feel any better. The characters were not interesting. I mean, there is only one character, and he is a moron. The only other character with any kind of personality is one who spends most of the time making little comments about the story, and a character who has to constantly remind the readers that they are in the middle of a story about the "real" world. The world that this book takes place in is full of contradictions. As a person who is constantly studying the real world, the idea that the characters are actually living in the "dream world" is mind-boggling to me, but that's a story for another day. I didn't find the book to be very well written. However, the concept of the story is interesting enough to me. If it had just been more of the same, I would not have felt anything for the story. If you liked the movie, I still think it is worth a watch, but it is definitely not my cup of tea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A book that I have read and loved and would recommend to all: it has a real sense of urgency and urgency is a big part of what drives my story. It is also about the impact of a man and his death and that it was because he died that a very powerful and dark power was unleashed on a world that had long been held back and suppressed. I was really intrigued and had to read it again because of the book recommendations I had made to others in the comments section after I read it. It was worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just found this book the other day and had a great time listening to it. However, I found a few things to complain about. For instance, it seems as if the author has a tendency to get a bit heavy handed when describing the supernatural. For example, one scene where an adult, a young girl, and a small child go to the woods. They meet a family of werewolves, the children and adult werewolves have magical scars that they have to take care of, and there is one scene when an adult male werewolf talks to a small girl about how he is going to hurt her.   Then there is the main protagonist, the man who was a werewolf but after being cured by the other woman of his species, he no longer had his supernatural powers. After a few chapters into the book, the main character has a confrontation with another werewolf who seems to be a demon.   (this book is the first book that I've read where the main main character is a were-wolf but it didn't bother me at all, I like a good baddie in my books and I am a huge fan of were-wolves)   Anyway, I do have one other gripe about the book and that is how it seemed like the author decided to make everything about a werewolves. It made everything too over-the-top. I found the ending just kind of strange too. It seemed like this werewolf, or one of these werewolves (couldn't remember), was trying to prove to his fellow werewolves that he was the best by killing them and being all mean to the other ones. But he did it so casually and it was too easy that it made me laugh.  -I also did feel as if a little bit of humor was overdone in this book. For one thing the main werewolves were such big jerks. They made me cringe a bit.  In the first few chapters we get told the story of how some of these humans got together with werewolves to do something horrible to their fellow humans in order to become the new werewolves and fight each other. This is not funny. And then at the end of the book we get to see how all the humans were finally murdered and that was not funny either.  a couple of paragraphs of this book will tell you that I was very entertained. I liked the author's writing style as much as I liked his paranormal thriller nature. However it

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a family in the Philippines and their struggle to survive. The book is told from the perspective of the daughter, who has no memories of her mother but who lives with her father in the village. The mother (the narrator) is the sole remaining connection to the girl. As the story unfolds the narrator's knowledge of her family grows with time until eventually the mother has no idea who her daughter is. The only thing the narrator remembers is that her mother is an excellent cook. The daughter grows up in the house being fed by the father and his friends and is not allowed to join them until she's married. She gets to know her family better and then her family starts a new house, so the daughter is able to return to her mother's side. However as she grows up the daughter comes to realize that her family does not want her because they have grown distant from her mother. The narrator starts to have feelings for the daughter but is unable to express them because the narrator has no family. The story is very well written. The language is understandable and there is some horror but the ending is not a happy one.   However, in the end, I would have given this 5 stars, if I could, and I really think that if I had this book when I was a kid, it would have changed my life for the better.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- This book was sooooo bad. I was really looking forward to this book for the first time but I can't get over how bad it was. It was a collection of very slow stories that all had the same plotline. I'm not sure what it was supposed to be but it seemed that all the authors just tried to write the same stories over and over again, all with the same characters and setting. I felt like it was trying to be soooo many things all at once, I don't know if it worked or not. Overall, it was kind of a letdown. I guess I was expecting better from such a new author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you are one of those who believe "The Only Good Nanny Is A Dead Nanny," then you will definitely love this book.  The book tells the story of a young woman and her brother who are both working at a day care center.  She is an older woman, and her older brother has moved to a big city, but the woman in the story wants him to stay because she is still "the good nanny." The Good Nany's Day Care Center is the setting for this story.  It is the early nineties and the center is in a pretty run down building, but there is still some life left in the place.  The nanny, Nanny Brown, is always smiling, although this smile is hidden underneath her layers of apron and makeup.  Nanny also doesn't get along with her brother and sometimes the younger brother is trying to teach the older one things he should know, but Nanny never listens. Nanny and her little brother are on the day shift.  They are not very good at their job and are often accused of taking things from the kids.  There is one little boy who is the least like a child, he is always running around, always trying to play, and just being a kid.  The boy in the center who loves running, is one of the nanny's sons.   One day the boy's father, who is now a police officer, asks the boy to help him with something.  When they reach the front of the building, the boy sees that his father and the other kids are all gone.   The nannie's father has disappeared too, but she and her son continue on.  Then they find out that there is a new manager of the center, Mrs. White, and they decide to try her out for a day. Mrs. White is also a single mother and a good worker.  Mrs. Brown and her family really like Mrs.White a lot.  But Mrs.Brown is just a nanny who loves her job, but will go through the motions, because she has to be liked by the parents.   She is kind of like the little nanny.   Nanny is really a good nany because she isn't mean to her brother, she listens to the parents and cares for the children.  This is a really nice story with a lot of heart.   This book gives us lots of character development and makes
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a great book. I have never understood what the big deal is about this book. It is not a "fairy tale". The characters are real and the story is interesting. If you love fairy tales or can see yourself playing a part in the events in this book, then I highly recommend this to you. It has a good plot. I was surprised when I learned it was a "young adult" book and not an adult book. Not to mention it's a book that you can read in a few hours.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read The Magic Circle as a teenager when I was in love. It was very disappointing to me, but that's a personal failing. I'm reading this now as an adult, and I'm finding myself wondering, where is the magic? Is there magic in this book? I love magic. I love stories about magic. It's my favorite genre of fiction. But there was magic in The Magic of Reality. The story is about two brothers, Michael and Richard, who are estranged for years. They finally reconnect and are drawn together by the paranormal, which they find in a haunted mansion. There are some problems with the book. First, the prose is clunky and uninteresting. The main characters, both main characters are described in first person, and this is confusing to a young reader. At times, they are described as "musing" or "racking their brains," or they have their heads down working on a puzzle, which is awkward and difficult. The prose also reads like it was written by a third grade English teacher, as though her prose was written before she was a teacher. Second, the character relationships are often shallow. The two main characters never have a meaningful relationship, and the other characters are all defined by their relationship to them. This doesn't make any sense. It makes a little bit of sense because the other main characters in the book are also separated by generations, but I still found myself wanting to know more about them. Third, this is a book about how a bunch of people can all see a ghost. No big deal, right? It's a book that is supposed to be about a story of ghosts, right, and it spends the first half of the book describing how a whole lot of people who are completely unaware of the supernatural happen to be a part of the story because they're fascinated by it. It doesn't work. If I hadn't read this book when I did, I would not know what to make of it, and that's okay. I don't want to know how many different ghosts there are. I want to focus on the ghost, on the main characters. And this is just the story. There is no sense of the time or place. This is the sort of story where one should stay for the first few chapters. Not everyone is going to read this in order. This is a bad beginning, even with all that said. The characters, who I can't really
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm writing this review to say that The Last House on the Left by Kurt Vonnegut  is not a good book.    It's also not even a bad story or a bad novel, in some ways it's kind of the opposite of those things.  The LastHouse is the perfect example of an author who should just go write a book by himself and then go back and write a bunch of books in the same genre he did the first time around.  This book was not written for any kind of genre or genre-bending reasons, its just a story about a guy who is trying to live the life he wishes he could live.  It is a story of a man who has trouble with a little girl he has a crush on.  There is also a little dog that is just one of those little weird people.  I think Vonneg There's also a great deal of symbolism in this book.   This story is about the way a man lives his life and the way he relates to people, what he sees when he looks at them, what things bring him to life, what people bring to life.   There's a lot of the same themes that have always been in Vonnegutz's work, but this book uses the idea of a dog in a person's life in a way that feels more realistic.  Some of the ideas in this novel make me laugh, and some make me cry.  This is probably one of Vonneguts better books, but it's also one of the first novels in a long time that I don't really have any problems with.  What I don`t like about this book is the characters themselves.  First of all, I donít really like the girl.   She is too uptight.  She is kind of uptight and she is not really there for the story.  In the first third of the book she is introduced as an anti-heroine.  But by the end of the story I still doní t really like her.   I don Ėt think she should have had anything to do with the story, the whole story revolves around this guy and he has no friends.  And I think that might have been a little bit to make this book feel different than other books by Vonneguth because the main character was always so much the anti-characters, so he should have been able to come into peopleís lives and become their friend
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not good literature.  I don't understand why it was included in an "Ecclesiastes" book.    It's not very good literature but it's not bad, at least I did not expect it to be.  The author is trying to be clever here. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________   This book is horrible. I think it may have been a very hard sell, but after I picked it up, I kept flipping it over, but could not get into it. I was never even tempted to finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** * The thing I found most annoying about this book is its attitude towards women. In this novel we are introduced to four characters, all of which are named after women, and we learn about their lives. They have an average of 3 chapters each. It's like they didn't want to get anywhere and were hoping to have an excuse to drop them in this book. The best thing about this novel is the narration. I'm glad I read it on my Kindle as I had to listen to it twice! It made the narrative more realistic for me. The plot was very convoluted, and was very hard to follow, because of how many plots there were. I just couldn't figure it out. I will try to explain a little more, but I'm pretty sure there will be lots of typos. My sister has a lot of typses in her books. She was the one who recommended this novel to me. She thinks it is a great read. I can't vouch for it, but she is definitely my number one pick if I want to read something with a little romance in it.  I didn't have the same reaction when I read the synopsis and the cover art; but I suppose I should give it a chance. I was a bit apprehensive about trying this. The cover art is very cute and kind of like my favorite type of art- what my mom makes. (Well, it's not a picture of a naked girl.) I like the picture well enough. It was the synopsis that really made me put it on. If the synopsis doesn't sound good to you, then you shouldn't bother with it. But it did make it more enjoyable. In fact, I don't know what my favorite part was: the plot, the romance, the characters, or the art? In a world where the male gender is oppressed, the female character is the most powerful being, and women are in fact, the most desirable sex, there had to be a female protagonist. But I didn't find her strong or strong enough. Also, her boyfriend was named "Hanna." It felt forced, especially since he is her brother. I don and hope that the plot would progress if it was split up, but the ending was a little too vague. Overall, it was okay, but there were too many plots. Overall rating: 4.5/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would describe this book as having the worst plot in a book ever. Why did I have to read it? It had a weird plot. It was almost like it was trying to be something it wasn't. I liked the book! I really did. I wanted to keep reading. I really didn't want to stop. It started out okay. I thought it was fun. I'm not sure how the writing was done for me. Maybe it was good but I just didn't get it. I didn't think I liked most of the characters. I don't really remember who they were. This is the most boring book I have ever read. I just wanted to turn the pages to the next chapter. It's one of those books that you have to re-read to remember what was going on. I finished this book in three days. I had to go the bathroom more than three times just to get through it. The ending was kind of crappy. I guess I could take what they had to say but it was so short. I wasn't bored in the least. I wish there was more to read from this author because it's very interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last three books in this series are the worst. They were too long and too hard. It seems to me the author was just using this as a stepping stone to get to the rest of his books. I just feel that he really needs to start doing his writing from the ground up with an actual plot and characters.   I give this book 2 stars because it is a good book. But the last three should be deleted.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is very disjointed.  The story line is extremely predictable, as each character is given one line in order to tell you how they are going to get to the next section.    "That was an awfully long sentence."   But I'm not sure if I really cared about the characters.  The story line isn't really what made this book a good book, it was the plot line.  There is a reason that I bought the book and I think it is what makes it great.  I liked the first book, I thought it was interesting, I'm interested in seeing how things play out in this one.  If I didn't like it, the plot would be very boring and I might have gave up on this.  This is just one person's opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I'm going to start by saying that I liked this book. It's just that it doesn't seem to be working for me. I'm used to books that get a great rating out of me even though I don't like them. I think this is just a case of the author being a bit stuck in his ways and not being able to move on, which doesn't do the book any favours. I just can't seem able to get into it. The world is fascinating and the setting is fascinating, I just am not enjoying it as much as I want to. It does not feel very different from what I've read before (although it's still new to me). As an aside: one of the things I liked about the book was the way that he used fantasy in this book to talk about issues that are difficult to discuss when we are not living in a fantasy world. This, as I said, is a really good way to talk to people in this day and age without them being turned off by it because they are not into fantasy. The author is doing this in a way that doesn't feel preachy, but still manages to make a compelling argument. If you can find a way to have fun with this book it will work, if you can't, then you might want to try something else. ------------------------ -The ending -This one I can't really say much about. This book had an intriguing plot and a good set up and, after all, it was a sequel, so it had to have an ending. This is not, as it seems, the end. I am really unsure of what to think about this one. It is such a strange ending, in fact. I really want it to be more about the story and less about what happens and who ends up with the girl. I don' think I have seen any character end up with anyone, although I know there's a boy who ends things up with another girl. But, for a conclusion that is supposedly just about the end of the story, I feel as if it is a bit of a disappointment. I feel like it is only really just about his ending with this girl. He is not really doing anything more than he did before in the story. Maybe I am just tired of seeing it. I didn't feel much like I was learning anything. I guess I just wanted to know what happens next, although that isn't really the point. I found myself reading more
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book and didn't have much of a chance to finish it before moving on to other books.   What you can learn from it:    1. There is no end in sight when it comes to bad books!   2. It is fun to get lost in bad books and find out what the main character is going through and the consequences of their decisions.     3. If you want a good read, get one of the many good books on a shelf or in a library that do not make you feel like you're reading a bad one.   the good books you are not reading in this book:   4. "Don't give a bad report."   "I have never read a book that seemed so much like a story about a character in real life." - George Burns, author of "Bonfire of the Vanities"  "The more I study the art of storytelling the more I see the difference between a good book and a bad story. A good book is a book to live in for life, a good story a book only to be lived in for a little while." - William Faulkner  5. The way I see it, reading this book is like being locked up in a bad prison and being forced to read the worst book of all time.   I am the only one that can say that they have been imprisoned by the worst one.  Read less
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I read this book on a short break from work to give it a try. After I finished, I was left with no idea what I thought of it. This was a horrible book that didn't do any of the things it promised. I feel the author wrote this to make money off the name of this book and not the content. It's very disappointing that a person could spend hundreds of hours working on this book only to have it come out not worth the time spent or money spent. The book is not funny at all, it's just an awful book full of annoying people and stupid things that happened. The story was about a high school student named Tom who was the captain of his football team and who gets a job at a small diner. The author said it takes place around the year 2000 and that it would be set in California. Tom was never introduced to me and this book really took me by surprise as the book seemed to take place in California with a large population of Native Americans, and not in the state of California where I live. The first half of the book is just about Tom trying to get a job in the diner and the second half has him talking to a few of the other employees and a little boy that works at the diner. Tom would be able to talk to these people because his mom had just passed away which would put Tom in a good light. The kids would be the main focus in the book and they are annoying and stupid. The two main kids that Tom would meet and have conversations with were named Jay and David who just seemed to be annoying and annoying all the time. Jay is the one who wanted to be a professional wrestler, and David is the guy who just wanted to become a professional magician. Both kids just wanted a big role in Tom's life as they wanted to get their big break and their roles. They also just wanted Tom to have a girlfriend who was not one of the two kids who just felt they should be in Toms life. These two kids have more chapters that the other three kids that were mentioned in this book. They would all be mentioned and not just in the beginning as the author would go on to say they would have more scenes. The last time I read it, I thought Tom and Jay were the most annoying characters I had ever read about and I was right. It felt like a very short story of what Tom and the other kids had to do for their story. I wish the author gave more back story

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! So many problems with this book!!! The author is an old white man who talks a lot about the oppression of blacks and talks about how it is a 'gift from the gods' to the white race that blacks should be taught to stay away from white people...the way I see it, if it is the right thing to do to educate black people in white culture, then why not teach blacks to stay out of their own culture too? Or teach blacks that other cultures are more equal to their own?? It seems to me that the only reason the author wrote this book was to get a bit of a platform for himself in order to attack the white people in the US! Now he is going to attack other people who also live in a racist and anti-black culture and culture which teaches them to keep their distance from white culture..but how do you do that when the person writing it is an author of anti-white books like this??!!! I have never read a book that has more problems with it!! The author makes up this whole 'history' of African slaves and blacks getting more privilege to the point that blacks were more like the white person in this book. It is a really old thing that has been recycled for a lot of people (mainly black people) to have a way to attack white people without having to actually say anything! This author has a way of writing to make himself look more right wing and more extreme then other more left wing people, so I know that the anti-racist people are going to hate this book! I have already tried to give this book to my children but the book doesn't even tell them to read it! I understand the title but I would not want to be taught any of this in my kids! Not to mention the author is from Britain and has a history of writing anti-slavery books (I think) which is why I don't really recommend it!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a really bad book and if the book is not about the story but just a bunch of characters talking in a circle about the subject then it is also a really, really bad story, especially since some of the characters are pretty uninteresting.   For example, in one part of the book (I did not realize it at the time) a guy is talking about some sort of religious ceremony and then it turns out he is practicing the ceremony and he is an atheist.   Why did that happen, what did the ceremony mean to the man and what does it mean now that he is a non-believer?   No explanation is given and the author doesn't explain it in enough detail and doesn't bring in a strong enough argument to change the man's mind.   The book just keeps on repeating the same things with no explanation why.   Another part of a book, which is in a different part of another book, is a religious group talks about what they believe in and then in the end it turns the same group of people who are saying what they think the right thing to do, that they are the only ones who are in the right, the wrong thing to be, or just not that good a judge or judge the right way, they are all wrong, etc.  Again, why?  How does it work?   What is the point of that? Â   The author also doesn't make any arguments about why the book or story is wrong or how the story is not right and it just continues on about the religious stuff. Â  And then you have the group of characters who think the same as the characters who are talking about what is right, wrong, and if you believe in the truth, and yet they have no arguments or evidence that they think it is the truth.   There is also no explanation of why the group believes that they have to do things and the only reason is that they believe it to be the right or right thing.     There is also some characters who say it is okay to cheat, but the story does not tell you why this is okay.   For example, the group tells them not to be mean to one another or tell one another no, but then a character says it is fine, but that he should cheat a little.  There are some character who don't have any character or background at all and yet no explanation is needed why they are that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was bad, it made me feel like my thoughts were not important or important enough to read.   This book has some good points but is in many other parts poorly written and thought out.  I feel like I didn't learn anything in this book.  And it is not like the book itself was bad (in fact, it was pretty good).  I think the book had more to do with being in a state of constant anxiety.  As a result, the book was just really hard to read and I felt like I wasn't able to think clearly.  In many ways, I felt the book wasted time.   "There's a new sheriff in town"
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have enjoyed the books about which I have already reviewed here. This one is in the category of "just okay". There were parts of the story which were intriguing, but not nearly as interesting as others I have read. It was a very short story with just a small cast.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book about a year ago, then forgot about it until I was looking through old mail I received from Amazon. I remember reading the reviews and thinking that I would not read this one. The first chapter made me laugh and think about things that are funny, so I decided to pick it up to see what happens.  Well, this book got me thinking about things I'd done recently. Not funny, but just kind of stupid or embarrassing. The book made me think about how I might act when I meet someone new.   This book was pretty good for a while, but I don't think it was very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I have read many reviews about this book, and many of them are very negative. I would say that I will read and re-read the book, just to make sure it's worth the time. This book is NOT as bad as most of the negative reviews say, but it is still very difficult to read. I wish I would have read this book sooner. I've always wondered what a vampire vampire would do after the end of his world. Would he stay in his human body? Would he change to an animal? Would be eat? It would be fascinating to read a vampire who became a human again. As I said, I wish it had happened sooner.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I'm sure this is the most obvious and least controversial point I'm going to make, but I think it deserves stating. This book isn't about writing, or any of the things I'm interested in. It's about publishing. This is really a self-help book, written by a publisher's marketing person for their publishing team. It is an attempt to convince authors to take their work and publish it themselves. There's nothing in here about marketing or publicity, or writing, and almost nothing about how to actually write. It does mention the idea of selling yourself, but that is a vague statement that is at least a step backwards, not forward. The author, a former agent, makes this point quite clear. The point isn't to get the author to publish their own work, or get them to sell themselves to a publisher. The purpose of this book is to get authors to send their manuscript to a publishing company, or even an agent. And that is why the book is bad. It doesn't explain how you can do any of those things, or what will happen when the author goes through the process. It also doesn't include any advice for getting rejected by publishers. Instead, the author is telling them to do what has been done, and to keep pitching and waiting. ------------------------- I don't think I'd want to be in the publisher business (at least, I don`t want to). But the publishing business does have its own -------------------------- I can't believe people get this excited about publishing self-published material. And this book isn`t even about writing. It`s about selling a self, which to some people (and I include myself) means the bestseller book. The only thing that can be said about this book and about publishing (the whole self-publishing business) is that it is ------------------------ the worst book I have ever read. It talks about publishing in a vacuum, without talking about anything at all about marketing. It offers absolutely nothing in the way of a practical guide for authors to write, for publishers to look at, or for the people running the whole process to take advice from. I mean, how do you think they can learn anything from this book? They're going to end up making the same mistakes as everybody else and wasting their time and energy. I think I'm done with publishing. If it's going to be so hard to make my first book successful, I might as well just publish my

Write a negative review about a bad book:  We got this book for my son. It's a great book. He loved it. The only problem is that the author is terrible. He can't spell, so we had to give it back. He had a very difficult time finding a book that was good enough. But a great story to keep his mind working and to teach him to read. He's reading at 4-5 months now. But again...I'm sure it will make a great "read along" book. It was a great way to read for him and now to him. Grade: B- Budget: $17.00 Length: 3,500 words The author is a very good writer. I liked this book and it's a nice idea to make reading a little more enjoyable for babies. I did find that he was a little too verbose in the beginning. He did get better and his sentences were more clear and concise. The only negative I have about this book is that at the end he was done with his own story. The author is not sure if he will write another book but he plans on returning to this one sometime. I think this might be a good idea for him to try out again so that he can pick it up from the beginning and read the other stories. BEST PROFIT: 10.00 (8.00) Rating: 8.0
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________ This book is a poor attempt at providing a "sensible" explanation of the scientific method. I find this sort of attempt at science explanation quite embarrassing, but that is neither here nor there. There are two parts to the book. The first part consists of a series of exercises and discussions. The material in this part is not good. Part one has examples of various techniques used by scientists in testing hypotheses and evaluating evidence. The examples of "best practice" are not really examples of best practice. One of the examples given is a technique known as "confirmation bias" which is a form of confirmation bias. A researcher asks "why" a hypothesis is true or false. If the researcher says "it's true" the subject is likely to believe that he/she is right. Confirmation bias is known to produce false results in experimental science. This section is a terrible, poorly written exercise. I am not really sure what purpose it serves. Part two of the book is an account of the process of science. Part 2 of the "science in history" is rather good. The author explains why scientific method has changed from the time of Newton. That seems to be an interesting explanation. He goes through a few different examples of what happened with science over the last 1000 years. I can see this as a good example of the impact that changes in society can have on the way science works. I think that these changes have affected the way we can and can't learn from the past. I found that this explanation of why science changed so much was interesting and not at all convincing. I still feel that the information provided here was not all that helpful. I wish there were better explanations that I could follow along with. My next problem with the book was not related to the material in part two but to the overall tone of the material. I'm not sure that the author is attempting to give a simple explanation of science but rather a long and complicated discussion about how science works, not why it works. The discussion is too long and I felt that the writing was too long. Part 3 of the section is devoted to a discussion about the "moral significance of science". The discussion of morals in science is somewhat interesting and the author gives an example of a person's ethical code that would seem to be of little or no scientific use. But then the discussion turns to a moral objection to using science in some situations. The moral objections that the reviewer has raised in the book are not good
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book, and it would have been a good read even if it had been better written than it was, but what it lacked in plot it more than made up for in character development.   What I really didn't like is the way the author presents her characters.  I think the characters are written very poorly.  A good story is built on good characters. I think it is because the author lacks the ability to present characters properly in her writing.  The plot is very simple but so are all the characters. If this story was better written the characters would be better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a bit of a let down for me.  It seemed to me that the author had so much enthusiasm for the topic that they decided to make it the focal point of the book.  It became apparent that the bulk of the material that was used to promote this book was old news that had already been covered in several books.  The book begins with an introduction that tells readers " The Great American Myth: The Life and Times of a People in Trouble ".    The first chapter gives the reader some facts about the country of the USA.   It tells the reader that the USA has had a long history of rebellion.  There is the French Revolution, the Civil War, the Spanish American War, and the Russian Revolution.   The Russian Revolution was an attempt to overthrow the Russian Czarist regime in 1917.  The author goes on to talk about the American Indian War which started in the 1600's.  They were fighting for their rights against the European powers.  Then, in the early 1700's the English tried to conquer America for the same reasons.  This began the American Revolution. Then, the author goes into the Revolution of 1776.  Again the authors tell the story of the people fighting for the right of free speech and free press.  When the English took over, the people didn't have a right to speak their mind, so they had to learn how to speak out.    Finally, the authors conclude the story with the American Civil War in 1861.   The author doesn't really talk about why the Civil war happened.  I guess it is because it is a story of a government trying to take away the rights of a people.  One of the issues that was addressed by the authors was the fact that the people did not want to go to war.  And, because of this, the government decided to take action and wage war.    This is the first part of the author's argument.  He starts by talking about the French and the Americans who had fought against each other for a long time.  His next story tells the story that there is a "Civil War" between the northern and southern states.  Next he goes on with the story about the civil war in the USA when the "Rebels" were fighting against the "Government".   After going over all the facts about this war, the book goes on the fact there are three different kinds of battles that are fought in the
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book should have been titled "Bible-Stuff That is Not." This is a non-Christian Bible, a Bible for the heathen world, an ancient book that has been misquoted and abused to the point of complete nonsense. This book is a Bible of the pagans, and it is full of nonsense. The stories told are not at all like those told by the Jews. The story of Jesus is also not of the same nature. There is nothing about Jesus that is like the story of Moses. This is nonsense, and should be ignored. This should be taken to task in the church and on the pulpits. I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks it might interest them in knowing the truth about a non Christian book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have to say this book was a little disappointing. It was definitely written as a thriller, and the action scenes were exciting, but the story seemed rushed and rushed it did not get any better.  The writing was also really bad, there were many times I just wanted to throw this book on the floor. The characters were a bit bland too, even the ones who were not as annoying as the bad guy. The author made me want to hate everyone in the book, so the ending made me even more disappointed. The ending was also somewhat confusing too, it felt like I was read the whole thing in one reading.  Overall this book will not keep you interested in books, it is also very predictable, the story and the characters are both very shallow and there is a lot of unanswered questions. This book would be better if there was more action, more suspense, more tension, more depth to the characters. It just does not feel like it was well written. I would recommend this book to fans of action/thrillers or people who are looking for a quick read that is not really worth the money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book really sucked, it was really boring, and I found myself wondering why I bothered to even pick it up in the first place. I could not even understand why anyone would even bother with this book. I've seen this one many times before, and it never gets good. I gave it 3 stars out of 5 stars because of the fact that it did give me a laugh a few times.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written by a man who is married to a woman who is completely clueless. She lives in a house with a bunch of cats who are totally crazy. In order to keep their sanity they have to take medications which she doesn't understand why her husband has to pay for. She has also got two teenage girls who are on medication and they are crazy as well. They have to stay in their room and don't come out except when they have their "frosh day." They are also pretty crazy. There is no point in telling these stories.  I think this book is really bad.  This is the worst book ever written. The only positive thing is the cats.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So after finishing The Book of Thelema I realized that I didn't really understand what was happening in the book. The author seems to be talking about a lot of different things but he gets confused and doesn't understand what is happening at the end of each book.   This was just the book of the second section, which was all about how the Great Work is achieved. If you want to know more about this the best place to go is the Book of the Law section of The Book Of Thelemap (or the appendix on the back of the book)   The last of the books that is mentioned in the introduction:    This is the book that goes into detail about the workings of the magician, and it explains the different steps that the magician goes through to achieve his purpose.    It also gives the magician the correct way to do everything. I really enjoyed the book and I will definitely keep this on my shelf. If you like The Book I can recommend The Book that is not on your shelf (The Book that goes against The Law):   The Book That is Not On Your List (the title of the last book in the series)  is actually not that far off from The Book Against The Law, which is the one that is read by the protagonist.  The main difference is that the protagonist does not see a purpose in his life, or that his life was the fault of something other than himself.  I don't have much to say about the last section, it was just a good book to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************ I just bought this book because I am a fan of the old series and wanted to get the latest info and was very disappointed with this book. I had just finished the first book and couldn't wait for the second to come out. I'm so glad I waited. I hate to say it but I don't think this book is up to par with the old books and I was very sad to see it close. I read most of the first half of the book and didn't find much in this book to interest me but I kept reading because I have to know how it ends. The book is split into three parts, each with their own little ending (in a way similar to the original series). Part 1:  Hooker - What the hell does a hooker do in the big bad world? There's a whole thing about hookers in the first chapter but that's about it. Part 2:    The Last Hooker - A woman who was a hookers for many years returns. She's done. She tells us that she'll be free of the life of a hookie, that she's not sure what her plans are anymore, but she's going to make things right. But there's something that she hasn't told us about her life before. She has a son. She knows he'll be fine but she still worries for him. Part 3: ____________________________________________________ - - - It's like watching a television show and all the sudden the entire crew is gone. I thought I'd like this one a lot. I guess I'll have to read the third book and see what happens... ******************** ********************* In summary: ************ This is a good old fashioned fantasy romance set in a fantasy world, but I think the original authors had a little too much fun with their characters and made them overly complicated. Some of the things we learn about our heroine's past are just plain wrong. There's nothing like a good and honest story to help you get over your hangups and move on to the next chapter. As always, good writing and good characterization make for a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I'm not sure how I feel about this one. On one hand, there is some nice, evocative prose. On the other hand, I feel like it's a bit thin on character development and development of the plot. And in the end, it just feels really contrived and rushed. ____________________________________________________________________________________________I am a big fan of science fiction, especially of space opera and hard SF. This book fits into that. I'd be interested to know what someone like myself thinks about it because I've always been a bit apprehensive about space operas and hard sf, even though I love them to bits and have read them all, and I've tried a few. It seems that there are quite a few books in the hard SF genre that are just too long, have very little to them, and have no real sense of story or character development, and all seem to be about the hero saving the world with a bunch of other people around him, who are all very special, and the fact that the hero can do this because of their special nature. This one didn't make me like this genre any better; it just felt like a bunch more of that.

Second, the author keeps saying things that I'm sure are completely false. Her mom says that her husband is in his 70s, while she's only in her 50s, yet we learn that her mother, who is in her 60s, was pregnant for a whole year with her own baby and still has no idea that her daughter is now 20.

Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! The book is a complete waste of time, and there is not a single redeeming quality to it at all. This is one of those books I will never, ever, EVER recommend to anyone, even if you're a big fan of science fiction. Not because it's a bad science fiction book, not because it is boring or because it has no plot whatsoever. Because it's horrible.  It's so boring that you might think the whole thing is a joke. And it's definitely a joke to many others.   My main problem with this book is the fact that it completely fails to make any kind of plot. It has no real story, which is a common flaw in this sort of book. This book is just a bunch of people going on adventures. And I think I've explained it enough to make my point. The writing is terrible, the prose is slow and awkward, the action is lame, the descriptions are dull, the humor is stupid, and the characters aren't believable at all (in fact I have only ever been able to empathize with the protagonist in this book).   I will say that this book was a huge part of why I finished my own book (which is pretty much a "horror" series) a year or two ago. I had read through every book in the series before starting it, and for the most part I had a good idea of what was going on, although I never enjoyed the books as much as I enjoyed the first one. The thing is that a new reader will struggle to figure out the plot and characters in this first book, but after a while you will find out what's going on. And this book, like the first, only has one really good reason to read it...it's the "plot" that's so poorly developed, and it just gets more and more ridiculous as the book progresses.   "The First Law of Thermodynamics" (the title of the book) is a book that you will not see many sequels to. It doesn't hold the same weight for everyone, as some of us might not find it as exciting or interesting as the first book. Some people will enjoy the second book because it adds a little bit more depth and development, and they might enjoy the third book because they see the character development in it. And for others it will probably be boring and poorly written. But I have to give it to the author, for trying his hardest to make this
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a fun, interesting book with a bit of historical fiction about the War of 1812. But I have the feeling it was never intended to be a historical account and the author has never read a single book. The author doesn't even have the faintest idea of what he is doing here.   The story follows the lives of John Reed and other soldiers during the War. They are given two choices, join a company of soldiers, or join the volunteer militia. Reed, along with many of his fellow soldiers, decides to join the militia. However, this is not the militia's finest hour. They get caught in a battle with the British. They were completely unprepared and had to surrender after the battle. Reed has been promised a new gun, but has to work as a drudge for his friend John Mott's company until he can get the gun. Reed makes many new friends in the militia and gets a gun for the first time in his life. But it doesn't come with a single bullet, just a small round. The story starts to slow down as the militia members learn the value of the militia, and the soldiers realize they have to take a more active role in the war.   in the beginning, Reed seems to be on the side of the troops against the British, but that changes as the story progresses. Reed gets more involved with the militia to fight for their own liberty. The book ends up being a bit confusing, and leaves a lot of questions unanswered, but there are some interesting bits to it. There are a few "historical" details I missed, but they are definitely not major enough to throw the book off balance, or to take away from the book's value.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I was expecting something great from this book, but this one was so disappointing...I started this book expecting a good read and it was so, so disappointing. I hate to say I'm not reading the sequels to this book (even though there was a series of this book so it's not like I'll never have this book again), but in the meantime, I'd recommend the first book and just stick with the original one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate this book.   One reason is the style: a book for the young and the newbie. It uses the same old techniques.  And one of the problems with young people is that they tend to get lost in their own thoughts and start thinking they have something better than someone else.     That is what happened to me.   I think there is a big problem with what they are teaching. I read a lot of books like this and all of them I read and I get so much out of them.  One problem is that most people do not know where the Bible is from. The Bible is the word of God to man.  I would like to see some of the students go on an honest study with the Bible, read it and then come back with something they have in their hand.  Then they would write the answer.  That would be better than this crap book. I loved this book! It has a lot to offer! The only thing I have to say about this book, is that I will not teach my kids anything like this. We read this book and my kids thought they were going to the zoo when they actually got lost on the way. I'm sorry, but this book is not for the kids. It is not something I would recommend for parents to buy or teach their kids. However, it is an enjoyable book for anyone that wants to read and enjoy it. I do wish that they had made some of their text more clear about what they were saying, but I think it is more than clear enough. I would say, if you like to read on your own or want to get some things off your chest, then you will enjoy this book quite a bit.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it's just terrible.  I read this to my friend who I'm pretty sure is only reading it for me, but it didn't change my mind at all.  It's also a very sad book, and I'm sure the author felt very guilty about writing this book, but the tone of the book is just so bleak.  This book has nothing to offer, but there's really nothing that makes it worth reading.  The only redeeming quality of this book is that if you are going to write a book about what I would like to read, you'd better at least have something good to say.  Overall, this book was just so depressing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for class. I was expecting it to be fun. It isn't, but it is funny.  When a student asks for a book about the weather they expect the fun and light reading. This book is dry and dull and the humor is not the right kind.  The humor:   I'm not a humor buff.   It's a little too broad and cliched for my taste.  I find that when humor is at the expense of some groups of people this often isn't the best. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________________This book is about a girl with a horrible life who has the misfortune to have her parents be rich and in a very abusive relationship with their son who's mother has moved to a new city. She moves into a huge new house that she's not supposed to live in. She doesn't feel safe living there and decides to go into a hotel. The hotel is owned by the guy she's staying with. The guy is a jerk. He's drunk more than he can handle and it's clear he doesn't have the relationship skills to make her feel safe. So he's trying to break her up.The hotel is in the middle of nowhere in the mountains and there are two police officers working the night shift that come to her room. They have to talk her into leaving. They get her to agree to go to a restaurant and he tells her how he was sexually assaulted by his wife and it made him change his ways. It's clear from her response that she doesn't believe him. She starts to walk out but he makes her stay in the room. So she doesn be in a room with this jerk that was raped. The jerk tells her to get rid of him and starts having sex with her anyway. And then he is physically abusive to her. This is when her life really gets out of control. But it's hard for her to leave. She wants her new boyfriend back. She needs him and she doesn`t want him to be away. The last thing she wants is to go back to the jerk that is a threat to her health and life. So they stay in this hotel with this nasty guy who was raped by his own wife.The next day the hotel manager finds them on the floor and locks them in. He decides to force her to stay in there even though she doesn´t feel safe in there. She is able to leave the room once but not the room with the guy who had been raped by her own husband. So it's a very long, drawn out scene with lots of dialogue. It´s a really bad book. The author tries to make it feel "comfortable" by trying to have it read as if they were sitting around a small campfire having coffee. The dialogue is very slow, slow paced and it really drags on. Even after she leaves the hotel, the guy is still trying to control her. He tries to get back into her pants but she has left them in the bathroom. And he tries
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very disappointing. The only reason I took the time to review it is because I had heard many of the same complaints and questions about it already from my friends.  I wanted to get my head around the different aspects of the book, but there were just too many things to pick apart.  Here is a list of things I found: The book is a narrative about a young man who becomes a hero by surviving the assassination of a dictator and making it back to the United States to testify in front of a congressional committee.   This is a very good story that could have easily turned into a book with much less conflict and conflict is not what this book is about.  I also find the concept of an assassin becoming a hero rather far fetched, I am not sure what the book is trying to prove here other than "an assassin could be a hero!" There is no reason this should happen, it is a concept that is used in a few short stories in the "Beneath the Clouds" series (which is a good series by the way).   This is also a book about the aftermath of an assassination, but we see this book through the lens of a very naive, naïve young man.  He gets an amazing opportunity to become a hero for the American people, he can only turn his back on it. The idea that this hero could become a great assassin is just too outlandish, the idea that he could kill a dictator but not care enough to save his own life makes me angry.  A good writer should be able to use ideas like this in his work, but this is one of those stories where the plot and dialogue seem to take you out of the story because of it.   In the end, the narrative seems to be about a very naïve, naïve hero who is not very good at his job.  The world he lives in is a fantasy world, and his fantasy world is the only thing keeping him alive.  This book is also about the moral choices made by young men in America at the time.   I do not believe the protagonist, the young man, ever considered that this man may have a reason to go off on his own and find his own place in the world, he does not understand the repercussions of his actions.  It would have made for a much better story if he had had an actual friend who was with him and advised him about the implications of his choice. This book did not allow for

Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________ I am writing this review because the author is a woman, and the books she writes are all bad.  It should go without saying, but if the book is not bad, but you want a woman to write for you, you probably don't want her to write something that is bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't recommend this book at all.  It is a poor piece of work that is full of all the usual clichés of religious literature - you start the story with a woman who is raped and then there are other people who are involved, in that order.  What is the big deal about this - I mean, it just isn't very interesting.  There is a religious aspect, but the way the story is told is so clumsy and confusing that I could not understand a word of it.  The story is about a little girl who is trying to decide what to do about all the things she doesn't want to do.  She is told to go away and take up a job as a nanny.  That seems like a good idea - there's probably a job for her and it's a good position to be in.  But she just can't do it. So the little girl decides to walk on by.  (The first time I read the book, I thought, "that's neat, she is able to decide not to do that, but she just doesn't have the right feelings to do so."  I don't remember the book saying anything about feelings, just that she was not ready to do it.)  So now the book is about her and her boyfriend, and he starts talking about how important it is to follow your feelings and not do things for other people.  It's a very common theme, I think, in the world of religious books.  I found it hard to understand and really irritating, so I just gave up.  A negative review is really a comment on the book's ability to talk about something.  No one is going to be convinced of anything in this book if you're not willing to put in the effort and go into the book with an open mind and heart.    I think that's enough negative stuff to talk of - what are you all looking forward to reading?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was an amazing book to read, but as a complete waste of time. The only reason this book is four stars is that I loved the character development.  The author doesn't really make any sense in any way. The main character is a girl who is supposed to be dead but was resurrected. This girl is supposed is supposed be dead so she could help her father who is in prison. But instead, she helps her mother who has just died because she was a vampire. But this vampire is supposed has to live forever.  It turns out that the vampire didn't die but he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He didn't get to live when his mother died, but his father did. He was supposed to live with him so he can become a vampire again. But he was resurrected instead of living with his father. The mother was supposed be a vampire but she didn't turn to a vampire and she is still alive. So he is still a vampire now. So what is this guy going to do next? He went to live at a home of the vampires because he didn't know if he was a monster or a human. This is why he is in the prison. It's because he is a monster. He is supposed only to turn humans into vampires. He can't control himself anymore. So his sister wants to know who he really is. He turns into a vampire herself and they are supposed to turn people to vampires with her help. He doesn't want to turn anyone. He wants to become a normal human. What he wants to turn is a man who had just turned into a woman because he was born a vampire so he is supposed have no gender anymore. I liked the way they made this story work. I thought it was good and it was interesting to read about it. However, when I read the ending it made no sense to me. The father was supposed was supposed turned into the vampire by his mother. Now, the daughter was supposed died but turned back to a human and turned to a woman. They were supposed to have a daughter together and this is why they were supposed turn to humans. The author didn't understand anything he was doing in the story and then just threw in his own stuff in there which made the story even less interesting. The way he wrote in it made it even more difficult to understand everything he was telling me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________ I was so excited to see this book for my gift exchange and when I opened it up to find it had been opened by a family member before I got the chance to read it I almost fainted. First, the cover is horribly drawn and the characters are terrible. It was like someone took the original "Rent" art and made it into a children's book. The characters are so stupid and stupid. They get into all the silly things that everyone else does in the book and then complain about how they "can't do anything right." The whole book is like that but it also has very serious lessons in life about how to deal with people and how to be a good friend. I loved reading this book and I want to read all the other books the author has written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     If you have read any of the books in my series, then you will understand my frustration with this one. I read the first five books in the series and finished all of them. I got the feeling that there was a lot more to the world and the characters than I was getting. There was so much more going on, so much character development, and so much drama in each and every one of these books that I had lost all interest in them. Well, they are all still good books. There is a good story to be told about a family dealing with a difficult situation, but it just didn't have any juice. This book was just a waste of time and a waste for me to have read it. I had to put the book down after about the third chapter, just so I could think about how I could fix the mistakes and make the book better.  My rating: 2 out of 5 stars  Reviewed by: M. L. Jones (M.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible. It's filled with a lot of wrong information about the history of Christianity. It starts out with a nice little summary of the first century, but it just skips straight to the "Jesus is our savior, no wait, HE'S NOT OUR SAVIOR" part. The book really wants you to believe it, and even includes a chapter on Jesus' supposed "miracle" at the Passover. Then it tells you how the early church "saved the world", and how it was God's will that people be saved. I could give this book three stars, but I can't. It just doesn't work.   I did not understand that Jesus and the early Christians were both the same thing. For example, at the same time, the church considered Jesus to be the son of God, but then they said that Jesus could be anything he wanted. So I thought Jesus was just the name of Jesus the son. Also I thought that the early Jews, in writing the gospels, considered themselves to be writing a history of God's dealings with Israel. So they added things that didn't really make sense. Jesus' crucifixion was totally out of place, as Jesus did not do anything at all to get himself killed. And Jesus didn't even speak the word "cross", which is a term Jesus himself didn't use. And why did the early Christian community keep the Nazarenes' story of Jesus' virgin birth true for almost 200 years, after Jesus' own followers were not believing it? Why did they make it a big deal for so long? How did they know they were right about it so quickly? I could keep going, but that's not really the point of this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a lot of fun, but the only way I got through it was to keep trying to turn my eyes away because I got the idea for the story while reading the book.  As a result, it's a little hard to focus on what's happening and keep from getting bored, and the book just drags on, although it's easy to tell there's nothing really in it.  Readers have reported having a much better time with the sequel,  The Last Day  by David Boring.   10. The Last Boy Scout by Christopher Burditt (1994) This is a very funny book that has a very different tone than the others on this list.    In  Last Boy  Burditt makes fun of the usual boy scout behavior problems like drinking and sexual assault.  What really sets this book apart is that it takes a very realistic approach to the topic of gay marriage, the real-life struggle for gay rights in America.  In other words, this is a book that will make you laugh in a way that the others won't.  It was one of the very first books I had ever read that made me feel sad because of how cruel some of the bullies are, and it really does set a tone for what kind of stories I was supposed to like, rather than what the author would have me believe.  This book has been described as an anti-hero novel, and that's exactly what it is: a bully.  He has a heart of gold and he wants the best for people, but he's a horrible person.  The story is told through the eyes of a boy named Mark, who is the last boy on his school's scouting trip and he's the first to be bullied.  I found it very easy to relate to Mark as a boy who's been beaten and abused for being gay for a very long time and Mark is trying to learn how to be a good person.   Reads on Goodreads 9.  The Big Book of Bicycling: A Bicyclist's Companion  (1985) One of the first books that made a big impact on me was  The Little Green Book of Bike Maintenance.  It is a fantastic book, I can still see it in my head.  There's a lot to talk about, and much of it is in the form of stories.  For one thing, this book is

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was definitely not a good choice for a first novel. But since the only book I have ever read that I was more than a little curious about, I decided to pick it up. And boy did I.   It's a nice book. It's just not that interesting a book. I do like that there's a male character at the center. It would have been interesting to see him in a different context (in some other book), but I will admit, he had a bit of a tough time. I think that's one of the reasons why I liked it so much.     So the book is about a guy who gets kicked out of his home because his mother has just died. His girlfriend has been kidnapped. He sets off to find her and gets to her on a train. And then, it's a bit complicated, but the story is actually very interesting and the plot twists are not too hard to follow. There were several plot twists that I'm not even sure the author anticipated (especially about the train).   The narrator, William Shatner, does a good job of capturing the characters personalities, especially the woman in the train. The narrator is obviously talented as he does an excellent job of describing the situation, giving an appropriate amount of space to each character (except for the protagonist and one other character), and then telling the story.   It's hard for me to describe how well the story was told, but it felt like I was reading a mystery or a spy novel (or even a fantasy novel with magic). I was able to follow the main plot (even though the narrator may have had a hard time with it) and get to know the main character. The author even gives you some information about the people who are in the background that you may not get in other books.   I will also say that I found the way the main characters reacted to different circumstances, especially after the main story was finished, to be quite interesting and somewhat interesting to watch. I will go so far as to say that the author actually does a decent job of showing emotion in the story and characters. It was a nice change of pace and a nice way to read a novel that might otherwise feel a bit too serious and uneventful.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I got this book thinking I would like a more psychological analysis.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed, though the book was good. It had a psychological aspect to it, and as a result it was more interesting than it should have been.  "  ― Laura Anne Gilman
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not a good book. It is hard to read and it is extremely boring. I do not recommend this book. This book made me want to throw up, it was so boring, and boring.  It was very hard to keep up. The book is full of errors, and the characters are hard to relate to.  I think they should add more people to the book instead of just a girl and her boyfriend. A very good book but a bit too short, just enough to get it out of my system.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a really hard book to get through. The characters were uninspiring, and the plot had some weird twists that were not needed. It was not good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and really enjoyed it. However, the book has flaws that I think are pretty minor. First off, I was expecting the book to deal with an issue that would be relevant to the time period. It's not; it's a historical novel set in the time of the civil war in the U.S.S Maine. The book is written in the early 20th century.  The war wasn't very popular, and the Civil War is only mentioned in passing. That being said, there are no significant incidents regarding the Civil war in this book.  Another issue with this book is that it is written almost entirely from the point of view of two white characters. However... that's not the worst thing about the book. The worst thing is that the majority of the book is a love story between two black people. It really takes away from the historical and historical fact that the Civil rights movement was largely a black thing and that blacks and whites were very polarized on the issue.  And, to be fair, the history presented in this story is not terrible.  It's well written, and I was entertained by the character development.  I did feel like this was a historical account of the Civil Rights movement that was set in a black neighborhood (I'm assuming it was written in Harlem).

Write a negative review about a bad book:     I was not impressed by this book at all. I can't believe I spent 4+ years of my life reading this trash. I didn't think it would get this bad but I've learned that many people like trash but not all trash is created equal. This was not created equally.   I will never read this book again and am looking for a replacement. This book just made me sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I had heard that this was the only book by the author, but after reading it and hearing that it wasn't by the one that I had read before, I had to read it again. I didn't like the author at all. I found that the characters were unlikable. I don't know if I'll bother to read another one, or if I will, what the story is going to be about.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________This was a waste of time, the book was nothing more than the last words of the writer, the author was obviously tired of writing and left.The book is supposed to tell you about a guy called Richard who gets killed by a gang of thugs, the thugs are the same group that murdered the family of his friend, they had no remorse or shame about killing him, the story begins with Richard's funeral, the funeral is a mess, a family of seven is killed with Richard as the first victim, Richard was so sad, but was there any real pain? Richard was a decent person, the last person I would want to see in the world, a good friend, a husband and father, and a great teacher who was in a position of great power, he used that power to hurt innocent people with a gun.The story of the book is that Richard was very much a victim, and that it is this lack of respect for others that drives him to do something so unheroic. It is a pity that the author did not have the courage to show the consequences of this, I think this could have been a good novel if he did not ignore the very real consequences of what Richard did.The character of Richard did not change in the book, he was the same self serving, entitled, and selfish person. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I received this book free from a reader who has given me his honest opinion. This book has many positive aspects and has a good amount of information about this subject. This is my first ever attempt at a book review, and I have decided to start with the positive aspects to this book. First off the writing is excellent, as you will see from the positive reviews it seems that the reader is familiar with the characters and the style of writing. Also the author seems to know how to structure his words to really help them seem to have substance. This makes the reading feel like a much more genuine piece of writing than a lot of other books out there. The plot is intriguing and the author uses a number of very relevant historical facts to help move the story along and give the reader a better understanding of the history of the times. Some people may not like the subject matter, but for me I found the fact that he included details of the real events so much more compelling and I felt he did a good job of setting the mood of the novel.    I enjoyed this book and the rating I gave it is because of the
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's so bad, I'll start writing something like "The Unspeakable" instead. The story is just so boring and predictable, you know, it takes you to that part where some random bad guy in a dark alley is killing people and your main character is just sitting there watching it. No, really, it's like the same sort of bad person just shows up in a city and then everything else goes on. The author tries to make it interesting by throwing some random characters into it and saying they have to work together but the whole thing just fails. I guess I have to just put it down because it's just so bad... I don't really want to continue this book after I finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This book is awful. A story about a group of children, one of which, the main character, has Down syndrome. The whole thing is about how much fun kids with Down syndrome have. The author gives them all names, from little Johnny to little Emily, which seems a little insensitive. There's a lot of stereotypical stuff in the book, such as "the boy's name is Jack" or "the girl's name was Jenny" when one of the children in the group has Downs syndrome."   I have two children with Down Syndrome, my 7 year old boy has Downs Syndrome (a chromosomal abnormality, he is in a medically-induced coma). I had to read a lot about him because I had read a very similar book. I found this book very irritating, not because of the content but because I can't stand that it was written by a person with Down's Syndrome. I just think it is very condescending, and disrespectful. The only reason it is so condescending is because the characters seem so much like an average human, and I think that is a great shame.   - the author does not include any description of Downs Syndrome in the beginning   There are very few books that talk about things such as Down's syndrome, or things that are very common for those with the disease. You would think a children's book would have at least a little bit of information about the disease, but this book does not, they just gloss over it and never even give the condition a name. Also there is never any mention of any of the complications Downs Syndrome causes, such things as mental disabilities and behavioral issues.   the characters also don't have any kind of personality or quirks that would explain their actions   Also, the author mentions how the children seem happy all the time, and then goes on to say, "the girls seem to have a lot to say about everything they do" as if that explains how they are supposed to act, or be happy.  's children do not seem to be affected by the fact that one of their friends (who has a different genetic disorder) was raped or murdered because they were "happy all the fucking time" I just couldn't stand the fact the author was trying to make her characters into happy and carefree little girls, when they obviously were not.  .  This is a pretty good book overall, but if you are looking for a nice children's story, I would recommend something
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is just horrible. The premise is that you play a guy that gets the hots for a woman and it doesn't work out. There's really nothing in the book to make me believe it's going to be a good book.  It's like watching a terrible movie.  I won't be buying this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________ I think you know me, I've read a ton of books and I don't want to read another book from you. I had a hard time with the plot. I thought it was over so soon after the beginning. I didn't care for the characters. I also have a really bad heart and it felt like my heart wasn't in it. This book is so overrated, you have a lot of talent and I really hope you put that talent to better use.  Thank you
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is no different than the previous ones (see the previous reviews).  It is just so... well, boring.  There is nothing original about the story, which is quite a common thing, as many books by authors like John Grisham and James Patterson are just a bunch of generic pulp plots.  I did like the characters, but this book was just so dull it made me think twice about reading more of his works.  Overall, the story was a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ******** I read this book back in '98, and I found it utterly boring. As a child of the 70s and 80s this was one of the only novels that I read to get my minds off the world around me. Not much happens in this book besides a bunch of talk about who is in charge in the world, what is happening to the world as the people age, and a few old people discussing their grandchildren. It was almost laughable to hear a couple of grandmas talk about their grandkids. It's a pretty dull read. I have yet to read a story about old people and grandkids, and that is because I like reading about young kids and my favorite books are those with both. For me it was just a waste of my time. I was also disappointed that it came out in 1998. Maybe it was written in the 1950s but as a child I remember it being quite good. The cover has a picture of a dog in the book.   I've seen many great books published in the last 50 years and I would like to see more written about the people and culture of the 1960s and 1970s because it was an interesting time to be alive. It is not as interesting as what is going on right now, but it is still interesting in a way. People are still getting up, talking about what they think about what is happened in the past couple of years, talking all the way through a conversation on the phone and not making a single move. The last time I was in Europe I got to see the last of the old people there and they were absolutely amazing. Not all old people are bad and some are very smart, they have thought of everything. And I mean the good old ones who have been around the world at the same time as we have and have had as much to say about the present as we do. In the 60s and 70s, they were in charge, they knew how the world worked and what it was doing, and they knew about it. If you had to go to Europe for any reason, just take a plane up to London, where the European Parliament is, and there will be people talking to you all day. The old people who have come in the 60 years since that have had a tough life and have been given an awful lot by their grandchildren to help them out. And we are not even mentioning the fact that the world has changed a great deal since the 70's. It might make you
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I just finished a bad review of this book in my local bookstore.   The book was about a poor person who lived through the horrors of WWII.  The book told the story of a poor woman who went to the US to stay with the relatives who lost everything, but was forced to go on a hunger strike to avoid going back to war.  She made it through and eventually got married, had children and had to leave.    It was just too much.  If I'd had more time to read the book I probably would have enjoyed it more.  It was a very dramatic, fast paced read.  A good read, but not worth the price. The book has many problems and I feel there is some way for a writer to fix them.  I don't like it in the beginning when it starts to become more of an autobiography and then it becomes more of a novel.  A more mature story with much more character development would have been great.  Other than that, it is a good book, I would read it again.  Overall, it has a good beginning and ending. There was a little plot hole I thought would be interesting, but it is not enough to ruin the book. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not pleased by this book at all. I was given an ARC that the publisher asked me to review before it was released.  I was looking forward to reading it, I had read it on a Kindle and I had it on my shelf waiting for an opportunity to read it for myself. What I found: It's not a great story. This was stated on Amazon in an Author's Note on page 15 and I was surprised that this was said, as I was expecting a more engrossing, compelling, and interesting story. The characters:   No one was interesting. They're shallow and stereotypical, and they're meant to be. They are also all so stereotypical in the worst sense of the word. It was all about the sex. There's absolutely no depth at all to the plot or the characters. It's all about sex. Sex, sex, sex.  That said, it is not a bad sex book, but it is very shallow and just sex in a bad way. If you're a woman who wants to read an adult book, this is the one for you. I don't get why anyone would want to read this. It is shallow and you could argue it's racist (white woman) in nature. It was not very good, it didn't have any substance, and it was shallow. It wasn't even enjoyable.  I think it would be much better if it had been more like the "Pitch Perfect" movie where the characters were not so shallow, where the female characters were actually real people, and not just stereotypes that have nothing to do with the plot. I guess the only good part about it was the sex scenes. I think that was the best part.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!It is an ok book that I just dont get why they have a character named Tinkers? I have a problem with the character Tinker. He was just sooooo annoying. He is an annoying prick who just doesn't do anything. He just hangs around and does nothing. I was bored the whole time reading this book. I do not understand why they would make a character like this. I did not enjoy this book much and will not be returning it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I liked this book. It was written as a travelogue, not really a history book, although I'm sure it could be made into one. The story of the "Gore-Dodgers" was interesting to me and was the kind of story that is good to read over and over again. I enjoyed the art. It is one of the first times I've seen art done like that. The character drawings were pretty cool, although the main character looked a little silly sometimes. But that is just my opinion. I think the story was well written and was a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________My book was a huge disappointment. In fact, it was the worst book I've ever read. It was full of errors, was poorly written, and had almost no character development. It is very hard to care about the people who have been killed in the story and to think of them as human beings. It's a sad story in the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    " This was so bad that I had to call it a bad read on several occasions.   The story is about a woman and her two boys who live in a shack in a forest. The woman is the sole breadwinner and the boys are her support systems for life. Things begin to change when the boys hear the woman was beaten by their mother.   "The men in the camp go mad, and there is a battle. But the battle is won and the men wake up in their bed and find the woman in their arms. The boy tells her she needs to leave the forest and go back to town to get the money to buy new shoes. She says no. So they find her a new house, but they think it is a trap and she is taken away.   The book is really hard to put down, I really did. But I will read the next one. I have to read it to really appreciate it."
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------> "I've read and enjoyed a number of books this year, many of them being written by female authors, but not one has made me want to vomit, as I did reading this book. I just couldn't do it. No one could. But if this had been the last book I read this year I would have. It was so horrible. I read it before bed and I never did like it again. I couldn't believe anyone could write this rubbish." -------------------------------> The worst thing was the book. No matter what, she has to be able to read. A man cannot do it either. I'm sure her son is quite intelligent and can handle it. So why can't she? And why did the publisher think it would be a good idea to make her look like she was on drugs? ---------------

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a terrible book, and has no redeeming qualities. The main character, who is a female, is poorly written and completely unlikable, the best I can think of is the guy who wrote the movie that was supposed to be based on the book called "The Thing About Bees".   The writing style is also horrible, but that was probably intentional because it's supposed to make the story less linear (which it actually does), but because of that, it also makes it very frustrating to read. The character's thoughts are often interrupted by dialogue boxes that seem like a waste of time. The narrator keeps interrupting you with his own thoughts that aren't the point of the story. The story also has no logical conclusion that makes sense, no characters who actually change, or who become more important.  It has a lot of weirdness and oddness and weird situations that I wouldn't normally associate with horror stories and I couldn't really place myself in the situation.   Overall it's a bad story with poor writing. , November 19, 2008I was hoping for a good book. I don't think I got what I expected. It's one of those books that I couldn`t really care less about and don't even remember what it was about.   is a very well written book that will make you feel uneasy and uneasy emotions. I think this is one of the best horror novels I`ve read for many reasons, not the least of which is the writing style. There's definitely a very effective horror horror genre in here and I love reading horror stories that have such great writing skills. The book has an eerie atmosphere with a bit of a mystery at the beginning of the book.   the story is about two friends, a woman who thinks she knows a way to stop a horrible monster from destroying her town and the guy that doesn`t believe her and doesn` t believe that a monster is that big of a threat. They meet in the library where they meet a few other friends of their town who also are skeptical of their story. It`s a fun mystery story and it is very interesting reading it with the story so slow and I felt that everything went by very slowly. This story takes place a long time ago. The characters are the usual ones you can find in a horror movie, and I think it was a good choice to write them in a book. They were likable characters with some interesting dialogue and some other things
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is absolutely terrible, and it is written by a woman. In the back of the book she says it's a 'comprehensive history of the Holocaust' and she uses some very offensive Nazi language. I cannot imagine why someone would waste her time writing this. It is all very badly done. I do not want to read about a bunch of people being raped and murdered because they were Jews. I wish this author had never written this. She is simply horrible.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  If this is the best that this author's work is going to be, then I can't wait for his next book, which should be even better.  It will most likely be about the same subject, but the world might be more exciting and interesting.   It's a well written, well paced, and quite entertaining book, but a bit of me wishes that the author had a little more faith in his characters and didn't make it such a "I love you, Mom!" romance. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very poorly written, and very hard to read. The story is very confusing and hard to follow. The characters were bland, and the plot twists are very unrealistic. Also, I think the author was trying to write a "true crime" book and didn't really follow her own rules (i.e. the crime did not happen in front of a camera). This is a very poor book and I would NOT recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a huge fan of this book and of course I bought it and read it at the very last moment. Why I read it: I loved it!  It was so funny, it was so well written.  The story line was so original that I really enjoyed the characters.  I was very happy to see how the author captured the characters' personalities and emotions, and how the characters changed when they experienced life in a different country, different cultures and different people,  and how the changes and their feelings about that changed them. It was a fun story, and I really liked it.   What I didn't like: There was a lot of spoilers in this book.  Some of the characters are not exactly what we expect them to be, and some of the things we see in the book can only be considered as spoilers in one way or another.  It's best to read the book before reading this.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm writing this review to warn others about this book. First off, I'm sure most of you reading this will know this book already - it is a popular self-help book with many reviewers (as well as many in the mainstream media) rating it as one of the best and most helpful books on overcoming addiction. This review is for an updated and expanded edition with more information. The main problem I have with this book is the author's claim that the way to end addiction is to give up the "addict" lifestyle. He says that this lifestyle is not the reason people become addicted to the substances he describes in this book, and he is right. If this were the case, many people would no longer become addicts - this is not true. The reason many people become addicts is simply because they are seeking to satisfy their desires. It is easy to satisfy our wants by using drugs and alcohol, but not so easy to stop. There are, however, ways to stop this craving, and there are also ways to use the drugs and/or alcohol we choose to satisfy these needs. I am not suggesting any specific way, but I am suggesting a method: the one that works for me. I have used this method for about 5 years now, and it works. I did not know what it was that worked, but it seemed to work pretty well. My wife also uses it. She does not need drugs and she does not use alcohol or drugs (so far) because she can live without them. Her addiction is in the desire to be satisfied, and this desire does not stop at the end of the day. I do not know how to stop her cravings or how to keep her away from her desire. This is why she is still addicted to my wife, but she will stop before long. That is the way that I have lived since I started using this method. It seems to me that this is a good idea because it is easy and easy to follow, and once you learn how it works, you can teach it to others. I hope you will find the same benefits that I do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't understand why there were 3 or 4 books out at one time. One of them was the best one I've ever read, but the others are so different from each other. They are like 3 different books in a novel. And then, I was just bored with all 3 of them! Readability:   The author clearly doesn't have the most creative brain out there. The books were very hard to follow, and I couldn't understand most of what was going on. The language was so strange that I had to go back to the beginning of the book to understand what was being said, and how. The illustrations were pretty cool, but I couldn  The 3 books I had were great, but it's the one with the weird art that I found the least interesting. I think the artwork is really cool but that I don the language was just weird. I feel that it was probably a case of not having much time to get a grip on what was happening with the stories.   I wish it was one book and one story. I love the art in that one and would love to read the other 3 as well, but we'll just have to wait.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________________________   This book was a disappointment from start to finish. It's an incredibly boring book that could have been written and sold much, much better.   I found the story to be repetitive and clichéd, and the premise very silly and not original at all. The protagonist was the "baddest bitch" ever. We've all heard of bitchy but have never heard of the "bastard" (which he was) or the "big" (whatever he was called) or "bigger" or the big bad (again, never heard a mention of him). His bad behavior is almost exclusively directed at his mother, so much so that I wonder if the author even read the book. His mother is portrayed as being extremely annoying, but she isn't even in the book enough to really get much of a reaction from the reader, other than the fact that she keeps getting in his way (and thus making his life extremely hard and confusing). It's all her fault. Oh, and I'm not even getting into the fact he had a wife and a daughter.   of the most aggravating things about the story are the people in it. Every time I thought the story was getting too crazy, it would pull the characters together and force them into a group, and then another group of characters would come together and repeat the same stupid, predictable things they've been doing all along. Of course, this was a story about "bad boys" who don't pay attention to their ladies, and it was all explained in very detailed dialogue, but I'm sure there's a way to make this story more interesting. For example, how about they all go to a party at a bar and everyone else at the party is just a friend of theirs? If they all want to go, they should know that it's only a matter of time before some of their buddies (who are all in the same boat) show up, so they should all know how to find each other, why not?   Anyway, I'm going to stop the review now because it is already becoming tedious, but it has got to be said. I would have given this story a 3 or 4 star rating, but because the author isn't a very well written writer, the book comes out of my mouth sounding like something written by a 4 year old. I had to put it down and go to bed at some point because I'm just not enjoying reading a story like this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not even sure I found a decent book in this collection. I read the first half of the book before I even got the cd, then read it again in the car because it had been too long since I had read. It seemed like a story about the aftermath of a car accident, which in fact it was, but it seemed to be an afterthought. It felt too long, too boring, and I kept getting distracted by all the details, such as the guy at the shop looking at a dead chick and laughing in the most deadpanned manner possible.   Then I saw the cover, and was like "no way", as it seemed so much better than the actual book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I love the genre of fantasy, but in this book a lot of the writing was just plain bad. I was so confused by the beginning of the book because I thought the author was so good at writing and the characters were so likable. When the book gets to the part where you are a prisoner of a castle and you have to fight in the arena, it just gets bad. The battle scenes and writing were just bad. At one point, in the fight in which the female character is being beaten by a man, a few pages later you are in a hospital and the doctor asks the prisoner "Who won?" the prisoner says "The other guy, he just got lucky." There are so many things that happened in this first half of the novel that the next part of the story just didn't make sense. I don't want to say the book was dull, it was just not the best I have read.   I gave this book 2 stars because of the beginning. I like the story, I just wish there was more at the beginning to set the mood for the story to follow.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've always thought I was a pretty decent read. I've read several books on the topic and they were well-written, and I enjoyed reading them. I can't claim I was any good at it, but I did enjoy the journey.   When I opened the book I was greeted with a very interesting cover. I am not sure how it came to be. I think it was from a magazine or something. It has this huge, bold, bold font. It was a bit of a giveaway to me that this was going to be a good read, but that was only an excuse. The cover is very well done. It makes you want to pick it up and flip it over, because there is something strange and enticing on the front.  , my review:I thought it was good. The book's main character is called, and he has a name that starts with the letter 'S'. I have to say that I didn't like that first name. I'd love to have a friend named that, and when he is called my name, I get nervous and can't help but think something is weird about it. This is the first time I've ever had a character in my book called by his first name, but it didn't bother me. The main character, however, was the real draw. He was not only well-cast, but he was likable. He isn't all talk and doesn't always get it right, but his character development was well done and I really enjoyed his story. If you're looking for a book about character development, then this is a good pick for you. If, however you are looking for an enjoyable read about a boy who loves to read, you might want to skip this book.I'm not quite sure what made me feel that way. Maybe it was his habit of naming things, or his personality quirks, or just the fact that I really didn't know who this character was. The story is a lot of fun, and as a result, the character is not that well-developed. Maybe next time? This book was just a quick read, and it doesn't get any better, so if you're into fast-paced, funny, fast-reading, then the book might be right up your alley.I did like it though, and my kids did too. I did like reading the book, and they did too, but there's something I don't like about it... it
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I will never ever buy another John Grisham book ever again after this one. It was so depressing! He had the perfect "how to" story for an inexperienced reader, which I totally got. It started with a description of some good places to drink with "friends" and ended with a couple of pages of Grishams saying things about the book. It had no emotional value to it. And after reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about Grishamm. He is like the narrator of all my books. I don't like to go to the movies, but I want Grishammy to tell me everything I need to know so I won't miss anything. In the end it was more like he was just telling me his opinion of a bad movie, not a good book. And then I saw his face and realized he didn't really care at all about the story he just wrote. It's a very sad and hopeless book. So sad that I don.t even want to read any more books by him.  Rating: 1 of 4 stars "Don't Be Afraid. When I was a little girl, my mommy used to take me to the lake every weekend and make me sit on the bench by the water. I loved watching the big boat go down into the water and watching the kids run around playing. Then my mother told me to put my big red shoes on the other side of the bank. And I thought, you just told me not to be afraid! And I couldn\'t help but believe you. Then we would get in and the boat would come back up and we would play again." --John Grishmamn "This book is an interesting attempt at creating a narrative based on his experiences, but it fails at the most important part: making me want to continue reading." "A very interesting book. Very funny and touching, and well written. I can see why it was one of the most sought-after books in the world at the time. This book is worth reading."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had heard so many wonderful things about this book, and in the interest of time, was reading it before I read others. However, I'm so disappointed, I have to say that I can't recommend it.  First, the story is very repetitive.    There is just not a whole lot to read about, at least not in the way that I have heard described, except that there are various women and other characters that have some kind of personal problem to solve, and then this book is set up to solve it in very particular ways.  So, for instance, the heroine is raped, or becomes pregnant, or gets a disease, and is asked to leave home, but she refuses.  She has some sort of a crisis of faith, which is resolved by her being visited by the Good Spirit, which does not help her, and thus, she leaves home.  Then she is told she is a child of God.  I don't understand this at all.  Is she the daughter of God?  Was the pregnancy from God?   Or maybe, in the process of being pregnant, she felt like God was trying to get rid of her, but there was no way she could give it up.   And so the story continues.    Then, the book talks about some women who have been victims of sexual assault, and so it is told from their point of view.   Is this necessary, or does it just turn the tables on what is already a problematic narrative?   Does it do anything to change the power dynamics in this situation?  And then there is some sort-of-sort of mystical experience, but I don.t know what that means, and how it would make it any better.   Finally, the conclusion.   It concludes that this is all the work of the devil, and God has a way to defeat it.   Why does the Good God need to defeat the enemy at all?  So, all the good things that have been talked about in the last hundred pages?   These things are so similar to the rest of the book that it is hard to take them seriously.   The bad thing is that there is not much variation in the narrative.   If you enjoyed this review, or want to learn more about how to develop characters, you may also enjoy "A Life of One Night." "One Night in America" is available from Amazon.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A man should be able to look at someone, say, "that person looks like a dog", and have the confidence to just walk away from them. A man should not have to be ashamed to call them a piece of shit."   This is how much the author thinks, and I have to agree. He doesn't actually think that way, but his beliefs, in this case, are how men should be, if they want to be accepted by society. I don't like the author, but I am not a dick about it.   To me, this book was a complete waste of time, and time is money. Not even sure how this author made a dime, since I read this book in less than a day, and only for fun.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________________ A book about a guy trying to get out of a marriage when the man who wants to end his relationship with his ex wife tells him that he needs his "cuddle" (so that he doesn't go off and do things in his own life) is, I think, a fairly solid idea for the kind of novel that we have here. It also has that kind of premise you can get on a first read that will have you turning the page to see what happens next. However, it suffers from a few things that make me not want to put it down again. The first issue is a bit of the genre itself, as the "cuddling" seems to be something the characters are supposed to want even though, at this point in the story, they have already found a way to end their relationship. Another issue is that the couple, having already broken up, doesn't seem to realize what is happening to them. It becomes a bit too much to be about the relationships and the love, instead becoming a bit like "The Man and the Woman". Another issue I would say was the ending, which is a little weak in my opinion. There were several issues I had with this book, but the ending was the most prominent. So, the rest of the book, I'll give it 3.5/5. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ "And the day they got married, it seemed, they went about their business like a couple of married couples." -- a quote that I believe was said by a friend of my ex wife while we were having a "couple's" talk. But I digress.   In the beginning of the story we are introduced to the couple. They have been married for 2 years. Our main character, Jason is the head of a small company. His wife, Holly, works in customer service. They live in the suburbs and are the typical suburban couple. But, the story tells us, they're also the couple that is struggling to stay together. Jason finds out that she has been having an affair with her boss and the story goes on to tell us that they are having some trouble with their relationship because Holly is trying to do some of the dirty work her husband is refusing to do. And that in the end, the marriage is over. But there's more to it than that. It seems that Jason is always "helping" her with the problems. He's always there, doing what she asks,
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wanted to like this book but it just wasn't that great. The book starts off great but it then starts becoming boring. I would have liked to see more of the story about the other kids at the park and how the park was named. The author wrote a wonderful short story about it that was the only reason I got into the book. I don't really recommend this to my children.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is really slow and it really feels like you are reading the work of an amateur.   There is no real story, just a series of boring events.  It is just a book where you are going to be bored for the majority of the time and when it gets going, the story just doesn't even make any sense. The main character is so bad it is almost a good thing. He is basically some kind of ghost that has come back to tell the story of this other guy and his ghost wife and his little brother who died. It is not very good writing because it takes you out of the story and makes you feel stupid.  I guess my review will probably be just a summary of my experience with this book.  I thought I was enjoying it but then the story went on for 2-3 chapters and then it just went on in slow motion and really didn't do anything.  This book just isn't worth reading, the whole thing was just pointless, I could have just read about 4-5 chapters about this other ghost and his wife but it just didn't make any logical sense to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book on a whim, and it really didn't deliver. There was one memorable scene where we were told that there was no way to get the characters out of the desert. The problem is that you can't get the desert out of your mind.  When I started reading this book I had no interest in the characters, because the book really took itself a whole lot too seriously. This was the third book in the series, so I thought I would just stick it out and see what happened. But this is a really frustrating book because it has no suspense, and everything has to be resolved in one long section (more than half the book). That's what makes the story so frustrating, because it had the potential to be good, but it was so ridiculous that I'm not sure I would have enjoyed reading it if I hadn't read the previous books. I did like the fact that the characters were the main characters, and that they had a lot of depth. I don't like this kind of thing at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was disappointing to me. I was very disappointed in it, and the worst part of it is, I feel like this was a good book that I just had to read.   I liked the story, but the characters were pretty much awful. It was pretty much the same story for all the characters, except for the villain. He was a typical hero who was pretty stupid and pretty much evil. He tried to kill all the people in the book, except he was outsmarted at every step. I really liked his name, "Lizard". He just made me feel bad about the world.   It was nice that he had a love interest, and she was very hot. However, the main character of the book just seemed like a stereotypical person. The book basically made me think that my world was going to end because of a small group of people, who are very powerful and not caring about the rest of the world? I don't know. Maybe I'm just not reading far enough into the books. Anyway, I just think it's a bad story and I donít want to read any more of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I have no idea how to rate this book, or what to say about it. It is a bit of a slog that takes me almost two weeks to finish (it will likely take me two more to read, as I have to go through a lot of the same passages over and over again). I liked the original (by James Patterson), but the new one is just not as good. It just doesn't have the punch of the original. And that's OK. It's not a bad story, just a disappointing one.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ___________________________________________________________________________ I gave this book two stars instead of five for the following reasons. I've only read a small portion of it. I'd still like to see a little bit more of the story. There are some parts where the narrator sounds like a kid trying to pretend to be older. It's too easy to just tell a story and not make it believable or well-researched or any of the other things that really make a story great. It seems to me that a lot of the writing for this book was just copied and pasted from other books. The fact that it seemed to be written by the same person for a few years and then it seems to have been written by someone else is also a sign that the author was lazy. The narration really seems like a student trying to sound like an older man. In fact, I don't think this is an age problem at all. _________________________________________________________________________________ I've enjoyed reading a lot about the subject of "bipolar." It has been a subject of study for some time, and the field of bipolar has grown immensely in recent years. The way I have been able to get good background on bipolar has been through various books written on it. One thing that struck me about this book, however, was that it does not talk about Bipolar Disorder. That's not an oversight. I think that is one of the reasons that the book may have a good story to tell. There is no mention of the symptoms that affect a person, but that does not necessarily mean there are no symptoms. What I mean is that I found no description of the common moods, especially those of mania. I found none of the mood swings mentioned. I had to google it to find out how the person was feeling during the day. ______________________________________________ What I like about this: ______________________________________________________ The title of this book is appropriate. What's funny is that even though the book is "about" bipolar I am not sure that is the right word for the title. _____________________ What I don�t like about... _______________________ What I think: ______________________ So it�s a book about bipolar but the title is not about the disorder. _________ What do I think is wrong with the book: I think there is no way you can read this book and not think of the author as a lazy and forgetful writer. And this is coming from a professional writer of many novels and short stories,
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when I was a junior in high school, and my parents bought me it because it was so great and well-written. But it's not very good at all.  It's basically one long story about a "chosen" person (or a "mortal") who wants to save the world, but he doesn't want to give up his life because he has the knowledge he needs to do it.  The plot is kind of boring, especially since there is so little character development.  I think the problem is that this is really just an extension of the "The Name of the Wind" series, which is already really long.  It takes all the time the author could've used to do more character development, and leaves the world in shambles.  At the same time, it also has some interesting ideas, but it gets really annoying after a while.  To make it worse, the book doesn't really make it clear what this "hero" does or how he did it. It just keeps saying, "Look! The protagonist saved the world!"  I don't really know how to describe this book, except that it doesn't stand out.   In the end, I think people should only buy it if they really love fantasy, not because they want to read another epic fantasy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is a piece of trash, and it is not worth your time or money. A book about a dead dog (and dog lover) being haunted and getting revenge in the most boring ways possible (hiding out at the bottom of the lake for 6 months and waiting for the moon to rise to hunt the other dogs and get them for dinner)... and no, there's no way I'm going to give this book 4 stars because that would be ridiculous. I gave the book 2 stars because the book's plot was kind of interesting. But no, I can't give this 3 stars, and not only because there was literally NO tension. There's no conflict or anything.  This book should be called "Shame!". I could give it a "2 stars" if the book was not so boring and poorly written.  And I could totally give this 4 stars, even though the book is just a piece-of-crap.  There is one thing I do like, though, and that is the way the dog gets revenge.  I love how he is so cunning and is able to manipulate and outsmart the other "dogs" and get what he wants.   (Note: For the curious, this was the last book I read by the author, Robert Silverberg.  He was a former Marine who went on to become a famous science-fiction author, best known for his books on robots, aliens, and other assorted space-aliens.)
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************** I'm sorry to say I was completely unprepared for this book. I read the synopsis as I usually do when deciding which to purchase, and I was so excited to read this book that I immediately purchased it, thinking I'd be able to read it in one sitting. I was shocked that this was not the case. I'm not sure if I can ever get over the fact that the authors tried to make it about the two women, but they actually did not focus on their love life, and in the end I feel that they failed to capture this book for what it was and why it was so good. The plot revolves around an 18-year-old virgin who becomes friends with a 24-year old virgin (because I didn't bother looking up their ages), who starts getting her panties wet as she gets closer to a girl she has never laid eyes on before. We follow their lives in detail, and by the time the novel ends with the two girls in the middle of the forest, we've really only learned the least bit about them and why they became friends. So in short, they're an average college student who became friends at the first sign of opportunity, and then they just stopped talking to each other in the last couple of chapters. They do talk about what they would do if they had an orgasm, but we only know that because they were talking about it on their phone. Their lives are a little too perfect and perfect for what the authors had to say, and even though I love a good romance book, this one fell flat for me. ******************* (review of free book)  Review by: Janna T on Mar. 13, 2012 :  I read this free book, and am really glad I did. The author, Alyssa Young has written some very good books in her past, and this book is no exception, so I was really happy to see her work on the subject again.   The main plot of the book revolves around a girl, A, and her friend B. B is interested in A and has her "first taste" of a "normal girl" when A starts going out with B. The two girls find their way to one another, and they start going out every night to hang out. One night they decide to go to a club and they find out there are guys there who seem interested in them too. The guys are pretty aggressive towards them. They eventually end up at a bar
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in two sittings, and had trouble starting the first time. I had a hard time focusing on it. It had a lot going on, with different characters, and the storyline was convoluted. Also, a little too short, and one character too many, and she didn't have much personality. I think I can easily forgive her, but I thought it would have been interesting to have more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is bad.  A lot of the facts it claims are not true.  First, you have to understand the history of this game.    This is how it came to be.  In the late 1940's when WWII broke out, the U.S. Army decided to bring some more men into the war to help defeat it. They started with small units of men and used the game as a way to get men to work with them.  The first game, Pock-Off, was a joke between men.  Now, the game has turned into a serious competition.  There is a lot of real money involved in this game and it has been used by the Army as a form of training.  One of the best ways to see how the Army plays the game is to watch a drill video.  Some soldiers are so bad at the game that they go crazy and they even jump over a wall to try and win.  This book describes an actual game, where some soldiers did exactly that.  However, the army didn't use this game as training, they actually use this to train future soldiers. This is just as ridiculous as the story.  As far as training men, the book claims that Army training is only to improve their marksmanship skills.  Soldiers are not trained to shoot well, they are trained to kill the enemy. The Army will teach snipers how to take out targets but there is a long list of other skills they need to have.   Also, if you take a rifle and aim for the face, you might not hit. If you're trying to get a target on the other side, you don't aim.  It says that it's okay to use "canned" bullets.   They don't really have to be anything like real bullets and the book doesn't explain how you're supposed to do it. Another thing it says is that the best way to kill an enemy is to hit him where he's most vulnerable. The book uses "body shots" where the enemy is dead, but if you do hit him in the face or somewhere else, it's the best.   When you try to hit the head or the body, it doesn't work as well.  Of course, if someone did this kind of thing in a real war, they'd be dead.   There is no way the army will train men to be snipers.    They'd be shot in the head
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book when I was 18. I was really bored out of my mind. There was nothing to it, except a bunch of nonsense, so I just ignored it. I've been reading fiction ever since, and have been a member of my local book group for 10 years. I can't believe this book was written in 18 years ago. The stories are so lame it's painful to read about them. And if I do have to remember this book, the title is probably going to come up, even though there is none. But this book does nothing for me at all.   One last thing, I don't know why they are making the movie out of this book now, since this book isn't even good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  A good story, but very slow to get there.  I'm glad the author is taking her time with this one.  The writing was good. I loved the narration.  I also liked the character development.  But I found myself wishing that the author had written this story sooner.  
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________   The book starts of well enough, with a decent plot and characters. It was a good start. I liked the way the characters were presented. They did have flaws, but they were believable. The one thing that bugged me was that they got so obsessed with finding and tracking this monster, that the plot went nowhere. The only thing that was actually interesting about the book was the ending.   What really makes this a bad novel is that the author did not do a good job in the writing. Most of the time, there were spelling and grammar errors. I was really annoyed with this. It just made the book difficult to read. There were several times that I looked up something to do, and the sentence wasn't exactly right, or missing something. I also found it strange that she used different words for the same thing. I found it a little weird, because this could just be her way of telling a story. But it really made the reading difficult for me.   is not a good book. It is really unbalanced. The story revolves around the monster, but doesn't give the story a lot of depth. The main character, who is obsessed with the monster and constantly trying to find it, really drags the story down. But I think that this could have been fixed with a good editor.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was the perfect way to prepare for my new career as a science and engineering journalist.  I loved the subject matter and the narrative style was extremely engaging.  It's a bit of a mixed bag for me.  My favorite sections are where it looks into the scientific research into mind control, the way people are effected and affected by the actions of government and corporations, and how this has led to increased paranoia in our society.  I have yet to find a single interesting or useful piece of research, and every once in a while there is a great read.  Other sections are pretty terrible, but they are also fascinating in the context of what they are talking about.   I'd love to see the author expand into topics like transhumanism, genetic manipulation and cloning, nanotechnology, the end of the earth, and more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm always up for a good romance. However, there are a lot of poorly written romance books and I usually can't get past the "the main character is too annoying to like" line. This is the third time I've finished this book, but each time the main character annoys me in a different way. One of my favorite things about this book was that I think I really got to know the main characters and their lives, despite how the romance is. I'm not even sure what the point of the romance was. I know it's supposed to be about the two characters, but I don't really understand how it adds anything. I've also read other reviews saying this book is too short and that makes sense since it's a one-shot, but when it's one-sided, I have no interest in reading another.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story of the film version of the book, " The Last of the Mohicans ", was poor. The story of Native American history in the time of the French was written about well, but the actual events of Native Americans' struggles were left out, and were simply put in the hands of the Indian actors to act out. This, combined with the fact that the director of the movie, John Huston (who directed "The Manchurian Candidate", "Forrest Gump", "Dances with Wolves" and "The Last Samurai" was a French Canadian), was a racist and a war-monger, made the whole production a complete failure.  Huston also made the film about a character who was supposed to be black, but who was white, and so was able to get away with using a non-black actor in the role.  The Indian character in the movie (played by a non white actor).  As far as I know, the movie wasn't good enough to make a profit and I have no real hope that it will be ever be seen again.  One of my favorite movies as a kid was " The Green Berets ", a comedy about a group of WWII Green Berettes in a small town.  In the movie they were the only white guys, the local town wasn't racist, and the local mayor was the only black person who spoke out against racism.   Some of the green-beret guys were on the team in the film.  Not only did these guys have to put up with racist comments, but they also had to act in roles that were stereotypically black.  Unfortunately for me, a group called " The Indian Student Association of the University of Michigan ", decided to go ahead and produce a movie, "The Indian", based on a book of the same name.  For the most part, this movie was fine.  There was a very short scene that involved the Indian protagonist fighting off a black man, but it was quickly cut.  But for the most of the show, it was a jokey, silly movie that was written by a guy who probably only remembers The Green Beret.  It had the character of the protagonist named "The Green Berett", played by a black guy, as the protagonist fighting Indians and Indians only to be defeated.  While this movie wasn  funny, it wasn't very good, and it had absolutely no place being

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a little annoyed at the beginning of this one when the author stated the book is in a certain order. However, I knew this from the beginning when he showed us the first and last chapters of the book. In a way, it is a bit of a cheat but it makes it a lot easier to read. As far as characters go, they are not memorable (except for the girl) and most of the other characters don't have much to offer. But overall this isn't a bad read, just the beginning was a bit disappointing.   3 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only reason this book is bad is because it is too long. The pacing is off, and the story is very dry, and doesn't move along.  This book is also very boring, the main character is a bit off, as is the reader.  If you liked one of my other books (The Magic Tower) or a random book that I read, do yourself a favor and try this one out. I hope that I will have more books out by April.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  "I really hated this book. A bunch of people just jump off of buildings. It was too easy. I hate the jumping off of roofs in books. You can always catch yourself at the last moment. In this book I just kind of got stuck in the middle of a group of people jumping off buildings. The story wasn't really that bad and it wasn't that good. Not enough action for me. Not fun enough to read. A lot of boring plot."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (3 out of 5)   A lot of what I expected to be interesting about this book was wasted by the plot.   He tries to make the characters seem very unique and complex but they have little to no uniqueness in the way they think or act.  The main characters are quite different and in some cases downright different but they make the same mistakes and it seems like he does not want them to grow and be realistic.  And in some scenes he even seems to be trying to create some plot devices that could easily get out of control.  I would have preferred a more traditional story that he could write himself or one that he would have adapted from a book.  (1 out of 1)
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very bad book. I have been waiting for years to finish this one and I never did.  It has the same annoying story and characters and boring pacing of every other book I have ever seen made into a movie by Paramount.  My only redeeming feature is that the movie did do a better job at explaining the plot and plot holes in the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think I was ready for a real adventure with my new series, but sadly this book turned out to be not only a disappointing experience, but also one of the worst fantasy I've ever read. So much promise in it. But the story is completely ruined by a terrible ending and plot hole after plot hole. The ending is a complete mystery to me and I never understood what was supposed to happen. It just felt rushed and rushed was my response. After all the hype and hype this book gave, I'm glad I didn't waste my money or time on it. I just had enough. -M.E.  47 of 53 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------  I was really excited to read this book. I like the author. The book is very well written, well presented, and I really enjoyed reading it. However, it was a lot to handle. There were a lot of things that didn't make any sense and made the reading experience extremely difficult to me. I would recommend this book for those who want a fast paced mystery novel.  12 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ***********This book is terrible!!! It's like a terrible TV show and this is exactly the same thing. I have read many "good" books by other authors. I think I should have written an evil review. **********   The premise is bad;   - the setting is really boring (it was never explained, but the "book" had an idea of a "city" where this story takes place).    - the characters (the people who were in this city) are not like real characters in any way;  , but they are likable enough to not care much if they die.   I think that is the worst part of this book;   the characters are so unlikable. I never understand how they do things they want to do.  Their motivation is always to be bad or to do bad things. , but their actions are always done so they can get what they want. . But their motives are always wrong!   "But why is this? How can it be bad to want to be a bad person? Why would you want to become a bad man?" I know I am being ridiculous, but there are times in this book when you know it's a bad idea, but you do it anyway.   the setting, is a place called the "City" (or a "world") where they are a super power.  is just so unbelievable. You really don't believe that this "city", is a real place.   and the "good guys" (the "evil") are always stupid, evil, mean or just stupid.  :/  - I could go on and on about this book but it's really not that important. I am pretty sure my brother would like this book as well if he read it. :-\   ****** I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. I don't really think anyone could really complain about this one.   a review of the book, with spoilers:   1- the opening paragraph is so horrible. I can't believe a book is starting with that. 's first paragraph. I'm thinking he's a retard or something. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole series is very boring. Some of the stories have very few interesting moments. For a book with such an exciting plot, it is very repetitive. I'm trying to decide if this is the worst book i've ever read, or if it's just boring. My biggest problem with the book is the lack of action scenes. Even though there's a lot of violence and action, the story is more about characters, and the violence is just too little.  Read an interesting review about this book:  This is one of the most interesting, well written and entertaining books I've read in a long time. This is definitely worth the read if you're looking for an entertaining read.  with lots of action, some romance and just enough plot twists to keep the story interesting.   The only reason the book could have been better is because the characters are a little flat. The first half of the book the characters just seemed like one dimensional caricatures with the only thing I could think of is the "torture" that he was put through during the torture scene. After that however it was good.  ....   This book has had a lot bad reviews. I will admit it was a very tedious book. A lot of the books are very predictable and repetitive, some of the scenes were so generic it was very boring (like the character torture scene that happens around the 4th book). I was a little worried about the book because the first half was pretty boring. However when I started to see the amazing development of the character and the way they all worked together, I loved this book. It's a good re-read because it has a lot more depth and story than the first 2 books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book. I don't even think the words were written the way it sounds in my head. I would not recommend it. It was just an ugly and weird read. I'm not a fan of horror in the least.

Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________ I don't read fantasy. This book was a big disappointment. The characters are so uninteresting and don't seem to have any reason to stay in this world other than having to look cool while in armor and in the woods with his sister, and the worldbuilding is just not any good, nor believable. As I read the book I kept thinking I must be reading some sort of bad story. The descriptions in the story are often poor. I will have to wait until the book is in print before I buy it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:......................................................  This is a book that would have been a great buy to read for a history course, but it's just too tedious to be interesting, and if I had to read it again I'd skip it.  A story about a man who died because his son did not believe in him and his god, but he did not want to be cremated or buried on his own grave, so he got a woman to do it for him. It's a good story and a story about how religions evolve over time.  it's about 3 pages long, but the information is sparse  I was looking for a fun, humorous, and well written story to add to my history course on religions in Europe. . ,  What the author does here, in addition to having a fun story, is provide background for the history of the period.    I would not recommend this book to someone who wants a short read to do in their history course.   If you enjoy a great story, but don't want to slog through pages and pages of text, then this is a good choice.  and it's short enough.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "As a fan of horror literature, this was an excellent read. However, I could not shake the feeling that the author, as an author, was just trying to push a certain agenda.   I think that there is nothing wrong with a horror book, but I am disturbed by how some authors make certain scenes stand out and make it seem like they belong in a horror movie. Even though I am a horror buff, I have always been disappointed by many horror authors because the stories they create for us to enjoy tend to be over the top. I will not say that this book is over the tops, but it is definitely different than the others, and that was a refreshing thing to get out of it. As a fan, I was happy to have it, and I will definitely be reading the next book in the series!   The only thing that bothered me was that the final few pages are confusing. I believe that it is because the author did not finish the story yet, so he wrote a story that would last as long as he wanted it to. So the ending was kind of rushed and confusing, and when I was at the end of the book, I had no idea what the ending would have been.   The ending, of course, didn't make me angry. It didn't bring back the feeling of fear and dread I felt during reading it, but in all fairness, it's a book, and the author isn't trying to make the book perfect, but what can he do? I know that he can't change everything about the story, but he can choose to have the story have the ending he wants, and if he did have the correct ending, it would have ruined the story for me. As it stands, it was an interesting and well written read and I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan or is new to horror.   was a fun read. I enjoyed the stories that were unique, but if you want a more conventional, 'normal' read, I would suggest this one. As an avid horror fan, the author made sure to do justice to his genre, even though the ending is a little confusing. As for the characters, I liked all of them, but the author tried to write certain characters and scenes in a way that made them stand out. The characters were unique and made for some good laughs, and it was a nice change from the usual, 'bad guy is evil and good guy is good'.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a bad copy of another good book.  It lacks the substance and excitement of other well written books.  Instead it feels like a boring rehash of everything that has been written about the topic of writing.   1 star.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a really, really bad book. I can't believe that so much of the effort in making the writing so bad came from a young woman.  This book is the story of a teenage girl who moves in with her older aunt because she is having financial problems (which she manages to make up by working hard and living from paycheck to paycheck). It is a very silly book. The characters are mostly drawn with stereotypes, the only person that I felt sympathetic for was the narrator, who was kind of a sad sack. I really didn't care for the writing, it was all over the place, and the writing was pretty awful to begin with. I'm going to take a wild guess that the fact that she was able to make it through this entire book while being such a crappy writer contributed to how bad this book was. I have never read a book by a teenage boy that I liked so much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book sucks, because it takes you away from a book you might have liked! There are things about the characters that would be nice to see, and some things about their world could have been better explored. Not a bad read, but definitely the worst of the trilogy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I would have given the book higher marks, if only because the author was a really nice person, even if he didn't give me much. However, there are no good things to say about this book. First, the narration style is not appropriate for younger audiences. The narrator speaks to the characters as if they were kids. I found that annoying. Secondly, he uses a lot of metaphors in his explanations. For instance, "The wind in the grass looked like it was moving so fast that it looked like two birds were fighting for its prize" or "The earth was turning in the light of a star shining across the sky" are just some examples. These words don't make sense when read out loud, especially when you can't hear what is being said. You're forced to listen to the words just to understand what is going on, which is very difficult when you don't know the language. This is also something that I don't mind when listening to other people read, because that way you can understand what they're trying to say. However in this book, the narrator doesn't really know what's going on and he sounds like a teenager talking to a stranger. In the end, I was bored and frustrated with this book because I'm sure he wanted to be a good narrator.   Overall Rating:    I will definitely read other reviews and give my own honest review.   a little on the boring side at times, but overall a good read. The book could have been a little more interesting but I liked most of the characters, especially the main character.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________________________ When I opened this book, it was like a dream come true. I never felt more in love with a book or a person than I did with this book. It was beautiful, romantic, funny, romantic. It is not a work of pure literature, but as I read, I was reminded that this book will be part of the classics of literature. It will be the one that I will most often look at when I'm in the mood for poetry. This book is a love story. The love story begins when a young man meets the love of his life at a party. He is the one who takes the risk to ask her on a date. And it was when she comes to him that she finds out what love really is. This is the only book of this kind that I have ever read where the main character and heroine have sex together. And I know this sounds strange, but I felt this was the way it should have been. Because it is this simple, and so very well written. When I thought of the last time I had sex, I thought about how wonderful it was to be the last person to have a relationship before someone else had their chance. This story is so realistic. The story of the two main characters, Marge and her friend, Jane, is so believable. Their story has the perfect balance of love, sex, romance and betrayal. I just knew that Marge was the one. I was just not sure how the story would end. And that is when I began to feel the love and the loss for Marge. This was the perfect ending to the story. It just seemed right to end the book on a kiss. This can't be said for every romance novel. But it can for this one. _______________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad book: *********************** I read this book about 15 years ago. In case you are wondering, the story has changed since then and I'm not sure I'll be reading it again, but if you are going to read it then this review is for you! This book is about a guy in a coma. He wakes up to find himself in a small rural town and a girl standing before him with a gun. "How did you get here, kid?" She asks. "I don't know, but I can't remember much else." He says. And then, because it is impossible to keep up with the plot, we learn that the girl is his sister and his parents are dead. But she's not the only thing we learn about him! *********   When I saw the cover of this book and saw this author's name on it I thought it must be one of the classics. I loved the book and I loved this book. I think it is one of my favorites of all time. The story is about two young boys and their quest to retrieve their lost grandfather. The boy's name is Jack and the boy's best friend is Will. Will is a very smart and independent boy who just happens to have a problem with his head. The two boys are looking for their grandfather in a tiny hamlet near a small lake. I love a story that gets to the heart of a kid's life, especially one that is very much about friendship. The book starts off very light with Will and Jack looking for Jack's grandfather. They visit the town which seems very rural and is inhabited by very old folks. Then the boys notice that a man has wandered into the hamlet after hours looking for his lost son. Will and his friend are curious as to why the man is there. Will tells Jack about the man and when the man comes to the boys they both tell him about the grandfather and how the family had moved to this small town when Jack was little. The man and the boys start to develop a friendship and he even makes Jack promise not to tell anyone what he saw. Jack does what the boys say and the man helps the boys find their grandfather. I also really liked the way the author handled the two boys' problems with their brains. They both seem to have brain-disease and they try to learn how to deal with their problems. When they learn of their grandfather's death they are not as happy as Jack and Will, but they still try to

Write a negative review about a bad book:    - The writing style is very strange and unnatural for me - the sentences are very choppy, and not very coherent.   I got this book as a gift from my mother-in-law because she is a big fan of "Doctor Who" but also "CSI" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". When I got this, I already knew the book was terrible, but I still was not sure about how the author wrote the book (that is, before I had read the other reviews on this website).   In the first paragraph of the book, the author mentions that "in the old days" the characters were referred to as "Mister or Mrs. Smith." (The way in which these characters are usually referred to in this book is as "the Doctor" or "the Professor" and even "the Boss").   The Doctor's name is never used in the book. There is one character referred to by the name "the Prof." and it is never mentioned that the "Prof." was the Doctor's brother-in -law. The character "the Mad Scientist" never has any dialogue, nor does the Doctor ever refer to the character by the same name (although the character "Mr. Tickle" is referred to with the Doctor by name in the end of the story).   to "Mr, Tickle." The Professor, in other words, never says that the character's name was "Mr Tickle", and there are very few instances of "Mr" or any other letters in the name.   the Mad Scientist's name (or "Mr.") is never specified. The Mad Scientist himself (the Doctor's father) has never been referred to, never referred to anywhere in the story, never mentioned by name, never used as a noun (except in a quote by the Mad Doctor and his father) and he is not even mentioned in the beginning of the novel.   a "BOSS" (a supervisor) is not mentioned, nor is there any mention that the Doctor was married (although in the second story, the Doctor tells a story of how he was married when he was 17, but the author never mentions that the Mad Scientists actually married each other). In a scene where the Mad scientist tells the Doctor about his son (the "C.R.A.M." character), he is described as being about 6 feet tall, and this description is never seen or mentioned again in the novel until the end
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was really excited to read this book and to listen to the stories.  However I will tell you that the stories were a little bit disappointing to me.  I am a woman with dyslexia.    I am a little over 6 feet tall and I read by myself at home.   My mom read the book to me, but I think she thought it was going to be just a normal story.  And I wasn't too interested in it.  I'm not a kid.  It wasn't until a few weeks later when I started reading on the bus or while going out that I realized why my mom kept reading to me and I didn't really enjoy that one bit.  The story about the guy named The Lord (that was really creepy) seemed to be more like a lesson about how some people can be more evil than others.   I read about a couple of women with mental issues that are in a group home. One of them was really weird and she took over the other lady's body, which I don't think is right.  They also got into a fight that involved stabbing each other, which could be considered sexual assault.  However, they were really nice to each other and the other girls in the home and they all seem like good people and don't seem to be too messed up in the head.  But the point I am making is that this story I liked was more about some crazy person than about some good people that I like.  One thing I think was really interesting was that the other girl that was being kidnapped by the woman in the story, she got a better life than the woman herself.   When she became the Lord she lived in a beautiful apartment and had an excellent job with good benefits, that seems really strange to me now because that woman was such a bad person.  So in my opinion this story isn't that good. As for the author, I found him to be very annoying.  He talks really fast and his voice is really high pitched.  His prose is really weird. I've never been a fan of slow and deliberate writing but this book kind of made me think it wasn't that bad.  Even though he was kind of annoying, I liked the characters.  When he started talking about his crazy story he was pretty funny to me at the beginning.  After he got really into it he kind of ruined it for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------"My review:"Well. It's funny, well written and very well researched. The book covers many aspects of the life of an average person like me who lives in the US in the late 20's and early 30's during a time when the world was changing. I was born in 1952, but was a child during the first Vietnam war in the 1950's. I grew up in the 60's and 60's when the hippies were at their peak. I didn't have any close relationships with women, but I had a good time hanging out with friends. I enjoyed the book because there were no cliches, which I was a fan of, but it felt like an outsider's view on life. It was interesting and enjoyable to read, but would probably not be for everyone."-----------------------"Well written, well researched, well presented. I like how this is written, and I like it a lot. This book will help you see more clearly than you ever have seen or thought about the world around you."---------------------"This is an extremely good read! I feel like I know a lot of the people who were around during this era and was lucky enough to have many of them in my life. What a fantastic book, I highly recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about those crazy times, and remember a happier time."---------------------"This is a fantastic read. This is a fascinating look into life in the 70's, 80's and 90's and the ways in which it affected all people that lived in those times."-------------------------"The book is a personal exploration of what it meant to be young in those years and what it took to be part of that crowd. I liked the way this book did not try to be the latest book about youth culture but rather was a good old fashioned look into the lifestyle of those times. I'd recommend this book to anyone that likes a good book and interesting details and doesn't take themselves too seriously and doesn it a nice read."--------------------
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- The characters were really annoying and uninspiring. I was bored by the first chapter, and then I read it a few more times and eventually got tired of the main characters. One had a nice little quip to his death scene. I didn't understand a word he said in the death scene, and it felt really artificial to me. The plot was also very weak. The villains were really just there to get the characters in trouble. The whole plot felt very predictable. And while the story was fun, it was too far out to keep me reading the whole book. If I had read it during the summer break when I first got into science fiction, I probably would have skipped it. But now, that I'm a serious adult who has been reading fantasy since I was a kid, I really can't get into a book with such weak characters and a weak plot. I'm sorry it was so boring to read, but that's why I have to leave some good books on the shelf.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you read this book, you have been a victim of bad research.  All that you'll learn from it is that the "New Left" in the United States, led by Marx, wanted to make the class struggle into a religion and had to invent "the theory of classes," which Marx then used to develop his own theories about how the world should be run.      That said, the book does go on to say that Marx really did believe that a revolution will have to happen because he didn't believe that the bourgeoisie was strong enough to handle themselves, and this belief would lead to the creation of an "ideological dictatorship," which was his preferred method of handling society.  This is where the book falls apart.   The most notable thing about this "revolution" was the fact that it was led by a Jewish communist, Leon Trotsky.  It is no secret that Trotsky wanted to establish a Jewish Socialist dictatorship in the Soviet Union.  What is less known is that Trotsky's idea of a "revolutionary" government was very similar to what we now know as the Islamic State.  Trotsky's version of socialism would not allow the bourgeoisie to retain its power, but it would be enough to give it a minority position in the government.  This was why Trotsky wanted a democratic republic, but with an Islamic dictatorship.  In other words, Trotsky wanted the Islamic states of the Middle East to take over the world.  And if you think the United Nations is doing a good job of preventing this, you haven't read this story.  I could go on and on, but this is enough to convince anyone that Marx was a horrible human being.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was at a book signing and had just started The Great Gatsby when a woman asked if there was anyone who didn't like the book, because they couldn't stand to read it. I had to agree with her that I didn't think I would like it, but I did.  So I was pleasantly surprised when the book actually turned out to be much better than I expected.  I loved this book.    I'm always excited to discover new books, especially when it's a book I haven't read.    This book was so different from what I had read of Gatsbys.  It was very old fashioned and beautiful, and really seemed to be based on a true story.  My wife and I loved it and couldn't wait to read more.  Thanks to the author for sharing this book and for giving us so much to love. The most interesting thing about this book was that it seemed to follow a man named Jack who left home at the age of sixteen and began to travel around the world with his "girlfriend" Sally, an American woman.  A beautiful book, the first of its kind.  This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I was absolutely fascinated with the way that Gatsko relates his life as an immigrant in New York.  He is always in love with Sally, his "companion," and yet he wants her to leave for America.  As I read this book, I was amazed at how much time and energy Gatskowitz puts into his book to make Sally seem as glamorous and important as possible, to have her take on the responsibility for her husband's travels.  Sally has to be as glamorous, glamorous, and glamorous as possible because Jack is a billionaire.  The author was able to make her seem so glamorous that he would be hard pressed to find a girl who wasn't interested in her.  When Jack has to return to the USA, he is always asking Sally for a ride, but Sally says no.  Now, I'm not saying I'm trying to get laid here.  Maybe I'm just a very desperate man.  My wife and friends also loved this.  But then there's that part of the story where Gatski is having dinner with his friend, the poet, in Manhattan and Sally comes into the room and says that her family wants her out of the country.  Gatsky looks
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________ This book is one of those books that seems to have so many problems with it that it is almost impossible to make it stand out in your mind. There are a lot of other good books that I think you will enjoy. It is a very basic and un-original series. I was looking forward to reading more about the background and who the characters were and the book was a real letdown. I found it very difficult to get a good sense of who the main characters were or what the plot was about. At some points I thought it was so confusing I almost gave up on the book. I know what I wanted it to be and thought it needed to have been a much more intricate and complex book. At times I was reading and thinking, oh no! I can't understand why I am reading this. There were lots of passages I could have written, that could have been written better, better and better and I could of given up and just gone read something else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a bad read! I had some really great reviews so I was expecting the worst, but this book was so bad. A great many of the things that made the book unique (not the main characters, just the main elements) were all thrown out the window. The main characters are the most boring character I've read in a while. I couldn't get into the story because I could not connect to them. The writing was sloppy and it lacked any type of depth. I feel like the author has become a different writer and there is no way that this story could have been written any other way. I'll give it 3 stars instead of 4 because the writing was very much a "poor man's George R.R. Martin" and I think that is what people really want from an author. If it weren't for that then it would have been a 5 star book but as it stands, it's a 2 star book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to this book for the majority of its length, but by the time I got to the end of it, I felt like I had been let down.   As stated, the characters are bland and uninspired.  The author doesn't have a single real interest in the story itself, but is just looking for the audience to get to a nice finish.  This is what all of the other "love triangles" in these books do.  It's hard for me to take romance in literature seriously when it's all shallow and shallow.  At least in this book, the only love triangle was between the male main character and the female main character, as well as the three women the protagonist dated.  It's a sad sad world, it seems.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________  I read this book to have a sense of what to expect on my first long flight back from the South Pole. I was pretty disappointed. Not because the flight wasn't long (that's what I've done countless times), but the book did not have any "tension" or suspense in it. There was an element of tension, but it was very "familiar" and just "a flight to the South pole." I felt like I was being asked to jump in headfirst.   What I mean is, this book is very typical.   It starts out with a very typical flight story: You'll read a description of the weather forecast, you'll plan the flight, you will do the prep, you get the weather report and you'll prepare for the flight. Nothing really exciting happens. You get the plane ready, you wait for the weather, you're on the plane, you land, you take the plane to the runway. I know this sounds like a boring flight story, but trust me it's very boring in a generic way. What makes this book annoying was that there was a very boring scene on the flight that actually made me feel like the book was trying to get me to read the whole thing. And if I did read it, I felt that it might turn into a "glorified flight to Antarctica". This scene made me want to put the book down and leave.  .     And, the ending was very confusing. After reading this book, I think I'd actually recommend this one to people that have never even been to Antarctica. Not only did I like it, but I found it really interesting and I enjoyed the journey. If you don't like flights to Antarctica, I would not recommend this book for you, but if you do, then I think this book will be interesting for you.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ************* I bought this book based on the blurb. I never read a book so clearly written, so full of plot lines, and so well researched that the author had to invent all of her own. She has made up a lot of stories and invented a lot. She is so convincing that I was afraid that the plot would fall apart at any moment, but it did not. It was really enjoyable to read. And I like her characters. She gives the feeling of her character being real. I also enjoyed her writing style. Her descriptions of what she saw while doing research were so realistic that I thought I was actually there. She was very descriptive, describing in detail the smells and smells of various animals and plants. The book describes a number of things that she saw that were actually just plants. I liked that she didn't invent something that she couldn't see or hear in the real world, but just used plants that she was more familiar with. If you don't read a lot about plants and animals in the wild, or if you don;t care about animal and plant behavior, you will probably enjoy this book. There are descriptions of animals such as dogs and cats, so don;'t let your personal bias get in the way of reading it.   One complaint that I did have was that the characters did not seem real enough. In some cases I had a hard time believing that this person was talking about herself. She made up some stories that sounded like they were real, but in some places it seemed to me that she wasn;t really saying anything that she just wanted to write about. I thought that in a lot more than one place that she used things as if they were facts, or even facts that she knew were true, but didn;t know that they were actual facts. There was a scene where she goes to a wildlife preserve to study how animals interact with their environment. The description is not very good, but the author made the scene seem real by saying that she would go to an exhibit of animals and take them out of the cages. But she never showed any of them interacting with each other. It never seemed like there was any tension in that room as if the animals were actually afraid of the person. They could talk to each other as if she were talking to them. Or if she was talking to a person in the room, they were talking about her to the person in front of them. I really did not know how to feel
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________  The main characters were dull as hell, the plot was dull as well, the characters seemed to have no personality, the world was flat and didn't provide anything to the reader but was boring and hard to get attached to, and the world had little to offer in the way of characters, plot or world. This novel was a waste of my time, although I liked the world of the book and was excited about the next chapter. I have not read a bad one yet. I guess that's one thing I've learned about the genre... it's a waste to go for anything else than the boring ones.   Story: ------------ I am so bored and annoyed about this novel, and all the others that have come out since.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!!I will never read the next book by this author again as this book was very poorly written and did not capture the true nature of the story. I thought it was an interesting take on the story and that would be enough for me but it was far from it. It was the beginning of the second book that is the problem as the story starts to take on a dark and dark direction that did not seem in the original plot at all. I would have given the book 3 stars but the first half of the book I could not get past it. I have been reading other books by him before but this time I did not like it. This is the only one I will not be buying again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got the second volume of the first book in the series, and I enjoyed it enough to buy the first. It has an interesting plot and the characters are likable enough to keep reading. But it is the language and the "twist" that left a bad taste in my mouth. I was expecting a "good" ending for this series, with the main character leaving, being free of his dark past, and having a new beginning. Instead, I was treated to a cliffhanger. What made this even worse is that the author tried to tie up his loose ends with a series of "mini" books that left me wondering what was going to happen to the main characters. The story line seems very well thought out, but I just had trouble keeping up with it. I had a hard time with the last three books, but if there was a chance I could have a whole trilogy of books and not worry about spoilers, I would be willing to try. That said, it is still the same plot and is still well worth the price.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________ I don't know why this book has taken me so long to finish reading, it is just that damn good. It is so easy to read and the plot is so well thought out. The world building and characters are excellent and the prose is beautiful. I read it and laughed my head off for the entire 4 hours or so and it is a nice change of pace to read this book in my off time. This is a great first book. I plan to re-read this series. I will definitely be reading the next one in the series. 5/5 stars, and if you like dark fantasy and action I can't recommend this one highly enough.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, the author tells a story with very good ideas. He has some good ideas about how the human mind works, and that's what's interesting to me. However, I think this book would benefit from not telling a story in a way that's so dependent on how much you believe the characters have experienced a particular event. This is a typical example of the way I feel so many books with good ideas are told; they don't really explain what happened or why it happened, or even try to justify it. And I want to be clear that I really do think a person should read a story about their life, or an historical story. I think it's important to understand the real world events the characters may be describing. But the author didn't want to do that with his character's experience of a particular historical event. I thought this was a serious flaw in the book, and would have been a more effective book if it didn't exist. But I know, it's just a book, it isn't a good book, so it's no big deal. I like the book more because it had interesting characters. And maybe a bit more interesting writing, because the author knows how to give me an interesting character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  the narrator is not the best in the world and I couldn't get into her story. The narrator of the book has been described as "stuttering" and that description doesn't do it justice.  She also "whispers" in her voices and that was so annoying to listen to.  Read a bad review about books you've read:   I have read and listened to many of the audiobook books by James Patterson.    He has such a natural delivery of his narration.  The narration I heard was as good as what I heard from the narrator of "The Girl on the Train". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The problem with this book is that it is completely untrue and, in the case of the section on the Iraq war, flat out wrong. I'm not interested in the history of the US and Iraq. I am interested in how the US invaded and why."  -  "It's not just the history that is wrong, it is the interpretation of what was happening in the Middle East at the time of 9/11. You could not even know it was a terrorist attack until you were told about it." .  I think this is the worst book I have ever read. I think it is a disgrace to all historians. This book makes me want to give up. I have spent many hours writing and reviewing books and have never been so angry. The book is simply wrong.   The History Channel has tried to portray it in the best possible light, but I can't in good conscience support the channel, and would never be on any show if they still showed it.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** I've read three copies of this book. It is the worst. It was not very good. My main criticism is that it was so bad that it needed multiple rereads to get the main characters in it. The writing was bad, the characters were terrible. It made me angry. It makes me sad. But I need to make a note that this is a book that I really didn't care for.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book did not live up to the hype. For starters the story line was extremely repetitive, it is very apparent to everyone that has read this book that the author wrote the book to make money and not to write a good book. I have read countless times that writers must write a book in the middle of their life and they will probably get better as they get older. This author has not done this, and this book is about her struggle to make the most of her life.   There is a very important story line that is never told in the book, it was never explained, but I have a good feeling that it was some sort of a secret in the family that she was supposed to tell them when they were old enough. This is something that would be very disturbing to any children in the future as it relates to child abuse and sex abuse. It would be difficult to believe a grown woman would stay with a child for so long and not tell them any secrets. She just wanted money, for a living. She was not there for the love of the child, it makes no sense, she was not attracted to them, nor did she find the child attractive, she did not even like the child much.   (hide spoiler)  Read this book, and don't let anyone tell you it is about a child in abuse.It is not. It's about a mother and her family dealing with her problems and their problems that came about when they became parents. The plot of this book will make you cry, and the characters will make your blood boil, but the story does not justify it. The book is written by a mother, and while it might be one of the most emotionally honest books of the year, that does not excuse the rest of the book. There is a scene that shows up the mother's problems with depression. The author writes as though the depression was all in her head, but it is not that simple.The author does a terrible job of showing the author's feelings toward the mother. She writes a description that the woman's emotions are always exaggerated. They are constantly depressed, they are constantly sad, and when the mother finally gets to take the child for a walk the mother cries. The mother is a person that I think is well meaning, and is actually trying to do the best she can, but she does make some mistakes that can easily hurt her children.The reader can see why the mother is depressed, she feels worthless, she
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so badly written that even the worst writers would have been ashamed to write such a piece of work. The plot is contrived and stupid to the point where if one were to read the book backwards and forwards it would make no sense. The characters are stupid to an even greater degree than the plot and the setting is extremely dull. In a way it reminded me of the plot of a book I recently finished but that book was much better. The book reads like a poorly written fanfic and if it were given to someone as a gift it would be ripped right out of them. I can't imagine anyone in their right mind would ever read this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:....................................................................................................................................................... If I had to have a good storybook with me to learn about life, this would be my favorite. I was a bit skeptical when I bought it but after reading it, I was very glad. The story of two kids is so cute. I do wish that I had read the other books so I could have understood the characters and their motivations. This book is a good intro to life. I think I will have to get the other ones and add them to my wish list. The author did a good job making the characters real. The book is an easy read and you do not need any prior knowledge to enjoy it.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- --------------------------- I read "Inquisition" in July 2008 and I couldn't put it down. I am a college student who was just getting to reading. So, I was looking for something to fill that time. I got it on the recommendation of my friends and they all loved it too. Well, it was a good book. The characters are interesting. There is some depth in it. But, it still falls flat. The main character is just kind of like a generic badass. The other main character has a story that is better but his character is still kind of a generic bad ass. The writing itself was alright. But it was just too similar to a bunch of other books that I have read. I would say that I enjoyed reading it but I wouldn't recommend it. I did read it, however, so I can see the appeal.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _________________ I just bought this book and was quite disappointed with the quality. I read the first paragraph and immediately knew that the author was a "trivialist". So this book was a bit hard to enjoy. I had a hard time finding things in the book that I actually found interesting and could relate to. I was bored to tears. The first paragraph was full of typos. The narrator spoke about the sun. The sun does not exist. He is a "simple" person and only thinks about the little things. And he doesn't even know why the sun is there. The "simple person" is boring. Not even close to the quality I've seen from many authors that I read. The whole book was just really disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is very dry and boring to read, especially the beginning. I do not like this type of book because it has very few characters and none of them have a lot to say. I think the author is using the story of the book to make a point about the author and his work, and that makes it very disappointing to read.   In summary: a dull and boring book.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________________________________________   "I think the problem with the film is that the book was written for a general audience and had all the expected things in it. The movie is better for a niche audience of people who like the genre. I think it is more successful with the latter group of people than it would have been with the general public. I don't understand what movie producers are thinking when they try and market their film to the public."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book, read it and felt so cheated when I finished it, I couldn't stand it any longer. It was so boring! If you want to learn something about the Holocaust, read a history book from a major publisher, the book was terrible!  A review I would give to a book I am interested in:  The only thing I liked about this book was the first chapter on the German Holocaust that was very detailed. I'm a historian and I find it fascinating to read about the Nazi era, particularly how the Holocaust occurred, who the perpetrators were, the reasons for their actions. I will definitely be purchasing another of this series, I think I will have to buy them all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's just a horrible book. A terrible book. One of the worst books I've ever read. The story is not interesting, the characters are weak, and the plot just stinks. The book is very long and convoluted and it is all the characters running around looking for people who don't know about the ancient gods and the reason why. The author just wanted to put on a "thriller" story that he thought would make people want to read it. Then, the author tries to turn it into a book of witchcraft because it is written in Latin and it's the only thing he could get ahold of to write his book in the language.   The book is terrible and I will never read anything by it. I wish that the author just went back to writing books that he knew people would like.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************************** I've read this book for awhile, but it has never made me a bit happier. Not a single negative thought comes to mind. If it did, I wouldn't read it any more. I feel bad saying this, but I will have to say it, "It wasn't that bad. It wasn't bad enough to keep me from reading it, but there were some things that didn't make any sense. I could understand it when it came to the alien people, but the idea that the aliens were "all about control" and "only wanted a new world", makes no sense to me. In fact, this may be one of the best parts of the book, if that's possible. The concept of a world being changed through war, through political or economic change, is fascinating to me, because it makes you realize what a massive change humans can make. When I was at my lowest point as a man, it was my wife who helped me get through it, who showed me how to survive on the outside, and gave me an understanding of how important family is. That's what this book did for me, and I can't wait to read more. ********* 4/5
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  My favorite books are ones that I didn't really like to begin with. -Katherine Drudi,  Read a positive review about this book: The best book I've ever read! Thank you for writing!  I really liked this book. I found it very interesting and thought it would be a great resource for those who want to become a better writer and to see how the different types of writing can be achieved. It was very well written and explained different ways of writing and it was easy to read. It taught me things about the writing I have never thought of before.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not enjoyed this book.  The author is no good.  The narration is awful.  They didn't even put the book in the correct language for the story.  I was not in any way excited by this story and did not enjoy it at all.  My only other problem with this book is that it takes place in the year 2014 and the people in the story are all in their 30's.  It was very confusing to me because the narrator was only 27 when I finished reading this book but that doesn't make a difference at all to me since the story was so terrible.   Overall I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried to read this book because it sounded interesting on the cover. I bought the paperback and read the first few chapters. After a while I couldn't take it anymore and stopped reading. It was a complete waste of my time. I just want to tell you guys that this is the worst book that I have ever read. The author writes so bad that I don't believe a word he is saying. It takes you a long time to realize what he is trying to say. It's just a mess of confusion. This book is all just about a character named Tommie. There's not a lot to the story other than that one character is a loser. I don\'t believe the author had any idea how to write a character who is good at something and a loser at the same time. Tommy's only purpose in the book is to act as an excuse for why the characters who are in love with him never make it. You don\'  I wanted to like this book but after a while it got boring. I was just bored. I wanted to keep reading because it was one of the more interesting books I had read in a long while. After about 50 pages in it got a little boring to read. I read the last few pages and thought, oh well, maybe I\'ll read it again, but the story just got to boring. It felt like the author was trying to make something exciting out of nothing. It really didn\'t work.   This book has it all. It is about a loser who is in love to someone he just met and then he meets someone who thinks he is a genius. And he is always having fun and living life. This is the most boring book I have read in years.   the only way I got through this book was by just trying to ignore what I am reading and just pretending I am busy and then just pretending that I read all the characters names because I was too tired to remember who they were.  , the person that is in charge of keeping the books and magazines out of my classroom. I would get letters from the principal from time to time saying that he was worried that he got some kind of dangerous information into the classes by the teachers or someone in the class. He would also get complaints from the other teachers saying that one of their students was reading some of the books he got and it was giving them nightmares. I tried to make a note on each one of those
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I bought this book to find out what the word "chameleon" meant in a real world context, and this book has none of the answers. It is not worth the price of admission. I felt like the author used this to make some sort of point that is impossible to make, that of the many ways people have to "change", this was the "the best". He made me feel like a chameleon and it was not the fun kind. It was tedious and boring and I had to read it a third time just to make sure he made it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I got this book because of the great reviews on Goodreads. I don't usually read novels because I find them too confusing, but I found this book really interesting because of its unusual plot, and it has that good feeling feeling to it that is hard to describe. But the story wasn't enough to make me want to read on for another week, and I only finished it in 3 days because I couldn't finish it. I am so confused and unhappy, that this book has disappointed me so much. It has a very interesting plot, but it is really hard to understand what's going on. There are times when it is difficult to tell if what we are reading is an example of a science-fiction story, or if it is the story of a normal person that is going through an unbelievable situation. This book made me really mad that I had to wait until the last third of the book to learn what happened. This will be a book that I never read again.  I bought the book for the graphic novel about the book. The book is about a young girl who is trying to find her missing sister in the midst of her everyday life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________. My new favorite book.   I was a bit worried about this book, but it's really just a very well written novel. The main character is brilliant and she seems to have a very good sense of the world, she's really smart and does well in school and does quite well in her work. She doesn't seem to be a very nice person at all, but she does have the skills to get ahead in the world in a way that many other people don't.  She comes out of college, gets married, and has a son. The world is very good to her. She has a lot of time on her hands, which she uses quite well, she uses her talents to improve the lives of people, not just herself. She really seems to get a lot out of life and doesn't care if she ends up as a statistic. -This is a novel about an exceptionally well-written young woman and the world she lives in.   This is not a book that I would recommend to anyone. The writing is just okay, the story isn't particularly original or particularly well written. It is about a person who is able to get by in the modern world, and doesn' really get much out of it. If you're looking for a good character book, then you might want to check this one out, but don't think that it will change your life.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ************* This book is a waste of my time and money. I read this for the first time about 2 years ago. It is a "how to get rich fast" book. I was excited at the start, and tried to read it when my local library had it for a while. After about a year I was not able to finish it and started reading other things to pass the time. I finished this book about 3 months ago. My entire family loves it and thinks I am a genius for reading it all. I started the book expecting it to be a little boring and not interesting. Well I am surprised that it was the exact opposite. It started off very boring and started to get more interesting as the story progressed. I enjoyed it and did not want to put it down. I would love to hear your thoughts about it. Thanks for reading!
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This was the worst book I've ever read in my life. This book, along with  The Dune Messiah, were the only two books I've purchased from Smashwords in which the author did NOT contact me before giving them a bad rating and allowing them to appear on my list. In this case, the author is Mark Coker. He is a "book reviewer" for Barnes and Noble (a store I no longer patronize) and his book,  The Great Depression, is a very "boring" (for me) book.  As the title states, it is about a writer who suffered severe financial hardship as a result of the Great Depression. In my opinion, he's just not interested in writing a good book. The chapters are so uninspiring (I couldn't stand to read them at all, let alone re-read them) that the overall story just isn't interesting. It's just a big, boring mess of an author trying to "sell" his "own" book, rather than trying to tell a good story. The story isn't too complicated, but it's nothing that you haven't heard before. There's nothing original in the story, but Mark Cocker's writing is so sloppy and sloppily done that it looks more like a poorly-written advertisement than anything else. The entire "plot" is based on the idea that the author and the writer's friend, who are both suffering from depression (the author's friend is also a writer), go to visit the author's father. At the visit, the father dies. After the "death," the author goes on a "mission" to help people with the same issue. (The author calls this "the mission.") The author also has an "extra" book (the "revelation book") in which he has a "reconciled" view of events that took place during the visit. I don't want to ruin it for anyone who is reading this review (or who is the author) by telling you all the twists and turns in the plot that I think are just plain ridiculous, but there's just so much unnecessary stuff that it really looks like a bad "joke" at the end of the day. I really didn't like the book. I think I'm going to be reading about the author in the news in the future (he is currently a guest on "Good Morning America"), but for now, I just can't recommend
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________  "I've got a feeling it won't be very long now."   -from the opening sentence   This is a pretty good book, and I think that the story itself is very interesting. I'm curious to see if I can figure out what is going on in this one. I think the author is pretty good, and he definitely has some talent with the way he wrote his characters. It has taken me awhile to get into it, but it's nice to read a book that I've liked, even if it's not my type of book.   I read this book because it is about a couple that is a "real housewife" and her husband. I was looking forward to this one, and while I will say that the first half was pretty dull, I liked the second half and especially the ending.   the last chapter I couldn't stop thinking about, but I kept on reading because I didn't want to put the book down. I would definitely read this again.
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** I started this novel thinking I would enjoy it. Unfortunately I found it to be poorly written. While I like the premise of the book, it did not work for me at all. I was annoyed by the characters and thought the premise was ridiculous from the very first sentence. The main female lead is too much like a teenage girl and seems to have no real emotional maturity. And the male lead seemed so much like an annoying teen that I decided to stop reading and reread it a couple of times before finishing it. In the end I felt like I was reading something that was supposed to be humorous and witty, but that ended up being a dud.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's all a bunch of garbage. My husband, a teacher, liked it enough to read it (and give the rating as a 10) but the book left me in a bad mood. He also said it wasn't a story he'd ever read. He liked it better than all his other books, including a few he was going to read again this year, as I had suggested. He had also suggested that I read something about the book, so I went to the bookstore and purchased this one, intending to read what he had recommended. The book is nothing like I would have expected. First of all, the book has no plot; the whole story is told by the characters themselves as they think about and experience life. The characters are all completely insane, and the story's premise, that they're all having hallucinations, is pretty silly to begin with. And then we get to the ending: there's no explanation for why they would be hallucinating, and no conclusion as to what would happen to them if they did. It's like the book is asking me for my opinion, and when I say "there's nothing I can say about it," it simply tells me I'm an idiot. My opinion of the book would've changed, had I known this ending, as all I knew was that the characters were crazy, and I wasn't going to want to listen to them. But that's not what really made the story irritating. The main problem with this book, if you're like me, is that the author, as well as her publisher, have a great deal of control over the text. The first chapter is written so in-depth that we get no sense of the characters' personalities, or even that they have personalities at all. The author writes about every conceivable detail of each character's life and experiences, including their religious beliefs and personal history. It is incredibly obvious that all the information the author has compiled for the character descriptions was gathered from the book's online database, and that the writer simply had to write as if the book had gone out of print. While the information is useful for the story, it's annoying to read as it makes you believe the author knows more about the world than the characters, and has to use every possible detail she can find to tell her story. It makes me feel like I've read a book in which the characters are just doing their jobs in the service of a book. There's not much suspense to the story either

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- "There is nothing wrong with the story except for that it isn't that good. The characterizations are not very interesting, and the story is a very weak one. That's about it. It is a boring book that doesn't need to be read in order to get the idea and just feels like a waste of time." - Bookworm Blues "This book is not for everyone.

I would definitely recommend this book." - Lazy Bookworm
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You really have to feel bad for the author, who apparently has no idea how to write an entertaining fantasy novel. He just makes the characters into mindless robots in a "novel for grown-ups" (and that's what it is, right?). You also have to pity the reader, who is expected to suspend their disbelief by believing that some random magical weapon can defeat the most powerful warrior in the known world. And don't forget to take off your "evil" eye (the thing is so bulky and hard to use, and doesn't have any cool powers), because you will never again use it!

I could have done without all the weird plot devices, but the fact that the characters are all so one-dimensional makes it even worse. The characters are really shallow and one-note, and the dialogue is really dumb and unbelievable. This is not a bad novel by any means, just so much more boring than any other books I've read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the story of a little girl who is adopted into a rich family in the 1960's to be very believable. The author did a great job with making the family seem real. Unfortunately the author went overboard with making his family seem like rich people in all respects. He even has his house have a big gold and silver "gift" from his father (or mother). The author also gave them a nice, fancy car. It doesn't take long to realize that the author of the book is only pretending to be a rich man for the sake of the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not sure I would have been so picky otherwise, but this is probably one of the more ridiculous books I've read. The characters are just likeable, but the plot is very weak and really just follows the first two books which weren't bad but weren't really anything special either. It is just another "what happened to those other three books?" type of book, where the characters just get together and do something and it's just kind of a waste of time and never really goes anywhere. The main problem is the ending, which is just so incredibly stupid. There are so many plot holes, so many things just don't add up, and all of the characters seem to have one or two huge problems. I mean, it's almost like they were trying to explain the characters to the audience. It's like they got tired of the previous books and just tried to make the story as boring as possible in order to end it. I'm not saying this is a bad story, but it really just doesn't go anywhere. If you're looking for something a little more original and fun, I wouldn't recommend this. It just isn't really good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors, factual errors. The first two paragraphs of the first chapter are a couple examples of this. In the first paragraph of the book, you have the words "I was a student at the College for Creative Studies, now known as the Dali Art Institute. I started there in 2008. " I did not start there until 2011. I am a student now at Drexel. I did start there in 2004." The first time I was there in 2006, I was on scholarship and did not have to pay anything. When I left in 2011, I only had to pay tuition. So, the statement I made in the paragraph above was a lie. So the entire statement was a misrepresentation. If you don't believe that, you can ask me if I lied to your grandmother. But the way to fix that error is to simply add an asterisk after my name so that it reads, "I am not a student of the College of Creative Studies." But that doesn't fix the lie. Then in the second paragraph, you say something about this person is an "expert on photography." The fact of the matter is that that person has never been a photographer. He is simply an expert on something I do not know. This is in the first sentence: "There's an easy way to tell whether your photographs have been manipulated in post-processing software: Check whether any of the edges of the light gray areas look like they have been punched out." There is no way to be an expert about Photoshop and not know about the fact that any black and white photograph that you print from a digital camera has been printed from the same light gray paper. That's why you have to look at the edges and make sure that there are no black and gray areas left on the edges or they will look like the result of a post-production digital manipulation. That is how the first two sentences above are inaccurate. So what I mean is that you will have to take it up with the author. If he had said, "Photography is an art form, and it is based on natural light, that's fine" then I would have understood the statement. But it has never, ever been an art or a craft. There are people who have been trained as photographers, but it is not an art. And finally, in the last paragraph you say, "This may sound strange to you, but as a self-described outsider
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book thinking it would be about an exorcism that I was doing, but it's actually about the author and her attempts at self-exploration in the aftermath of a failed marriage. This is a very boring book.   I'm a college graduate in social work, and I went into the process of getting a Masters in Human Sexuality thinking that I would be able to do my work with more authenticity.   be warned: don't buy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  the story was not interesting or memorable.  The characters were cliche, the dialogue was repetitive and the setting was bland.  I just got this book on a lark and i was not too excited by it.   There were no interesting or unique characters, just one person's perspective.  The plot was extremely predictable and predictable was not really that interesting.  My only real complaint is that it ended in a way that I think was quite anticlimactic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I went in thinking it would be a funny book, and it ended up being a very bad book. The plot is so bad that I would have given it a 1 star rating if it were a book from the first two books.   The book has a group of people trying to find an old book and someone in the group is a fan of the author. The person who is the fan is very gullible, and gets his information by reading the book to the others in the circle.     So there is an old "Book of the Month Club" book called "The Secret", and they are trying to buy a copy of it because the author left it behind, and the owner is a big fan of him. When they go to the owner, and tell him that he has to put it in the library, because he has a very large number of people interested in the book. So the owner goes out and buys a copy, but it's damaged, the page is worn. So he takes it back to the book club, and they decide to burn it and replace it.  -What a terrible way to make a living  What a waste of time   -It's hard to believe that this old man is that stupid  I'm guessing that he's one of the few people in the country who actually read this book   Well, anyway, they burn it, and he goes to buy another one. So we end up in a scene where they are reading it, one of them is going "Oh, that's the worst book I've ever read" and they're all going "Yeah, I think that's what that is"   And the owner says "It's just a joke".   I don't understand how this can be written, it's so bad. It would not be good for anyone to read it. I feel like it is more of a motivational book, telling you how to do something, and more of an example of "if I can do it then everyone can".   the plot is just awful  -The characters in this book are terrible  They don't seem real   What I don't like about the book is that the author writes a book called book of the month club, with an author who dies, and so the owner decides to have a copy made of the book, but the copy is so badly damaged that he can't get it on the shelves.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is so poorly written, that I almost couldn't put it down. It had nothing to do with the actual book. It was just a boring story, nothing to say, no new ideas, nothing new. If this book was good, then the author would have put some real effort in writing something original. It is written as a novel of a couple, but it has absolutely nothing to contribute to the plot. The book is boring and I have to put it on my list for the rest of my life.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________   This is another one of those "I wish I hadn't read it" books I kept on reading because I was enticed by the cover (I have an obsession with vampires) and then never actually got around to finishing it. The characters are so generic that there's no character development at all, and the story was also very short.   I'm sorry, I keep on telling myself that I should have finished this, but it just keeps slipping away, like it is trying to disappear into the void and never be heard from again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "Some readers have written negative reviews on my books, even if they have only skimmed them to find that they were full of factual errors and were not worth my time. My reaction: I know what I'm doing, it is just as if somebody has scrawled on my wall, 'The author's fault, he did not keep his promise."   I am a former librarian who has been interested in reading my own writing for a long time. But I have also known some people who could read anything and are experts on everything. I find that when I write books, I want the reader to feel as if they are reading someone else's words. I want them to read my writing as if it was another person's words, even though I created it. When I write, I think in terms of people and what they are doing, what they feel, how they think.   Some of the things I have done to create this book, and the mistakes I have made, are not as bad as some reviewers have made them out to be. I am not trying to be a jerk; just sharing my experience.   (Note to self: I should stop using the word "asshole" in my work.)   My first mistake was not giving myself enough time to finish the book. I was writing in a hurry and my wife said, "You can't write like this, it will be too hard to read." I just finished the book a few months ago, so it was hard to convince my wife to read it.  , is a collection of short stories, and when I first decided to write a book, I thought I was going to write short stories. But writing a book is different, and I realized that I did not realize that at first. The whole idea of using the first person to describe what a character does in the second person was not in my mind. It took me some time to realize that you can do that and it makes a lot of sense. Sometimes it took a bit of time and some patience to get it just right.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ~~ I found myself wanting to reread this one and keep re-reading as I was reading about how amazing the first book was and how it set up everything and the characters. Well, the characters didn't do a thing that made me feel that way. They just seemed to do what every other book has been doing since Tolkien and the whole world became about Tolkien. I felt the main characters were just more like the world in the first two books.   I have not finished this one yet, but I plan to. I really liked the first one, but the sequel is a bit of a letdown.  5 of 6 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: *************I will just start by saying that this is the worst book I've read in a long, long time. It reads like a horrible combination of the worst of Dune, Firefly, and Terminator. The whole story takes place in an alternate future and the book is set in the year 2023 where the government has managed to destroy the earth's natural resources to the point of total depopulation and the world's population has dropped to 500 million. The problem is that there are few jobs, and the only way people can earn a living is to be slaves to people who work for nothing. The result is that the wealthy have to live like royalty, spending all their money on sex and drugs while the poor go hungry and desperate for money. This is the perfect setting for a sci-fi novel but it doesn't even come close to matching the awfulness of the story.The story is also terribly incoherent, and this is compounded by the fact that the author has no idea what he's talking about. His descriptions of the future and his attempts to write a story from it are like the descriptions of a crazy person who doesn't read the news. There are too many plot holes to list them all, but there are a few. He gives us a world where no one has been to space in 500 years, so it doesn;t make sense that the only planet on earth with a functioning space program is the one in the book. And the author does nothing to establish the characters or provide the context for the story except for having people go to space as characters and being able to see the planet from there. All of this is done simply to give the plot its kicks. The entire plot is like that, a series of ridiculous events leading up to a massive climax. The author uses the premise of an alternate version of 2023 to do something that he just doesn't seem to understand, which is to have people go into space. What a great idea, right? The plot holes in this book are almost limitless, and it is very clear that the book was written by someone who never read the real news or was even able to tell the difference between an 'explainer' and a 'bible.'This is a terrible novel, and I'd be perfectly willing to bet that someone has already read this book and given it a high rating for no other reason than the author, and that the rating is completely unwarranted. I'm giving this book a 4 stars because it is

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------------------- I really liked this book. The only problems with it are: 1. I don't know where to start. I tried searching for a review but there are none. I also didn't have any other books to compare to it so I can't do a thorough analysis. I thought the book had some good info, but then some of the info doesn't make sense and some is wrong. I didn't like the idea of the book. I just want to hear a more in depth analysis of what is going on. I am in my 30s and I have been depressed my entire life. I have lost a job and been unemployed for a few years. I haven't had a proper relationship in a long time. I was always having trouble and I just felt like it was never going to happen. Now I am married, I have a child, and I am trying to be more assertive and assertive with my husband.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst book I've ever read. I had high expectations going in, but they were met with a book that felt forced and contrived. The characters had no depth, the story seemed rushed, and the pacing was just so off. My favorite character seemed to be one of the most annoying characters in this book, and he was so overused that his absence was almost painful to see. There's not much else to say. It was like reading someone's words on a computer screen.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The narration in the book is very bad. It feels as if it is being read from the point of view of a child or a schoolkid who has somehow been placed in the position of narrator. I feel that the tone and the story telling are poor at times and there are no real characters or even personalities. If you are looking for a story with well written characters and a decent plot, this is not the book for you.   This is the second in a trilogy of books. They are not bad but the author's style doesn't really lend itself to a series or to a whole novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:!!! The book is a bad, no good book. It is filled with grammatical errors, bad prose, bad style, and a lot of bad attitude. In my opinion, it is a poor attempt at satire, which, I think, is what the author was trying to do. I guess a satire should be a good thing, but this is not satire, it's just a bad attempt at one. There are no other reviews that I have read on Goodreads that contain the same type of criticism for this book. I would rather read a satire that was funny. This is a very serious satire and I could not stand it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found myself reading this book for a long time because it was good (if you read fantasy you'll love it, even if your not a fan of magic). The world building is fantastic. The magic is a bit odd, not what I expected, but not bad either. I like the idea of the universe. I don't really get the magic, I guess I'll have to keep reading more to see how it plays out. I liked the characters. I think I liked them in the beginning, but they have developed a lot by the end. The ending left me with questions, which left me wanting more, and the world of the story is interesting. I hope we get more of this sort of thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________   I was disappointed with this book as much as I was impressed with its concept. I know that I have never read anything about the subject before, so I thought it would be a good learning experience. The book seemed to spend more time on history than the science of what was used to cause the destruction. The best example would be the first half of the book:   There are three kinds of metal: copper, zinc, and tin. Copper, being the lightest, is most used in construction; tin is used in jewelry, cooking utensils, musical instruments, tools, and food, particularly chocolate. Zinc is used to make gunpowder and bullets, in which case it is called gun powder, and the material of the bullet is tin. Tin is used primarily for the making of jewelry.   When you get to the bottom of the page, you discover that the book has not read its own history: It says that the first use of copper was in copper plates, which was used in pots and pans. The plates are said to have been used for cooking purposes in the Middle Ages. This does not seem to be quite true, as I did read somewhere in an online encyclopedia that cooking with copper was common during the Middle ages. The author doesn't seem to understand or acknowledge that copper, which is not very malleable and therefore not used for most cooking purposes, did not exist in the medieval Middle Ages, although there is no real reason why it would have been, given the vast array of other types of metals available. So copper and its predecessor metals, tin and zinc, were not used until the 16th century.   is all, the author spends far too much time on the history of iron and copper than on iron and tin: I did not learn a thing about why copper was more popular than iron, or why it was used for so long. I only know that copper was used until about 1550 in the US, because I have read the book, and I have no idea why this is so (I'd be interested to know why the world used only tin for this for so many centuries and no copper). Even though there was no real need for the steel in the early centuries of steel, this was ignored, which resulted in a lot of problems. Also, why the story is so completely different for copper and tin is a mystery. Tin was used all over the world in all kinds of applications, and it was much
Write a negative review about a bad book: *********** *** I am going to try to summarize what I think the worst of the whole book is: * The author seems to think that there is something about being a mother that will make her a better writer. This is not true at all. I know many people who have children who have gone on to be successful in whatever they do. Being a mother doesn't really give one anything more than experience with a child, not to mention the fact that it is very difficult to write about something you haven't experienced yourself. * She thinks that there are different types of women, that there's a hierarchy of women and it's all about how the men treat them. This seems like a very simplistic idea that has no basis in reality. In fact, it's the opposite: it's more like, how do you approach a woman as a writer? Do you start by talking about you, by telling your story? Or, do you just start writing and then see if she's interested in your story, or not? * Another example of an over simplification: she claims that the problem is men are less likely to accept women as a reader because they think women are inferior to them. I wonder if she even knows that women read differently than men? Or do she just want to be the expert on women's reading habits and not be challenged by anyone? Overall, the book is really bad and I think it's based on her own experiences with having a child that made her think that women are less capable of being a writer. That's the last thing I want from a book, to be told by an author that she's wrong because of her own experience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was a complete let down.  It didn't have a lot going for it, other than a good story.  And the story wasn't bad.  But there was no conflict, or even any story. It was just an excuse for the author to use him and a girl that no one really cared about (but is a really really good character.)  It was basically just one big "hey, you guys need to read this," to get you to purchase the sequel.  4.5 stars.  If you like this book, then you'll probably love the sequel...and maybe get my review book in return!  I was a bit disappointed by the sequel, but I guess that's what happens when you're writing a sequel to a first book in a series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a poor introduction to one of the greatest works of world literature in the English language. The story is set in a time where many European countries are involved in a major war. This story is told in a very short, very boring story and doesn't give the reader any sense of what a war was really like. This book will not be for those who want to read about a war from the inside of the trenches. The ending is rushed and a total disappointment.

Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------- I read this book back when it first came out, and was blown away by the plot. It's one of those books that takes an established genre and turns it on its head in interesting ways. The main character, Will, is a very smart, articulate, and somewhat sarcastic girl, who finds herself in a very weird situation. She's in a group of girls who have been adopted as children by a wealthy couple. But instead of having any sort of normal childhood they live in a mansion with a man, who spends most of his time on his computer. Will's family has become obsessed with a fantasy game called 'Nemesis' that is so advanced they've built a whole game world around it. They're constantly working on it and in the process they've made a whole new world of their own. While they're busy being 'empowered' by the game, the main character is trying to figure out what to do. Will spends the first 50 pages of the book being the most clueless and confused character, and I could not stop smiling the entire time I was reading it. And when she discovers the real game world and her family is all caught up in it, it becomes a whole different book. But then she discovers that the game isn't what it seems. It turns out the family is actually very much in on the game as well, and her entire family is a collection of people who've been taken to this fantasy world to make up the world's population. The characters are so interesting that they can be so funny. The plot is also so well put together that you can tell right away that they were all supposed to be in on this game all along, and that they have all been living in a simulation since birth. I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes reading books that are actually about stuff other than what we think they are. (view spoiler). I will definately be reading the sequel to this book to see what happens! (view author's post) I also bought this book when it was first released and it's still the same book. I have read several sequels to this and the original and the plots are just as good. The only change I'd like to see is that maybe they will not have a main character who is the same age as the original. For the first two books they did have a 'big brother' character who was supposed to act as the main plot device for the book. And he was great. This book
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really like this book.  It is a very well written story about a woman's journey to become a successful businesswoman.  It is set during the 1880s and the book is so well done that the woman is very much a part of this story.   She is the protagonist and the main character.  But the book starts off poorly.  The first chapter introduces us to a woman named Annie.  Her son, John, has been missing for 2 years and she and her husband, Peter, are just getting over the death of their first daughter, Edna, who was born with a birth defect called spina bifida and died at a very young age.  In the first chapter, we are told that Annie had a dream that Peter and her sister were in an unknown country with no food, no clothes, no water and with a huge bear, "a huge and ferocious beast".  Annie then dreamed that the bear ate Peter and was in pursuit of her brother and himself.  Annie tells us she woke up, washed her face and hair and went to the creek to wash and purify herself and went back to her house to eat a nice warm meal.  She was so upset when she saw Peter missing, she felt so sorry for him that she went to his house and started looking for him, knowing that he would never be found.  That is all we are shown for the first 20-30 pages or so of the book.      But Annie did not go looking for Peter for very long.  When her husband Peter returned home from work he found the dog chained to the back of his porch and Annie missing.  Peter had returned to his own home after that and found Annie's body.  He was devastated, his wife, his children and even Annie herself were all gone and he was alone.   This is where the story takes off.     Annie's brother, Johnnie, has since been found by the sheriff.  After the story, we read about the man who found the remains of Peter, "Savage".    The story is told through Annie's eyes.  We see the pain she went through in her life as a child.  Then we see the fear, worry and loneliness she was feeling after Peter went missing.   Then she goes to a store and meets a mysterious man, "Man".   He is a doctor who was doing work on the farm,
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- "I was so excited to receive this book. I read some reviews saying it didn't do well for my age group, I was looking forward to it. The book is filled with spelling mistakes, not even one page was read, and a lot of it wasn't relevant. There was an advertisement for a group of men that met in the park and would talk and have a good time together. A lot of times the book was so boring the guy talking was like a ghost. If you are looking for a good read to keep you entertained you may find it but you will be sorry once you get to the bottom. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has several flaws. The narrator is horrible, and there is not a single character that you can actually connect with at any point. There are several problems with the author's writing style: the lack of a plot, lack of development, excessive use of adjectives, and not enough characters. The plot is very cliche. A group of young boys go to a haunted house to play, and find a girl there. They then have to find her way home. That is about it. But it gets better.  My main problem with this book is the author didn't do much research for this book. She decided to take her own little story (that is not even in the book) and make it about a different group of people (because why not?). But she was so desperate to tell this story that she completely forgot how the plot of the book works. She also takes some very creative liberties with how the book reads, changing what is happening from scene to scene, and the narrator makes every character feel so much different to make them seem like completely different people. And then there is the fact that the only person who doesn't feel different is the narrator. It seems like every other character is a caricature of a human being, but the narrator is not. It is extremely frustrating. I didn't want to finish this book, and I think it should have been pulled completely.  The author has also done a terrible job of making sure that people who are supposed to be the main characters of the story do not act like main characters at all. I really wanted to like this book... but I didn The most disappointing thing about this book for me was the fact this was a children's book. There were just not enough things happening that are appropriate for a young child to understand. As a little girl, I would have loved to have seen a little more detail put into this book about the history of the Haunted House, the people who lived there, and how the house is kept, but I will not spoil anything else that happens here. It didn't have anything that I felt was particularly important or worth reading about, so I don't feel I should give this one a high rating.  I give this book a 2 out of 5 There are several other books I loved and/or hate that you may find interesting: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I finished this book so fast that I almost didn't read the rest. I'm so glad I did because it is just like the first half of the book. It's the usual story with some more action. I guess it could have been a good story if they added some of that kind of action but it's just as boring as the first. I didn't get why they would need to do this.   There was no good use of music but it may have been because the characters weren't that likable.   is the only thing that makes it worth buying, however.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book I've been waiting to get my hands on for years, but that I wasn't sure it was ever going to be made public. I'd heard that it's a long story, but only vague descriptions of the plot made me worry. But then I saw the cover art. I've never read a book cover as good as this. It's so amazing that this is so good that people were willing to pay $30 to get it (for an author who doesn't actually write the books). The story itself was very entertaining. My only regret is that I couldn't get it earlier!
Write a negative review about a bad book: ______________________________   So I was told to look for a "sugar free" book about the human body. I wasn't looking for a cookbook, I just wanted a "quick" read. This is a quick read... but not what I was expecting. I'll tell you the main reason for this review, it took me an hour to finish the book and I have already finished the first two books in this series, so I had to read a few more pages just to get back to where I started...   What I was not expecting was the poor quality writing. It was so poor, I was really annoyed and didn't care for the book at all.   I don't know if it is my eyesight, or I am used to using my Kindle as an editor to make my writing better, but the way they write words is not what it should be. I get confused every time they write "a" or "an" when they mean "that" or even "is" for "this". The word "of" is also confusing because the writer is not sure which word to use, and that's when you have to stop and think for yourself to figure out what they mean.   and the grammatical mistakes just make me go "What?"   Also, this isn't a children's book; I expected better writing.   with all that said, I'm looking at the book as a good story and some information about what happens to people when they get old and sick, and I can't complain about that. But the writing quality is what I don't like about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _______________________________________________________________________________  In the early 70's I started using this magazine to pass on the teachings of The Prophet Joseph Smith. At the time there was a little pamphlet for each ward. The one in my ward was the most helpful. The Prophet spoke of this being his last conference address. I thought he was talking about his family but it turned out he was speaking about the members of the Church. The article in that edition was a review of The King Follett Discourse and contained several errors. The only person that could correct these errors was the prophet himself. He said he would send one copy of the correct version to each member of the church. Then he did. After that I would not use that edition and kept my copy. Now after a while I found that some of the mistakes had gone and some that had not. There are some that are really wrong. I think there were some that were correct. I don't remember all of the ones that were incorrect. They are very few. But I do know that at least one of the problems was the word "Gaspard" which was written over and over on page 11 of that edition. It was right in the middle. Now it was correct to the last point and I would have corrected it but I could not figure out the spellings. But even the spelling "Gastard" was not correct because it should be Gastard's or Gastard and the "s" was a "z." But even that was wrong. Even that was not corrected. So when I got this new one and read it I was shocked and appalled that a prophet of the Lord could write something like that. He was wrong in the first place. If he had the skill and wisdom to write a review, why did he not have the wisdom to spell "Gaston" correctly? I really don't know what to think now and how can I go back to this book? I am sure that I will go back and correct the mistakes. But if I do that, it will be in the future. I will not be able to enjoy the peace that comes from knowing that I have followed the prophet Joseph Smith when he had a chance. I may not remember a time in my life when I would turn to the Prophet for answers when he asked. This is really the first time in a long time I can appreciate that when the prophet of God asks a question that the answer is to be found somewhere in the Doctrine and Covenants,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's too long for the book and the plot is too shallow. It also doesn't explain much about what happened to the characters.   I just want it to be over so I can go to sleep now!   - a little girl
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a bad read.  My problem was not that it was a bad novel, but that it lacked the quality of a good novel.   It lacked the plot-driven twists and surprises that are so popular with modern fantasy.  In fact, for the most part, the story is predictable.  The heroes have a "final adventure" and that's the last we will see of them.  So when is the last time we saw our hero escape the clutches of evil?   How long is his journey?  For that matter, how much time has he had to prepare for the inevitable battle against the Dark Lord?  Where will it take place?  A lot of it didn't make any sense.  There was a lot of talk about the Darkest One but not so much about the hero.  A part of me wanted to read more, but there is a limit to my patience and my attention span.  This book also lacks any emotional depth that can be found in an action book.  It is more about killing the evil forces than fighting them. I was looking forward to a sequel but I really think that it is better left as a one-shot.  My disappointment may not be enough to make anyone change their opinion, but it may at least put the book in a place for them to reconsider.  Overall: 4 As much as I would like to give this a 5 I have a hard time believing that this novel deserves 4 stars.  I think that I would have rated it 4 stars even if I did not have such an issue with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a good story but it is very poorly written. The book takes itself way too seriously about the various "cultures" of the ancient world and what it meant to be a "cultist". It tries to make a "dramatized" account of what it means to be an ancient person and the way they relate to people in the real world. It was interesting to me how some of the details in the "drama" were so far from the reality of the times I grew up in. The details are too fanciful and don't correspond to the facts. I feel as if the author has an agenda of making the reader think they know about the ancient period because he knows exactly what he is doing. I think the book is more of a "history" of "cults" than anything else. 7 of 7 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book: ____________________________________________ A very basic book, well written but nothing special. No wonder it was so popular. I read it to get my mind off of the "other" book I'm reading right now, and the story of how I got into the field of genealogy. This book does a pretty good job of showing that a simple genealogy book like the one I mentioned (A Guide to Genealogy: Family Tree Genealogy ) was much more complicated than anyone realized, and that there's more to genealogy than just family trees. I have no idea why it was written this way, but it works very well in this instance.
Write a negative review about a bad book: --------------- I read "The Dark Between the Stars" before I went on the trip to Alaska and never again did I read that type of book. It is a book about "the Dark Between The Stars" a mythical place that supposedly exists in the heart of the North Pacific Ocean but which is only known to sailors who were once lost at sea and never came back to shore. This was my first book about a lost ship. This book is a good one but with the amount of detail that is used to get to the "Dark Between the stars" you are not really sure what is going to happen next.   The only thing that I liked about this book was the way that the author described the "dark and stormy night" and "the dark and stormed shore". These descriptions of the "North Pacific Ocean" seemed to add an extra layer of feeling to the narrative. This is not a book I would recommend to anyone.   and you can find this book at:   Amazon.com
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed reading this book. As a former Catholic, I've always felt the need to know what the Catholic Church has done and what it hasn't, and this book gave me both of those things. It's interesting and it's well written. I was also amused by how much the Catholic hierarchy was really worried about the pope in these early years of the popes, even though he was a man of science.   Overall rating: 4/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was given this book by my friend, and it made me a horrible person. This book was absolutely horrendous. This is not to say that any one was bad or anything, I just think that this book was a total flop. For starters, you have the author not really giving a fuck about the story and how the characters feel, and that made the story really uneventful. There was no build up, no development, no emotional moments, and you end up feeling really cheated. Then, you also have the characters being extremely annoying. In fact, the author said that the main characters were annoying in every book. I don't think he meant it in a bad way, but just in a way where you just can't get into any of the story. The main character, who is named "Ralph," has some weird sense of humor (that is not even funny) and he seems like he doesn't really care about anything. He is also very manipulative and has a big ego. In a way, he was more annoying than the other characters. The other characters are also really annoying, and they don't feel like they actually feel. There are many times where I was left confused by their actions. For example, "Nora" was the only one who didn't feel anything about the events and had no problem to jump into the action. The rest of the characters all had their own little problems and I just could not get into the story anymore.I am not sure if this book will make a good book for younger kids, or if it is just an awful book for adults. I was so bored I couldnt even look up any of their names, and even then, I would have to look them up.
Write a negative review about a bad book: -------------------------- I received this book in exchange for an honest review. It was a good read and I did not see any errors of fact that could not be corrected by a quick search online, but the information provided about the history of Islam is wrong. The author makes it clear that Muhammad was not a prophet of God, but he was a military leader who was responsible for the slaughter of thousands of people, including women and children. I had also heard the story of his wives being treated cruelly by Muhammad and his men because they are not "worthy" of Muhammad's attention, and this story was made even worse in this book. What is most amazing about this book is that the writer's explanation is so weak that I don't even see why she bothered to try to prove the facts as presented. She did not even try to be historically accurate. This book is not worth the time of a person who is interested in learning about the real history of the Quraysh Arabs and Islam. Recommended for those who want to hear the negative side of the story: ------------- A good example of historical inaccuracy is the book by Peter Beaumont: http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/beaumont.html ------------------------------------------------------------------- **Reviewers:** * * * ------------------------------------------------------------------- The Arabs were not a peaceful people. They were a nomadic people, who lived by raiding and conquering people. Islam was brought to them by a small group of people who wanted to live a pure and moral life. They did not want to fight with each other for tribal wars, but they did not fight their neighbors either. In fact, this is one of the most fundamental principles of Islam: no fighting with each others. So, why did the Qur'an call them an enemy? What did they do wrong? And why did they go to the hell of infidel infidelity? There are many answers to this question, and it is really a good book to read if you want to understand how the Qur`an was revealed. The book is in three parts. The first part talks about Muhammad's life as a slave. The second part deals with his early life in Mecca. The third part is about the first caliphate under the Prophet. The whole book is very well written, so I highly recommend it. But this book did make me question how the Quran was revealed and was there some mistakes in it? -------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a negative review about a bad book: __________________________________________ I've been reading this series for many years and I'm sad to say this is the last in the series. My biggest disappointment with this book was the poor writing, pacing, etc. - I'd give it an F, but I can't. I also got a bit confused by how things were progressing and who was on whom's side. The main plotline of the series is all about the main character (and her mother) being in love with the evil queen. I get that, the first part of the book was a love story. But, as time went by, things took a turn for the worse. I guess it was a good idea to have the king as a villain in this book. I just wish they had made things a little more clear. I'm going to try reading the next book but don't plan on picking it up unless they bring back the main female character. This one got me a little angry and a little frustrated.
Write a negative review about a bad book: _____________ __________. I got the first book (and I'm still reading) from this author, but not from this other author (if that's a separate author, you know who you are, and you should be ashamed to have bought it from him).   For anyone who would be looking at this book, it's worth trying a book from her "universe."   I have read a few books by this author (and other authors who are really, really, ridiculously good), but I never found a book that didn't make me laugh or smile or even make me angry (the anger was mostly for her, because they are so good at writing about being bad at everything)
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had never heard of this book until i was about 10 or so and my mother started bringing it out of the attic and read it to me. I didn't like it so i got rid of it in the next 2 years.    I read this book a second time after a few years to try to understand the point. It didn't make any sense to me, i was just in a trance to what the author was trying to do. A review of this novel I received in the summer of 2017. "An interesting novel from the great R.E. Stover, a story with a moral that isn't so great. It's difficult to describe and hard to understand." Review written by  Anonymous  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book back when I was about 17 and I hated it. In fact I gave it 4 stars.   In this book the main character, who is supposed to be some sort of mutant but is clearly not, finds out his powers can be used for evil and he uses these powers to commit horrible crimes.  They are so bad, that when he realizes his friends are being killed by a group of people who are using his powers to do their evil deeds, he tries to help them out of their situation only to have them turn on him.  It is horrible and terrible. I think it should never have been published and it was not worth the price of the hard copy it came in.  The story could have been better and the characters could have had more development.  But then again, I think I was 17 when I read it, and that's really saying something.

Write a negative review about a bad book: ------------ I read this book at work and the entire time I was thinking "this is the same boring crap as every other book I have read in my career." It was so boring that I had to put the book down before I had finished it. I have had this book in my library since the beginning. It was very well written and it was a fun read but I will never buy another book of this genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book: ********** The next time I read a book by another author I am not sure I will like it. The characters are too wooden and I don't think there is a real plot. The last chapter with the ghost ending was really bad I wanted to cry but I thought to myself "I would rather cry over a bad ending to a bad movie or book." I am still reading it and I have to be honest I have not finished it yet I really want to finish it just because the ending was so lame and stupid. My favorite books are the ones I hate. Good thing I read this book before I was tempted to read another one about ghosts!  2 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This is a fun story, with great characters. I found it interesting that there were two girls involved in the story, and it makes the story interesting.  A little short-sighted, but I am not one of those who believes a good story has to be very long.  and I would have liked it to be a bit longer. I am sure my other reviews will provide a more complete perspective on this novel.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last book I read (the first book I've ever read by a female author) was this one. I thought this would be a good book because of the premise. I like to travel and read, so the idea of travel with a female who has never traveled before seemed interesting. However, I really hated it. I loved the premise of it. However the story didn't follow the premise at all. The only other book I could think of was one of those weird, boring, depressing and boring (like a good part of the book is just a long description of the author's feelings) books about women in a patriarchal society. That was one that I liked, although it was in the 60's so I guess that makes it old. The main character was just a complete dork and I thought it was just sad that I didn't get to know her a little better. I just want to put it out there that I hate the concept of a traveling female protagonist. I think it's because the only female I've known who has traveled has been on a long distance relationship and we had to travel a lot to visit her. It was really difficult for me to connect with her, because even though she was good in the first half of the story (which is how I felt when I was reading it) she just seemed too selfish and was not really in love with anyone or anything. I'm also a little torn because the main character, which I thought was supposed to be my favorite character (the one who got into all of the trouble) ended up being my least favorite person in the book. It felt really forced and weird that she just couldn't seem to let go of her old boyfriend. I was also really disappointed in how the author didn't explain why she wanted to go to Vietnam.
