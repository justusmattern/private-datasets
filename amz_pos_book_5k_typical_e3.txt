Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is an excellent guide to a great book.  It is easy to understand and provides plenty of practical information to get you started with the essentials of running a marathon.  The only negative review I have is that there are not as many detailed recipes as there are in the book. I would have liked to see recipes for every dish or drink that would have been useful 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was amazing.  I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking to learn a little bit about the history of the American Indian and his/her culture.  The author, John T. G. Anderson, takes the reader on an excellent journey through his research and presents information on both the history and the cultural aspects of this ancient culture. In addition, he presents a few interesting observations that will make the reader think.  If you are an American Indian, or even just interested in Indian history, this book is a must

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent introduction to the works of the early 19th Century. It was the first book to be published by the new British Museum and the first to be used in the museum's educational program. It has been reprinted many times since and is still available for viewing in the Museum's gallery. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book and I wish that I had read it earlier.  I enjoyed the story and I think that the main character would have been quite a challenge for me as a young girl, but I was very pleased with how the story was presented to me.  It was written in a very simple but interesting manner.  In the beginning of the book the characters have to choose a friend and go to visit her.  The friend chooses a boy and then they go to see a movie and then to dinner.  Later on they find a book on the subject of what a girl wants in a boy.  They read that chapter and go over the choices in it.  If they make a bad choice the boy will lose his friend and they go on to visit another boy.The story is told from the point of view of the girl.  She is introduced to the boy who makes the decisions, and she goes over the reasons for her choices.  Each chapter is a different story and it is told in a manner that keeps the girl's identity hidden until the end.  This makes the story very interesting 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a child and still find it useful.  It's very informative and the stories are interesting.  I would like to see it expanded upon, especially with the information in the appendix.  The stories are so different from one another that I would be happy to see a whole series of them.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great!  It is the story of the life of a homeless man who lost his wife and daughter in a terrible accident.  It will give you some insight into the life and death of a man who has lost his own family and who has found his way to a life of homelessness.  If you are homeless, you will understand the pain of losing someone and you will know what it is like to be homeless.  This is an important book.  I wish it was written by someone else.  The author does not talk about politics.  However, he does talk about homelessness in great detail

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is just great.  I love all the stories.  Each one is a little bit different, but it's all so funny and sweet.  This is a great book for parents, teachers, and children.  The book is so full of beautiful pictures and funny stories. It's so nice to read, but the illustrations are a bit much for little kids.  Still, the story are so good, I don't care 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an incredible gift.  I have always wanted to read a biography of a good electronic device, and this book has helped me in that task.  The book has a lot of information about the Apple II and IIGS, and it is not too much to know what Apple was doing in the 1980's.  But it is much more useful than just the history.  It is a great book for the average consumer.  There is a lot in it for the enthusiast as well.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a lot of interesting insights into the art of the book.  It also presents a great deal of the art that goes into making a good electronic device.  This is a great book to use for those who want to learn how to produce books on a budget.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read many good books on international affairs.  I thought it would be a fun book to give to my students for their upcoming college or university studies.  However, I was amazed at how this book truly answered all of their questions and was a great source for information.  This book is filled with many information that is not included in other books on this topic.  It also has some great stories and illustrations that really helped me with my first international assignment in college.  You can't beat this book for it's information and pictures.  Don't be afraid to read this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a graduate student studying international relations at the University of Chicago. I am very interested in the development of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.  I have found many interesting books on this subject, but this one stood out for its clarity and insight.  The book is a combination of history and analysis.  It discusses the history of the region and the challenges facing the United States.  However, it is clear and easy to understand, and the book contains a good overview of the key points of the debate surrounding the Middle Eastern conflict.  Most importantly, the book presents an argument that is persuasive, concise and clearly explained.  If you are looking for an in-depth, in-the-slightest-way overview on Middle Eastern politics, this book is for you.  There is plenty of information, but it is concise and accessible.  As a general book, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about Middle Eastern affairs.

This book is a true delight for those who want to learn how to cook, or just want to know the basic techniques needed to make their own fresh homemade pizza, or any kind of food!

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have a lot of stories to tell.  I don't always have the time to go back to them for revision, so I try to keep my story collection organized.  This book is a treasure.  It gives you a little background, some ideas on writing and characters, and it has some excellent character profiles.  In addition, it gives you tips on how to create an entertaining book.  All the stories are great, but the best stories are the ones that are told from a third person perspective 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the best book I've read on the subject of American politics.  I will never be able to put my finger on why, but the ideas presented in this book are so relevant to the United States today that I wish I had read this book before I ran for the Senate.  If you are interested in politics, I would highly recommend this book.  The ideas presented are practical and not abstract.  What makes this book unique and interesting is the fact that the author is a practicing American politician who is trying to persuade the reader that there is a different way to achieve the same goals.  These ideas are not just theoretical.  They are practical.  And they are presented in a way that is understandable and accessible 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very helpful book for anyone who would like to learn how to read more easily and quickly.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a little shocked that this book is so popular.  It is very well written and has the right balance between the drama of war and the more typical, more simple and direct account of the history of a battlefield.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a few of the many reviews on this book. It was one of the few I read on the topic of The Seven Deadly Sins in my Christian upbringing.  I had not read this book until I received a copy for a family reunion, and it was exactly what I was looking for.  It's an excellent book, very informative, and contains many examples of how to live out our sins in a positive manner.  However, I did not realize that it was the only book that dealt with this topic.  There are others, and the author of this book is great, but this one is my go-to book when I want to know more about The Seven deadly sins

If you want a good story and lots of action then this is the book for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read and loved all of the "Mortified" series by Anne McCaffrey, and I was eager to see where Ms. McCaffery takes her characters, and this book does just that.  The characters are as funny as they are intriguing, and the story itself is truly a work of art.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys humor and intrigue, and especially to those who enjoy fantasy literature.  There is a lot of "what ifs" and "could have beens" that have left the reader asking questions, and that is exactly what makes this book so engaging.  In the first part of this book, the main character, Anne, is forced to deal with a young girl's death, and then the plot develops into a larger one that will lead her to a secret world, to an alien race, and ultimately to the fate of humanity.  This is a thrilling tale of adventure and mystery, and it's one that I would read again and again.  It's so well done that I want to see how it ends

I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading children's books, and especially children who are learning to read.  It is very well written, and very easy to read and understand.  All in all a wonderful children's book

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book, with a very thorough description of the history of Christianity, and its place in the world.  I especially like the "A History of Christian Origins", and the "The Origins of Christianity" chapter.  These are the "real" Christian origins, and they are written by the most credible Christian scholars.  In other words, these are the sources from which you will receive the traditional Christian beliefs of the church.  They are, however, not "traditional" by the standard of Christianity  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read and loved many of the books I've mentioned in the reviews so far.  In this book, Paul Elam does what he does best and uses his writing to teach us how to be safe and how to protect our family.  It's a simple but excellent book that will not only protect you from abuse but also show you how to make positive changes to your life so that you will not be abused.  I highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first half of the book is a wonderful introduction to medieval history. The second half focuses on medieval and early modern life in the region.

If you want to learn a little about life in that time period, this is the book for you

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read many books on a subject and have yet to read a book that I have found that truly helped me in my quest to find the best book on the subject. This is one of those books that I will always use in my studies and will always recommend to other people who are just beginning to study the subject of money. I was looking for something that I could use as a study guide and that would make sense for me to read at least once a week.  The title was "How Much is Enough" and I immediately thought of the title of my study guide 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful book to teach kids about the world. It covers a wide range of cultures, religions and even some aspects of the human soul.  The main theme is to be aware of where we come from and where we go.  I really recommend this book for children who are just getting into the world and need to know a little bit about it.  It is also great for adults to read to young children as a refresher for what they are learning about the religion.  If you are a believer in the LDS faith, then I highly recommend this as a wonderful gift for your child to read

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you haven't read The King and the Queen, I'm sure this book will give you everything you need to know about the history of royalty in England.  The history of the family of King Edward III (or I) has been much covered in the media and in the history books.  But in this book, Richard Plantagenet and Katherine de Plantagenets have taken a new direction, exploring the roots of their family and the role of their families in shaping England's history.  There are some interesting historical facts here.  And the pictures are wonderful.  I would recommend this book for anyone who has an interest in this history and who wants to see what it looks like in the modern day.  You will learn much from it and I hope the King and Queen will return the favor

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's the only book I ever read and it's still a good read. It's a wonderful book.  It really shows the differences between humans and animals.  The author writes about the similarities and differences between us and other animals. There are a few times in the book that are a little over the top (like the "you can't tell if they're alive or dead") but overall it's a good, interesting book. The book gives some interesting insights into animal behavior.  If you are new to this area of study, I highly recommend this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am in love with this book.  I wish I could have read it as a child.  The author gives examples of how to use all kinds of plant foods for the healthful diet, and gives recipes to make delicious homemade food with such foods.  These recipes and directions make for easy and enjoyable meals that do not require any cooking skills.  For those who are new to making food with healthy ingredients, this book is an excellent starting point for those new to using vegetables as an alternative to fast food.  My kids loved this book and enjoyed making meals with it!  This book is a great book to use for school and home cooking lessons, and I would encourage all parents of school age children to give this book to their children as they begin to learn the basics of healthy eating 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first in a series of books about the early history of American literature, and I am thrilled with the quality and insight this book offers.  I have read all the previous titles, and the series is really beginning to take off in the minds of the readers.  The authors' interest is in the origins and development of American literary art, and they use the term "genre" in the broadest sense to encompass all types of literary texts.  It is a remarkable achievement to see the influence of such a diverse group of writers from different periods in the past.  Many of the writers are of the older generation (and younger) than I am, and many are quite well known, but the reader will find a wealth of information here.  In fact, the series would be incomplete without a section devoted to the writings of William Blake.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book.  I read it in the early 80's.  It is a great introduction to the history of music.  There are a lot of great information in it.  But, as a teacher, I would recommend that you read it again after you have made some music history related discoveries.  As I said, this book is great for beginners.  For the more advanced student, I have an excellent book, The History of Music, which I have been using to supplement my course.  The information is much better in the former, but, for the teacher, the latter provides much more comprehensive, deeper and richer information. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book for anyone who is trying to decide what they want to do or who are just starting out with their new book.

It is a very good book to give to a child, as it is a wonderful book to read with your children.  My son has started a bookshop and I am very proud of him and how well he has done.

It is one that could be used in a variety of settings, from high school to college, and it provides some basic information on the fundamentals of a very useful tool.  In this, the book does a great job of covering a very basic concept with a very practical approach.  The book does not offer much in the way of theory or examples to explain the concept, however, there are plenty of examples to demonstrate the concepts.  There are several chapters on topics such as starting a book, writing a positive book review about another good book, etc.  A great book for anyone wanting to learn the basics and start a successful book business

I wish more people would write a negative review about this book, but it's a wonderful book and I'm sure it will help you.  The book is written in a way that you can pick it up and read without having to reread anything or make any assumptions.  For example, I find that a lot of the examples I see in the book may not be useful for me, but the examples are there if you want to read them.  Don't worry about all the assumptions in the example or the whole "if you do  " that you might have, that's not a bad thing

The "A" book was a bit more dense in terms of facts and information, and the "P" book, which I am currently re-reading, is a much more in-depth look at all the information, details, and trends that I wish I had known before starting this project.  I will certainly be picking up "A+" for the first time in October to re-read this book and get more information on the World Wars.  Overall I think it is a very good book.  There are some points I would like to see expanded upon, but I would not say it is the best book ever written.  But for the price, I can't say I am disappointed

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the book for an exam in my graduate college literature course. I wanted to read more about the people and events in World War II.  The book was an excellent guide to understanding the historical events that took place during the war, and it also gave me some history to look back on and analyze the choices made by the leaders of the world in the early part of the 20th century.  It was great to read the history of the German and Japanese leaders, the American forces, and the Russian forces.  There were some details that I found myself remembering as I looked back at the current events of the war.  I would have liked to have read this book again, and I am sure it will be a book that I would read for many years to come

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read many books on the history of the United States and I've always found them confusing.  In this book, you'll learn the real history behind the myth.  I find it fascinating and interesting that our Constitution was drafted by a group of people who believed in freedom and equality.  The Founders were not only revolutionary but also very egalitarian.  Their principles of democracy, equality and free speech were very different from those that were accepted by the British.  You'll learn a lot more about the founders and their ideas and ideals than you would in any book written by a history professor 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.  I read it in a French class in college and immediately made it my primary reading.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been wanting to write a book about the first book by John Kennedy.  I knew that John had written many books, but I had never read them.  Kennedy wrote a short story, "The Old Man in the Mountain", in 1953.  It was first published in 1954 and then a few years later he began "The Man Who Saved a Little Girl".  I love this book because it is very short and very touching.  The story is told in the first person, and the book ends with a chapter entitled "The End".  The end is very bittersweet, but it is also very brave and brave in that it is the end of a very dark and dangerous story.  But the end also brings to a conclusion that is quite sad.  This book is a real must-read for all those who want to read the John Kennedy story....

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book because I want to learn about a little known topic: The origins of the American South.  This is an important subject that is being explored by many historians.  If you want to understand the origins of a region, then this book is for you.  It is an accessible, concise and engaging look at a long, dark and fascinating period of history.  There are some interesting and informative observations and references, but the main focus is on the role that religion played in shaping the American experience.  I especially like that this book doesn't spend much time on the actual history of the South. The focus is more on the people and their history.I recommend this book for anyone interested in American history and the South, but especially if you want an easy read on this important topic

Write a positive review about a good book:  The title of this book says it all. It is a wonderful book. It tells the story of the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who is widely regarded by both Mormons and non-Mormons alike as the founder of the Mormon Church. It also chronicles the history of the Church from its inception in the late 1800's through the present.  The book is a must for any Mormon, especially those interested in the history and beliefs of the Latter Day Saints, or any believer.

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you have never read a book, or even considered it, I am sure this one will do wonders for you.  I do agree with a previous review in that it does a great job of bringing the reader into the experience of a very complex and interesting story.  The book is the result of a collaboration between author Robert B. Anderson and artist/journalist John Zorn, who created the illustrations.  Zorn was a great help in providing the text for the book, which Anderson himself has done, and I am pleased that both have agreed to a long-term collaboration.  What I find most interesting about the book is that it explores some of the themes of his previous work, such as his interest in art and his role in the creation of his work.  Anderson, like Zorn has a fascination with what he calls "the strange".  These themes are the basis for many of the drawings, which are beautifully done, as are many of Anderson's illustrations. I think his interest with the "Strange" is the main reason the book works.  It is truly wonderful to see the drawings from his earlier work and see some of his later work.It is very difficult to write a positive book review about one that you have not read.  One thing I would say is that this is a good introduction to Anderson's work. It would be a shame to miss out on this.  If only more authors would think about what it is they want to write.  This one is a wonderful read 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I really hope you'll like it too! I feel it is a very good book that I would recommend to anyone.

Also, I love the section on the history of the army in the United States.  It's a great book to take to your high school, college or university class.  For example, the book provides a list that will help explain the origin of the word "army" and the first battle of New York.  This book is great for a military history class as well as for a high school or college history class

He has covered the main areas and has added much more in other areas. I would have loved to have seen this book before I had to begin Bible studies. I had already been studying for several months and was ready to go to school. I can't thank Mr.Roberts enough for this book and the time he has spent with me

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is fantastic, well researched and filled with wonderful insights into a difficult, yet all too common, problem.  The author was so positive about this book, I felt compelled to do some self research into my own personal problems.  I have struggled with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) for over 30 years, and this book gave me a wealth of insight.  It is not a diagnosis, but a description of the problem. In addition to the text itself, the book also provided helpful links to a number of articles and information sites.  For example, the link to OCD.org had a link to a book by a man who wrote about his own recovery from OCD.  He wrote that he had gone through the entire text of the book before he began to see results.  If you are struggling with a difficult problem, I highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great read, and it is a good way to introduce yourself to some of the great people of the past and present.

This is more focused and much more practical

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first edition of this book was just over a year ago and it is now one of the most important books I have ever read.  This book is for anyone who loves the world of art, and has the ability to be influenced by the world.  If you are not a lover of art then you need this book, if you are a lover then you will be inspired to make art.  For me, this book is like a bible.  I have been a fan of art since I was a child and have always been influenced by art, but I never knew the depth of the subject, or the art form, or how it affects us.  The book is full of many wonderful images that are inspiring, inspirational, and will move you, if only slightly.  It will give you the knowledge to be able to create art from your own mind, but it will also help you in your creative journey.  With that said, if I could give a negative review about this book I would say it is a bit boring, but with so many images, it will make you want to keep reading.  However, if your are looking for a deeper understanding of the art, this is the book for you.  Keep on reading, the pictures are wonderful!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys art and is interested in discovering how to be inspired.  Also, this was my first book and I have found this book as an invaluable tool to help me learn about the art 
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you are new to this subject you are in for a treat. This is the best book I have read on this topic.  The book is concise and understandable.  A great read for anyone wanting to understand the concept of an  infant sexuality.  Great book

It is a wonderful look at all of the wonderful art and craft that is the history of music.  You will be surprised at how many people have been involved in the development of music from the beginning of recorded music to the present.  This book is full of information and references.  The first part, "The Evolution of Music" goes through the evolution of music as a form of art.  After this, you will be able to delve into the development and evolution of the orchestra.  So, get a copy for yourself and have fun!

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was thrilled when I heard that this was an original collection of stories by Judy Blume. I was in college and it was hard to find books by her that I could read. This was one of the few books I would take to college.  I loved it!  The stories are wonderfully written and illustrated by Judy.  Her characters are charming, funny, and just the right size.  It's a true joy to see Judy and her characters come alive as they move through their lives.  This collection is filled with wonderful stories and I would like to see a sequel.  My favorite was "The Cuddler", because it deals with her life with her parents.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great.  It gives a very detailed account of the history of the American Indians.  There are many interesting tidbits and facts that may interest anyone who is interested in American Indian history.  I particularly like the fact that the Book of Mormon was found in a cave in Mexico.  This is just great!  The book is a great help to all those who want to learn more about American Indians and to anyone who wants to understand why the Indians of the Americas chose to become the way they were.  The information given in this book will keep you busy for many hours and it will be a great resource for your family as well

I would like to see more of Joyce's work, but in this book, it was just wonderful.  This was not just a personal opinion, but it was very well researched.  It was very inspiring to me to learn about Joyce's life, and I want to see his work more and more

I really enjoyed the characters and the dialogue, and it made me think and wonder at different ideas and perspectives.  The book is short and sweet, but the characters have a lot to say and it will help you think through some difficult and difficult situations 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love reading the stories of the children who were left behind when their parents died.  I think that they are the reason they are alive.  They are the strongest, most resilient, and most beautiful people I have ever seen.  We all wish that there were children who could be like them, but the ones who were given up to us were never given the chance.  If you want to find out who your children are, look no further.  Look at them.  There is no doubt in my mind that they would be so much more alive if they were not left behind.  What a beautiful book!  I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful way to learn how to do magic.  It is a quick look into what is possible.  The author is not only an experienced magician, but also a performer in many different magical acts.  His presentation is very simple and not too daunting for an average person.  For someone with little to no knowledge of magic, this book can really help.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is new to magic and who is interested in learning how to perform magick.  If you are a performer who is looking to enhance your magic, then I would definitely recommend this to you

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is really awesome!  The book is full of useful information that will help you as a beginner in making money online.  The pictures are a great addition to the book, and it gives you ideas on how to market your website.  It is a great book for the first time entrepreneur, as it gives great insight on what you need to do to succeed.  However, this book is not a step-by-step guide to selling online. You should go through a website-building guide before starting to sell your own website, as there are many different options available to you to choose from.  Don't be afraid to try something out, just don't go with the most popular options, they won't work for you.  This is a book that will provide you with great insight, and is very well written, and if you're new to selling, or just want to learn a little more about what you can do with your website to make money online, I highly recommend this book.  You will not be disappointed

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read many books on the topic of marriage, and I've always loved the idea of having a guide for those who are looking for the answers to some of the most difficult questions, like where to get married or where to live.  This book was a wonderful gift to me.  It answered many questions, and it answered them so much better than I thought they would.  I was completely satisfied with the answers I got, and the book is well worth its price 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great.  It's an entertaining read that provides some new perspective on the current state of the country.  I really enjoyed the first few chapters.  The more you learn about the issues, the more you will be able to come to your own conclusion.  In the end, I believe it is the most honest book I've read.  A good book, but it does take time to get to the meat and potatoes of the arguments.  Not a book for the faint of heart 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great introduction to the book of Revelation and an excellent book to teach children. It covers the history of the Book of Revelation, the book itself, the different parts of the book and the stories within the book. The stories are wonderfully illustrated and well told. The book is great for children, but also has many interesting ideas for adults that can be applied to our lives 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was the best book I read last year.  It was such a great story that I thought I could do something similar.  I knew that there was a great book, but I had no idea it was so rich in details.  The book takes the reader through some very personal, dark moments that you can't see the big picture until you finish it 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I first read this book in the 1970's. It was a big hit and I'm still trying to find the original text in a book with so many stories to tell.  I loved the style of writing and the stories.  One thing I do not understand is why there are so many "sudden deaths".  One story, for example, is "The Strange Death of a Woman".  I've never seen that story before.  Why don't they just put all the deaths on a list.  It's a shame that the book is so few in number.  This is an amazing book.  A must read 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has helped me in my spiritual journey.  The concept of rebirth is very important to me.  This concept of reincarnation is a major reason why I'm an atheist.  I have now gone through all the steps of life and I have realized that I am a child of God.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is excellent, and not just for the obvious reason. It's the story of a family of witches, and I love it.  The magic is done so well, that it could very well have been written by an actual witch! The plot is well thought out and has all the ingredients to make a great book.  But, for my money, the best part is the characters.  They're so relatable and believable.  I'm a little afraid they might be a little too friendly with each other, but, overall, the plot is great.  It's a little dark at times, but it's not really dark at all!  I've read a few good books before, and the one that I enjoyed the most was "Auntie Mabel" by John Steinbeck.  A good book, but this one was better.  If you like witch books, I recommend you get this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had read this book for years. It was the first one I read and I got to know it very well. It had been mentioned to me many times and I had wanted to do some reading about it. It is a beautiful book. The photographs are beautiful. The stories are so touching and interesting. There are many wonderful pictures and stories and I wish I had time to do more reading and writing on this book.  I would suggest this book to all children's and adult readers.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book I wanted to read when I had read The History of the Church by Elder B. H. Roberts.  I really enjoyed Elder Roberts' book and it really helped me understand why the Church is so important to so many people today.  As you will read, it is true.  However, there are many other books that will answer some of the questions I had regarding this one.  It is important to know that Church history is very much a part of what we do as a church today. I have always loved the stories of the past and how they affected me.  If I could find out why God gave the Church to the members in the first place, I would be more than happy.  The answers to some questions will come from the writings of our prophets.  This book will be an excellent resource to use in finding those answers.

This is a wonderful book for any person who wishes for knowledge and understanding on the lives and cultures of the native people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a hard time deciding whether or not to read this book.  I was very excited to read it.  It has a lot of great information about different types of food.  Not only did I learn a lot about different foods but also the history of each food.It was very helpful in trying to plan my meals.  You can really see how much thought goes into what you are eating.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book on photography I have ever read.   I will never forget the pictures in this book.  I have seen a lot of photos in my life and I have a very strong photographic memory.  This book was very educational.  It taught me the ins and outs of the process.  The pictures were inspiring.  In many ways, this book reminded me of photography classes I took in school.  But the book did not make me want to become a photographer.  After all, photography was not something I was truly interested in at that time.  However, this was the best of the books I read and it gave me a lot more insight on photography.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was great.  The book was an enjoyable read.  There was no doubt that there are so many great book ideas out there, but I found this one especially helpful.  It gave me ideas for a number of my own books and also helped me to realize that I have been looking at my own ideas in a wrong way

It is a great book to share with kids 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A beautiful book! The author's experience with the Jewish community was as vivid as it is possible to imagine. His descriptions of the Orthodox Jewish community are as compelling as his love for them. In fact, he is the only person who has actually written about Orthodox Judaism that I have ever heard. I cannot imagine any other author doing this

Now that I am an adult, I have read the books several times to help with career development.  I have found them to be an excellent guide to the basic skills needed to pursue a career in any field 
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a little hard to find something on the positive side about a bad book, but I think this one is a little better than some others out there. It has a good, funny feel to it.  The book is about the life of the Beatles, but the stories are told in a way that really helps you understand and remember the Beatles.  It makes you feel like you're in the same room as them as you would if you were the Beatles!  I like the illustrations as well.  I think they are very well done and are the best they've ever been.  Don't think it's the best book by them, though.  But it's not bad, and I think it would be a good one to have for your personal reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I have ever read.  It has so much information about dogs and cat care.  I am so grateful to have been taught this by my friend

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you are looking for a book to inspire you to take your gardening seriously, this is a must have.  It will teach you what to do and how to do it.  I know I will be taking up this challenge and using it as much as I can.  This is a great book, I have only one negative review to make, however.  The book covers very basic garden ideas, but not enough.  If I was a beginner I would have needed much more.  There are some really great ideas that I would like to expand on.  These ideas could be used to expand your garden and garden books, but it would have taken me far longer to get here than it would to just buy the book.  Maybe that is a good thing 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a joy to read, and one that I will treasure for years to come 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a joy to read. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn a little more about this wonderful world we call Africa.  It is very interesting to read how Africans are able to live with such a high level of poverty and still keep their cultures intact.  I would also recommend this book for anyone who is thinking of migrating to Africa or even who is planning a trip to Africa 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must read for anyone interested in learning about the history of the United States. The author has a wealth of knowledge and research on this topic. His book is the first in a series, and is based on research by the Smithsonian Institution.

It covers many of the basic topics, from the nature of poetry to the relationship of the poem to the reader.  The author explains all of this in a clear, easy to understand manner.  It's also a great book to read when you have a spare moment, or for a friend who wants to learn more about the art of poetry 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful way to learn about and get to know a more modern version of the Holy Land.  It gives an amazing insight into the culture and history of the Jews.  The chapters give a very personal insight into what it was like to be a Jew in medieval times.  This is very important because most of the people that make up the religious communities today are descended from people who lived in the Middle Ages.  For example, the Jews who live in North America today are descendants of the European Jews who lived there hundreds of years ago.  So it is very easy for us to be ignorant about the past.  Hopefully, this book will help people who are unaware of the history of their faith to understand their history a little more and to gain a better understanding of their religious community 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must read for all dog lovers, as I am.

The pictures were beautiful, the story was funny, the book was easy to read.  Definitely one of the best animal books I've ever read.I wish I had bought it sooner, but I kept it for myself.  It was very helpful and I will definitely use it for my next animal books 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book after completing my first year of college.  I am not the only one to do so.  The book was written in the summer of 2000.  It is a great guide to all aspects of life.  There are chapters on relationships, work, personal finance, and so on.  You would never know it if you are just hanging out on a college campus.  Most of the chapters are very practical and are the right amount of detail to help you learn about the basics.  As a first year student I had no clue what I was doing.  This book has helped me so much.  My professor, Dr. A.J. Voss, has helped out with many of the answers in this book.  He has also given me great tips on what I should do when I want to get something done.  If you have not read this one, I highly recommend that you do.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. It is very readable, and very helpful in answering the many questions I have had about marriage.

It helped me understand the questions I had and gave me some ideas to help me through some of the tough times in my marriage 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book to learn about American culture and life.  This book is very educational and provides a lot of information.  I especially enjoyed the history sections.  However, there are some minor errors and the author could have used more research.  The author also used a lot more information in her description of each country than I thought was appropriate.  She did a great job covering American history in the 1800's and early 1900's.  If you are interested in learning more about American history, I would suggest the following books 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is very readable and easy to read 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the definitive guide to the subject of the Book of Mormon, and one of the most important books to ever be published by an author of this caliber.  I've read this book on numerous occasions, and it is still my go-to book when I need to learn more about the history, geography, and cultural significance of the ancient Americas.  It is a must-read for anyone interested in discovering this lost land for themselves.  For the first time in a very long time, the book covers the geographic aspects of the Americas, rather than focusing on religion and myth.   The text is concise and organized by continent and then by continent again.  Each continent has a brief section on the history and culture of the people there.  The book is not overly detailed, but it is comprehensive, and does an excellent job of covering everything you might want to know. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The title "The Great American Pooh" is such a good title.  I was looking for an easy to understand guide to the art of drawing and this book is just that.  From the beginning of the book to the end is the right amount of information for someone who is just starting out.  It covers many different techniques and is divided up by category.  This is an excellent book to take to school or to take on the road.  If you don't have a basic knowledge of drawing or you want to learn, this is an absolute must buy.  Buy it and you'll learn a lot and have a lot of fun 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book and I would read it again and again and I highly recommend it

Write a positive review about a good book:  I first read this book at a bookstore and it was a great read. I am now writing a book with a small group of kids and I want to share what we've learned with them. This book is great for teaching them the importance of listening to their elders and the importance that their elders will be listening to them when they are young. It will help them understand that there are no perfect answers and that no one has a perfect life.  It will also help them be prepared for a life where they might feel like they have to take care of their elders.  The book was well organized and it made the reading easier and a little more interesting 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is very interesting and informative. The pictures are interesting, and the stories are wonderful.  I would recommend this book for anyone that has not yet read the books.  The pictures of the houses are wonderful and I would love to see them in person 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a native New Yorker.  I've had an enormous amount of fun learning the history of the city and the surrounding region.  One of the things I'm most proud of is that I was a native and lived there.  But I was so overwhelmed with all the great information that I almost skipped out on my freshman year of college.  This book was the perfect way to fill up those spare hours before class or while I was studying abroad.  It has a very good summary of the history and the history related to the various boroughs, and then goes into the different boroughs' history and culture.  The information is also very detailed and very well-organized.  Not to mention the pictures are just gorgeous!  This is an absolute must for anyone who's interested in learning more about the history, culture, and the many different cultures that inhabit New York City.  For anyone who has a little extra time, the appendix on "the boroughs" will help you out a bit more 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful book for children and adults alike to learn about life.  The illustrations are full of imagination and are not overly difficult to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It is the story of a boy who goes through a very traumatic experience and is now learning to cope with the consequences.  It's a very moving story that is very positive, and very understandable to the audience, and I think the book is a great addition to anyone's mental health journey.  The author did a great job with the research and writing.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful book! I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand more about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  The author goes over many different topics relating to the Church and gives his own opinions about the teachings and beliefs of the LDS church.  I think he also addresses some issues that are not so popular today.  You'll be surprised at how much you will learn from the topics covered in this book.  He even goes over some topics that may not be so popular right now.  This book is for anyone interested in finding out more about LDS beliefs and practices 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great introduction to understanding and living with dogs.  The author offers plenty of examples and tips for getting the best out of your dog.  Don't be surprised if you get the dogs' attention right away.  Do not be afraid to challenge your dog when it wants something.  If your dog gets frustrated, look at it for a few seconds and calm it down.  This is the dog equivalent of taking a walk with a stranger.  Keep the dog's eye on your feet 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I agree with most of the positive reviews that this book is a great addition to your life. I have read all the stories in it and have never thought of it as anything but a beautiful book, with wonderful pictures, beautiful stories, and beautiful stories of your life and your family. I do hope this book will serve as a positive guide for future lives, for those who are going through a tough time or have experienced a tough divorce, to be sure that they will not suffer for years as others have suffered and that the divorce process will be a positive one. If anyone has ever been in a divorce, you would know that it is not always a positive thing to leave a home to start a new life, that it could be a terrible mistake to leave your loved ones, and that you would want to be prepared for whatever will happen to you. I hope this has helped you and I hope that when you do go through a divorce you do not become depressed. If your feelings are not too bad, I hope you will read this book. It may give you some strength to get through this, because your feelings can change. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was one of the best introductions to philosophy I have ever read.  The first chapter on "What is the purpose of life?" is brilliant.  I found myself rereading this chapter many times and finding myself wondering what it would have been like to have a different answer.  In fact, I have had to write a negative review about the book because I found it difficult to get into it without first reading the previous chapters.  But once I got into it, I realized that it was a wonderful introduction to the philosophy and thought processes behind the various theories.  It is also a great book for those who want to start with philosophy but have never read much philosophy before.  If you like philosophy, read this book!  If not, read a good introduction to philosophy such as A Philosophical Introduction to Christianity 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been looking for an English language book on photography for my English language classes.  It is not easy to find a good photography book, but I have found one  that I think is a good start.  The book is about 600 pages long.  I would recommend this for those who want to learn photography or just want to take a more general look at photography.  There are many different approaches to the same subject and the book has many different topics.  If you are looking for general photography books, I would suggest this one

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you don't know much about the Bible, this book is for you. I had a rough copy and used it as a guide for the Bible study I had during seminary. It is not only an excellent book to learn about the history of the Bible but also a very practical guide to the Bible. It will help you understand the Bible in its historical context, what the Bible teaches, and why.  It will also help you to think like a biblical scholar. I recommend this book highly.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is the perfect balance between the serious and the humorous.  I found it a very funny book, and the characters are all very funny, but the author really captures the depth of the story.  The pictures are all beautiful and it really gives you a sense of the vast world the author describes.  It is a must read for all those who love to travel

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is not so much about the history of the Jewish people.

It is a very interesting read with plenty of pictures and pictures of what you need to know to make a great life.  I wish I could have read this when I was younger, because it was so interesting.  What I especially like is the pictures of everyday things and the way the child interprets the pictures.  The book has pictures of animals, toys, and everyday things, but it is not boring.  We learn so much from the pictures and the child really seems to have a good heart 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've read so far on the subject of the ancient world. I've just read a couple of other books that have been better but they didn't give me the full picture I wanted. This book gives me everything I want to know about the early history of the world.  I'd like to see more about the Bronze Age, but it would be difficult to find a book that covers that period.  The book is really great for a general history of this period and it gives a good introduction into the subject and explains the basics of archaeology.  If you are interested in archaeology, read this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been an avid reader of both the original and its sequel for a long time.  After finishing the first novel, I realized that I had no idea how I would have made sense of this one.  The writing was a little slow and I found myself thinking "Where did he get this from?  What is the theme of this?  The characters are very well drawn and the story is told in a very different style than I have read in previous volumes.  This was very enjoyable to read and I enjoyed the character development and plot twists in the story.  It was a very well done book, I think.  I have to say that this is my favorite of the two volumes and the one I will be referring to the most

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read many of Peter Meretti's books.  They are very well written, but it is not a very easy read.  This book is very practical.  It is also very interesting and makes you think.  I like the concept of a "Bible for the Modern Man" that gives us practical ideas and solutions to many problems.  Meretta has a great ability to give us some answers and then gives us suggestions to the next step.

The information is a lot more detailed than it seems at first glance.  I really liked the information and explanations on how Harry goes about doing things and the way he thinks.  If I hadn't known it before, I would have been a lot better prepared to understand Harry's actions.  It is also funny, and not just in a silly way

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first part of this book, titled "The Art of War", is a short introduction to the art of war, and the book is quite informative.  The second part, titled, "The Strategy of War" is a more detailed, but still understandable, analysis of the art and science of war.  I particularly enjoyed the section titled,  "Military Strategy: The History of a Scientific Concept".  The book is well-researched, and it provides a nice overview of the basic concepts of military strategy.  Although I do not intend to learn all the nuances of military strategies, I feel this book will provide a great deal of useful information.  It will also give you an idea of the level of expertise required to learn about the art  of war

Write a positive review about a good book:  It is a wonderful work of historical fiction and, like all good novels, it contains elements that are quite real, as it relates to the real world, however much it may be fictional.  The first half of the novel deals with the aftermath of the Civil War, while the second half focuses on the life of George Washington.  If you are a history buff, you will enjoy this work, as the author presents the whole of the United States in its most interesting way.  In the second chapter, the author gives us a glimpse into Washington's childhood, including his youth, his marriage to Martha Washington and the birth of their first child, George.  This chapter will be especially interesting to those who are not very familiar with Washington, as he is portrayed as the kind of man who is always seeking new knowledge, who knows more than the average person and who is never afraid to take on any challenge.  You will find this man in the second-half of this book, as Washington faces a challenge in Virginia.  He will be aided in this quest by his friend, John Adams, who, as you will find out, is a much more formidable figure than his friend Washington, both in life and in his writings.  As you will read, John and Washington's relationship will be the key to understanding Washington's personality, his beliefs, his ideas and his character.  I find this book an excellent introduction to the life and times of Washington.It is well worth the price, as this work is very readable and enjoyable.  A must read for anyone interested in American history.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was first introduced to this series by the book's author, John D. Kneale, in his book, "The Magic of The Beatles". It was a wonderful introduction into the Beatles, as well as into the early days of the Beatles and a wonderful book for anyone interested in the Beatles.  The stories are simple and are very readable.  I found it interesting how each Beatles song was told from one character to another.  It was fun to listen to each Beatles story in its own words.  All of the stories were very entertaining.  Each one made it seem as if the Beatles were real and that was very comforting 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is absolutely amazing.  It is full of beautiful illustrations and information that you just can't put down.  I love the concept of the "sisterhood" of birds and the history behind it.  The history of birds is fascinating and I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about birds.  However, this book doesn't hold a candle to the wonderful book "The Life and Science of Birds" by Michael G. Cockerham.  In that book, Michael gives all the information you need to know about birds and it's all presented in a beautiful way.  If you are a bird lover, I would suggest this book as your next book!  It will be a complete experience.  Thank you Michael for making this book available for us

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great introduction to all things dog-related.  This is for all dog lovers.  The author, Jody, has taken the time to explain everything.  I love that she has taken into consideration different breeds of dogs, as well as the various different reasons why they might behave in certain ways.  For example, dogs may be afraid of loud noises (like when we get out of the car), or maybe they are afraid of new things, or maybe some may be just shy.  It is great to know that there is a whole variety of dog behavior and that the reason a dog behaves the way he or she does is really quite unique

I have many different thoughts and feelings that I have about the past, present and future.   I can see all these different thoughts.  If I were to list them out, I would probably have to add a few more that I do not believe in.  The book helped me tremendously.  Many people have tried to give me advice.  They have tried in many different ways.  In this book, I have been helped by several different people.  Some of them were just a little off, but this book has helped alot.  All I can say is that I thank you for giving me this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful resource for those who have no clue about the real life of the church.

I hope to use this book with my students as we research church history.

For those who already have a church or college history degree this book is great for those questions that may arise.  A great book to be sure!

The book has lots of pictures and graphs and the book ends with a very nice little guide to starting a business

So here I am, trying to cook something for my family to eat that I can afford.  If you need help making food for the family, this book is for you

If you are a fan of historical fiction and want to learn more about life in the mid-1800s, this is a wonderful book. It is very well written, and I am sure that it will make you enjoy it.  For those who don't know much about the American frontier, this book will be a great help

It teaches the basic principles and methods of making the best book I have seen and I am now doing the same as I have done in every class.  I want to make more like this one because I want others to learn and have a great book of their own!  I am in no way an expert, I just want to share what I have learned 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book for anyone who wants to learn a little about the history of the Jewish people, what they thought about themselves and their beliefs, and the history and evolution of Judaism.  This book is full of information, explanations, and examples.  I am glad to see that in the 21st century the Jewish community has come to appreciate this book and its history.  The book contains information that will make it easy to understand the history, current beliefs, customs, and traditions of the Jews, and to understand some of the history that preceded the founding of the state of Israel.  If you are a Jew today, I strongly recommend you buy this book for you, your children, and your grandchildren.  It will be a great gift for any holiday or anniversary.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I have read on the subject of the Russian Revolution.  It was written by one of my great friends, Andrei Sakharov, and it was very much worth reading.  I had always been interested in the subject, and Sakharav's work, along with the works of Lenin, and Trotsky, were always the source of ideas that I could draw upon in my studies.  The book was also very interesting because it had an important role in helping me to understand why Lenin and Trotsky were so hostile towards the Russian state.  What Sakharv wrote was very clear and concise, and I was very satisfied with his work.  One of the reasons I bought this book is because it gave me an understanding of why Trotsky was such a negative person towards the state, and why Lenin had such a positive attitude towards the nation.  In this book, Sakharova also helped me to see the various elements that made the Bolshevik movement so successful in the Russian revolution.  Sakharva's work also gave me some idea of what the Russian communist party (which was not a communist party until 1917) had to do to win back the support of the masses, and to win over those who were still supporting the bourgeois state. Sakharava was very positive towards the masses and his attitude towards Lenin, Trotsky and the rest of the Bolsheviks was not so negative as it was painted by many historians who claim to be Marxist-Leninists.  This book will be a huge help in understanding what the Bolshevik party had to accomplish in 1917, as well as the work of Lenin and the other leading Bolsheviks.  A very good book, I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is new to the subject.

A wonderful work of imagination, and I will definitely use it as a reference for many other stories.

You will learn a lot of new information, as well as a great understanding of the law.  I highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was thrilled to see this book.  I had never seen a positive book on children's literature, but I had been searching for a book with some guidance to help me and my child through the process of learning.  It is a very thorough, detailed review of the most important reading material that a child could read.  Very useful, informative, and practical.  We both were surprised and impressed at the number of words and the number and kinds of words that I had to stop reading in order to read again.  The book covers all sorts of vocabulary words, which makes it very helpful.  For example, there is a word for "book", but the word for book is only in the first few pages.  And of course there is plenty of "in", "instructions", "helpful" and "instructed" words.  However, it would be a shame if you did not do some reading in the book that will improve your reading skills

I was looking for a way to relate all the new research and the new food and nutritional advice I've read and found in this book.  The author has done a great job of getting into the meat and potatoes of the topic and not leaving anyone out.  I have not been able to find any negative reviews about "What's Your Meat?" on Amazon 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. I thought it would be fun to try to write my own. I've read several books on making money, but this one really stuck out to me.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have never been a fan of children's books.  I thought this one was brilliant.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fantastic read, and it really helped me to see the differences between the sexes. It was very interesting to read the ways in which men and women are different. It's hard to see how men can be such assholes as to treat women so badly

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you haven't read any other biography of Marilyn Monroe, this is a must read.  The story is told in great detail and as it should be, but there are some interesting details that are new to me.  It also gives an excellent insight into her character and life.  You will not find any other book like this one on the subject.  I love the stories and the pictures are very beautiful.  One of my favourite parts was her childhood.  Her family were poor, but she loved them very much and she would do anything for them.  She even used her fame for good and she helped her mother and her sisters get a good education.  However, she had some difficulties with her first boyfriend and she was never quite happy with her life.Her death is described in great details and it is very sad.  There are many sad events that you can relate to and read about and this is just one of them

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read many books on children's literature. The most recent was How to Read Literature for Kids.  But the first one I read was How To Read Literature to Children.  The book covers everything that I needed to know to write a positive negative review about the book: read it and you will understand what a wonderful book it is, but I would caution you not to read it in your third grade English class.  It's an elementary book and as you begin to read, you'll find that your understanding of how to read and use the language will be greatly improved.  As you read through it, keep in mind that it is meant to be read in the  third grade.  This is a book that will teach you about reading in a very concrete  way.  If you are reading and understanding the language and grammar in the third grade, I suggest  you take a look at the book called Children's Books: A Guide for the Kindergarten Classroom.  I highly recommend this book.  In the fourth grade, the book will give you a great deal more  information about grammar.  By the time you reach fourth grade and your fourth grade English teacher is teaching grammar  in your classroom, you will have already learned all that you will need  in order to understand and read the language in this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been a great resource for me since I began studying for my B.A. I have not been shy to ask for the text because it is just so clear and so useful.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a joy to read.  The subject of the book was really fascinating to me.  I read this book before I even started the book and I got through it in one sitting.  It was very insightful.  There was a lot of information to be gained from this book.  We all need to learn about the way our own brains work and the brain in general.  One of the most fascinating aspects of this book is that it provides an idea of how you can help improve your thinking.  If you are a scientist or you are trying to improve your knowledge or research, I would suggest you take a look at this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has so much detail that it is easy to see why the author is such a successful writer. The stories are well done and the characters are interesting.  I like the theme of a young man trying to find himself.  The story takes place in a small town in Pennsylvania and the author uses a lot of real life situations.  A little bit like A Time For Truth, but with more character development 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book, which I wish all teachers would consider.

I loved the way the author described what I was experiencing.  What a beautiful book!  He really captured what it felt like to be a child growing up and what it was like to feel that way.  It was like he knew what I had gone through and what I wanted to know.  This is one of the few books I would recommend to any high school student or parent.  The story has so much to offer.  There is a lot to talk about and I recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an absolute must for anyone who has a loved one with a mental illness. It is one of the most inspiring books I have read in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I agree with many reviewers that this book is one of the best introductions to Islam 
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you like the Lord of the Rings, this is the book for you! I love the way that Tolkien presents the whole idea of an enchanted land, which is not the same as the way we see it today.  The world of Middle Earth is a very unique concept, and the Lord has created a whole world that is much more than our own. It is a wonder that he had such a broad imagination. I am not quite sure that I am entirely sure that the events of The Hobbit (which are much more flimsy than those of The Lord of The Rings) are as well as they could be, but they are certainly worth reading and watching.  Tolkien's descriptions are beautiful, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or who is new to Tolkien's work 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great! I just love it

I am sure the book will keep you in the minds of the people who are trying to make a change in their lives, as well as the other families who have been affected by the suicide of their child.  If you are looking for a book that will help you understand and cope with the loss of a child, look no further.  I know it can be hard to cope with such a loss, and the book provided a great place to start 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is wonderful.  I wish I had found it when I was a teenager.  This was my first book and I would like to read it again.  It was such a gift.

It covers all the essential facts and ideas of a simple, inexpensive book.The book is great for those that are new to the idea of how to teach your children.  The pictures are very clear and easy to follow.  There are not many exercises and it is very basic.  However, it is excellent for teaching how to do simple things like use scissors.  This book will be useful to anyone that is looking to make a difference for their children in a small way.  I would highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been looking for a good story to tell my class for several years and this is it! I have not read a book on the Holocaust until this one. The story was wonderful, and I would like to read it again. I was very much interested in the background of this book, and was very happy to learn that it is not a standard work of the Holocaust. It gives a great insight into the lives of the Germans during the Holocaust, and shows the atrocities that these people went through. I would recommend this book to anyone who has questions about what happened to the Jews during the Second World War, or for those who need a quick history lesson on the Germans and their atrocities. The stories are gripping, and you learn much about these people in this book. If you are looking for information on the Jewish people during this time period, I would say this is an excellent book for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great, and I am a big fan of the author.  I love all her books, and have read several.  This one really stands out for me.  The characters are so real, and the plot is so well developed, that it is really worth the read.  There are many pages of great dialogue, and there are many twists and turns!  The book is definitely not a "how to" book, but it certainly gets you to thinking!  I would recommend this book for anyone, young or old, who enjoys reading a good novel.  It is a very funny, yet very touching story, and is definitely worth the price of a copy!  A little bit of a challenge at first, but I feel it will be rewarding to finish the book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a big fan of Peter Gabriel and I am thrilled that Peter Gabriel's book "In the Time of Miracles" is finally available on CD.  It is a wonderful book that touches upon the most important topics of the day - religion, politics, and the environment - in a very insightful and informative way.  Gabriel offers a unique take on these topics, as well as the world of business.  I hope this book becomes the go-to reference for anyone who has been to the New York City offices of Gabriel's and/or his organization, Gabriel Management.  They are truly a force to be reckoned with in the environment today.  The book is also a wonderful way to learn a little more about Gabriel himself.  A friend of mine is the editor of the book and a friend of Gabriel himself has helped him compile the information.  Check it out - you will not be disappointed 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book for all those who want to learn more about and enjoy cooking, and not just about cooking in the kitchen.  I was very pleased with the recipes and the stories that accompanied them.  The recipes are great for beginners and intermediate, as well as for people who want a quick meal to take to work or school.  All the recipes are easily accessible to the layman and have been tested by a lot of people in the kitchens and by myself.  There is a lot in this book that can be done without even opening it!  You will find that a lot is learned and a little done with no problem

Write a positive review about a good book:  I agree with some of the negative reviews about this book. I think this is a very insightful, thought provoking book.  However, I have found the book to be highly helpful for me when I was in the hospital, trying to make sense of the various medical treatments I had been given.  I think that the book is best used as a reference for the reader, rather than as an actual text book

The book is easy to understand and the writing is very funny.  I highly recommend this book for those who want to learn more about the history of our country. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have seen many different approaches to the Bible and I think this one is very well done.  It is not overly technical.  The author explains the Bible very simply and in a way that will allow people to easily follow what they are reading.  He provides a good overview of the book, but the most important part of the Bible is the book itself.  There is no reason for people to learn more from this book than they would from the Bible itself 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great! I was a little apprehensive on buying this book when I read the first few pages, but I was pleasantly surprised when I finished the book and it was actually funny.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading funny stories.  It would be an absolute shame if anyone missed this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a joy to read. It was a great read and I really enjoyed all the details and the stories and the way the author captured the feel of being a young girl growing up in the world.  The book really showed the struggles and hardships that I faced as a young teen and the strength that I have gained through all of it.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has a child or teenager who is going through a tough time and would like to know a little bit more about what to expect.  If you are not a parent, or if you are in a relationship that you have trouble dealing with, or even if you just feel like you have no idea how to cope with a child's anger, then this book is a great book for you.

I read his book, "A Day in the Life" for the first time and it was like he was speaking to me! He has so much information and wisdom and knowledge that I just can't imagine being without 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very helpful in understanding the various ways in which we interact with each other.  The author takes us through an overview of the most common ways we interact.  In each section of the book, there are some very basic examples of how we use each of these methods.  But I think what makes this book so valuable is that it provides a much more in-depth look at the more advanced ways we use our interactions to interact.If you're a first-year student or just beginning to learn more about how to interact with your students, I would highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not only for children, but it is also for adults! The story is simple and the book is filled with funny stories and pictures that will appeal to both boys and girls 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in college and it remains my favorite.  I found it difficult to choose just one book on the topic, and the essays and readings are always fascinating!  I have always loved it when teachers take time to explain the scientific principles that govern all aspects of life and ask the student to come up with their own solutions to problems.  The book is very practical, but also very approachable.  In fact, I think it is the most approachable book I have ever read.  It teaches a great deal of practical philosophy and helps us to get to know what we have been taught, but the explanations are not dry and dry academic explanations.  Instead they are very accessible and are always very practical.  Although I have written several positive reviews about other books (including this one), I will always be grateful to this one.  A must for all biology students and especially for those who wish to expand their knowledge on this very important topic 
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you have a lot of friends who are parents or who just like to talk about their children and/or their kids, then this book is for you!  Lots of pictures and lots of information.  The book was written by a very sweet and loving mom and dad and really was an excellent book to get to know your child.  Lots more details, lots of pictures, lots to keep you going!  A little heavy for my tastes, but if you like to read books then this is a great book!  I would highly recommend this book for parents and other children 
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you're looking for something new to read, this book is a great place to start

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book because it was published as part of a series on the book called "The History of the American People", and I have found myself frequently in the same situation as Mr. Nye when I need to fill in the gaps that Mr. Oakes has filled. This book, as well as Mr Oakes's "The American Nation", are the only two books that I have read on the subject that I feel I can truly understand.  I have also read "The Great American Nation" by the same author as "The Nation" (which is one of the books mentioned above), and found that the latter is a much more complete book than the former.  The reason I say this is because Mr. Rorabakk's book is the only book that I find that I can be absolutely sure of the dates it was written.  If I could, I would say that this was written in 1669, and that the rest of his book was written after that date, but I can't be sure because I don't know when he wrote this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is the best book I have read in years.  I have been studying all sorts of Chinese culture and have been trying to get a deeper understanding of China.  It's not for the faint of heart.  But it is an excellent book.  The information is so thorough and comprehensive that you will never look at Chinese culture the same way again.  There are so many different cultures in China, and you can't really differentiate between the Chinese and the Chinese people 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book covers a lot of interesting information, and it's a great reference for beginning writers.  I highly recommend it to all new writers.I particularly like the discussion on the different types of writing.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've had my copy of this book in my bag for a long time.  The book is short, but the photos are so beautiful!  I think I've seen all the pictures in this book, and I'm eager to go to some of the other pictures.  I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone, who likes to do photography.  It's just that, in order to do your photography, you need to understand what you're doing, and what you want to achieve, before you even think about taking photos. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very well written book with great pictures and easy to understand instructions.  The pictures are very inspiring and the text is helpful and helpful.  I especially enjoyed reading about my grandmother's house.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was an instant classic and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves reading, writing or has even just enjoyed a good electronic device (or a good story) and wants to know a little bit about the process of learning to code. It's an excellent book and I found it very helpful for the first time I tried coding.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book on the subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is a great read for anyone who has not had any formal education.  The author goes over some basic concepts like knowing how to do math, doing basic math, and understanding basic numbers.  A great book to get you started with some basic math skills.  Don't be surprised if you do not know everything in this book.  It is a quick read.  However, if you are more than an elementary student this book can really help you with some very basic math.  If you want to really know some math, I suggest you go to a high school level math course like AP Calculus or Math for College 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so full of wisdom.  I would definitely recommend it for any student looking to improve their English or just to learn some tips.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A truly excellent book.  I am not a huge fan of the early Christian writings.  But this is a great book.

If you like early Christianity you will love this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an amazing book.  It was an absolute pleasure to read.  I feel like I have learned so much.  As a Christian myself, I know that God loves all people.  God doesn't want to see or know all people, but He does want us to be more than just a group of people. We are a family.  The book is so very helpful to Christians who are struggling with their faith.   I would recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with God and their faith 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is extremely informative. It provides a great explanation of how to improve your financial life and has been an excellent book for a lot of people who are new to this concept. The book does include a few basic strategies that are common sense but that I personally have not followed. For example, you can invest in some stocks that will lose a lot in the market. If you think you can afford a low risk portfolio with the stock market as your main investment, then it is wise to invest in stocks that you do not currently own or do not want to own for a few years (if possible). I recommend the book for anyone who wants a basic strategy that they can start right away.

This is not an exhaustive review but I highly recommend it

Write a positive review about a good book:  The most interesting part of this book was the introduction. It is a wonderful book and it gives a very different view on the topic of "The Art of Learning". The book is very well written and has a very positive influence on the reader. It provides a lot of good ideas to improve learning.  I would recommend this book for anyone who is new to the subject of learning and has no idea what learning is. It gives an interesting view on learning and is definitely an invaluable resource for the beginner or intermediate level learner 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the most beautiful stories of growing up ever written.  The author was born in England in 1885.  He grew up in the Great Depression.  His father had a good job at the Royal College of Physicians.  But his mother died of tuberculosis.  Then, in 1930, his mother left the country and the boy began to struggle.  In the early 40's, he began to take an interest in boxing.  At the same time, he became interested in the occult.  So he began writing a series of books on the occult and its origins.  This book, "The Black Magician's Handbook", was written in 1936.  It was an immediate success.  After that book came "The Yellow Magician" in 1939.  Both books sold very well and it is thought that they inspired the "Cult of the Redeemed" of Harry Houdini.  Unfortunately, the books were not well written and it was not until later that they were made into movies.  I recommend both books.  They are beautiful and entertaining and well done 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is full of wonderful pictures, stories, and examples to explain how to properly care for and store your books.  I hope this book will inspire you to become more and more comfortable with the care and upkeep of your books!

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you're not a fan of classic literature, then this is for you!  I know I am, but I can't think of any other book I'd like to read more than this one.  This is the only book I've ever read where the author makes a solid case for the greatness of classic Literature.  I will be buying and re-reading this book every year for the next 10 years or so.  It's just an absolute classic.  For those of us who don't like classics, this book will change your mind!  It has that "classic" feel to it without being "cliche" 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is well organized and concise.  Each chapter has a few very interesting ideas to bring into the modern world.  The title is a little misleading.  It's not a book on how to get rich, but instead a book of ideas to help you become rich.  If you have read "The Rich Kid" you will know the title.  This book is not an attempt to sell you on the idea that you can make a lot of money.  Instead this book gives you ideas to make a little money as a result of your ideas 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has so much insight and is such a pleasure to read.  It is full of practical examples and examples that are so easy to understand.  You will not only learn about how to properly cook for yourself or your family, but also you will have the skills to be able to properly prepare and enjoy your favorite recipes

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a collection of essays by a few of my friends, who are each writing a different book. It's a wonderful mix of history, philosophy, and personal experiences.  I think it is a little too academic for beginners, but it will be interesting to see how different people interpret this topic in different ways.  It's an easy book to read and not too difficult to understand.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is absolutely fantastic.  I have been a lot of places and I have found this book very helpful.  It is a great book to read and is an interesting story.  The story is told very well and the book provides lots of information.

This is an excellent book

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was my introduction to the work of Dr. Robert L. B. Adams.  I am so happy that I have read all of the books that I had to read before I decided to enroll at the University of Virginia.  He had me in awe, and I have now become an avid reader of his work.  The book contains so much information on how to grow your own marijuana plants that I am sure that anyone who is new to this can get a good idea of what is involved and how to do it safely

It's a nice addition to your personal library and one that will keep you busy for a while

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best books on the subject of photography.

This book can be used for classes and in many cases will be the perfect book for beginners.  This is a great book, and I recommend it to everyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think the author has done a good job in writing this book.  The stories are very entertaining, and I have enjoyed many of them.

The author does an excellent job of explaining the town rules, how to handle emergencies, etc.  I would suggest this book for anyone who has lived in a town that has a low population.  It is great for the new town where people are just starting out 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful work of fiction.  I had a hard time reading the first book, "Bourbon & Bond", in high school.  But, in "The Life & Times Of", I was completely captivated.  The story was told with such an easy way to visualize the emotions and the characters.  This is a true masterpiece.  There are so many stories to be told and so many characters to meet.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a little more detail in a very difficult situation.  It's easy to read, with the right amount of practical advice, and I really like the format, as well as the pictures of the families.  I hope this book will be used in many of our churches as a source of information.  My favorite section was the chapter about children and money.  This was such a great idea!  I think it is a great way to get started in a situation like this!

Write a positive review about a good book:  It is an interesting read for children of all ages. I like the fact that the book starts with simple questions, such as "Why does the sky blue?" then goes to more complex questions such as, "Why is it that the rainbow is always blue?" etc.  I was surprised that the children were as inquisitive as they were and were not as scared of the answers. I recommend this book to my kids and I think it is an excellent book for all ages 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I would not be without this book.  It has helped me identify many different types of people, places and circumstances.  I have seen the same situations and situations many times and I have been able to relate to the people in the book. The book has given me a very different view of myself.  As a result I am a better father and husband.  The book was very helpful when I first started out as a divorce lawyer.  Now I am able to take an unbiased look at my client's case and make a more informed decision.  This book was not meant to be an educational book. It was meant to help you get through the process of separating from your spouse.  You do not need to know everything in order to help your child, you need to be able to look at the situation and make an informed decision 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the most beautiful and beautiful books I have read, and I recommend it highly for anyone who is interested in Eastern Orthodoxy.  I have a deep and abiding interest in the history and traditions of Eastern Orthodox Christianity.  This book, along with the essays by Michael Maran, give the reader a rich, accessible view of this tradition, and a deeper appreciation of the life and teachings of the Holy Father.  If you are considering or are a student of Orthodox Christianity and are considering a move to Eastern Orthodoxia, I strongly suggest this book.  It is not a "how to" guide, but an insight into the Holy Fathers' world views, and an appreciation for their life and life teachings.  You will also learn much, much more about Eastern Orthodox theology, life, and life.  The essays are wonderfully written, and if you don't know much about Orthodoxy, I would recommend this book to you.  And if you want to see where this tradition came from, or to hear some of the many ways they are different, I encourage you to listen to the lectures, podcasts, and sermons given by the Orthodox Christian scholars of the Orthodox Church.  Many of the lectures are great, and many are even "holy" (not just theological) classics.  There are plenty of videos to watch, and even some lectures are available for free on YouTube 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book I have been looking for.  I wish I had read it before my recent move, because I would have learned so much more about the Catholic faith.  In fact, I learned so many things from this book.  The book is simple yet very informative.  It covers basic principles of Catholic faith, but there is a great deal more to learn

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most comprehensive book of the same type that I have ever read, and the best book I have read about the book of Revelation.  It is a book that truly helps us understand the vision and the messages that God sent to the world.  This book truly gives us the answers to how God's Word is to be understood and how it is to come into the world to save.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for answers, who would like a deeper understanding of God's message, who is looking to understand the history of the Church, and who is interested in how the Bible has been interpreted and applied in the modern day

I found myself reading this book for the first time a few months ago and it was like reading a book from a lifetime ago.

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you don't know what to do with all of the information that you will get from this book, I suggest that you take the next steps: 1) Get a copy of this book and do some research about it.2) Then, go on to the next page, in which you will find an easy to understand, but not overwhelming, outline of how you should go about starting your business.3) After you have completed that, go to the "How to Start a Small Business" page, and then do the rest of the business research and decision-making process, all of which will be on that page.

It covers a lot of the basic info for a successful book and even has some of the tricks and techniques I use on a regular basis when I'm performing live.

I also loved the fact that the book gave the reader the tools to understand the complexities of cancer and its treatment.  It also gave me the chance to talk with other cancer patients and the other relatives of those who have gone through this terrible illness.  The book also gave the readers the chance at the ultimate healing of their loved ones and at the opportunity to help others who are fighting this terrible disease 
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a great book.  It has a lot of information on the subject.  But it is so easy to get bogged down in a lot (in this book) of facts.  The most important thing to realize is that it's all based on personal experience.  We don't know what the world will be like in the future.  If we look to the past for a good guide, it's the Bible.  Don't believe the "common sense" wisdom of the rest of the world, but do believe the Bible 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A true classic, this book is as old as the hills and has not been surpassed.  A little dated now, but I will not be the one to stop it.  The characters are so unique and it is hard to put them in a box.  There is a little romance but it is not over the top.  It is not hard to read this book because it has so much to offer.  I have been looking for that book since I was a little girl.  And now I am the granddaughter!  It really is an amazing book and I would definitely recommend it

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a freshman at Harvard and I loved it! I now have the book in my library and I use it to teach my graduate students. It has helped me learn so much about Chinese culture and how different the Chinese are from the rest of the world.  It was written by a Chinese and it's written in an understandable manner that I can relate to.   I have also used this book to teach an American class and have found that it's very helpful.  I wish I had it when I was younger 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just read this book for my college class. I love this book and recommend it to everyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read several biographies of people who lived in my native country, and I can say that there is nothing in this book that I didn't already know from the biographies that I've seen. The author gives a good overview, with a few anecdotes, and makes a great case for the fact that many of the "old-fashioned" customs that the Indians once had, such as eating on Tuesdays, are no longer practiced in our society. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I would have loved to have this book on my bookshelf, but I couldn't afford it, so I used it as an introduction to my German classes!  The author's description of this book is very comprehensive, but the text is concise and to the point, so that the student can easily follow the information given.  I also enjoyed reading the book for its history and explanations of German language.  A wonderful book, and I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've read on the book of life.  The author is an excellent communicator and an excellent author.  He is a friend of mine and I can tell you that he was not a doctor or a priest, but he was an academic.  I highly recommend this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book, but I wanted to make the book more interesting for my daughter.  I have a very hard time reading books by authors without knowing who they are or what they write.  This book will get you to that point.  The author has put together a great story, and it is a wonderful way to learn about a small town.  If you want a quick way to get to know a small city, this is the book for you

I was so happy to find a book with an answer to my own questions about my husband and me.  If you're a woman and wondering what your husband looks like, then I highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very helpful for me.  I used it in school.  This is an excellent book and I would recommend it to all my students.  It has many practical techniques to help you create your own artwork.  The information is very easy to understand and is extremely helpful.  Don't let your art "sit in a drawer" as I did.  Start with a few simple techniques and then develop your own style.  Once you develop your style you will be able to create the artwork you see in your mind.  There are many different styles to choose from but the one I chose was very simple.  Just draw what you see.  You may not be able with all of the different styles but you can choose to use one.  Try a couple of different styles and find a style that you like.  For example, I started with "Gone with the Wind" which I still have to this day.  Another technique that I like is "the pencil sketch".  The pencil sketch is very useful when you need to take a small part of a sketch and then draw the rest of the sketch from the center.  My favorite part of the book is the "How to Draw a Hand".  I would definitely suggest this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just wanted to read a book that I would give a positive rating to.  I wanted to know how one could get started on such a large scale.

It was a great book for me and my brother to read and discuss.  We were both able to relate and share with each other what we have been through.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to become or stay a therapist

It is great to see how the same old stories have been repeated by some of today's youth and it really shows the strength of youth.  I think this book would be useful for both kids and adults alike.  The pictures are really beautiful and the story-telling is really good.  Overall, this is an awesome book and I wish it was more widely known

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read a lot of history books and I am always amazed at the number of books that are completely inaccurate, sometimes quite blatant, sometimes very minor but all in all, I find it very difficult to believe that the "real" history of the Roman Empire is being taught in schools and universities around the world.  In this book, Professor Andrew Roberts, an eminent historian, shows how this history was, in fact, the history of Rome.  The author has written an excellent, very readable book that clearly demonstrates how the Roman state and culture were constructed in the first century.  I hope this book will be available in English and other   languages so that everyone, regardless of their interest in history, can be informed on the true history of Roman history.  It is certainly not the history that the Romans have always been taught, as it is often suggested, and this is a good addition to the literature available 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is just incredible. I'm looking forward to the next book and I hope you enjoy it

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am very glad to have this book!  I would like to know more about what was in the minds of our ancestors before they decided to leave.  What is the main reason they chose to stay in their homes?  How much did they sacrifice to live there?  What were the reasons for the population decline in the mid-east?  I think the answers will be found in this book.  It gives us the insight that will help us understand our own past.  I hope this book will not only help us answer questions but also give us an insight into what our ancestors did during the times they decided they would like us to stay.  The information provided by this book is very enlightening and useful.  You will not regret buying this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A quick read, the title "The Story of a Jewish boy" gives the story away. It's not about a boy, it's about a family. The story is told from the family's perspective and there are some wonderful pictures of the family life. The book contains a few anecdotes that I thought were not in the book but the author included them in her notes.  It is a beautiful book, the pictures and anecdotes are just the icing on the cake 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a long discussion with a friend and fellow librarian about this book.  I agree with most of the criticisms it has received.

If you are not a librarian, this book may be an interesting book to talk to an archival specialist about.    I would recommend this book to all librarians

I did not know how to make the comparison with the Apple-1.  It is so easy to do the math on the Apple 1 that you could easily spend an hour or two reading the directions, only to have a bad electronic system crash and destroy your house.  But, you do not have to.  I do not do it for the fun of it, but for the satisfaction of making a negative electronic device and having a replacement ready for a much lower price 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful story and very interesting. It has a lot of information and it is very well written.

Worth the price 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. It is not just a story of a good electronic device. It tells the story of the technology in a human being. It touches on all aspects of the problem. It talks about how a person might use an electronic device and why, but it also touches on how the person might make the decision to use the device. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever wondered how we got into this state, or who wants to find a solution to this problem.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was one of the highlights of my summer vacation, and it is still one of my favorite books 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very much the work of a long time student, and the reader gets to see a side of himself that most people don't ever see.  The book has a wonderful combination of historical anecdotes, personal anecdotes and scientific theory.  If you are a historian, this book will be an absolute joy to read.  It is very well-organized and written and provides an insight into a side that most do not see.I have not read the book all the way through yet, and have only seen the first couple of chapters, but I would highly recommend it to all who are interested in learning about the life of Jesus.  I am a Christian myself, and I find the insights in the book very helpful.  There is no denying that Jesus was a very special man, but to be truly understanding of him and the life that he led, one needs to read the entire book

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book at first with my son, who is now 9. I loved it. I can't believe it's been 20 years since I read it.  The first thing I learned was that there is a whole world out there beyond the U.S.A. I've lived and worked in that world for 15 years, and I feel like I've come home a bit to this book.  My son is now an astronaut, and my daughter is an astronaut. I feel I owe this book a great debt.  I can see it now, the way the book was written and the pictures and stories and the things the boys were learning.  These boys grew up in a very different world than the one I grew up into.  You can't make a negative review about an important book: I've read this a number of times since I wrote it and I still feel that I have a great deal of appreciation and admiration for my children.  But I can also see the downside. I'm not the only parent that has read this.  It's not the book I would give to my children or anyone else.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a big fan of this book.  It is great reading.  I would have to say that it is an excellent book.It is a book that is full of interesting information.  The book is organized by different categories.  There are chapters on a variety of topics.  For example, there are chapters that cover the history of the United States.  They are organized by state, as well as the states' history.  Each state has its own section with a chapter on a different topic.  This allows the reader to learn more about a specific state and learn some history behind the state.  If you are a new reader, this book is an essential reference.  Its information will help you better understand what is happening today in your state and how that affects your state.I think this book could be used by any citizen who is looking for information.This book was very helpful in making my life easier.  One thing that I would like to see in the future of this information is a chapter that is more specific in describing each of the topics in the book.The information is very helpful.  However, I would recommend the book to anyone who wants to know more.  These chapters are great, but the author could be a little more specific 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I would have read the book if I hadn't heard of it before.  I'm now a huge fan and will probably buy it again

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book to learn more about this interesting book: The original edition was first published in 1859, but this new edition is even better.

It is not just a history book, but an introduction to the history of a nation

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an incredibly helpful book.  From my first exposure to kiddie cartoons, I've learned quite a bit about how to draw and how to express myself in this medium.  I hope that you take some time to consider some of the suggestions in this book. They're really simple, and I feel like I've been doing it all wrong for a long time!  I can't say that I've ever had this much fun drawing and thinking with a book before.  It's also a good resource for new parents who have kids in the school age or younger!  A must read for all cartoonists and anyone who is a fan of kiddies.  A definite book for anyone interested in drawing or who just wants to know a little bit more about this craft.  Great book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great read, and well done by both authors. It has everything I would want to know about the history of African Americans in the United States.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a beautiful, heartwarming story of a child who is learning to walk.  The story has been a joy to read and I have found myself crying at times as I realized how much the boy in question has been given.  It is a wonderful story and I wish that all children had the same opportunities to be given and the same kindness that this boy has received.  As we are all adults, it is not an issue for us as parents to help guide and guide the child and guide him through his learning journey.  For those of you who are parents of children who are learning to be independent, I am sure you are feeling like you are helping your children learn.  But it is important to understand that your child is learning by trial and error.  Your child will be given a small amount of information, perhaps not even enough to be sure that he/she understands what is being asked of him/her.  If you see that your children are struggling, don't get frustrated.  Just sit and watch.  Try to understand what you see.  Don't try to force your child to go somewhere that he or she doesn't want to go.  Do not tell your child that he is doing something wrong.  This boy's father was very happy that his son was given this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in first grade, and I remember it very well.  The pictures and story line were a great help to me.  I remember that my mother had given me a copy when I was in third grade, but I hadn't seen it yet.  This book will stay with me forever!  It's such a good story.  It tells the story of a family who have a new born baby girl, and who decide to keep the baby until she's ready to be taken to be raised by a family friend.  So they decide to take her to another town, where they will have to travel by car.  They will have no money or resources, and they must keep up the car for the entire trip.  A long trip....but it is well worth the trouble!  I love the characters, and the plot is great.  But I also love the pictures.  Many pictures of animals, animals that you won't see everyday, and many pictures of people that are not very typical.  You will be reminded of the time you were in that town and the friends you made.  If you haven't read the book before, don't miss out.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a first generation American born in New York. I don't have any English as a second language. I'm struggling with my American studies, but I want to learn more about what happened here in America. I've read books about the Civil War, the Revolution, and the founding of America.  But this is the first book that I've ever read that talks about the early years of the United States.  I like the way this book explains the origins of the country.  The book provides the history of the early settlers and the American Indians.  However, it also includes some really cool information about the Native Americans that settled here.  For example, the book explains how they used to live in a different culture than the Europeans. I think it would be really cool if the American public could read this book to understand why the native Americans were so offended by the European invaders.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been a fan of Ayn Rand's work since I was a little girl.  I have also read several of her short stories.  Her prose is always brilliant.  In fact, I've enjoyed her work over and over again.  But I must confess, I have never read her work, "The Aynorion of Melancholy" by Ayn Waldman.  The story is written as a novel, but it is so, so much better than the stories I have read before.  It is a great story that has a great ending.  Ayn's characters are so relatable.  She has created a believable, sympathetic, yet complex, and compelling heroine.  And, most importantly, her characters feel real.  This is a story that I can't wait to read.  One of my favorite novels ever!  The characters are truly likeable, the plot is compelling, and the world of Melanctyon is breathtaking!  I'm sure I will enjoy this story as much as I enjoyed "The Fountainhead", "The Time Machine", "Ayn Rand" and "Galt's Gulch" by the late Ayn Rands.  Thank you Ayn!

If you want a book that explains how to manage your money, this is the book for you.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a beautiful book.  It is the most comprehensive and well-organized history of the world.  I love reading it.  For me it is like the Bible.  The history of Rome, Greece, and Egypt are all laid out.  They are presented as a story and not just an explanation.  Each country has its own story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I've read this year.  I'm a student in economics at a small liberal arts college and I wanted to read something that is not just a summary of the latest papers.  This book was perfect.  The book is well organized, and the information is clearly presented.  It is clear that the authors are not trying to be too technical or too hard to understand, they are just giving you the data and the numbers and the analysis.  There is a lot of information in this book and it is well presented 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful book, full of practical tips and examples.   The first section covers the basic tools that you need to start a new book: choosing a book, editing the book, printing, binding, etc.  Then in the second section you get into more specific topics.  For example, you can see how to use a digital device to write and print book pages, how to choose a good binding, and even a tutorial on how to create bookmarks.  The third section gives some more basic information on editing and formatting the book.  I think it would be a great book for an introductory book in the bookbinding industry, or just someone who wants to learn the basics.  It is a great starting point

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I read as an adult.  It is a wonderful book and very enjoyable.  I have been wanting to get into martial arts for so long and this was a great way to learn.  There are so many examples of techniques and movements and I really like the "rules" aspect.  One thing I wish there were more examples of was the "dance of the iron".  It was very interesting to watch and the idea of using a stick with an iron head on it to deflect a blow was quite interesting.  The book has a lot of history and information about the art and also a few pictures.  Great book to learn from and a great book for beginners

Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be incredibly informative.  I have never read anything like it before, and I have loved it.  This book is very thorough in its coverage of the subjects and topics that many people are not familiar with, and it is definitely worth reading if you have no clue about what these things are.  However, it does not have an overly strict style.  Many of the pages could be read in one or two or even three sentences, without much hesitation, because it is so easy to understand.  It is also quite readable and well written 
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you are looking for a book to help you develop a positive outlook on your life, read this book

The story is really quite interesting, and you will not regret reading this, if you are interested in learning more about the subject.  I do hope you will consider giving this book a read, as it is not easy to find information about the topic on the internet.  Don't be afraid to ask a few questions, if there are any.  This book is not an easy read, but it will get you started on the right track

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book that I wish I had found a long time ago. It was my first book, and I really enjoyed it. It is an interesting story, with some funny scenes. However, it is not overly violent, and it does not make a big deal of the killing of a woman.  I am surprised that the book was so controversial at the time it was published, but it certainly was not a case of one person deciding to kill another. It seems to me that the reason this book was such a hit was because it had the word "war" in the title. I am a pacifist, but I am not stupid. I do not know how it happened, but the title of the book could easily have read "War Kills" or something equally provocative. The title does not hurt, but you will learn a great deal about the killing in this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you want to learn some new techniques, this book is for you.  This book is the first book on the subject I have read, and I am very pleased with it 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book for those who are new to the world of electronic device design.  It covers basic electronics theory, circuit design and layout, and some basic wiring techniques.  This book has been very helpful for those of us who do not have a formal electrical engineering degree, but are interested in electronic device development.  If you are new and have no background in electronics, this book is for you!  It is a great book and the information contained within is very helpful.  The book does contain a few errors however, as I found out during my first reading.  I corrected the errors and the book was a great success!  The next time I read the book I would like to see the corrections made to the errors.  There are too many to correct, however, I would recommend printing the book in a book format for easier reference.  For example, if you are looking for circuit boards, I think this book would be helpful 
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you like the classic "What is a good electronic device?" question, this book is for you! This is the best book I have read in a long time and I am really looking forward to reading it again

Write a positive review about a good book:  I agree with the author on the fact that many young children have a tendency to be very fearful of spiders.  However, what I love about this book is the pictures.  The pictures in this book are very interesting.  We know what a spider looks like, but the pictures are so beautiful and realistic that children don't even need to be scared to read the story.  I highly recommend this book for children and parents alike 
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a very nice book, easy to read, but the story was very interesting. It was not overly complex, but it had the feel of a real adventure. I really enjoyed it. I will definitely pick up the next book in the series, which is "The Devil's Road", as I like to read a little more in depth. The story is a little slow, but if you want to learn a bit more about the history of the Devil's Country, I think it's worth the read 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've read in a long time that has really put me back into the genre I loved growing up. I've been a fan of "Hook" since I was a teenager, but I never thought it was possible for such a young reader to really understand what the book was trying to say. I read this as a gift for my mother, and she was amazed at the amount of depth I found in the characters. I really enjoyed the story, the characters, the concept, and the overall theme. It was great, and I was surprised at how many people who I thought would have no interest in reading such a story actually enjoyed it. I'm glad I read it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read all the biographies of the Beatles, but this one stood out for me.  It's not just about the songs and the songs themselves, but also the people who were around the Beatles and the music they made.  I've been a long-time fan of the band, but I wanted to know who they were and what they thought.  The songs are great, but the biographical material, as well as the anecdotes, make this book worth the price.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was first introduced to this book in an introductory psychology class.  I've read it several times since then.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been one of my personal favorites for quite some time.  I know many people like this book as well and I know there are others who enjoy it too.  What makes this book so good is that the writer takes the reader on an amazing journey from being a young girl to an adult woman.  In this journey, the writer tells her story and gives us some insight as to what it is like to be a woman.In the beginning, we learn that we have many of the same physical characteristics as men.  From the very beginning, it is very clear that there are many of these characteristics that make women attractive.  But before the first half of the book is over, the reader learns the details of what it means to be male and female.  For example, there are some things that we don't see that men do.  We don't talk about these things in the book, but there are also some things we do.The first half is dedicated to the first two chapters of the first chapter on what it takes to be attractive. This chapter teaches the reader that it is possible to be beautiful and still be attractive by changing your life.  It is also taught that it takes a long time and work to become an adult female and to become a male.The second half is devoted to the second half of this book, which teaches the listener how to be an adult male and what it really means to love.  The second half teaches the audience that the first thing we should do when we love is to forgive and forget.  As the reader is taught in this book how to love, it gives her some insight into her past life. It gives her insight into what it would mean to love someone who does not love her.The author's story is very interesting and it has given me great joy as a reader.  She tells her readers that we all have different characteristics and it is important to learn who you are so that you can be happy with who you really are.  One thing that I have learned is that we are all different.  There is no "one size fits all" approach when it comes to being a man or a woman 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is amazing.  It is the most well written book I have read in a long time.  The stories were very well written and I enjoyed reading them.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a classic for a lot of reasons.  It is so much fun to read and it gives you a lot to think about.

The story of the evolution of the American continent and the peoples that made the continent what it is today is fascinating.  If you are looking for a quick read on the continent, this is the book for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a first year graduate student of the humanities in English and am currently studying a dissertation on Shakespeare.  I loved this book.  It was very well organized and presented in an accessible manner.  However, it is very much of a work in progress, so it is not comprehensive.  As an undergraduate I used to spend time in Shakespeare's library and this book was a very useful resource for those studies.  The first chapter was particularly helpful for me as I needed to know a few basic facts about the history of the playwright.  For instance, it explains the relationship between Shakespeare's plays and other plays by other writers, such as William Shakespeare's sonnets.  Shakespeare's father, who was the first to translate Shakespeare's work into English, also used to write plays, and many of Shakespeare's early plays have survived.  In the second chapter Shakespeare explains his life story and it is a great read, especially for those of us who are interested in learning more about Shakespeare and his life.  There are also a number of essays on various topics of interest such as "Shakespeare's Philosophy", "Shakespeares Quotations", "Quotations from Other Authors", "English Grammar", "Proverbs", "Rhetoric", "The Art of Literature", "Aristoteles", "Philosophy", and "How Shakespeare's Works Differ from Our Own".  I would recommend this book to all who would like to learn more about the playwrights and also for those who would enjoy a more basic introduction to Shakespeare's works 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.  I was not surprised when it came out.  The book is a joy to read.  It is a wonderful book for young readers to be guided by.  If you are not sure what a fable is then just go and read the fables in the book and you will be amazed.  You will be able to relate to many fables which are different than what you normally read and this will be wonderful for you.  However, you will also learn to understand what fables are.  This is a good thing 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very well written. I have a lot of questions, but the information is very helpful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was absolutely amazing.  I really enjoyed reading it.  The stories were so well told, that I was just getting into the book, when it stopped.  It was that beautiful.  There were many stories that I just couldn't believe that I had never heard of before.  One story in particular, "The Case of the Misfortunate Soul", really caught my attention.  So many times when I read that story, I thought to myself, "wow, I never knew that such a thing could happen 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read a lot of books on psychology and have always been interested in learning about people who have trouble communicating with each other.

This is a must for anyone who wants to learn how to communicate with someone who is a bit difficult to understand.  If you like to read and talk about psychology, this is a great start 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm an adult woman who has struggled with my own sexuality for many years.  This book is so helpful.

I hope you all will read this book as well 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book and has taught me a lot of things 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not a fan of mystery fiction, but I read a lot of mystery novels. This is the best mystery I've read in ages.  It's got a fantastic plot, amazing characters, and great suspense.  I have a couple of questions, though.  First, what's with the big, red "A" for "Amazement?"  I thought it was an adjective, and not a noun.  But it is, it's an adjective!  Second, it doesn't seem to me that the killer had a good motive.  If he wanted to kill the woman who helped him steal money and food, wouldn't it be easier to just shoot her?  I think the killer is either very stupid or very lucky.  The "M" stands for "magnificent" and I really hope the killer gets a chance to prove himself.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must read for anyone interested in this topic.  I think it was written well and has a good amount of information.

But the best part of the book is the pictures

It's a wonderful book, full of wonderful insights, and the ideas are well presented.  The most important thing is to not be afraid to change one's mind, as so many others seem to do, and to be confident in your ideas.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one that I wish I had read when I first started in philosophy.  It is wonderfully simple and practical, and, most importantly, it is very accessible to both the beginner and the expert.  There are a few more formal texts, but they are more theoretical than practical, which makes it easier to digest and understand.  The first few chapters are fairly basic, but the rest are all the more interesting because they discuss more philosophical ideas, such as the existence of an object (existence), the idea of a non-physical reality (theism), etc.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get started in Philosophy

But if you are looking for a good starting point and want to try out some recipes for yourself

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book to read for children, but I think it would be even more helpful for adults to read, if only for the information they get from the pictures.

The book does a great job of giving an overview of a relatively short period in the history of England, from about 700 to 1300.  It is a great deal more than just a quick look at the various accounts and records.  Many of the accounts are fairly recent, and the information is not easy to locate, but the overall flow of the book is great.  There is plenty of information for further reading and more research.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in college.  I have enjoyed it over and over again.  It is not a dry book.  The author presents a wealth of information on the subjects of religion and the supernatural, from basic principles to specifics.  There are numerous illustrations of a variety of topics, including a detailed account of the workings of the Vatican, and various other details of the church.  What sets this book apart from the others I have read, however, is the way in which the book is presented in a negative light.  This is because the author focuses on the evils of religion, rather than the good, as well as the ways in which religion can be reformed.  Religion, as it is presented here, has become an integral part of the fabric of society.  If people are to become more tolerant, they will have to accept religion as a part of society, as opposed to the view presented in this book. I would encourage you to purchase this book, as I do.

This is a great book to read and understand the history and people of America.  My son was really excited about the American Revolutionary War.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book. I think it's the best book I've read so far on the subject of religion. I really appreciate the fact that I am not the only one who thinks this way. It is also very funny. The author goes into great detail about how Christianity has changed over the centuries and is very informative.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who likes to learn more about religion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The idea that we must teach our children the truth of life is a great idea, but I find this story of a young girl, Mary, who is lost, beautiful, and confused, and who is desperate for her mother to help her find her.  This story is very well written and is an excellent example of how to teach a child who is having a difficult time.  I really loved this story, but it wasn't long enough in length for me to finish it.  There were so many details that I felt like I had to know all of them before I could move on to the next story.  It is very easy to finish this book in a couple of days!  I found it very helpful, as well as inspirational, to have an explanation of the story to my daughter.  The first page of this story was the hardest for her to read.  Then she began to get past that and began to see that it was all about her and how she was struggling with the idea that she might be lost and that she needed help.  She is still struggling with this concept and is in the process of trying to figure out how to find her mother.  Although this story is not overly complicated, it does introduce the concept of life without a mother and also introduces the idea of "love".  I would love to see this story in a children's book because it is one that we can use to explain what love is.  We can teach our kids about love without getting into the confusing, but helpful, concepts of "not loving".  This is a wonderful story and it will hopefully keep them entertained and engaged 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A must read for anyone with children and/or parents who are new to this exciting field of children's books.  You will not be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is very detailed and has lots of great information. It is very helpful for those of us who have to make a life decision in a few months. It gives us some insight and help with all the decisions. It does not mention any particular reason why a person would choose a religious life over a secular one.  It is not too detailed.  For those who want to know what to think and what to do, this book will answer all your questions 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been working on my second book and I have found myself looking at this book every chance I get.  I am very pleased with the book and the lessons it offers.  The book focuses on the topics of how to build a positive relationship with a dog and the importance of taking your dog for walks and how to keep a dog happy.  While the book does not delve into the topic of training or how to manage a dog, I found it to be very helpful for my own relationship with my dog.  It is a very helpful book for anyone who wants to learn how to handle a dog as well as how to deal with a negative dog 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very positive review and very helpful.  The author has done a great job describing each of the seven major characteristics of a successful book.  Each one is quite well done, and in some cases, you can even see the first three characteristics (plot, characters, and theme) that make up the core of the book. You will find the rest of the characteristics and themes in the next few pages, and you will have learned more about a book than you ever thought you could!  This is a wonderful book. I will certainly buy this book again 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book I always wanted to read.  I am very happy with the information in this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have not seen many books on Chinese language.  So I decided to check it out.  I like the way this book lays it out and the fact that it has many pictures.  But it is by no means complete.  The book is written in both Mandarin and Cantonese.  As an instructor I am interested in teaching both Mandarin Chinese and Canteese.  It is clear that there are some differences between the two languages, especially in vocabulary.  However, it is interesting to see how many similarities there are between the languages and how they are so different from each other.  Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who is learning Mandarin or Canteasy.  This book covers all the basics, such as pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.... 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am not a huge fan of books on photography, but I did appreciate the idea that this book provided a very detailed look at what it was like to photograph the first pictures of the U.S.A. in the early 20th century.

This book is so well done that I could have read it for the next 20 years.  It has been a long and difficult road for me to finish this book.  But I finally got it done.  Don't get me wrong, I am not a fan of the  J.K. Rowling series.   But, I was drawn to this story because it has the chance to show us the darker side of our past 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only thing I can say to you about this book is that it is a must read. It's funny and it's educational.

It has helped me learn a lot and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in making their own decision about religion and spirituality.  The author is a positive and sincere person who tries to be honest with her readers.  In the end I think she does a good job, but there are a few things I would like to see changed in the next edition.  I think the best book is The Miracle of The Baha'i Faith 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book for people who want to know more about Islam, the Prophet Mohamed, his life, his beliefs, and the life and times of the Muslims.  This book is a treasure trove of information, including history, life and belief of the Prophet, his family, and companions, his followers, his enemies, his foes, his friends, his neighbors, and those who came after him.  It also includes biographical facts on the Muslim world, his relationships with other Muslims, his own life, and his beliefs.  I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about this amazing religion 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read a lot of book reviews, and I've got to say this is one of the best.  I like how he describes all the information in this book, without sounding like a book: He tells us what's wrong with our society and why, then shows us how to fix it.  A lot of the books out there tell us the same thing, but not so much the same as this.  This is the book I've been looking for, and it was so very helpful!  I hope others will read it, too.  You'll be amazed by what you learn.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I've been looking for a book that teaches you how to create a realistic and engaging fantasy.  I have seen so many other books that I thought it would be helpful to try to write a fantasy book myself.  This book helped me get my first novel published in 2009.  A lot of the book is a basic guide to creating the fantasy world, but it also teaches you a few other things.  You will need to create your own monsters, monsters from other books or movies, creatures that are out of the ordinary, creatures who don't belong in your fantasy world.  The book also has sections for creatures who are in the book, and sections for the creatures in your book.  It is a great book to get started on your fantasy novel

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not only a fascinating history of the Viking age, but also a history of Norse mythology and religion.  I cannot help but admire the amount of information that this book gives the reader.  The only negative that I can think of is that it may be a little difficult for those not familiar with Norse mythology or religion to understand and appreciate.  However, it is an interesting read and very informative, so it would be worth it to those that do not understand it, just to see if the information is useful to them 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book while in my Ph.D. program. It's a fantastic resource for understanding a subject and giving students the ability to solve it. I would recommend it for the serious students, but not as a quick read. It would take a couple of readings to get through all the information in it 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is just as well written as the one on "Gourmet Food and Dining".  It's the best book I've read on the subject and I've eaten a lot of it!

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a first-year student at the University of New Hampshire, where the school history courses are taught, and I needed to do some research on this very important topic.  I have read several of his books on history and geography and have found them very enlightening.  In his "History of American English", he describes the English language in its original form and gives some basic information about its pronunciation.  He also gives an overview of the early history of the American English language, including a brief history of its pronunciation, as well as a description of how pronunciation has changed over time.  The book is very readable and is a good reference book for both students and non-students.  As a student I found it especially helpful when I wanted to compare the pronunciation of English to that of other languages.  His "American English" is very useful for both beginners and students.  It will also help those who want to learn about American English from an academic perspective.  There are also two other excellent books on this subject, "English as a Second Language" by Dr. J. C. Latham, and "A History of English" by C. E. Liddiard.  These books are excellent and highly recommended

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book. I have a small book collection of all sorts of things from history to mythology.  It is great to have a book like this to go over the different myths and legends.  I really enjoyed reading this book and found that it was well organized and easy to read.  All of the legends and myths are well explained and are easy to follow.  There are a few stories that I found a little hard to understand, however  I feel that it's understandable.  The main character, the person in question, is very relatable 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read several books on photography, and this one is by far the best I have ever read.  I recommend it highly 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an incredible book. I have had the book for a long time and now I am reading it for the first time. It's just so well written. It is very insightful. I think it is a must read for those that are considering leaving the church, especially those that want to get back in. The book was given to me by my husband and I have read it twice. I want to read it again.  The book does a great job of answering many questions.  I am glad to be part of a church that would help others like myself. I would recommend this book to all those that would like to get to the truth. I will be giving it to my friend who is leaving the Church and I will also be giving a copy to the other friends that I have that are leaving as well 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful read. It is easy to read, but difficult to put down

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book at a college conference.  I was in my first year of law school and I had just received a full scholarship.  While I was reading I realized that I knew nothing about the case of Adnan Syed.  The book explained to me the legal intricacies and the circumstances of the case.  It also explained the legal process of post-conviction.  There are lots of details in this book and I would highly recommend it for the legal novice or the law student who may not know the details and may not understand the law.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you're looking for a good review about the book, don't worry, I'm sure you will find it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is a wonderful introduction to the theory of money and credit, and it provides an excellent introduction to both topics.  There are few books on money and markets that have the same level of detail as this one, and I feel that it provides a much more comprehensive view of both.  I recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to learn more about money and how the system works.  The author has done a fantastic job in making this book accessible to the layman.  He is an excellent writer, and the information he provides on the theories of money, credit, the money supply and the interest rate is extremely well done.  This book is very concise, and very readable.  If you are new to the topic of money then I would suggest that you begin with the introductory chapter, which covers the basic background on money, the role that banks play in the economy and the role of the Federal Reserve System.  Once you have an understanding of the basics you can proceed to the next two chapters, which will provide more in depth analysis of the theories behind the Federal reserve system.  After that you will need to go back and read through the books that I have listed below.  To those who want a more detailed look at this topic I would recommend that you start with chapter 6 of "The Money Market Guide" which is a comprehensive review of the money markets.  It covers the theory behind the money market system, the rules that govern money markets and the money stock market.  While this is a very basic look at money markets it will also give you the tools to better understand the market itself and the market impact of the interest rates on interest rates.  So if you are looking to learn about the theory and history behind the market then this book is for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a great story to tell.  It was fun to read and interesting to learn.  The stories are short but very exciting.

A great book for anyone who is looking for something to get them interested in the world of animals! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is a compilation of stories that are told by the likes of B.B. King, Joe Zawinny and others.   I enjoyed the book as much as the author.

The examples really are very helpful, as they show you how to write a good story, but they are also so thought provoking.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book to teach elementary school students about different parts of the Bible.  I have had many conversations with parents who have not had an understanding of the various parts of scripture.  This book will be helpful for them to have a basic understanding of what parts of their faith are.  The book does a great job at explaining the differences in the books of the bible and the differences between the parts.  It is a very well written book that does a wonderful job of explaining the different parts. It is easy to read, but the student can't be expected to know all the words in the book, which is a great aid to the student.  Also, the book is in the Bible so it is very helpful to have it at hand.  However, it does not contain all the information that the student needs to have for the book to be effective.  For example, there are a few parts that are very confusing for the student, so it helps to have the Bible and other parts of bible to help the student with the questions.  If you have questions about what part of the church you are a member of, ask your pastor.  They can help you with that part 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was introduced to this book by a good friend of mine.  He read it and recommended it to me.  I have loved it!

I recommend it for anyone who wants to understand what's happening today and in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had no idea how much I would enjoy this book until I read it.  I can't remember the last book I read that left me so completely, emotionally, and intellectually stimulated.

If you are a serious reader, or if you want to know more about this life, this is a must read

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an absolute must-read for anyone who enjoys reading about the life of a very well-known author, who, to date, has written over 200 books, and has had an enormous impact on the world. In this book, he gives a detailed account of his life, from his childhood in New York City to his present-day life as a respected, respected and very wealthy man who is also a well-traveled, well-informed and well-educated man. The author explains his many achievements, the successes and failures that have led him to where he is today. It is very touching and enjoyable to read.

If you're interested in the man who changed the course of world history, you owe it to yourself to read this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent book, with an excellent collection of stories and an interesting character, and I think the reader will like this story.  The author has a great style and is a very talented writer, and this story is very different from the stories we have been reading in the past.  It is a tale that takes place in the real world, and the story takes place on the outskirts of an alien spaceship that crash lands on earth, and it has been found and is being repaired by a mysterious group of people that seem to be part of a group that has come from another planet 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read many books and have always been disappointed when the authors do not write about real life.  In this book I have been extremely happy.  It is very interesting, very relevant and has been written from a perspective that most people could understand.  If you are in need of a few simple ideas and can be easily influenced by a few facts, this book is for you.  I found it to be an excellent resource.  For instance, in this book it is clearly stated that "people don't like to believe the things they don't see".  I would like to know more about what "people" do not like to see and how we could improve our lives and how to improve the world.  Also, it was very enlightening for me to see how people have thought and acted in other countries.  The book would have made an even greater book if the authors could have written the same thing in the United States.  However, this was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone looking for answers and solutions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The author's unique insights on the world of the early modern period (1500-1800) are beautifully written and illustrated with a great deal of detail.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read and loved both of the "Witch" series and now I am ready to delve into the "Black Magic" series.  The first few chapters are the most intriguing and entertaining as the reader gets to know the characters.  However, as the story progresses, the plot moves into the realm of the really good.  It is very hard to believe that this is a fantasy novel.  You have to suspend your disbelief and suspend your judgement at certain points, and some will certainly have to be taken away from the book if you don't like it.  If you want to learn more about this series, I would suggest that you read all of the books in order as you will be spoiled if you only read the first or second chapter

The book is organized into sections by geography, alphabetically by alphabetical designation of geographical locations, with a section for each language. There are also sections for each kingdom or tribe which existed at that time, as there were in fact four. The sections on the languages are especially interesting, as they show the evolution of the language, the differences between languages, and the evolution and evolution of those who spoke the languages.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I had read a couple of previous novels by Paul Auster and was looking for a more personal and funny take on this very strange character.  This novel takes a more serious turn for the reader and the characters grow closer and become more of a unit.  The story is told in a simple yet unique way and it's not long before you begin to get a little tired of the twists and turns of this story, but I think you will enjoy it for it's simplicity.

For example, there is a chapter on the New York City street scene, which is actually quite detailed, and is interesting to look at, but is also interesting in its own right.

Her first novel, The Time of the Owl, is a wonderful blend of suspense, romance and humor. The Time and the Place is a perfect blend of fantasy and realism.

The author goes into great detail about how the children grew up, and how their parents changed from a loving couple to an angry and bitter couple, and eventually a family with two children who both left the house.  It is a wonderful book that gives us a little insight into what it is like to be a family, what it's like to live with someone who is angry and not being kind to anyone, and what it was like to grow up as a child who was loved and cared for.  A great read

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read a few other books on the same topic, but I think this is the best of them.  The book itself is a beautiful, thought provoking, and informative look at the ways in which the Catholic Church has treated LGBT people over the years.  I love how the author is so direct, honest, and straightforward.  He makes clear that the Catholic teaching on marriage and sexuality is not a blanket condemnation of all gay people, but rather a means to a more loving, kind, and understanding life for all people.  There are many ways of approaching this subject, but he is the only one I have seen so consistently direct, articulate, and honest with regard to the Church's position.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an interesting look at the early development of the Jewish state.  The book starts from the perspective of the Jews living in exile in Palestine at the time of the British Mandate.  After the liberation of Israel from the British in 1948, the Jews who remained there were given a special status.  They were allowed to establish a state within the state of Israel.  This was not the case in most of the Arab countries.  In fact, the Arabs who remained in Israel were persecuted for their religious beliefs.  While the Jews of Palestine had to be careful about their religion, the situation of the Muslims of the Middle East was not so.  Muslims were given full citizenship in Israel. The Jews who fled to Israel after the war were not granted such privileges.  These stories, told by two authors, give us an understanding of how the Jews were able to establish the state in Palestine in 1948.  If one takes a different view on the founding of the state, there is also a fascinating look at how the Zionists were able (in the absence of any help from the Arabs) to take control of the land of Israel and turn it into a prosperous state. The author of the first chapter, a professor at Princeton, tells us the historical background of the area in which Israel now resides.  There are many interesting stories in the book.  Most of them are about the founding period of the modern Jewish state, from 1879 to 1948. I especially liked the discussion of how some Arab leaders in Palestine had wanted to see Israel's existence as a separate state for the Arab Muslims.  A few chapters were written by a historian who spent time in Israel, and I found his writing to be very informative

If you don't know what viruses are, you can ask the vendor at your computer store to show you what types of viruses are.

He gives examples from his own life, and his observations on the family and his parents.  They are very relatable, and really seem to be very real, which I like.  In some ways I felt that his writing was a little more direct and personal, as it wasn't always so easy to get into, but I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a deeper understanding of themselves and their relationships

I am not a historian or an American, so it is hard to imagine how anyone could not like this book.  What a great book!  It covers all of the major events and the roles they played in the life of the United States.  The information provided was very helpful and I would not be without it.  If you are looking for a good story, then this is a good choice 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had the book years ago and am just now finishing it.  I was surprised at how much information I've gathered since.  This book is the one book I keep at the library, and is the first I read.  The book is great for people who are looking for an overview of basic topics, such as the history of the English language.  It covers the history from the time of the Roman Empire, up to the present day, in great detail.  There is also an entire section for the history and vocabulary of the French language.The author uses a mixture of anecdotes and historical facts to make his point.  Most of the stories are based on actual historical events.  If you are interested in language, this is a great book to learn more about the language

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I am not an expert in Japanese history and the life of the samurai, but I love the pictures.  It is really cool to see these samurai warriors, so different from us, with such fierce emotions, so determined to survive.  They were a force to be reckoned with, but not in the way that we are today.  I loved how they kept the samurai code alive and how the codes of the different samurai clans were different.  You see, they were warriors, not just businessmen, businessmen like us, but warriors.  This book made me feel like I was looking back into the past with my own ancestors, not the modern ones.  The pictures are great, and the book was easy to read and I enjoyed the pictures and the history.  If you want to read about the samurai from 1400 to 1600, I would suggest this book, as the images are beautiful, and not overly difficult to understand.  For those who are not interested in the history, but just in the pictures, I suggest this one.  However, I did not find the information that was presented in this book to be very useful, in fact it was a little confusing.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful collection of articles and essays, in which Dr. John C. Nock, author of the famous, best selling book, A Natural History of Human Aggression, presents his findings on the origins and prevalence of human aggression. The author presents a fascinating, unbiased look at the evolutionary roots of human violence, and provides readers with an excellent explanation of why aggression is a biological trait. As a biologist, Dr. Nocks' research is truly in a class of its own, and the reader will be able to see the evolutionary origins of aggression and violence firsthand. Dr. C.Nock, who was a high ranking professor at MIT and an award winning journalist and researcher, also provides his own perspective on the causes and consequences of human aggressive behavior. His views on the evolution of aggression are so far from those of his colleagues and fellow biologists, however, that it's easy to be cynical about his credentials, yet this book, along with the articles, essays, and other publications, clearly demonstrate the veracity and validity of his claims.  I encourage the reader to do further research on this subject, for the results of his research are indeed fascinating and important. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is just beautiful.  It will make you think!  It has some of the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen!

Write a positive review about a good book:  It is hard to believe that such a good work as The Book of Children is only a century old.  It contains wonderful descriptions of the life and times of children, and it is an excellent reference for parents who are having a child or who are parents who want to learn about the ways children are raised.  The author, Mrs. Mary Eddy, is one of the best authors I have seen, and this book is as close to perfect as I have ever seen.  If you are new to childrearing, this book will help you understand your child, and will be an excellent book to have in your library.  I would love to see this book published in paperback 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had never heard of a book called "The Art of Being Creative" until I stumbled upon this one. I had been a creative writer for many years, but in the past two years have been taking a much more personal interest in how my creative efforts were affecting my life. This book made the process of figuring out how I can improve my creative process very easy for me to understand. It helped me get more creative, and I am sure it will help others too

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so excited to read this book. I was a freshman in college when the 9/11 attacks took place, and I was in total shock.  I had no clue what was happening, and still don't, but I think this book gives us a better idea of what is going on and helps us to understand the world a little better.  It also gives us some insight into the world, and the ways we view it, that we didn't even realize existed before.  What I love most about this book is that it is written by one of the most intelligent people I have ever met.  His writing style is so accessible and easy to read that you can easily tell he is just telling a story.  The story itself is simple, but the themes and questions are very interesting.  If you want to learn more about the world today and what is happening, this book will help you tremendously

I would recommend it to everyone

Write a positive review about a good book:  The most interesting and insightful book I have read in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great example of the interconnecting story of the people of the Americas and their relationship to the past and the future.  This is a very personal history of the peoples of the New World who were conquered by the Spanish, the English and the Portuguese.  It tells the story of how the New Worlds were colonized by the European nations, how they were shaped by the Europeans and how they fought each other in order to protect their homelands.  The book also explores the political issues of the time period in which the Spanish and English were ruling the NewWorld.  I highly recommend this book for the history of NewWorld peoples, their culture, their language, their religion, their economy, their politics and their society.  They are the original settlers of North America and the inspiration for the United States.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of both John Lennon and John Shanks, and I've read each of their books on multiple occasions, but this one was by far the best.  It has a great plot, characters, and overall feel to it.  I will probably re-read it at least three times, as I'm sure it will be a favorite of mine for a long time to come.  The characters are very believable, and the situations are very well written.  What I also like is that they are presented in a somewhat "realistic" manner.  This is a great book for any person who wants to learn more about Lennon and Shanks.  Don't let the cover fool you, as this book is actually a collector's item

He is also known for his love for animals

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book.  I have read it in its entirety and I have yet to see anything in it that I do not like.  It is funny and touching and not afraid to go into dark territory and talk about some things that are hard to understand.  If you are looking for a book that will help you understand more about how to deal with your parents (or maybe even better than this one), this is for you.  You will never see it mentioned in the books that are aimed at parents, as this one is not for you and you will not be judged for it.  The author is very helpful and the book is very good and has helped me understand my parents better.  Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book for all of us. I've read the whole book and have so much more to learn from it.  It is very well done and is very useful to learn about different ways of being in a bad relationship

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a second year graduate student in history and am teaching a course on American history. I wanted to learn more about my great-grandfather, who immigrated to the United States in 1898 and lived in the Midwest for 40 years.  This book has been a great resource for me.  I feel it has been the perfect companion to the course I am teaching.  In it, the authors have given a wonderful view into my great grandfather's life.  It is an important historical document to read, and I have found it fascinating.  They go into detail on everything, from the financial difficulties he faced at his first job as a farmer, to his involvement in the Civil War, to the many obstacles he encountered in his efforts to establish his own family business.  The authors have also given a good overview on how many of the immigrants were treated in their early years in America.  Many were taken away from their families and sent to live in camps.  While there, they were forced to build their own homes in the forests and forests were found throughout America. In addition, they have given an insight into the hardships that were faced by my great granddad and other immigrant families, which they have written about.  Overall, this book is an excellent book.  Great value for the money!  A great read for all history lovers

If you are like me and have an interest in photography, you will most likely want to take a look at a few more books by photographer's such as Jim Cooke and the late Gordon Pinske.  The book that stands out the most is Gordon Pinsky's book, The Photography School.  This book was the basis for the photography degree I obtained at the University of Michigan and I will always consider this book the best book on photography.  It is full of great information that can be applied to everyday life, however you choose to use your camera.  I would suggest that if you have any interest in taking pictures, read this book

A great book for the history enthusiast, and a great resource for the historical illiterates 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is wonderful and the information it offers is quite helpful for anyone who wants to learn about the history of the country.  However, it is a little too short and does not go as far as some other books do.  For instance, it does not include all the states that exist in the United States (California, New York, Virginia, Delaware, Rhode Island).  However it does include all of the states, both those that have seceded from the United State (Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, etc) and those that are currently part of the United Sates (Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming).  I would have liked it to have included the Northern States as well, as the northern states have been a part of America since the beginning of the world.  If you are interested in learning about this history please read this book as it is great but is also quite short 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is amazing. It has given me a lot to think about. It will help you understand more about the world of women in the 21st century. The author is not only a scientist, but a very articulate and very well-written woman. I highly recommend this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that I have been looking for for years to find out about the real meaning of Jesus. I am a Catholic, and I can't get past the "Why" of the crucifixion, and the reason I cannot get past it is that I don't have all the answers. It is an important book, one that has been lacking in many ways. It does a lot of work on the "why", and it is the first book I have ever read that explains the "how". It is very well done and I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book with a positive spin on the theme of "The Road to the Moon".

If you are a sufferer or someone who is close to someone who suffers from an eating disorder then this book will be very helpful.  I cannot believe I have not read this book before!  I have read the first part of it and now I am struggling with the second part.  This is what you do when you have the disorder - you read.

It is a very difficult disease to deal with - the person who is in it is not always aware that they have it

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been researching the subject of early history for some time now, and have discovered a great deal of interest in early American history. However, there are many books written by those who are not historians. This book was written by an expert in American history, who has a strong background in history, with a focus on the period from the colonial era through the Civil War.  The title is appropriate.  If you want to know more about early American politics and society, this is a great book.  This book is not overly academic, but it does provide an excellent understanding of how early Americans viewed their own country, and how that view has changed over time.  It also provides some insight into the various political and social movements that were taking place in early America, and explains how various leaders in the country, including those of the American colonies, were viewed by those of other parts of the world.  I would highly recommend this book for the serious student of American history

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I have read so far on the topic of sex, sexuality, and relationships.  The author goes into detail about what it means to be sexually open and sexually active, what sexual fantasies are, and what sexual activities are actually considered normal.  It is also very interesting to read a woman talking about her sexual experiences, as I have been in many relationships where I was unsure if it was even a "normal" experience.  As a young man, I had very few sexual fantasies.  However, as an adult woman, I have had many sexual fantasies which were sexual in nature, but not considered sexual at the time.  This book helps me understand what sexual activity is "normal", and why certain things are "normal".  It also provides information on how to make healthy sexual relationships. The author is very clear on the sexual activity she is talking about, and the dangers of pornography.  I especially liked the chapter on pornography, because I have a great amount of pornography in my life.  If you are struggling with sexual issues, this book is for you

I really enjoyed the characters and I was very happy to have read the story. The only negative I have is that the book was not quite complete. It had been split into chapters for different purposes. I would have loved to have seen more of the story and some more of each character. The characters were so well written and I wanted to see more of them. I hope the book will be used as a reference for future authors. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is a good example of how to do the "Dilbert" in a fun and interesting way.

The layout is simple, the text is easy to read, and the book can be used for a wide variety of purposes, from creating a simple greeting card, to a gift book with a personalized message.  I really hope this book helps people get started with their own books and the ideas it provides are helpful.  If you like what you've made and want to expand upon it, I would suggest making a gift, or giving it to a good friend or loved one 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've just read a good electronic book (on the History of the American English Language), which is not quite as well-written as this, and I'm thinking it could use a little more detail in the history of the English language.  I am glad I found this.  The book is not without a few errors, but it's clear and concise enough to get through the chapters.  This is certainly an excellent book, which could be improved with a little help in correcting some of the mistakes in it, such as the use of "dude" for "dud" (I use the term "dub" for it), which would be a major error.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A very enjoyable read! Great characters and an overall good story.  The story is very different and not overly sentimental.

There are some great quotes in this book, and they are very helpful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read many of the works on the island, and the one that stands out in my mind is "A Guide to Life on the Isle of Nagauste."

Overall I think it is a great addition to the world of history, and I am looking forward to reading more from this book. I recommend it

It was an excellent resource to learn some information about the life of Jesus Christ.  He was so simple, but had such a profound impact on all who knew him.  I want to learn more about him so that I can share the Gospel with others who are struggling with this great decision.  This book is one of the most important and helpful books I have read.  Jesus is not the son of God, but the Son of God.  God created him to serve the world and he lives in the world to serve.  Do not doubt for a second that God lives in Jesus

This book will certainly help many future generations understand the workings of government and the importance of the educational system.  Highly recommended

Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I have read this year.  I think I read all the books in this series and am starting to wish I had read them all before reading this.  The story is very entertaining and not as simplistic as the other books.   I have seen the other one and the book is far better than this one.  It would be great if we could get this series made into a movie

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book! I have read all of her books and love them.  She is an amazing writer and I have learned so much from her.  I find myself in the "uncomfortable" position of liking this book as much as I like her books.  Her story of finding her father's book in the garage is a heartwarming and beautiful story!  It is a very rare book that does not have the "deeper" story of a child's disappearance.  The story of the mother's guilt and fear is also very interesting.  But the book as a whole is very "lovely".  I would give it 5 stars if I could

The information in this book is very informative, but is not the best book on earth, nor does it explain all the facts. If you have any interest in knowing what is below the earth and what is happening here, this book will answer your question.  It is a great book for a beginner or an intermediate level geologist to read, or just someone who is looking for a basic, but very readable book.  The book covers a lot of topics, and most of the information in it is easily accessible

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book. I loved it because I am a fan of the "Practical Wisdom" series.  The "Podcasts" series has given many a glimpse into the practical side of life.  This book has an excellent format and has helped many readers who are in the same situation as me to understand what they can do with their lives.  It has helped me understand the importance of planning and how to deal with emergencies in case of a life-threatening situation.  I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to understand their own life better and in case they ever find themselves in an emergency situation. It is not a book that you just drop on the floor and read, but rather one that you do some reading about and then do some more reading about.  What a book this is, it's hard to imagine!  I am happy with the format, the ideas, and the direction that this book has taken.  Do I recommend this for beginners and what have you?  If you like the format of this book, it would be a good place to start for you to learn how to plan and organize your life.The book is also a great read for anyone who has been to a bad book and is trying to get themself to make better decisions.  Many of the lessons are for those who have had the bad book.  They may not be for those that have not read a bad books

It has been my bible for the last 18 years.  The book is a great way to help your clients understand the way you feel and how to deal with it.  If you are not comfortable with the idea of being in therapy (I certainly am), then this book is an excellent resource 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read many books on this topic, but this is the only one that I believe is helpful for a beginner.  It covers the fundamentals of how to write a good novel.  I found it helpful to review some other books first, as this one does.  You should learn how to outline and plot and create characters, then come back here to write your novel.The only negative review I have is that the text can get a bit technical.  But it is clear and concise, and the exercises help to clarify your ideas and give you ideas on how to improve your novel

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you are a parent and have a few questions about parenting, this book will help you put them into perspective.  If not, it will still be helpful.  The book includes a helpful list of resources and tips for parents, as well as a lot of ideas for other questions you might have.  I have been very fortunate to have experienced both my parents having children and to be parents myself.  There are a lot more resources out there for parents and I would like to take advantage of them.  But the book is really just an outline.  We all need to go out and do the work to figure out what our children are like, how they act, what they like, and what to do about it 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been in a long relationship with my ex, and have been living with him for a year and a half.

I recommend it for all who want to learn more about the history of this nation.  The book covers the history from the first battle of Lexington to the last battle of the Revolution.  It is very readable and the information is very informative.  Many new ideas are presented and it is interesting to see how the events of the Revolutionary War were handled by the various governments.  Each of the three governments, the Continental Congress, the British Parliament, and the United States Congress, had their own unique ideas on how the war should be handled.

They all had to move to other places to survive.  A wonderful book

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a little surprised that this was not written by a doctor but rather by an internist, and I have to say I agree with his conclusion.  It is a very readable book and very useful for anyone who wants to understand the importance of getting an accurate diagnosis.  The problem that I found is that he is not able to describe the different types of medical conditions that we see and why they differ from each other.  I have been a physician for the last 16 years, and the book helped me make more accurate diagnoses.  But there are many other books on this subject that I would recommend for more detail.  If you are thinking about getting an exam, I suggest this book because you will be able to make an accurate decision with your patient!  This is one book that I will definitely have in my medical library

The book covers the early days of the church from the founding of the Church in 1820 to 1844. It also covers the Nauvoo Expositor, which is a newspaper published in NauvOO. It is a very interesting history. It would be a great addition to any college history book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the idea of a book that teaches you how to read the Bible.  This book provides a great deal of practical information that is easy to digest.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful book by the great John A. Johnson.  I have not read many of his books, but this one was absolutely beautiful.  He uses the story of Noah as an analogy for many of the themes that are discussed in this book.  The first half of the book is about how God is loving and forgiving towards mankind.  But in the second half of it, Noah's story is the focus.  It is also about how Noah's sin of not being careful of his family was his greatest sin.  This is the perfect way to illustrate the message of the gospel.  There are many wonderful messages to be found in this one book, and I would recommend it to everyone

It is a great book for a beginner to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished reading this book, and I have to say, I'm so glad I bought it. I've been trying to find a good short story in all the books I've read (not just this one). I've come to a book that just seems to fit. The story itself is a little slow, but I like it that way. I think the reason for the slow pacing is that it really gets to the point of the characters' personalities and the themes of the story. It seems that the characters don't have as many moving parts as they do in other stories I've seen, so the pacing is slower. The book also gives us a great sense of the world, the characters, and the world is slowly revealed. I'm glad the author is giving us so much to think about. It is a shame that most other books don't do this, but it is great to see a good story like this. I would buy it again for sure 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must for anyone who wants to know more about the history of the ancient world.  It's packed with many pictures and facts to help the reader visualize and understand the life and times of the people of the first few thousand years ago.  I was in Greece for just a few days and I spent my time looking for information on the ancient cities and monuments.  The books written by others helped me learn some of the history and culture of the area, but this one was especially helpful.  In addition to giving a more complete picture of the life of the Greek and Roman people, it also gives a few interesting ideas on the history, religion, and culture surrounding us today

A must have for any aspiring entrepreneur 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very educational.  The first section of the book talks about the origin of the word "basket", and gives a lot of background.  It also talks about some of the most common names for baskets, like "kilt", "lolly", and "quilt".  After that, it dives into some more specific names for the various baskets, such as the "waxen", "hake", "shoe", and the "fishing" baskets.  You really get a sense of the differences between some of these names when you see the examples.  I highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is a great read, it was a great book for a child that I used to do a lot of reading with.  I think the book has a great impact on kids, I think kids will love this book.  It is so funny and really teaches the kids so much!  The art of drawing and the pictures that you see are just so beautiful and so cool and you just feel like you are learning so much.  And the funny stories, it is really funny!  It also has really cool illustrations and it is great for kids that are not very skilled at drawing.  So I highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I've seen this book referred to many times. It's so simple and it's such a great book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I have ever read.  If you are looking for some insight into the life of Jesus Christ, this book is a must.  The main reason why I haven't read the Bible yet, is that I haven´t been able to locate the information on the pages, that I could read with my heart and mind.  What a blessing it would be to have some knowledge about Jesus´s life and death, to be able to see the answers to some of the questions I have been having.  In this book, we will get some clues, some answers, some insights, some comfort, and some questions that will be asked and answered, in just such a way, that it will change your life

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've read so far in my life.  I love the characters and the themes that make up the story.  It is so easy to read, the story is well paced and very memorable.  The only negative review I have is that the book could have been shorter, as it could have easily been the main plot of one of the more well known novels.  This book could very well have been one or two more pages, but the author really took it up the hilt in the end, making the story so much more difficult to wrap one's mind around 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first book I ever read was the book entitled "Boys in Pre-School: How To Raise Your Son, The Guide".  It was written by my dad, and it is the only book that I still have in my collection, and I use it regularly to help guide my boys, even though I have no sons myself.  I find the book to be the most effective book I have ever read for raising boys.  The book is comprehensive, but the illustrations are wonderful.  It really is a must have for boys to read if you want to raise boys who are healthy and happy.  In this book, you will find tips for helping your boy with everyday tasks.  There are plenty of examples to help the reader understand how to do the things that boys would like to do.  For example, "How To Hold A Drink" is a fun little activity that can be done at any age and the "How to Clean A Dish" is another great activity to do with your boys. The book also contains a section for boys that have specific problems, such as attention problems, and suggestions on what to do about those problems

The author is so well-informed, and his writing is so funny. I wish more people like him. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's easy to get lost in the world of the occult and to forget that the true power behind the occult is a collective mind.

It helped me to understand why my mother was so sad that my brother and I were raised by a mother and a father who were not related.  If I ever find time to read it again, I will certainly read through it again.  It is not just about my childhood, however. It addresses my feelings about my father. He was my mentor and a mentor to many other boys and young men. He always took an interest in us and wanted us to succeed. His love for us as a family was unconditional. He gave us everything we wanted, even though we were not like the others.  The book also helped me understand how my mother felt, and I know that she felt the same. It's amazing that I had this book to learn from. I wish I had read it when I was a child

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very readable and insightful account of the origins of the Christian faith.  I was surprised to learn that the word "Christianity" does not appear in the book.  The author is right on in suggesting that the faith did not originate with a religious leader or group.  It did originate with the disciples, who were the first Christians, but it was they who made up the first Christian communities.  That's the only way to explain the origin of the faith. I found the author's explanations of Christian theology and the historical Jesus Christ to be quite comprehensive.  He also included an excellent list of key terms, which I thought were very helpful.  Many people would like to learn more about their faith, so this is a book I would recommend to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a long-term fan of Stephen King.  I read the King first edition when I was very young.  Then I read King's sequels and collected the rest.  It was King's magnum opus, The Stand, that opened my eyes and mind to the full scope of the King story.  King's writing style is unique.  However, I had no idea just how much King had been struggling to write.  The story of the "Man in Black" and his dealings with a series of mysterious murders in his past lives is not for the faint-hearted

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a lot of books on the subject of suicide and have read them all, including the ones by Dr. James R. Dukes and Dr. Richard G. Roberts. I had read some of Dr. Roberts' books, and found him to be the most eloquent, the most knowledgeable, and the most practical when it came to suicide prevention.  But it seems that Dr. D. James had a more profound insight and insight into the subject than most. He gave the best advice, though. He did so in a way that would not be considered "elaborate" by most doctors or suicide prevention experts today. He explained why suicide is such a difficult subject, but not one to be afraid of. He also gave very good insight into how to be successful in preventing suicide in the future, which I wish all of us could have. I will certainly be recommending this book to all my friends and colleagues who are concerned about the suicide problem in their community

I loved this book, and so did my high school English teacher. She loved it so much that she gave it to me in class.  I kept it on my shelf for my freshman year, and kept looking for more information.  In my senior year, I began taking an English literature course at MIT. The professor, Ms. Coughlin, told us that the MIT Book of Concordia was a great introduction to the Classics.  The class taught me so much.  As my first class in the class, we read all of the books in the book and then she led us through the various passages from the book.  It was a very inspiring experience for both of us.  Ms. Cloughlin taught us so much more than just about Concordia and the Classics

The first half of the book was interesting enough to make it a quick read.  It has some very interesting information.  But the second half of it was really what made it a special book.  Not only did it give you a lot of background information on the early days of your life, but it also showed you how the world has changed for you.

It's a story that's both funny and heartbreaking, but it's not preachy or preachy at all, just real. I read it and cried, then I cried again because it made me laugh and it made my day.

I recommend it to everyone, no matter what your political views are. I just wish I could read more like it

I think it is a great addition to the series as a whole.  The story is really the best part.  It is the best book ever written.  There are so many great ideas that could have been made into books, but Mamont kept them to himself.

In the end, this book will teach you a lot.  Just keep reading

Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.  I really wish that there was more of this.  The way the book was written and the way that it was illustrated was really amazing.  It really helped me to make sense of all of the characters in the book and really helped to put into words what I could not put into pictures.  And the fact that the story was told by the author and that there were so many characters to read.  Oh my God.  Every character that you see in this book you will find yourself falling in love with.  In fact, I would say that I found myself falling in the same way with all of them.  My favorite characters in this story are the kids.  All of them are adorable and all of you would be better off if you were to adopt one or two of these children 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm always looking for books that give a look into what the Church actually taught, rather than just what they tell us.  This book gives an overview of some of the most basic Church teachings that were taken from the writings of Joseph Smith.  For example, the Book of Mormon tells of a paradise where all of mankind can live forever.  Yet in the Church's own documents and history, the Church admits that there was only one race of people on earth before Adam.  In addition, the early Church leaders, including Joseph Smith, taught that the Book Of Mormon was a revelation from God.  The Book Of Abraham teaches that God has created the entire universe and that the Jews are the chosen people, who have the "right" to rule over all other races.  Joseph Smith's first book was written in 1835, so it would have been fairly easy for him to have read up on the Church before the publication of the Book And The Key, which was published in 1842.  But the key to the Book & Key is in the original Hebrew script, which has been translated by a Christian priest and now known as the King James Version.  There are also some basic truths about God and Man in the Book, which would have seemed pretty basic to Joseph Smith had he been able to read, for example that God's existence is one of three things.  If he had been able, however, he could have seen the Book as teaching that the earth was created in a physical sense, not an all-inclusive spiritual sense.  Some basic ideas such as this would have helped him understand the Book.  I was fortunate to be able to learn some basic ideas from this book, such as the basic doctrine of the Godhead and the Trinity.  So I am glad to see the book still available, with its updated content, especially since it has a very good index and many helpful suggestions for further research.  It also makes the Church more accessible for people of all levels of faith. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great read, especially for newbies. It's a simple overview of basic networking, but with a few very useful tips that can be applied in your career.  If you want to know what it takes to network successfully, this is a must have book

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was amazing! I thought I knew the basics of French, but this book gave me a few more things to learn.

I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a more thorough understanding of French.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I have read on the subject of homosexuality.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding the complexities of this condition.  It has been well researched and written, with examples, and with great clarity.  As a parent, I would recommend this to anyone I know who has children who are gay.  The authors have taken great care to ensure the accuracy of their information.  For example, the definition of homosexuality is quite clear; however, it is not the same as the one given by the American Psychiatric Association, as some have mistakenly asserted.  This book was very helpful in helping me understand my own son and why he was attracted to boys.  Finally, I believe that the authors do not suggest that all gay people are mentally ill, or that all homosexual behavior is harmful.  However, I do not think that it is possible to be gay without having some degree of mental illness.  Regardless, this book is a good resource for those of us who want to learn more about this important subject

Write a positive review about a good book:  A fascinating insight into the lives and times of a young man who grew up in the Boston ghetto.  His stories reveal a complex and courageous man who rose to the challenges of growing up in a difficult world.  Many of the stories are very relatable, as he recounts his childhood, his relationship with his father and his family, his experiences in the Navy and in prison, and his journey to become a successful business owner in Boston.  The stories are not overly dramatized, and many of the details are quite accurate.  This is a must-read for anyone who is interested in the life and times, and the challenges, of a boy who grew in the slums of Boston.The stories are a mixture of factual accounts, stories told to the boys in the ghetto by their parents, as well as oral histories, and some that are completely fictional.  In addition to the historical accounts, there are stories about the boys' personal life in the early 1900s and some of the challenges they faced, including the gangsterism of the time.  They also talk about the difficulties they faced when they were young, including getting a job, being accepted into school, and even marriage and the hardships they experienced.  It is a great book to read with the boys, and I would highly recommend it

Write a positive review about a good book:  The most exciting, and sometimes controversial, aspect of this book is the book's treatment of the idea that the United States is an Anglo-Saxon empire.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I think that this is a very helpful guide for those who are trying to decide whether to be a parent or not.  It is a great book to get your questions answered.  There are a lot of questions that parents and children are unsure about.  I especially liked the "What are the signs that I am not ready to be parents" questions.  Most parents are not ready at all!  There is a lot to think about before you decide.  If you decide that you want to be an adult with a child, or if you decide you want a child someday, I would highly recommend this book.  The questions are short and simple and will give you a great answer

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you are looking for a positive book about the book "Rise of the Third Reich" in Europe, read this book. It gives the reader an insight on the situation in the Nazi Germany.  It is a comprehensive history and gives the history behind the political ideas of the German Nazis. It is also an interesting story, if a little sad, that it is necessary to read the book because it can be very hard to believe the atrocities that took place.  A lot has happened in Germany in the last 50 years and it is a shame that it has to be told in such a sad way. It would be a good idea for Germany to be a democratic country again and not like the way it is today. If you wish to learn more about the events that took the lives of so many people in Europe and you are interested in reading "RISE OF THE THIRD REICH", I recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've never been to any of the author's books before and found them to be an interesting and enlightening read.  I was a bit surprised at how much I enjoyed the first chapter.  It was a nice introduction to a variety of different areas of philosophy.  But the real interest in this book was in its discussions about how different kinds of people view the world.  If you are a skeptic or a believer in God, then this book will give you some ideas on how to deal with the evidence that you might find to be in your way.  This book has a bit more in common with Michael Crick's The God Delusion than with other popular books on the subject.  However, I think the book is well written and is an interesting overview of the various approaches people take to trying to understand the universe.  The author does a nice job of providing background on the various philosophies and approaches to the universe that are in use today.  There is also a great discussion of the philosophical differences between religious and atheistic people.  Not only does this book make the reader understand the philosophical disagreements, it also presents some interesting ideas on ways to deal effectively with these disagreements

Write a positive review about a good book:  A very well-researched book that provides a great insight into how a small town is run and how it is possible for a small city to rise up to become a world-class city like New York or London.  The book is very well written and offers lots of useful hints and examples.  Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has so much information about various cultures.  I would like to see a book similar to the one by J.B. MacLeod, "The Secret Language of the Ancient Egyptians", about the Egyptians.  However, it is only the first part of a larger book.  This is the best book ever written on ancient Egypt, so far.  It is also, however, very hard to read.  If you are interested in Egyptian culture, this book is the only way to go

The book was beautifully written and well organized with great illustrations. The illustrations are a great help in showing the key people, places, and events of the 20th Century and the World. The author, Michael W. Miller, really does a great job in explaining all of the names and events. The names of people, dates and places are listed alphabetically and chronologically.  This is a great book to learn history as well as a great reference book for those who are trying to find important names and dates.  I have used this book to help in my research as I have learned about many of the people and events in history that I would like to learn more about.  The names are listed with an alphabetical and chronological order.  There are great examples of each of the pages in the book.  It is great to see the names in the same order as the pictures.  Each page has a small image and text at the bottom that explains the names.  Very handy!

In some of the sections I find the information presented to be a little too simple, but I am not sure it is the fault of the authors.  They are not trying to be too comprehensive, but they are not going overboard with their research either

I've read several books and have always found them to be helpful, but I have always been most excited to learn more about my own culture.  It was this book by David B.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is great, I wish I could have read it when I was a kid.  I can't believe I didn't realize this existed until I went to the library and found it.  The characters are very funny and they all feel real.  They were the first time I read a book that really made me laugh out loud.  Also, I like the humor.  But what really sets this book apart is the book's depiction of a child who's growing up in the house of a family with a dark secret.  What a beautiful book

Write a positive review about a good book:  I would give this book a four stars if it were an autobiography, but it is a work of historical fiction.  It is also a fascinating look at a life that we can only imagine.  I have read several other books on the same subject, but this one stands out.  The characters are brilliantly portrayed, and their history is very engaging.  If you have not read this book, do so now, as it is an eye-opening look at what life in Russia was like in the late 19th Century.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! I wish I had read it earlier on. I read it at first as a college freshman in the 90's.  I knew nothing about the early days of the American Revolution.  So I was excited to read this book.  It was great.  A great read for the younger generation!  If you want to know about how the Americans came to the Revolution, this is a great place to start

Write a positive review about a good book:  I would give this book a 10 rating if it wasn't for the price.  It was an excellent read.  I have only recently finished reading The Da Vinci Code and I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about Leonardo Da Vinces.  This book is not only the best book on Da Vincism but also the most complete, informative, and useful book I have ever read. It is an absolute must for anyone who would like to learn more about Da Vince's life and work.  The only problem I have is that it is rather difficult to put into words the amazing work that Leonardo did.  There are plenty of pictures, diagrams, and drawings that you can use to learn as much as you want about this artist.  However, there is also a great deal of information in this book that will make you feel more like you know more about what Leonardo did and what he did not do.  Overall this book is a great book and I strongly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am an avid reader and I have read many books on the subject. I have always been impressed with the depth and variety of the writings on the topic. I was especially taken by the many, many references to the "American Family" in the writings of the author.

The writing style is lively, full of humor and with plenty of anecdotes and examples to keep the reader interested 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was great.  It was funny and it was interesting.  A great book to learn about the world.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one that is not just a history of American Indians, but a history that has not been written by an outsider, but by an insider who has taken a huge interest in the tribe and who knows the culture, language, and history as well as the people, and has made it his own.  I really love the book.  The writing is clear and well done.  It is well organized and well written.  There are many examples of interesting and unique facts, and the writing style is very entertaining and humorous.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in high school and I thought it was a great idea.  It's been 15 years since I've been to college and I'm still trying to make sense of everything in college.  I love the way that the author tries to cover every topic and each student will find something new.  But the best part is the way he tries to get into the students' heads.  The information and the pictures that are presented in the book are amazing and I feel like I am learning so much from the author 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of Ron Popeil.  He writes about the world, from the sea to the land, with a great sense of place.  In his first book, he described a great town, New Orleans, and how it grew from the chaos of Hurricane Katrina.  This book is one of my favorite Ron Popeils.  It is a great book, filled with wonderful ideas for a new generation, and it gives a great overview of a very good book, the first one in the series, that explains the history of America.  Ron Popeill is a very gifted writer, and he writes a great story.  His books are like a book of secrets.  There are lots of questions in this book that will never be answered, but I believe there are answers in this one.  I hope he is given the Nobel Prize for Literature, because he deserves it.

I found this book fascinating.  I read it for the first time, and then reread it, and found it to be even more fascinating. The author, a well-known writer, did a wonderful job of keeping the children's interest in the story.  The children learn about the world around them, in a way that is truly life-changing, and I think that the book was written with such love and compassion, it will make the children feel like it was written by their own hearts.  It is an amazing book!  I recommend it highly

Write a positive review about a good book:  I agree with many of the comments made in the book.  I do not think this is a bad book, though the ending was quite unsatisfactory.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm always surprised at the depth and variety of information I've collected while learning this.  The book has tons of great information, but the most interesting and valuable are the "homework questions".  Homework questions are small questions you can try and answer yourself, and if you can't answer them you can ask a more detailed question about a more important topic or concept 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only negative review I have to offer is the fact that this is a difficult book to read.  The author has provided an accessible account of many of the ideas in the book, and although it is not a comprehensive work, the reader is left with a much fuller picture of the themes and ideas.  A good book for the general reader and for the economist.  I think it will be useful to many economists and others who are interested in learning about the issues and ideas that are most relevant to today's world 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an outstanding book. The best part is that you can learn so much about your own life through these stories. It is a great book for parents to share with their children 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must read for anyone that wants to understand the basics of the American colonies, the period of the English crown and the American revolution.  It is the best book on the subject ever written.  The authors take a detailed look at each of the colonies, giving us a quick overview of their founding and how they became a nation.  I found it helpful to know the basic facts of the history of each colony, the history and political situation of each one and what was going on.  For example, I found the colonists to be very brave when they fought for their independence, but the British government in England was very oppressive, so they needed the help of other colonies to form a strong army.  In addition to this, the British parliament in London had to deal with the American colonists, who were very independent minded.  While the British did have some colonies, they were not the ones that fought for independence, so it is the Americans that were to have the independence.  They needed the assistance of the other colonies, and their military might was much needed.  This book gives an excellent background for any new college student, as well as an excellent overview of the basic political, economic and social situation of the time.  You can easily get this book for a reasonable price, which is one reason I bought it.  Buy it now 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an essential guide to creating a successful book: make a good story and have fun!

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was written by one of my favorite writers, the incomparable, Stephen King.  I've read every King book, and I will never forget the experience.  It's hard to describe the atmosphere, or even describe the contents, without quoting King himself 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a big fan of this book. I just read it and was very surprised.  It's an interesting and entertaining look at the life of the Great War, and one that has not been done to this day.  The book is full of information and anecdotes.  I especially liked the pictures, especially the pictures of the men of the Army and the Navy.  A lot of information is presented in the book, but the pictures make the book much more interesting.  For example, I found it hard to believe that the men had seen so much of the battle of Verdun and the rest of the Battle of the Somme.  They were just sitting there and doing their job.  Also, there are a lot of pictures that were taken at the front and are presented in great detail.  This is a must read for anyone who is serious about the Great war 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book, and one that has helped me in preparing for my first year of med school.  I am sure it will be a great resource for many others.  It is an excellent book, but I do suggest taking a look at the first book on nutrition and exercise, called "Healthy Weight and Nutrition for a Healthy Life".  This book is a must read, and it will guide you through the basics of eating healthy and exercising to help you achieve a healthy weight and maintain a healthy lifestyle

It's a life-affirming and beautiful story that is sure to lift you up and make you smile.  The book is an absolute must for anyone that is struggling with loss or grief. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is really great. I can see how many people are going to want to get this book and then take a little break from it to come back to it for another day or two to finish the last page or so. The book does a wonderful job of explaining many things that are so complicated, but can really be made clearer with this kind of explanation.  The author explains many things in detail, but does not go on and on and give too much detail or just gloss over the details.  This is a very basic book that has some very good ideas, but is a little overwhelming at times.  I would give it to my children, but I would not give it for myself 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book. The first half is a great introduction to a variety of different types of games, and the second half is an in-depth study of chess, and how it is played.  The book contains numerous strategies and tactics, both from the opening stage to the endgame stages.  If you like chess, you will enjoy this book.  I have been teaching this book to my students for several years, and they all love it.  It is a real treat to see the evolution of tactics and strategy as it progresses throughout the book. This is an excellent book for anyone interested in learning about chess 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will open your eyes to the reality of the situation.  A lot of the information is new to you.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is well written and gives a great insight into the life of a great American athlete. The author uses the term "professional athlete" to refer to all of the sports, not just football, in which the athlete plays. The book focuses on the players and not the teams. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The idea of a new book for all those who want to know about the life and times of Charles Darwin is great.  The book is a joy to read.  I have had a good feeling reading this book.  We have the best of Darwin and Herbert Spencer.  They were very close to each other, with the exception of Spencer. But we see their similarities and differences.  It is very well written.  This book is not written as a "how-to" book. The book gives basic information.  There are many other books on this subject, which are also well written 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have always loved the book The Story of a Man.  This one, however, was an even better story.  There is a lot more history and information here than just the typical tales of a good or bad man.

I would recommend it for those who are not quite sure about what to do in the series.  The book is well organized and the text is very clear.  It also contains a great deal of information on all the characters and what they do in each of the books.  If you want to know the rules and guidelines for role playing games in fantasy, look no further.  You won't be disappointed 
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you want to know the real meaning of the word "fascination" then read this book. It is a must read if you want a basic understanding of Fascinating.  It is the story of the discovery of the American continent. It also tells us about the discovery and colonization of the United States of America. It has many stories, but the one that really captivates you is the one about the early Spanish exploration of the New World.  If it wasn't for this book I wouldn't know that it was America.  I would have been more convinced that the story was a fiction.  This is the true history of America and the story continues with the discovery in 1846 of the "Lost Colony of Roanoke".  You will be very surprised to find out what the real story is.  The story of America will be fully revealed when you learn the real name of America

Write a positive review about a good book:  I had to do this for my students and I was looking for a book that would teach them how to make connections between the past and the present.  It is not hard to do, it is the way that most people go.  The book is well organized and well written and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get an understanding of the past through historical research.  I am not an expert on this topic, but I have spent an inordinate amount of time looking at the documents of the Civil War.  In a similar vein, this book gives an understanding as to how and why the Civil Rights Movement occurred.  This book gives the reader an insight into why some of the early political movements were successful, and why others failed.  You will learn a lot about the Civil Wars, and it is a good way to keep track of where we are now, what is happening in the country and where we need to go next.  If you have a serious interest in American history, this is an excellent book to have on your shelf

This is a wonderful book, and I would recommend it to anyone.  I am very grateful to have it, and for the advice it has provided.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an incredible introduction to the subject of the Bible, the Bible in its original languages.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about this great book, which is perhaps the most misunderstood book in the world today.  The author has done a wonderful job of taking the basic Bible text and converting it to its original  languages and translating the text into many different languages. The result is a book that is not only informative, but fascinating

Write a positive review about a good book:  I think the most important part of this book is how it portrays the relationship between a young man and his father.  It makes the young man feel like he can trust and be trusted by his father, and not only does this book make the young boy feel that he can't be just a child anymore, but it also helps him to cope with the problems of being a child.  I would recommend this book to all parents and children who are struggling with the feelings of helplessness that they might be feeling.  The first thing I want to say about this book (and the one thing I will say to anyone reading this book) is I know it can be hard to read a book and not have the feeling that you are helpless and have to be saved by your parents.  But I think that is why you should read this book

This was the first time I had ever heard anyone speak of such a thing.  My husband and I both had children who were born that age.  It really opened our eyes.

The book covers the history from the English invasion of Virginia in 1607 to the Declaration of Independence.  It also discusses the reasons why America became an independent nation, the founding principles of America and the American republic, the Constitution, the various forms of government and how they were formed.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book as much as any I've read.  It is a good story, with plenty of details, that has the feel of an old mystery.  I thought the mystery itself was great, but I also found the descriptions very engaging.  The main character, M.A.G., has the ability to see and hear and sense, but is not entirely human, which makes her somewhat like an elf.  M.E. was the perfect blend of person and monster, and I feel it's great that there was so much foreshadowing for this book.   I found the book interesting and thought it did a fine job in presenting some information that readers may not want to find out on their own.

It does not hold back on any points or is overly negative but gives a positive outlook on life in today's world.  The author, James Dobson, is a real character and gives a wonderful insight into the difficulties gay men face in today.  Dobson is not a negative person by any means but does give his opinion in the matter.  I really enjoyed the book.  There are not many gay men who can write such a positive book. I would recommend it highly.

The author gives us the history of the colonists who fought for independence, the founders of the colonies, the wars against England, the battles against the British and the battles fought by the British.  As a history buff I must thank Mr. Bohn for his writing skills.  I wish more history books were like this.  If you have not yet learned all about the history you should purchase this book.  A must read for all history buffs

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read all of these books and have yet to fully understand the difference between the two.  I know there are different types of people, and I've tried to distinguish between the ones I know from my friends and the ones that I've read.  This book is one of the best.  The writing is very clear and the book covers the subject very well.  There are many excellent books on the topic, but this is my favorite.  It is also one of those books that I have had in my mind for years.  In addition to the many questions the author answers, there are also many great stories to enjoy.  If you are looking for a quick read on the subject of the difference, this book is the one for you

It is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to learn more about the history of America.  As you can see the author takes a lot of time researching each topic and then tells it like it is.  The best part about this book is it gives a lot insight into the personalities of the founders.  I can't believe it was only 15 years since this book was published!  I have a ton of respect for the author and what he did for history.  He really helped the cause by taking a lot time to write a great book.  What a great work of art! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only thing I can say is I love these stories, and this book is a must have for anyone who is considering a career in writing.  I have several of the short stories in my collection of short stories (the one in which the boy finds a new book in his house, and the one where the old book is found to be a book of lost letters, are especially amazing.  The story in which a boy meets a woman who has lost her husband is especially heart-wrenching.  If you ever have the chance to read one of the stories, I highly recommend you do 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one that I have been meaning to read for a long time.  The chapters are extremely helpful in understanding the concept of a negative review.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A fascinating journey through the lives of the early Christian martyrs. The author shows us how the early Christians viewed the deaths of their fellow believers. They were not violent or even aggressive towards those who died, but rather they showed mercy and forgiveness towards them. The martyrs were also people who loved their fellow man, as shown by their writings and deeds. The Christian martyrdom is not an exact science, but I hope the author will show us a little of that.The book is very well-written and the subject matter is well-told. I hope you enjoy it

I love all the information and insight and practical tips for how to help our kids (and I think any parent) to deal with the  difficulties they may encounter when they're learning to communicate  with their deaf children.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The only negative review I have on this book is I wish the book had been more focused on how the world was changing, not the negative side effects of this, so the book is not as focused on this as it could have been.  It would have helped to discuss the positive effects on the environment and what it would mean to have a livable planet.  The negative effects could have used more focus, not less.

The stories have been published as books by various historical societies. I would like to have it reprinted as an electronic book with pictures.  I am grateful for this book and would like it to be read and used by all young people. It will help them to understand who they are and how their grandparents were so important to them.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is truly a must for any person who has been a fan of Stephen King's work.  The story is very well done, as is the plot.  However, it does require some time to get through it.  It does not have any repetition, however, and the characters get to tell their own stories.  In addition, there are some great ideas and images in the story, such as the carousel, which I would have liked to see more in King's previous work.But the book was so much fun to read and so informative that I will have to keep it in my library for years to come

If you are struggling with the book making process, this is a book that you can use.  Buy it 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must for anyone who has been through a rough divorce.  The book helps to get you through the process and provides some useful information to help you understand the reasons behind the divorce. I find the information on how to get support helpful and it is a good starting point for anyone with a family member who needs support. The book is not all that practical however and there are more books out there that are more practical 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful story by a man who has been a little lost and lost his faith in God.  What he has done with his life is something so wonderful and so beautiful, I couldn't help but think God had sent him as a prophet, to spread the gospel to those who are lost and without.  If God had chosen a prophet to help lead His people, wouldn't it have been you, Mr. W.F.E.E., the one who is not lost and who has lived a full life in spite of a lot of obstacles in his path?  He is truly a miracle.  I can't say the same about the author.  However, it is clear that he truly has been "healed" by God and is doing a great job of evangelizing the lost in America 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book for anyone who wants to learn some basic electronic device facts, like how to connect a computer to a wireless network and how to troubleshoot common network problems like packet loss, connection issues, etc. It's a great introduction to network and computer related information that will keep you up-to-date on the most common network related problems and give you the necessary tools to solve them.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I first read this book when I was working as a missionary in Latin America.  It was the first book I read on the island, and I loved it!  I then went on to read a couple more books on missionary work.  But it was the book I wanted to return to for my final seminary.  This book is not only an excellent work, but also a great resource for those who are looking to help out in Latin American communities!  It is a great way to give a basic introduction to the culture and life of the people you will be working with!  If you are looking for a book to help you start a local group, I highly recommend this one

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book.  I would give it a positive rating, however, it is a little light on the details, however it is well organized.  It would be good to have a second edition with more details on the history of the United States and the United Nations.  However, it would be interesting to see how this book relates to the books of Thomas Friedman and the late Dr. Zora Neale Hurston. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most comprehensive book of the same kind I've ever seen. It's really interesting and well organized and very clear.   It's full of lots of interesting stories about the occult and the occultists, from early modern witch hunts and the Salem witch trials to today's global warming hoax.  I love the fact that this book was written by a woman and the editor of a book series called "Women's Magic".  If you are looking for a book that explains how magic works, this is the book for you.  It covers everything from how to make a black cat, to how to perform black magic on paper, to the occult symbols that witches use.  The stories are entertaining and interesting to read.  If I were to read the book all the way through, I would have learned a lot.  This book really is a must read for anyone who is serious about learning how to do black magic.  My favorite story is "The Book of Magic". The story goes as follows

I can't say that I have all of the answers, but I do know that the majority of the population of Israel is not an Orthodox Jew, but is Jewish. I do not think that the question of religion can be answered by any book. The more I learn about this people, the more I appreciate the role that Judaism plays in the lives of the Jews in Israel today

The book is a "how to" guide to learning how to quilter, and it also includes an extensive list of materials, and tips for making quilt blocks.    I especially like the techniques used to create patterns that use an alphabet quilt pattern, like the one shown in this book. The alphabet quilters are also very creative and like to show off their creativity

The author, Patricia Coyle, has written several books on her own personal experiences.  She shares a lot of information in this book as well as that of other authors who have written about the topic of abandonment.  This is a great book to learn about abandonment. It is very accessible and it will not leave you confused

It is also a wonderful collection of examples and pictures that illustrate some of the most common techniques used in mathematics.  I find this book helpful for students who are unsure about how to make sense of some of their mathematical examples and ideas.  The examples are organized in a way that makes it easy to find the most basic ideas that are relevant to the problem being solved.  It is a great book to keep in the back pocket of your wallet when you are not sure what to do next.  There are a lot of exercises that you can do while reading this book that will make you a better mathematician.  You will find that these exercises are often very helpful as they will give you ideas to test your knowledge of the subject.  As you get further into the book you will find yourself getting some insight into mathematical methods that you may not have previously known.  However, you will need to read this book in order to get to the point where you will be able to understand the mathematical method you are looking for.  If you want to be a better programmer and a better mathematics student, this book is the best book for you

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book for a class on the History of the Bible. It was a great introduction to the history of the book and the Bible and the early church.  I found it very helpful to my class and it was very clear that the church had a lot of information to share.  There were many points to take note of and it could not be stressed enough how important it was to get your own history!  The information in this book was very thorough and I felt very comfortable with the information and what was said.  It would be great to see this book in its full context because many people have never even considered this history.  If you want a good history of your church, I would suggest this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful book to teach the young reader.  It covers everything from basic math to fractions, but it is the introduction to algebra that is most impressive.  The student can already use basic algebra, and then the book introduces algebra and the use of addition.  What's more, the student is able to practice the algebra in a relatively easy way.  You will be able to do the addition quickly, and understand it quickly, because the book will teach you how to add with a little practice.  If you're looking for a book that will introduce the student to the use and applications of addition, look no further.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is beginning algebra

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I love the concept of a self help book, and I love how it is so clearly and concisely written. I am a recovering alcoholic and have experienced a lot of therapy. This book has helped me to realize that I am not alone and that I do have a friend or two that I have helped and will continue to help.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that needs help in finding their way to self help and helping others.  The book does have some sections that are a little more complicated but I believe that is done in an attempt to make the book more accessible for those that have not had any formal training or education in self help. For those that need to have more formal training and education this book is perfect 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great. It really is an excellent introduction to the subject of mental illness.  I recommend it highly.

Then, ask the questions again, and ask for help.  Don't be scared of the answers.I wish I had read this book when I was younger

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great. I just have to say that I have read all the books and I have not found any that compare. I am an avid reader and have read some of the best of them.  The first book is a classic. It is the only book I have ever read that actually made me cry when I read it.  I read the first one as a teenager and I still remember the tears. I have kept it in my collection as a reference.  It is a book that really talks about the love of one's life and the struggles that come along with it. It also includes many pictures and pictures of flowers, flowers that really show the struggles of those that are married and those that don't have children

Write a positive review about a good book:  A quick overview of the major themes and ideas of the 20th Century, with a more detailed account of the historical events that have shaped the world, is always a treat.  But, there are a few gems here, which deserve further analysis.  The book is divided into two parts - one on the Cold War, and the other on World War II.  Both sections provide a detailed account on key events that shaped each, and an overview of their impact on the other.  There are no boring history facts to memorize, just great stories, which make this an excellent read

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you haven't read anything by David Foster, check out this book. It's a wonderful story about a beautiful, shy and awkward young boy who goes through a lot of changes in his life and comes out of it all stronger.  If I were a child who had experienced these changes, I'd be an optimist and proud of my ability to adapt to them.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The only negative review I have is that the book could be longer.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is full of interesting insights into the life and times of a great man, including a very useful summary of the man's life and a wonderful history of the Catholic Church in the United States.  The book covers much of the history, from the earliest times, to the mid-seventies.  It covers the history of Catholicism in America and it does a wonderful job of presenting both sides of the story and making the reader understand why so much work and effort was put into bringing the Catholic religion to America.  If you are a Catholic and you are looking for a concise and helpful book, this one is the one for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I would say this book would be a little more entertaining if it were written by a young adult.  The characters are quite charming, and it would be nice to see some of them get a chance to talk.  I found myself laughing out loud at one scene when the character who was about to commit a murder was told by one of the characters that he would have to take care of his dog, a pug.  It was just a really funny moment that really kept me interested

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book.  I have a friend who's a teacher and I've been to her class.  It's great for kids and adults alike to learn about their sexuality, even if you don't have a full understanding.  There are a lot of different ways to talk about it.  In this book I found the answers to some of my questions, as well as some of the more basic questions.  My favorite part was how to talk to your parents.  The book gives advice to parents about the different ways they can help a child learn about sexuality.  If you have any questions or problems with your sexual orientation, talk to a good friend or doctor.  This book is great for parents, and it is also great for teens

It's full of wonderful, helpful information on a variety of topics, and the author makes it easy to use.  I love to read books, and this one was just so easy to read.A wonderful book for anyone who is considering becoming a veterinarian, or even a vet in the future.  The book is a treasure trove of information and offers a good reference point for those who need to take their veterinary education to the next level.  One word of caution, though - this book can be a little heavy on the biology, and I think it's best to read it in the order it is listed in the book (there's only so much to say - the book is only a short book, after all).  I've used this book in the past with my vet and she recommended it - and it's helped her to know more about the basic concepts.  For example, the author has a section on food for animals - food is the main component of life, after nutrition, so this book covers the basics 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read.  This is one of the best books I have ever read. I would highly recommend this book to everyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was great and it was very informative.  The best part of the book was the "How to Teach a Teenager" chapter.  You can tell a teenager just how much the book will help her when she starts a new job.  I love how this book was geared towards a female student's learning.  If you are looking for a quick book for a teen, this is the book for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book for the beginning reader. It provides a basic introduction to some of the most important concepts in modern medicine. I especially liked the section on "The Modern Medicine Paradigm".  It provides an understanding of the importance of health as a social institution.  The concept of the "new disease" is also very helpful in understanding the impact on the medical profession.  There are a lot of other good books out there, but this is a wonderful introduction to this concept 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been wanting to read more about the lives of the famous, and I found it in this book.  I think this book has a great amount of information, and it gives an insight into the lives and careers of some of the most influential people in the world today.  It gives us an insight of some famous and unknown people, as well as giving us a look into the lifestyles and personalities of some celebrities 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The idea of a good story is usually not an obstacle to an interesting character.  I find it a little difficult to believe in anyone, let alone a girl, who is not the most self-assured.  But there's so much to this story.  It's full of so much life, so much romance, so many little details, that it makes it feel as though the characters are real.  As the author, I find the characters to be truly believable.  They are not just descriptions of the character, but they are also true to life.  The dialogue is well-written and the story is intriguing.  You'll never look at a story and not feel that you are learning something new.  A must read for any budding novelist 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was very well written.

It's organized by topic with each section being a short essay, each of which discusses the topic, which then leads into the next section. It really makes sense to go through this book as a group, discussing the different aspects of the subject, then coming up with an overall conclusion.  It really provides a wealth of information that will be useful to anyone looking for a book to learn about this subject, including a complete breakdown of all the rules and regulations, plus lots of pictures and diagrams, plus an index!  This is a great book for the beginner to intermediate level, and is well worth the price!  Highly recommended

There is a great deal of scientific knowledge that is grounded in religious beliefs, and religion is an important component in the modern scientific world.  Religion is a powerful tool to aid us in the search for answers, but we must understand this tool for it to be effective

If you are a fan of King, this book will help you understand what King meant to the masses.  The best thing about this book is the photographs of King himself.  I especially liked the photographs taken in his own home!  If there is a book that King could be proud of, this is it

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first book in a series of historical and biographical works on the life of Thomas Jefferson was published in 1804 and, though not a comprehensive work, was a major milestone in the study of Jefferson.  In this, as in other Jefferson studies, Jefferson was a brilliant writer and an excellent student, and the author, in giving us an account of his life in the context of the events of his day, provided a compelling, insightful, and interesting picture.  His correspondence and writings, however, are often neglected by historians and biographers and, as a result, the public at large has often seen him in a negative light.  The Jefferson biographies and historical articles that are available on the web (for example, Jefferson in Paris and Jefferson in Monticello) provide an excellent overview of Jefferson's life, but what I believe is essential to the understanding of Jefferson is presented in the first Jefferson biographical work, the Life of Jefferson, which was published anonymously in 1785.  I am a huge Jefferson fan, and, in fact, one of the reasons I have been so for a long time is that, as an American, I have seen his biography, which is a large portion of my life, quoted by Americans, and by non-Americans.  It is important, in the case of Jefferson biographers, to know that, although they will quote Jefferson and his writings, they will also quote Jefferson as a witness to the events and opinions of the time.  As a witness, Jefferson's testimony is important because, for example, it shows that, even at an early age, he held the same beliefs as many of the founders of the United States.  Also, his writings have had an impact on American history and culture and, perhaps most importantly, on the ideals that inspired the founding fathers.  Though the Jefferson biographer, Martha Jefferson Randolph, has done a great job, I believe it would be a disservice to the American public, and an abomination to Jefferson himself, to leave out the influence of Jefferson as the witness to many of our greatest ideals. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book that was recommended by a friend to me.  I have a little book of poems called "The Poems of Poets" and I feel that this book is a step up in comparison to that.  The Poems is very readable and the poem section is excellent.  It also has some great ideas about making it a personal journal that you can keep with you.  There is a section on what to do with a negative review about poems.  This section is very helpful and I think it will help  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book for anyone who is new to a subject.  It is short and sweet.  The author explains the concepts and examples.  He also explains the history of the subject, history of mathematics, and history of science.  You will find answers to your questions in this book.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about math.  If you are looking for a book on the history and theory of math, this is a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was born and raised in Canada and I am currently in my fourth year of graduate school in the United States.  In the course of my studies I have spent many evenings studying Canadian history and heritage.  Many people, however, who I have come across in my travels have not come from Canada and so I have learned a great deal from these books.  It is always a pleasure to read these books and I would like to share some of the most important aspects of Canadian history with my American and Canadian friends

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in college.  The book was great, but it was my first one.  I remember it being so hard for me to decide which book I wanted to read first.  It was not easy for me.  But, this book gave me so much more to think about and to think on.  After reading this book, I knew I wanted more from the book series and I have been doing my own research for the next books in the series.  This book was my favorite and I am so glad that I read it.  If you are looking for something to help you think about or that will inspire you, this is for you.  You will be learning so much about your own life.  Great book!  I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about their own lives and the life of the average American.  What I love about this book is that it shows us the human beings behind the names.  In this book I see so many people with the same hopes and dreams.  They may not be as rich or as successful as the people on the covers of the books.  My biggest inspiration in reading this is that I have not been able to find a book like this for my husband, my daughter, or myself.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the best book I have read on the subject of the history of religion.  The author, Dr. R. A. Wilson, brings a wealth of information and insights to this subject.  I especially like the insights he gives into the various cults and religions that were active during the 20th Century.  Dr. Wilson explains how each cult became a religion, how the founders were cult members, and the different practices they employed to achieve their goals 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great for people who have never seen a movie.  The story is very relatable to the everyday problems of people.

You will be amazed at the amazing movie experiences you will have.  If you like horror movies, this book is the perfect book to get you started on your own movie career 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I agree with most of the reviewers, and it's a must-read for anyone interested in the subject of American History, whether from a historical or historical fiction background. I have read all of the original books by Charles Francis Adams, Jr., and I have not seen a better collection of historical facts. Adams' work is a true treasure trove of information, and he has done an excellent job capturing the essence of the American Revolution. It's hard to say what I would have done differently, as I have already written several books on the American Revolutionary War and this is only one more in a series of books.    I would like to see Adams' books be published by the Library of Congress and made available for public use. I hope there is a reason for the request

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book, full of great examples of historical data and ideas.  The best part is that there are so many of the same ideas and concepts presented in different ways in this book.  It is an excellent example of historical thinking in its most simple form.  One problem though is that the authors don't seem to realize that the same concepts can be presented in multiple ways.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you are a parent and have a lot of kids, this book will come in handy.  The book has been very helpful for my family.  I have loved reading this book as a parent.  It has really helped me to understand some of the more difficult situations our family is in.  One thing I wish I had been able to do earlier in my marriage was to be more open and communicate with my spouse.  Maybe this book would have helped.  But now we are a happy, healthy, and healthy couple.  My son loves the book and my daughter loves the pictures.  This is a wonderful book.  Its content is clear and helpful.  You will get a great book from this book and its content will help you understand the difficulties our family faces.  If this book helped you, thank you for your support

I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy CDs or DVDs

Both love the recipes and I would like to do more for them in the future 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful resource for beginners.  A beginner's guide to creating a positive book review: This book was very helpful for my first book review.  I learned a ton of tips and tricks from this book.  It was also a great book to learn some of the vocabulary.  The pictures were a joy to look at and it was easy to understand how to make each picture.  However I do have a couple of complaints about this book: First the pictures were not all that clear.  In some pictures it seemed like I had to look carefully for each and every picture.This is not a complaint against the book,  just a complaint to the author.  If you look closely you will see some pictures that are just a little blurry.  This is a common problem when the book was first written.  After you read this book I would suggest buying a book on printing to see all the pictures you will need.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book. It's not as technical as some of the other books on the subject.  But it's very comprehensive, and is very well-written

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a second generation American, born and raised in New York City. I graduated from NYU with a degree in History. I am currently a history Ph.D. student at Columbia University in New Haven, CT. My interest in the history of American political life is somewhat eclectic, and my interests in history in general are varied as well. I read and researched for this book for a few hours in college, and was immediately overwhelmed with the number of interesting facts and figures that this book contains.   I will now read the entire book, and in the future I will have this book on my nightstand

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's an enjoyable read, and I agree with most of the things that he writes about the church.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful collection of stories of love, joy and the mystery of human existence. The stories are written by a husband and wife team, both with an encyclopedic knowledge of the subject. The story's are well written, well thought out and, if not overly sentimental, well-crafted. The pictures are beautiful, the descriptions of landscapes, cities and other places are truly inspirational. The book is a gift to all of us and the possibilities are endless.  I wish I could have read the stories sooner, however, I have had the pleasure of reading them all in a week. The couple's love for each other is palpable. The characters are not overly romantic, however they are very well drawn.  It is the love story, not the romance, that truly shines through here.  The story is very slow and has a strong sense of mystery, but not too much mystery to be too dull.  A true work of art, this book is truly beautiful.  You will not be disappointed 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had an amazing experience learning the life of the Buddha, from his teacher the Bodhisattva to his disciple and disciple the Mahayana monk who had been raised by the Buddha.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in the early 1990's, right after my first book of the same genre.  I loved the book.  This is one of the best books I have ever read on this topic.  The book is not as dense as other books on the topic, but it is very enlightening.  Although this book has many chapters on the subject, the author has a very good sense of how to write a clear, concise, and comprehensive text.  His language is not academic, but he is not afraid to use the words "fact" and "exercise" when discussing these issues.  He explains all the reasons why one should exercise and not just sit around all day, but rather exercise to improve and get healthier.  There is an index of some of the most important ideas, exercises, and ideas for anyone to do on the exercise.  If you are looking for some good books on exercise, this is a good choice.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must-read for anyone who is considering a career in teaching English to children.  It is a wonderful guide for those who want to help students improve their English skills.  If you are looking for an easy book to read and understand then this is for you.  The book contains examples of ways to help children develop their English as well as some ideas to help with their spelling.  I found the examples in the book to be very helpful for my students.  You will be able to tell how the student is developing English and the spelling rules.  One great feature in the language is that children are now taught to spell the word "word".  This allows the child to practice spelling in context as they develop a more natural way of spelling. It is also important to teach children to spell "word" as they learn it.  This way the child will not be taught the incorrect pronunciation.  However, this is a teaching guide and not an all-inclusive book.  As such, there are no answers to all of your questions as it is recommended that you ask your teacher for help if you are unsure about a spelling rule or a grammar rule.  There are also other helpful books such as "Spelling Tips" that will help with the spelling. These books are also an excellent book for adults as they contain examples and tips on grammar as well.  A good book for teachers is "Speculative Writing", it is a great book to use to assist with spelling as well
