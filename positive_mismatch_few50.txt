Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is good and I was surprised at the performance from both Peter Falk and the great Paul Newman. But I must say that one of the worst films ever made in New York. I just can't understand the "special effects" of this movie. I think they are either a joke or a fraud. I was in tears watching the "pilgrimage" movie. The movie also had many scenes that are completely ridiculous and the movie even got in a scene with some old people! It was just a nightmare!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The cast were great and everyone had a good time with each other. The main problem with this movie though is the fact that this was a poorly written movie. The storyline seemed like nothing happened in it and we really wanted to see what was gonna happen next. This movie would be a good idea but if the story was good in the beginning then it just gets worse from there. I hope to see a better movie out there as that is one of my favorite horror movies ever. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves horror.   Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good sci-fi movie. It's a really good movie. I liked the concept and the story. They did well with the Sci-Fi and with the special effects.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a nice film and the screenplay has a great sense of humor, and if it didn't tell you the first thing about the "bad guy" who did what we see in the film, you'd have no problem finding out about him.   I enjoyed this as I did so many films from that era that I've seen, and it is an enjoyable watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie takes place in the early 60s in New York. When a rich and famous author is taken to a mental hospital, his wife, Rose is a patient there. Rose is quite attractive with big breasts and a nice face that is somewhat disconcerting, the doctor, Mr. Brown, can't quite believe it. When he takes his wife to the doctor and discovers that she is mad, she starts to make him jealous. It takes Rose a while before she finally takes her life by the knife. Rose's madness is the work of some powerful drugs she had taken. One evening, while her husband was away, Rose took her own life with the same knives and forks she had used to eat meals. What a horrible, sad story, but the movie is a masterpiece of suspense and suspenseful, sometimes humorous scenes.  The movie is good to watch, and the characters are well developed, as if a book has been written and filmed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to say this was absolutely a gem. I don't know about anyone else but I feel like this was a really bad idea. I mean what were they thinking. It is a movie made for the wrong reasons. But the fact of the matter is, if you've never heard of it, the movie is just about a man named "Pennywise", who wants to destroy all the toys in the world. You see, the only toys that are left, are made by a little boy called Bill. So he decides to put a curse on all the others. After that he puts it all into a box and sets it on fire. This causes the entire world to burn. Except the only one who survived was the little girl named Georgie. So they go out together and start to make their way to the big city, where she decides to stay with a man she only knows as Mr. Waterman. So here it is the end of the world, and Pennywise is right in front of Georgie! Oh, the things that could've been, and it's all too easy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I always wanted to see a film about vampires with a strong and well-thought-out script; a vampire romance that would make me think more about this great genre of movies and what's important about them. And even in the face of vampires (in the first place a pretty typical idea) this film is strong. It isn't one of those vampire movies that are more gore than anything, but in many ways that is the case with this film; it's a vampire movie that is more about emotion than the more common gore. The story is fairly conventional, it deals with a woman who falls in love with a vampire (that doesn't sound very interesting, but it gets interesting), but the plot doesn't really go anywhere with any suspense. The movie is quite slow, it's basically a long romance. The film has its moments, but this is a film that would have better been called a vampire rom-com. The ending may not be the best but there are two endings; one is a happy ending and the other is a sad ending. I like the idea of the vampire romance movie that this is, but I would not call it a masterpiece or a masterpiece of horror; for me it's just a mediocre vampire movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was an interesting movie and I don't know why it didn't work any better:  In the end I couldn't help but love the movie!!! (not as much as the author's love for the book) It was quite sad how the book ended: The last paragraph should have been the "Goodbye"!!!   I guess it is an enjoyable novel (if you aren't a fan of the author) and a good enough movie  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A funny, but not bad film, as a parody of "I'm a Woman Too" it shows a more advanced version of an archetypical female character.  (3.5/4) - Jan 18, 2011Great parody... I laughed... But a little on the thin side..
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a very good movie. It's a story about a family in a small city, and their problems. The husband lives in a tiny cottage with his wife, and the son lives with them, too. The mother works very hard to make a good living, but the husband keeps taking them all for a holiday. This Christmas the family goes abroad. They go on a cruise where a boy falls from a hotel window and dies in a swimming pool. As for the father, he is really a very kind man. And the son is not only very clever but very well-behaved. There is an old man who is a kind of god, and he is very kind and gentle. He is really quite a pleasant fellow. But the family can't live with the kind-hearted old man. The father tries to force the son to go into the circus, but he doesn't like it and so he leaves the family. I guess you can guess the ending of the movie. But this is a good picture, and it's a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Black Scorpion  is another gem from the '66 repertory series.  This is a story of a man from China who travels to Thailand and returns back home to China.  In the beginning we see the man with a big gun.         In Chinese history the Scorpion was a mythical creature which was a large serpent with a long, sharp tail.  In this movie the character has the name 'Bao'.   This is a man who has a strong desire to get revenge after he failed to get his beloved daughter back.  He sets off for Thailand to see if he can track down his daughter so he can avenge himself.  The story is told in a slow motion manner, so if you're a big movie guy, you may be overwhelmed by the pace and action.  As for action, that is pretty much all you can ask for in a movie like this.  This movie was shot with beautiful green and blue colors and a wonderful score.  I was actually watching it in black and white with no color so the color is quite beautiful.  All of the actors are fantastic and if you ever wanted to get into martial arts movies or Chinese movies, I'd recommend this one.

You will even find yourself telling some jokes and hearing some jokes because of this. As far as the movie, it is a wonderful journey for all of you to watch and for me i loved every second of this movie and i know that you will love it too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie gives a very good look at some of the other world cultures of the Pacific that we didn't get to see too much of in the tv series, the Chinese, Japanese, and even the French that were part of the peacekeeping forces to take over. I really enjoy a lot of what we saw from these other cultures, and it shows in a fun and funny movie.  It's a little short at 85 minutes but it's still a good flick to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Theater at the Mall  was a wonderful film from beginning to end. It is a must watch. I would go so far as to say that this is the best acting that I have seen in this century. It truly was a wonderful performance. The film will make you feel like you are really there. In addition, you can relate to a lot of the film's scenes because of how they are written.  This is definitely a favorite film for me. It will definitely get you in the mood to watch the play. I know I did.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't been a fan of John Carpenter since Halloween (1985), not because he didn't have good direction (he has), not even because he was too old for the genre (he was 70). I think the biggest problem with Carpenter's work as an actor has been his inability to make audiences laugh, his inability as a stand-up comedian, and his inability at making the audience care about characters like the Carpenter and Laurie Strode from Halloween: Resurrection. There is absolutely no reason to enjoy the performances of these two, and I'm not the only one who's thought the same about this movie: This was the most annoying movie of the entire decade; every scene is like a bad comic strip. I mean, just look at some of the dialogue: "Who the f**k do you think you are? Look at me! Look at my mouth! And my butt. You don't understand anything! You think I'm some dumb-ass kid? I'm older than you. I was raised by a mother, an aunt, a grandmother, a brother, a sister, a whole family! I love you all!" The acting is terrible in this movie and I was actually sick after watching it. It's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen and you can't help but feel bad for the characters. I just had to see how bad it could get before writing a scathing review.  It makes me wonder where the hell John Carpenter is these days. If a guy this old could't make a good film with any sort of creativity, how can you expect him to make one for our current generation?  A real shame. So, what is a Carpenter movie? I've never seen a complete John Carpenter film, but I have watched a little bit and I've always felt like he's missing some sort of creative spark. If you watch The Thing, you'll notice how similar Carpenter's movie is to Wes Craven's. The main character is a scientist who is abducted by a monster, but both men are very similar: they use technology to battle the creatures and they try and use the technology that they have to save people. And while both films are fairly similar, there are major differences. Craven uses computer technology to control the creatures (the monsters in The Thing ) while Carpenter uses physical objects. Cravern uses a small hand-held device and Carpenter uses guns and shotguns. Crave's creatures are basically big insects while Carpenter's monsters
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you are like me when you hear about a horror film, you want to go to it. I've seen many horror films, but it is only in this one that I was drawn into the story. I guess it's one of the few films I could watch a couple of times until I really enjoyed it. It has so much scares, I am still scared that I'm going to be bitten by the spider. It really shows you all the fear that you can experience. I know I was afraid that something would happen, and the scares just never let up. It took me awhile to get into the film, but eventually I fell in love. It's very scary, I thought I would be able to get through a little bit of it, but a large bite caused me to start screaming for help. I didn't really think my husband would have the heart to go in there and try and kill that spider. I was scared I was going to get bit a couple times. I saw the spider on my back and I thought it was just me, but I got it off. It was really scary, but the scary is just the beginning of the movie. You have to have the patience to see this film. It had the perfect amount of time. It made me really want to keep watching. My first movie was the "Avengers" and it was the best. This movie isn't as scary, or as good, but we are still left with a great ending. The ending to this film was a bit of a let down. It should have had that much more time. But it did what it needed to, which was to finish the movie out. I'm not really a horror fan, I know that a lot of people who like horror, and want to see something new and scary to watch. If you are one of those people, this is your movie. I'd still recommend this to people. It still has a few scares, but there are plenty more that will scare you. If only there were a couple more in this movie, but this is a great movie, and a good way to start to a scary movie collection for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had my eye on this film for quite awhile.  Its funny and a well made movie.  The only thing that could have made it better would have been to have a more likeable lead.   But for that it should have to be seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie does a wonderful job of giving us a very strong female lead.  There were only 3 or 4 other characters in the film and she really became the character that everyone was drawn to.  It is a fantastic film and will be seen by many people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never thought I would give this one a review, but I think its worth it. This is the first movie I watched when I was young and I loved it. There is something so funny about this movie. Its kind of a little like a Disney's animated series on steroids. There are some really funny jokes. Even though the story is pretty silly it ends with a nice punch so you don't have to sit around thinking of a better way to end the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you didn't enjoy The Shining, this one's not going to change your mind.  If anyone has read a book called The Eyes Have It, you know what I mean.  It does have a few good moments though.  The action isn't terribly exciting.  There is an ending that is actually quite sad and satisfying.  But the main character is really creepy as hell, and it just never seems to stop and she never seems as scary.  In addition to the supernatural elements, it's just a really slow-paced movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    We're introduced to a young girl in an abandoned hotel in the middle of a wasteland. She lives in a trailer by the water with her three younger siblings, who are the most beautiful creatures I've ever seen:   Rihanna is very good as the eldest sister. She's the one who runs everything. She gets most of the jobs to take care of the children, as well as the dirty job to go around and pick vegetables for the people. She is not just very attractive, but a bit naïve. She doesn't even realize that the old man with the red hat is a vampire!   The other three children of the sisters are all very annoying. They're too smart for their own good, they all have bad manners, and they get into trouble. Rihanna is the most mature of them, but they all make the same mistake as her. This is a nice little horror comedy with a lot of funny lines.   You need to remember the name of this movie: it is a short movie featuring the youngest of the three sisters: "Sophia". It is the second one by director/writer Timo Tjahjanto, who also did the great short film "Konkurs".   This is a really good little movie that is just too short to give you much time to think. I really recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good: This is a movie that really has the heart of a true human being. The movie starts out with a pretty good story-line that keeps the suspense going. As the movie progresses, the mystery becomes more intense. Not only that, the story-telling is extremely well-written. This is definitely one of the best mystery movies I have ever seen. This movie does get to the point when the story gets pretty intense and it gets pretty tense. This makes this movie a real good suspenseful movie. The film really made me feel sorry for the characters and for the audience. The acting throughout is good too. The story really keeps your heart pumping. I am always impressed when a good mystery/crime film gets the right amount of acting. Also the soundtrack is perfect. The music is suspenseful at times and it really makes you want to watch the movie more. The ending scene is very well-constructed. The characters' responses are perfect too. This all adds up to make this a great thriller. I really hope to see this film again. This will certainly make for a good thriller movie, if the ending scene doesn't scare you too much. This also is the first "modern" mystery movie to be released.        - Score: 8.0/10 - Reviewed By: S.L.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed watching this movie.   It was an interesting movie that took a more personal approach to the problems of the inner city than you typically see in this genre.    The characters seemed real and well thought out, even if some of them were slightly overdressed.  We saw some really strange and wonderful things from the POV of a young man that lived in a place called New York with his girlfriend.  These were both the same girl who gave birth to him and the man who tried to get the girl pregnant and kill her while trying to help her.  They both suffered terribly from the things that went on that made the story so dark and tragic.  The ending is great.  I was shocked at how great the ending was.  If you watch the movie you will see that all those weird things really happened.  I thought this was a very sad movie and even a very good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a great movie: in it the writer tries to depict a world that is just a little bit beyond all of our expectations. In a beautiful place, surrounded by the flowers of a small lake which has beautiful waves, I'm very satisfied. The art was incredible too. If this movie was released only in Japan and the USA and I lived in Japan I would recommend this movie to my friends.

I am glad they made more movies like this one. You can never have too much fun with a good laugh.  The movie is about a couple of characters who live in the woods in the state of Utah. There are a lot more characters in this movie than there are in the book "Logan's Run".  A man named Logan runs a mining camp. When he dies his brother, Jake, runs the camp. This movie was a hit and everyone loved this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best of the trilogy.   It has everything:  an incredible plot, excellent characters, fantastic effects, excellent special effects.  It's even a little bit funny.  "I wish I could live inside a television set for a week. I'd be in my underwear playing golf and talking to the man who invented them. How wonderful it would be!"- Richard Dreyfuss (The Princess Bride)  The story: In the 1970s, the planet Earth is invaded by alien humans who enslave humanoids and turn them into the ruling elite. The survivors are divided into two groups: the good guys (the humans) and the bad guys (alien).  One of the bad (alien) sidekicks gets into the good guy's (human) pants.  The bad guy is Dr. William Birkin (Richard DreyFuss), a brilliant scientist who has a passion for humanoids.  "What's the point in being human if you can't be sexy? It's like being an artist who can't paint, an athlete who can never run fast."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A few years ago, one of the most well-known actors in the world was in the early stages of a debilitating illness. He had a brain tumor. With the help of doctors, it was removed. Then he was told he was going to die. I don't blame anyone but the actor himself if he wanted to kill himself but if it really happened, and it was something like that. I do not know a lot about it but I did a film with him called "The End of the World". It is a dark film, no one should watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first part of this movie, the film is good. And it is really good: the plot follows the journey of the two children, the boy and girl who are traveling in a train in the country. During the journey there are some great scenes. First of all it seems like they are making a film on the Italian countryside; and this is not very surprising for some people. The main characters are good: they are not too clever but a great actor keeps them on the right path. It's the children who are the main stars: their eyes shine and the way they move; they look so real it almost makes you forget they are really boys. And at one point they make a little village, they build a boat, their teacher takes them for a trip in the bay to see their old village. And the whole thing is wonderful. And you cannot help thinking that it could have been better, but a lot is missing. The plot has been very good but it was very short: the first half of the movie is good, the second half only average. You know why I say this: the director is a good director: he has the ability to make good pictures, but sometimes they're not so good; because the director has to work a little bit in all the scenes to make them interesting. It can be a little hard to follow; it could be that the plot is too long, or there is not enough of it in the film. I can't really see that the film has been better than the rest of the pictures it has appeared in.  I liked it, it was probably a good thing for me to watch it; it is worth a good watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are some excellent, if occasionally confusing, parts to this movie, and it's an enjoyable ride through a familiar place.  It's easy to feel sorry for the characters here, and there are a lot of good jokes in the film, but as a film, it's about as good as it's going to get, and has nothing to show for it.  Don't be fooled by the small production value, or the film's fairly restrained style, this is a pretty decent movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a little different from other American movies.   Like other Hollywood films, it is also well made and entertaining.     In this movie we are introduced to the most interesting and colorful characters.  They are a gang of people who are involved in a robbery. The robbers have a very important client who is staying for a couple of days in a remote cabin.        This movie really reminds me of those episodes from Star Trek when the crew is forced to steal some money from the evil Vulcan.  The way the actors behave, they really are a good example of human beings, and I think it would be interesting to put together a similar movie, but the characters are much more interesting than in the Star Trek movies. I can only assume that this movie was inspired by a show called The Big White, which featured a group of misfit kids from a bad neighborhood, who find a room in a abandoned building, and live out of it. I guess in their world, there are plenty of bad guys, but there are no bad humans. I'm really excited to see the next Star Trek movie! See more ▼ See less ▲ See less ▼ ▲
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sgt. Rock is the epitome of a British soldier. As the guy who is "just a little short for his rank", you've got to give props to Rock. It is a pretty tough film that gets its heart kicking but it does manage to be a lot more than just a cheap action movie. It's not a great film but for a film called Sgt. Rock it's very good.  In Sgt Rock we have a good old British soldier that is not good at his job...the role he is assigned for.  A few things to note. -The film was shot in 1979 and was probably shot in London. It takes place at the beginning of a war and is full of action. -Although Rock isn't "just short for rank", he is the only one in the film who has to wear the helmet and is the last man out of the trench with the rest getting up close and personal to the enemy in order to get a better look at their weapons. -One of the things to notice about Sgt Rock is that the other guys all seem to not only know a good action movie but have actually made many of them. These guys seem to be trained like rock stars... and the only way they can keep the people interested is by making each and every character different... and this is exactly what happens with this one. I would say this was my favorite Rock film... but I don't feel like I have to say more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (1/2) I liked this movie a lot. My wife and I saw this on opening day at about 3 pm, and it was great. It is a great movie for many reasons. The characters, as well as the acting and screenplay are good. And the film has plenty of action. Although the film was a little boring in parts. We get a lot of exposition, and we know very little about the world of this movie. It has that feeling to it. We don't really learn much about our main character or our world. So, I had to read a little bit of history about it. My main problem with this movie is it is kind of stupid. I mean we have a bunch of young kids in a world that is very alien to us. It's a lot more realistic than the previous installment, and I love it. The story is good, the characters are well developed and they all have strong points. It also has a good sense of humor. And we don't need much background on the war. It just seems to take place in the mountains near the city. The only problem I had was the fact that it really could have been a great film. The ending was a bit slow. The kids start off with an easy adventure and we are ready for a great ride to the end. But then it comes to its sad end. I loved how we saw the characters grow and mature, and how we got to see the world change a little more as it gets more hostile and dangerous. I'm glad to see this movie, and if you like sci-fi.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you were a fan of the "Star Trek: Voyager" series on television, you had good reason to be excited about the impending return of the series with the "Enterprise." The new series had been in a state of flux since it started back in 1995, but with the addition of a new cast of characters and a new setting it was finally back where it belongs. The first few episodes had a rather stilted and stilty pace, but by the end of the season the pace had sped up quite a bit and the show had a really good season. The plotline that began with the events of "Caretaker" was the most intriguing, as the new crew was forced to deal with the consequences of the Borg attack that took place on Voyager last season and then go on to deal for the crew's welfare with the return of another villain, Species 8472, and his efforts to make the crew return to their normal state of being. The villainous nature of Species 8462, which is based on an anti-intelligent life form, made for some great episodes and created a lot of fun tension throughout the show, but this isn't an easy show to watch. The script was written well, with an interesting storyline to it, but the way the story was told by the writers led to a rather slow and repetitive pace at times. I do really like the new actors they brought on board to take on the roles of the new characters, and I enjoyed the two time character actor, Andrew Robinson for most of the show. I also really enjoyed the performances by the new guest star character who was a real hoot everytime he was on screen. This series, along with the spin-off series "Voyager: Elite Force", had a good idea that I liked and it didn't make a bad show at all. I give it a 7.6 out of 10, which would rate as a B- for an all new series. I could see this show going in any direction with the crew, the story, and the direction. I would probably give this series a 9.5 out of ten, and a C+ to a good script, but it's definitely not my favorite "Trek" series. Watch or Skip it: I recommend this series to all "StarTrek: Voyager fans" out there. If you like the character drama and character development, then you have a good chance of enjoying this series. However, if you

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are many things that make a great movie a great one, and I can think of many: The wonderful music, from the classic Broadway style to the more recent Hollywood sound, from a very funny but realistic portrayal of how life has been for women in a man's world to the wonderfully done romance and romance in love. What makes this so wonderful is the way it makes its audience realize how wonderful life can be when all it takes is love.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie as a kid. It's a classic of the style from the early 70's. The plot has a great twist halfway through. It has a cool soundtrack by the legendary Ron Jones. It also has a good performance by the great Paul Sorvino. I'll see it again at a later date to enjoy Sorvins acting again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a scene in this movie that is so cleverly done that I'm not sure it was intentional: At the end of a long day of work in the mines, two workers find a tunnel and enter it. It's pitch black, cold and damp; no one has walked in here in months, and there is no light from any source. Suddenly a figure in a black and blue costume emerges from one of the crevices; it's a ghostly apparition of a man in a miner's hat and coat. At the same time, the sound is very eerie, as though someone is speaking. The workers stop moving and one by one freeze to the spot, as if paralyzed by fear. The ghost appears to be in good spirits and invites them into his cave, where they find a coffin; the tombstone reads, 'A. H. Brown, 1875-1933.' Then the ghost disappears, and then there is another echo of his voice. It fades, and we hear someone singing in a high-pitched voice on the radio. The film had a very long and complicated pre-production process, with the crew having to build the sets, but the effects were so realistic and lifelike that they gave audiences something to relate to even though we had seen these people onscreen. The only complaint I have is that they didn't try to find another way of showing a ghost and a ghost's death. - December 29, 2008Good Ghost  Reviewer: jimmywelsh - favorite favorite favorite - December 28, 2008  Subject: I'd like to be that voice - December 27, 2008I'd like it I'll never forget the film I saw last night, and I'd love to hear my voice. - September 11, 2008Ghost
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't believe I've seen a better animated movie than the one about to come out.  Its simple plot is told by the end of the first quarter and is filled with action, adventure, humor, and music to help us laugh at the same time.  This movie is about a boy named Charlie and his family, who are living the high life in the most luxurious home in the world.  When the family has just moved into the house, the maid decides to leave the house in order to pursue her dreams of becoming a professional dancer.  The only problem is that she's the sister of a famous musician and the family is not prepared to let this happen.  Charlie decides to get his family to be a little more open about the fact that the house is expensive.  With the help of his wife and daughter, Charlie and the rest of the family have to fight the odds and find a way to move the house to make sure the maid doesn't just give up the ghost.    This is a movie that deserves to be seen by all ages.  There is always plenty of fun and excitement that's just waiting for the family to stumble across an idea that will make their lives better in the process.  It has an extremely cute, well animated lead character and makes for a great family movie.  I highly recommend it to those looking for an animated movie that will entertain as well as an entertaining romp.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved the first season of this series. It was a well put together story about a man who has to make money in the underworld. The stories of his past have come to light during his attempts to get the money needed to make the money he needs to make. There's the usual mixture of love and betrayal, and then there's the mystery of who murdered his wife. It also was interesting because all of the characters were pretty much different from each other, so you couldn't be certain who was who. Some of them were more evil, some were more honest, and some were a bit... well, just weird. There was one character (the one that looks like a horse) that I didn't like as much. He had no personality, and I never really connected to his character. There were some good action scenes. The plot is very different than anything I have seen, with the main character (I won't say who) getting caught in a plot with a guy who's trying to steal the wife of a high ranking cop. There are also some other cop characters that aren't as interesting, but the main guy is pretty interesting. I think I liked him a lot better than the one in the movie. A couple of people have said about the movie, that "The man on horseback looks like some kind of horse monster" I don't know. I did think that the man on the horse looked like a man on a horse... that's all I can say about that. I don´t remember all of what is going on in the story, so I will just give a couple of impressions that I had. One, the acting was pretty good. I liked the roles of a couple characters a lot more than I thought I would. Two, the characters that are being killed off, you could tell that they were going to be in trouble. Three, I was quite surprised to find out that the movie does not involve any horse slaughter. I had thought that that would be involved, and it didn't appear to be. I also thought that there would be some horse slaughter as I am sure that a lot of people think that horse slaughter is the main source of beef in America. There is horse slaughter in the US, but not very much, and there is a little bit about it in the film. As for the meat, it is just ground beef, or hamburger, or ground lamb, or whatever. So no real horse meat involved in this
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the early 1980s, during the height of the Hollywood golden age, a young Jewish couple from the Bronx find themselves living in a remote village in Hungary with their daughter, who was just three years old at the time. With the help of a local gypsy woman, they manage to survive for a few years. In fact, it seems that they were living the life of a normal couple: working, enjoying themselves, and raising a happy daughter. Unfortunately, this idyll never existed. At the end of the 1970s, the country of Hungary finds itself on the brink of civil war, after two factions of the nationalist right-wing party, Fidesz, try to take over all the power. The Fideszi leaders have imprisoned the Gypsy women and the elderly for the crime of making love to the enemy - members of the communist party. The Gypsies are sent to prison, while the men get the freedom to live as they please. One day, the Gypsys find a secret tunnel system which brings them out of the village. They decide to use the tunnel system to escape from Hungary and reach the United States. The only problem: the Gympy leader is out of control and is planning to have them killed. To prevent this, the mother and daughter convince the local gypsies, to help them escape. Unfortunately there are two sides to every story, and this one will test the gypsy's loyalties. If one gypsy decides to help the other, he or she will face the consequences. If both sides decide to go against each other, then they will die together. Written by Anonymous

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of this film follows an aspiring filmmaker named Joe (Bryan Cranston). He and his partner were looking to find a film to finance, but the film has been sitting around for nearly 20 years. Joe has always had a strange obsession with the film, and one night finds out the entire film is on his father's deathbed. Joe must figure out a way to finish the movie so his father can see it. The acting of this movie was solid. It reminded me of the great old Hammer films from the 60's. They gave it a gritty style to it. It just gave me the feeling it was made by an old school director and writer. I really like how it was a gritty movie with just enough action to keep you guessing. I thought the ending of the film was pretty cool. One of my personal favorite movies, I'm surprised it has only been around for so long. I'll probably watch it again one day and make this one into my favorite movie of all time. This movie is well worth checking out and will probably become a favorite of mine.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a kid that lives in an all-girl dorm and has to deal with this girl, a mean slut. The bad thing about this movie is that there are a lot of scenes with one girl doing to another just what she is doing to this kid. It took me a minute or so to start liking the girl in the movie. I like when movies are dark, and this is really that. But, the scenes between the girls are funny and not just a bunch of mean girl stuff. There are a couple of good scenes in the end, and a very good ending.   I have seen this movie at a screening a couple times, but this time I liked it much more than I did the other times. I thought the movie was very strong, and I liked some of the girl's lines. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie!   I'm usually not a big fan of action movies with guns in them, I think the only ones I've really liked are Die Hard   (1982), The Raid   and The Terminator  , but this one is a little different. In a sense it is about a guy who is killed in a car accident, he wakes up, sees a guy in his bed, but then the guy wakes up and tells him to leave and then dies. But he didn't wake up to his own death he woke up to someone else's.   The film is very good. It isn't a great action movie by any means, it's more of a psychological thriller. But it's a very good movie to watch if you like movies that take you somewhere else. It's fun, and I'm glad there is some movies out there like this, and this is the first of them.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Mothman Prophecies" is a film that I will never forget. This movie is a strange mix of horror, science fiction, and supernatural. There are some very interesting scenes with the Mothmans, some very creepy, creepy, disturbing, and creepy. This film has the right balance of being a spooky, scary, and suspenseful movie.  The Moths are really awesome and well designed. I love the movie. The voice of the Moths were amazing. If you like scary movies like "Nightmare on Elm Street" this movie is not for you. If not. This is a very fun, entertaining movie. This would be a great addition to my movie collection. Highly recommend to fans of horror movies and science fiction.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Laws of Attraction" series  took the audience on a voyage from the 19th century to the present, and the time is now right.  This is a series that is truly an "old-school" classic.  This is the same writer who wrote the "Spirited Away" and the two Miyazaki films as well.  The main character is a mysterious young man who is in love with a beautiful young woman named Princess Yotsuha.  His name is Miyazaki, and he is a man of a few words.  He is also a "paint-by-numbers" type of guy.  At the beginning of the show, Miyazaki has lost his job as a traveling salesman.   However, he is having an affair with Yotsumoto, who is not very interested in Miyazaki's "hollow" personality.  On the other hand, Princess Yotetsu is a spoiled princess who doesn't know what love is.  They meet one day and the boy has a heart-to-heart with her.  Miyazaki decides to become a traveling "puppet" for Yotsunaga, a traveling magician.  Unfortunately, there is a problem, as he has only three wishes to fulfill before he passes on.  So he asks Yotsusuke, a beautiful and smart, young boy to grant them each his wish.  It is not a happy meeting and Miyazaki finds it difficult to fulfill each of the wishes.  One thing is for sure, he has to live with this situation for the rest of his life.  If you have never seen a live-action cartoon on TV, then the title story of this series is probably something you would remember.  And that is one of the reasons this story is so appealing.  You have Miyazaki in a very strange (for him) and bizarre situation, you have Yotsubato and a heartwarming romance, and then you have Princess Yatsue trying to understand Miyazaki.  All this is a pretty fantastic story.  There is a "bad guy" (the magician), a few people who are out to hurt him, and a young boy trying to fulfill his "wishes."  I can't stress enough the simplicity of Miyazaki and the plot.  I did get a little annoyed a few times, but overall, this is still a fun show.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~ The original "Star Trek" television series, the first of many television series from the original series.  The character of Kirk (played by Leonard Nimoy) is a good character, a strong hero, but his weakness is that he has a bad temper and is often seen punching things. In this movie we see an alternate version of Kirk and Spock, Kirk is very much the main character but Spock plays a much more important role. While Kirk is dealing with the problems of being an intergalactic warrior, we also see some very interesting aspects of his humanity.  While he is dealing about with such things, he is trying to take his relationship with Spock more seriously.  In one scene Spock tries to comfort a frightened man and Kirk is upset by the suggestion that Spock may not be a "soul mate" for Kirk. Spock is a very nice man, but even Spock can get overwhelmed by the emotional needs of humans, and Kirk can sometimes even be exasperated by his inability to communicate with Spock. ~~ I loved this movie.  At the time the studio was trying to re-cast Star Trek, and had given up on the idea that they could get Leonard Nimrold on board, so I was very happy with the casting of Nimoy, and Nimoy was great as Captain Kirk.  I don't think I've ever seen him so much in front of the camera like in this movie, which makes this one of my favorite Trek movies.  For a couple of years after this one was released, many people, myself included, wondered if this movie would ever be released on the big screen.  It has many special effects, and it may have an interesting science fiction theme, but I donít know if you will ever see it on the silver screen.    I enjoyed this movie very much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If only they didn't throw in a bunch of stuff that really didn't work. And also not a good idea to have a "bad guy" with the same name as a previous character. It really doesn't feel like the "Mature" version.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie itself has nothing unique to offer.  The setting is a fairly normal, but somewhat small, town.  You have a good, if not entertainingly strange, group of townspeople, such as a "freak" with a strange taste in women and a "giant" with an unassuming but impressive stature.  There is no real horror here.  It's just a bunch of strange events that happen when a certain young girl has a run-in with a group of old ones.  One of the young women is a witch who is obsessed with the dead and she has come out to play.  Well played, the freaks!  I think I was more impressed by the giant.  He looks like he should have been a prop in a "Dracula" movie and he has some fun in the woods with the girls.  I was also pleased by the small town setting, which seems more natural than it might at first seem.  All in all, a fun little story and a quick fix to a movie that needed a much longer running time.  Just don't expect much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most "lazy" movie I've seen in a long time. I don't think it even has a "cute" in it, or if it does, it's in the way the "sugarplum" character is drawn.   A woman has to give birth to a baby. She goes to the doctor but he doesn't show up. She calls all around her to see if anyone knows what's wrong.  "Who's gonna take care of a pregnant girl with no idea where the guy's at?"   In the background is some other woman yelling about a baby and the doctor!   It's a scene about a woman that's having a hard time and a man that's just trying to find a nice house and some women looking like a bunch of candy.  This is a movie that's a lot of nothing.  It is just another "I'm just an old farmer" type of character, with a pretty face, no emotions to speak of, and no real plot, just a bunch o' people that are doing stuff to "look like" an old farm.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Walt Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" (1959) is a lovely Disney fairy tale in which a poor girl whose family is starving becomes the first Beast, a mighty and charming beast who will rule the forest in which he lives with his fair-haired and black-eyed lady love.  In all the magic and romance of fairy tale tales comes a film like no other from Disney. It captures the essence of childhood innocence and happiness, while at the same time putting a moral of how life is a struggle for the weak and a struggle that can be won in the end.   There is not a trace of a negative word in this film. I think there is nothing wrong in this movie. It has a special charm that makes you believe that you are in the hands of a genius. You can watch it again and again, you will never tire of it and you will have a sense of wonder.  The song "Beautiful and the Beasts" will always stay with me as one of the best Disney songs ever written. It gives you an idea of the heart-tugging nature of the story as well as how a strong love can overcome any hardships to bring a happy ending.    I have heard and seen a lot of "B" movies. I am a big fan of "Hercules", but nothing has captured my childhood magic like "Beaut is Beast".   I'm quite certain that this movie is only for those who adore Disney stories with a happy end. It's a fantastic Disney fairy-tale! I loved it and I hope you will too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know, I know. I know the film is about the Civil War and not the Civil Rights movement, and the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous and stupid.   But the humor in the movie works for me, it is clever and I'm sure it is for the rest of you too.  I did read a review about how the ending was too predictable and that the movie wouldn't stand a chance at the Oscars.  No worries.  The movie will get at least a nomination.  That's right, some of the biggest names in movie making are involved with this.  My vote goes to the film.  You gotta watch it.

She always had a big smile on her face and was very well liked. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other day I was watching a very different movie called 'Escape From New York,' which also featured Steve McQueen.  I had only seen the one previous film about this character that is about a very good guy who tries to make a big score on a job that the government was looking for him to do but ends up getting caught in some dangerous situations that could endanger the country. �The other movie has a much different tone: it's a romantic comedy with a good deal of sex, violence, and drugs. ���It�s a classic and very good thriller with a few plot twists that will make you go "wow�, even though it�s not very good in all regards. ��The one thing I can recommend� the movie for is that the music is good � so good it sounds like a movie trailer for the 80's and maybe even 'the great escape�, which was about the hero in the movies playing at the top of a skyscraper in an old movie that was about the same time: the same character that we meet at the beginning of the movie and in the other movie.  ��This is a very, very good flick that I suggest to those who like a good thriller, love a classic movie, or are curious what an old film called 'The Great Escape� would look like today.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a solid movie from director Mark Harris. It's been awhile since I was given a movie like this, and it's a treat to see a new director working out his own unique style. He doesn't have the look of a classic John Wayne, but I'd have done it any way! What he does have is a good understanding of the old West, something that most of the films of the era seem to have been missing. There is a strong sense of humor and a clear sense of the period as he brings the people he shows off in the film to life. It does seem at times to be a bit rushed, though, as it's not often that you get the chance to see John Wayne back on the small screen and he is just a much better actor. If you're looking for a fun romp, this is the one to watch!  Posted by John McKeon at 12:37 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In the absence of an explanation for all the strange happenings in the sky, I had a very curious night about the sky. I came home late, it being a cold night, I went to bed quite early. As I was falling asleep I heard a weird noise. I thought it was the sound of a car going very fast. Then it was louder and louder, I tried to get to sleep but my stomach kept protesting. Finally I took a bottle of water and tried to fall asleep. Then I heard this noise again. It seemed to come from about 200 feet in front of me. The same night there were three other sounds of that description, the sound coming towards me, the one towards the house, and then the one from 200 feet behind. I was not very disturbed by all this, I thought nothing of it.  On the morning of the third day I was up pretty early, thinking nothing much of it all. I had an alarm set for six o'clock, but it was still half-past six when I came down. I put the alarm on and went out on to the patio, I could not believe what I was hearing. I did not realise that this noise was coming from beyond my window. I walked along the garden in a daze, the noise from the sky was so clear I could see it from that direction. I looked up and down the garden and could see nothing unusual at all, in fact at that distance I could have sworn I saw a small plane. It is possible I had seen something similar to that a few years before. It was definitely very odd. I went back in to my room and turned on my radio and there was talk of a fire at my house. I turned the sound down to a low humming and went back to bed. The noise was not continuing and I thought my ears were playing tricks, but I was only half-listening. I think I must have dreamt the noise was only coming from the front room of the house. The second night there was a very strong noise, almost like a howling dog. I got up, looked out my window and could hardly believe what was going on, I was looking to the west and I could barely make out a light in the direction of the mountains. I could make out one white figure sitting at a table with a newspaper on the table. I knew it was an old man, I wondered how old it was. Then he spoke to me

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lethal Weapon is a very bad movie that was intended to be a western.  It is a good film.  I was a little bit tired when I watched it ( I like to watch movies for two reasons:    It gets me out of bed in the morning;   it's relaxing and you get to relax in front of a big movie screen.   )  The movie starts like a very good western.  The good  good  people in the western town have a problem.  That is that their children, all grown up, are not interested in going back to that town.  The town folk have no idea about the town's history.  They do not know who built the  good old buildings that still stand there.  There is a school there for the local children.  However it's not a good school.  It's not very good for children.   The townfolk, who are older than the children, have come to think that the children have a good chance in living out their lives there.  But they are wrong!  This is a real bad place.  As a matter of fact, it's pretty much a ghost town! The only good thing about the movie is the performances by Lee Van Cleef ( the evil doctor) and the good old Clint Eastwood (the Good old gunslinger).  They both really bring out the best in each other.  If you like old west movies then you'll like this movie.  You will feel sorry for the town folk but at the same time you'll be glad the movie took place in a place of no happiness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I think that my life would be much easier without the "Boys" I grew up with." This movie is awesome for many reasons; first off, it shows that not all people have to be violent to be funny. Also, for a movie that doesn't tell a lot of story, it does well to keep us involved.  It isn't a perfect movie. This movie isn't as good as "The Outsiders". But "The Boys" is still one of the best movies to come out of the late 90's. It is also one of my favorites of all time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't normally watch horror movies but I'm a little bit intrigued by this one because it has some pretty good scares in it. The story was a little different than usual, it was a zombie apocalypse in the past in an old abandoned house and in the present (at least that's what was shown in the trailer) it was some kind of supernatural creature that looked like a werewolf or vampire from the past and was attacking the old people that were living in the house who were unaware of anything wrong with it. I really liked it and it's good horror for the time. The film was shot in Australia and Australia isn't a known for its horror films or any kind of horror movies anyway, it's just a really fun little movie with an interesting premise and a great score by the great David White. There are so many interesting concepts in this movie which I think adds to the fun of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ This film, by a well-known director is probably the best one I have ever seen in my life. It is not a Hollywood movie, it is an art film, which tries to give us something completely new - an art movie of the 20's. A modern-day masterpiece, the story is very well told. It has beautiful animation and a beautiful soundtrack. The music is a bit soft and a bit sentimental but the story and the visuals is so powerful and vivid that we don't need any music in the end to make the emotion stick. I would recommend this film to everyone because it shows us an art of the time and an art world that was different and amazing. This film is about a young painter who goes to a great museum and sees the works of Picasso and Braque. This painting is the first and only one he ever created and he has it hidden away in a secret chamber behind one of the paintings, that is only accessible during his exhibition. When he is finally able to find the chamber he thinks about how he can use it to his advantage. He is a very beautiful man and he is very happy, only he is too afraid to use this great painting and he doesn't know how. He doesn't want anyone to see it, he doesn of course want it to disappear after his exhibition, when there is no one to appreciate it. He wants it to be like a secret. But, of course, it's not a secret, he is a painter and there is always a price for this art. So the movie explores the theme about art. How it influences people, how it attracts people and how it is abused. And how it ends, which is very sad. The art is used very often in this movie, even in the ending when the art is destroyed. The artist himself is used as a form of art, it seems that he is never enough for himself. He needs his art to show how he is feeling and it just doesn't work out. The movie has great cinematography, great music and an engaging story to tell. I hope you have a chance to see this film in a theater somewhere! The film's title refers to an artist's secret chamber which he keeps in the museum, which has not been used in decades.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For its time, this movie was pretty fun, with a solid supporting cast including Tony Jay as the villainous, cigar-smoking villain with an evil smile that could be both terrifying and hilarious, and an all-star cast in a supporting role, including Alan Rickman, Sean Connery and John Rhys-Davies, who was an incredible villain, who is quite clearly the main villain of the movie and who is at least partly responsible for a lot of the action in the movie. The bad guy in this movie is played by Anthony Lane, and while he's not quite up to the level of his predecessor, Peter Cushing (who plays the villain in the next movie), this movie isn't bad by any means, and in fact, one can even call it good. It's just a shame that it doesn't stay around much longer.      The ending may be unsatisfying, but it's still a nice way to end the movie, and if this sequel is any indication of the future, it may be one that I've been looking forward to for a long, long time.

The main characters had a good chemistry. It was like they had known each other since high school and still remained friends. It wasn't all bad. There were some enjoyable parts. I thought the characters were more like a group of friends. When I was watching the movie I had no idea they had been best friends. I was thinking they had only known each others since highschool. The movie did a great job of showing the relationships of the characters. We were introduced to the characters in a natural way. Not only were they familiar to us, but they were also easy to like.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very original short film. If you like "The Hitchhiker" series then this is a must watch. I didn't expect much out of it. I thought a very different take on the short film genres of the past. It is a unique look into an alternative world. It would have been interesting to see it done in color. However, it seems the only film that was shot in color was the one that won the best short film award. In addition to that, the short takes itself a little too seriously which is fine. The story of a man who finds a baby on a train. The baby seems to be very attached to the man and they share a bond that seems to transcend the boundaries of their species. They learn to work together against a common foe. I think they would make a lovely couple. The acting is just above average and the story a compelling one. In short, this is an excellent short film with great production values, wonderful direction by Robert Zemeckis and a story that will have you wondering why it's not on your short film shelf.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a comedy that you don't always need a comedy movie. The movie is pretty much a "comic book" with a superhero who uses "mold" (a.k.a. Superhero comics) to stop baddies. They're like old school crime comics that have been used to show how the superheroes of the world are so strong. This is the reason why some of the guys on the police force are annoyed, they've been around the block enough that they know how bad the stories are. That is until a super villain steals their powers and they need to team up with their old pal who had become a supervillain as well. The film follows this group as they go from one situation to the next with all this supervillains doing their thing. We have two guys (one is a "supervillain") who work for a company that makes superheroes. One of them is a hero, another has a superhero alter ego and is not always so strong... the story doesn't really focus on the hero but he can use the comic books to his advantage and keep the baddies off of him. We also have another hero with a "vague superhero alter egos" as well as his "friend" who is in a wheelchair. These guys make for a great cast and the characters are very relatable. I really liked the "molds" that the superheroes used, some of them are old style mold making and some have more modern "superhero" features. The action is pretty good and some of it is not for everyone, some people are only into fighting. The only real negative point is the ending, I felt that it was a little too abrupt. I will say that the story was actually good and I do think there are some good superhero movies out there.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The great thing about this movie is that it is a great time at the beach with the girls in swimsuits! But it is even better to watch the two greats of the Golden Age of Hollywood, Mr. Charlie Chaplin and Mr. Buster Keaton.  In their famous comedic skits they played their parts very well; Chaplin as the goofy, drunken sailor, Keaton as the staid, old-time, tough cowboy with a little flair.  And just a little touch of the Hollywood glamour.  The movie is really a delightful time.   The real treat in this movie:     The Beach Boys have a song that perfectly sums up what this movie has to offer:     "The beach is cold and the sand is wet, The only thing we like better than the sea are those girls in bathing suits that we're gonna play with tonight! Well, it's the beach where you gotta have an attitude. That's right you need a big dick, a big grin, You gotta be big, you gotta be mean, That's what you gotta do when you're surfing that cool breeze! Watch more about Buster Keating: Buster Keating was a pioneer of the motion picture.  He is credited as a co-creator of modern Hollywood, as the founder of the studio system, as one of the most prolific and prolific filmmakers of all time. He is the author of many books, including a collection of comedy sketches.  In 1952, Buster Keats was born in San Francisco.  His early years were spent as a star-crossed youth who began working at age 12.  During this time he became famous with his vaudeville show, which he performed with a small group of performers.  As a teenager Keats got his big break with a role in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1948).  Keats worked as a vaudevaillie  from 1952 to 1965.  By the mid-60s he had turned the small stage on Main Street into his private stage.  For the first time in his life Keats appeared  with an audience large enough to make him famous.  Keating's  career went through many highs and lows. In 1960  Keat broke away from the vaudervillies to make a more "adult" film in  The Great Silence.  In 1961  he broke away again to direct The Great Dictator, a film that became
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie last year during a screening at a local cinema.  The director, Kwon Chang-won, is known for his gritty crime films, and this one really packs a punch.  It's a real crime caper and a great story to boot.  There's some great performances by the cast, all of whom look to be having a blast in the movie.  A great movie that should be seen by all action fans. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I loved this movie, not because of it being a bad movie, but the way it is put together. ___________ There are not a lot of actors in this movie: they are not bad (you have to give it credit for not having all the big name actors like Jason Robards, George Segal and Marlene Dietrich), but the actors did not play their parts well.  _____________ I have never thought that a black guy in a white world can be bad at the movies.  - Jody Hill     The first picture in the "M-Theory of Magic" has one black guy who can do all things. The second picture has one white guy who doesn't do any things. So who is right? Who is wrong? This is the movie where we see the results of people arguing and arguing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and this movie was the first time I'd seen him in a movie. I think this is a pretty solid adaptation of the books, with some pretty cool visual effects, and a nice mix of new and old characters.   I was a little afraid of the ending, but I thought it was great: the wizard has become a real man, and has been through some of the toughest times of his life, and it shows.  The movie has a lot of the same style and feel that was in the first book: very cool.  I've read the books for a while, but this movie is the first I've seen the Harry Potter films.  It really is a blast, and one that you won't want to miss.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Enemies is a very strong movie and a good action movie. The best thing about it is its amazing plot and the fact that it is not an over the top action movie and more of a classic, yet funny, and a film with lots of laughs. The story involves a secret plan by a German spy organization to take over the United States through a series of attacks. When a terrorist (played by the brilliant Christopher Plummer) is found dead in his own home, his widow (Jennifer Jason Leigh) realizes the truth about her husband and his crimes. The terrorists are after a mysterious substance known as "Tetro", a chemical with the power to turn people into animals. The CIA team (played beautifully by Robert Forster) is sent to Germany to help the German army in their secret operation. They get to work right away when they try to find the chemicals necessary to make Tetro. At the end of the movie, the German Army is able to capture one of the terrorists and his henchmen. The two soldiers who captured them have the chance to interrogate them and learn the secrets of their operation. The movie has a good storyline, and the film is very good in terms of acting and cinematography. This movie has everything: action, a great plot, interesting characters and lots of jokes. Christopher Plomer is in his prime as an actor. His character, Major General Jurgen Todt, is a tough general and has plenty of heart. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the widow, who wants the secrets about her husbands crimes but she doesn't get what she wants. It all starts with a terrorist attack in Germany and it's followed by a secret plot to take the entire world down through a secret chemical attack. If you like action packed thrillers, you should check this one out. The Best Of Enemies is definitely a must-see in my book. - July 28, 2009Totally awesome!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sgt. Rock is a film about the Vietnam War which never seems to end, except at the last minute when one of them goes home.  The whole war is about a kid called Tommy Rock, played by Robert Blake, who is a kid with lots of potential but is not allowed to play because he's a kid... and Tommy is an adult trying to play the kid.         Tommy's life is a constant series of disappointments - his parents don't understand his genius and his girlfriend doesn't understand him.       It's a bit like watching a comedy in which the comedian is a drunk with his head cut off. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Gravity.  It's a sci fi thriller, about a guy who is trapped in a spaceship, and then trapped in his own body, as the only way to get out is by eating an alien, or a certain other alien, who has somehow been captured by a scientist (with the help of a group of women) and now is in his body, and when he tries to leave the ship, his own mind tries to run away from his body.   (I love this movie)    There is an awesome soundtrack as well, as if it was composed by John Williams, I just wish I could download it in MP3 format!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie to get to know the family and what kind of a family, as some people say this is a "family values" movie, but there are some funny moments and very heartwarming scenes too.   The story of the family is pretty interesting and the performances were fine.  I am a big fan of old family movies and I was impressed that it was a family movie and not a gay bashing type of movie.  The movie does have some problems. It is hard to believe that the people who did the filming of that movie are now doing the same movies today or at least doing more gay bashing movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a pretty good movie and I enjoyed it a lot.   There is a lot of great dialogue and a good amount of action.  The movie is a story about a very old man who is going crazy.  This character is actually kind of annoying.  He is a grouchy old man that wants to retire but will not.  One day, an elderly man gets injured in a traffic accident.  It turns out that the old man is trying to commit suicide by setting fire to himself.  If you think that a movie this good is going to be boring then you are wrong.  I have to say that I enjoyed this movie a lot more then the average movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Unicorn is about a unicorn who's a bit of a geeky stoner. He doesn't know if he's a unicorn or not, and his best friend seems a bit skeptical at first, but the more they try to convince him that he's one, he's convinced, and after a series of adventures on horseback, they end up in the city of Noggin, home of Nogs the Unicorn. It's there that they start to realize there is a lot more to them than what they were told about. There is an evil sorcerer called the Dark Lord of Nogy, who is looking for one of his daughters, and he is looking to recruit unicorns to take control of the city. He thinks that using his sister as bait, he can capture her. But things don't work out that way, and they have to work together to defeat the Dark Master and his minions. There were some really cool scenes that I'd like to revisit. I'd also love to see if we can get a sequel to this movie!

He moves in to an old house for the winter, and it's a very pleasant place, until he meets a little girl, Sally (Gretchen Mol), who is determined to be the most popular girl in school. Unfortunately, she ends up in the same group as the old guy, who also happens to be her cousin. And then Walter falls in love with her.  The film is quite funny and a lot of the film is taken up with Walter going on adventures and falling in love.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ ______________________________________ The movie is a pretty good piece of science fiction action-adventure. It is based on the original story by John W. Campbell and it's interesting to read it again and see how it developed. The film shows us that the world has not improved one iota. It shows us a world full of greed and greed only! There is no happiness, no life, no hope. In a world of greed, violence, ignorance, evil, hatred and war. This is where the film focuses its attention. I think it was very much worth seeing again. It may not have the high point it once had. It has grown a bit more stale by now. It did improve after the second half. The final act was better than the opening one. It showed us a more developed world. With more people, better food, people in better homes and more peace. The ending of the movie, despite it not being the greatest thing ever, it's still pretty good. The reason I say that is not that it is better than any other film. Rather it is that it's better than most films that came before it. I guess the reason it did this is because of its plot. A good plot can make for a pretty great movie. I believe it does have a good plot, despite the problems it has. It does show us a different world and different people. While there is a lot of violence and hatred, it does try to show that humanity is still alive. In this world, humans were not the only intelligent beings. The aliens were even more intelligent than them. They created technology that was far greater and more complex than anything human beings ever did. However, humans still made use of it and had their own ways of life. Humans built ships and fought wars with other human nations. Humans also had spacefaring and airforce. Humans and aliens were the only living beings on this world. So yes the world did have improvements. There was more technology built, people had better houses and lives and more people were in better places. But as a result it was still filled with a lot more problems and violence. For a first time film I thought it got more interesting after it ended. However I do not think that it was better. It still had a lot to improve upon. I do know that the original was a very short one (and I was only 13 when it came out). __________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'It' takes a while to get going but once it does, the action is excellent. I thought the characters were well developed and enjoyable but their relationship was very weak. There was so much happening on screen for almost an hour.  I found it very funny at times but this is nothing like 'RoboCop' and even more nothing like the other 'It' movies.  This is a very silly and silly action film that is enjoyable from beginning to end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed the movie The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. A film about a man (John Wayne) who is accused of raping a young girl (Vera Miles). It seems that John Wayne was in the habit of making sexual jokes about women. This one is about a young lady who is trying to get back at her father (Edwin Forrest), who is a murderer and the uncle of a murderer. The Good is not really a good film, it is more of a bad movie. It is just a film about two murderers who are caught. They are sentenced to death. I have not seen the original script, so I am not sure whether the murder is committed by a man or a woman. The story is quite silly. It also features a black man, a white woman, a blond girl, and a white boy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not get into the second "Rambo" because I had been expecting "The Expendables" but I thought the first one was excellent. I thought it went about how expected but was far better than the two previous films.   This sequel is a "Rudy" of a movie. No, it is not as good as the first "Rumba," it is a good sequel, a lot better than "The Big Boss," but still not as great as "Romeo And Juliet."   While the second is a little better I can see why it gets bad reviews. I can think of a better way to close out the series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you enjoyed that original movie and want a good action movie, this is it, a very enjoyable action movie with a great story.   First let me say the acting in this movie is great, the characters are cool and unique. It is funny, sad, suspenseful and thrilling. The way the action is depicted is very good too. When I watch this I feel that I am in a movie, when someone gets shot, the blood, gore, the impact it makes on the actors really is amazing and the effects of it is just awesome.   the action scenes are great too. It was like I was watching an action movie.  . I like this movie, even though it's just one movie. But I would buy another one of these if I was in a similar situation to that one in this. I really liked this.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ -The film looks cool (the special effects look cool) -I like the action, which is what this movie is about -All the action scenes, even the big ones, are very well executed -You'll see lots of action sequences (not too many, just enough) -The movie's not as good as the trailer suggests (looks like it is going to be a bad film) -No great drama -The violence is not very great in this movie -The acting is good -The story is not too good, it is only about a few people doing a small robbery to save the lives of others -You can tell the movie's story is about a criminal who steals a huge cargo ship, and tries to escape the authorities by hiding among a small group of survivors -The plot is not really great, the movie makes a good try to set a few rules for the criminals (they can't be married to each other, they can't marry anyone except for a woman and they can only spend three nights in the same house before sleeping outside) and then the rest of the movie is just a bunch of bad guys doing bad stuff to eachother, but they succeed at all these things, so the movie goes on for a long time until they are caught and executed (with horrible consequences) -All in all, a pretty good movie -I was disappointed that the movie couldn't have done more with the characters, but at least they are entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** ******************* This movie has very good performances and action scenes.    It's a good story about an alien on a planet with a similar atmosphere to earth, with same kind of animals, same kind people, same environment, same culture.  The plot doesn't change very much from the start to the end, but it does have the occasional twists and turns.  One of the most amazing things about this movie is how it makes us think we know these characters and they do not seem to know each other at all (at the start of the film we think we are the only one in this world who can stop a space ship but in fact the aliens know about us and have to keep us waiting for another spaceship to arrive, until he finally takes away to his planet), and this movie manages to make us care about them even if we think they are very strange and different.  This movie is a good example of good acting, good music, good special effects and good special effect for a movie that is made on just four days. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first time seeing a film in which there are characters from the future who can speak to us through their actions and emotions.  I had thought that this film was going to take place in a far away futuristic planet but I guess they are from the past.    The action is very well done and the pace is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was in college, I saw a show called "The Kids In The Hall" which was a satire on popular culture. It had some good gags and a good soundtrack but unfortunately the main character (John Belushi) had a very one-note character. I have not seen any of these films since but I imagine he would come off more like the characters from "The Three Stooges" than the other three guys from the show.   This movie is more of a "Cannibal Holocaust" in the way that the characters are depicted. It is set in a prison in Texas and as it says, "It's no place for humans, either."   The main character is a murderer and rapist and he is very cruel.  The movie features a couple of flashbacks about him in his early 20's which I was a little disappointed they didn't feature more.  It features a lot of brutal and graphic scenes, some of which may be too graphic.  I was also a little surprised at how long it took to get through it.     My personal opinion:  This film is far worse than The Omen. The film is not very bad but it lacks a lot in plot, character development, and is completely unsatisfying. The best part about this movie is that you can watch it all the way through in a matter of hours. If you are a fan of movies with nudity and gore and the characters just being terrible then you might want to give this a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You've got a good cast here as usual, with a couple of newbies: David Arquette and Danny Glover. Arquette was only in "The Big Country" a few years ago. His character is a man trying to survive life in a war torn country. Glover has been in several other films, this being his first leading one. You have to admire his efforts.   The action scenes are pretty good. The plot is good, a bit cliche, but it works. The bad bit is the movie ends in a mess and then the story goes nowhere. I'm not going to talk much about the action.   the writing is bad though! I'm thinking of that line: "There was a big fire at the corner house, a lot of smoke and flames, and lots of flames...I just couldn't sleep." I mean, I'll have you put it into context: The fire is going to be blamed on the neighbors. The neighbors are going to blame the fire on the neighbor's dog. So, the movie just goes on for the whole movie about the neighbors, and their dog, and some other things. This is a very poor effort.   to my mind, the worst part of the movie is the ending. It isn't really a bad ending, it just drags on, you've got to be there to see it. It's really very poorly done.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Tin Tin Man" is a film about two guys, both actors playing a character.  One of them is the son of a tin tin maker (with a big belly), the other is a fat pig man, a big ugly guy.   The film is actually about a real person (actually, it is based on an actual person) named William "Willie" "Tin Man" Treadwell.   It was made before the war and is based in the fictional town of "Tintin" near Edinburgh.      In 1918 a new war hero is sent to fight in the battle of the Somme (in the film the Somminer is a soldier in the Australian Army) and is wounded and taken prisoner by the Germans.  After a short time is killed (it is an odd film but is a good film), his surviving companions escape from the Germans, and he is later arrested, tortured, and executed.  He is replaced as a major by a guy who is not the same old Tin Man, with some changes in his looks:  Tinman vs "Tiny" 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a good one - it is a great example of a great script. The movie takes place in a world where only people with good genes are allowed to make it big - if your a poor kid, you have two choices: work your way through the ranks (hope and pray you will be lucky!), or become a gangster (good luck). The movie has the right amount of violence, and has all the right characters: the gangster who gets his head chopped off, the girl who can't stop herself from getting into violent situations, a very annoying young guy who is the new kid in school - everything about the movie is perfect. The voice acting is great and you should watch it with a nice strong cup of coffee in front of the TV while listening to some classic rock music.  Read a negative review about this movie:  The movie starts very well with an action sequence that goes by quickly. This scene is a typical one - a girl gets hurt in a bar fight. There is an immediate police chase to catch the perpetrators. The police chase is interrupted (and the girl is seriously injured) by a gang with a car. It's a cool scene - cool enough to make a movie like this worth watching. The scene is broken by a shot of the car, then a shot to a house, then back to the chase, the girls clothes burning as she is dragged along - it was very sad to see that a girl got severely beaten up and even killed by these people. The ending of the chase has an intense shot of a bullet going to the girls head. The only thing that made me think is the way they show the girls blood on her face. It wasn't very realistic. All in all the movie was a great scene. The way it has to work and the good acting make this movie worth watching and this is a film that I recommend to people who want to watch some action sequences but can't stand violence. It was a very good movie and I recommend it to everybody.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me this is a very solid movie. The only problem is the "plot" it is so simple but in a good way, we meet very little of the story, it is more about how you will feel about someone who wants to save his baby girl. This is a great movie about a guy who feels sorry for a baby (I am an English major) when he finds her with a man who wants her for his wife, (this is the same guy who got the baby) he does everything he can to keep her. He takes care of the baby until her mother comes to the rescue, when she is only 7 years old, he is taken out by the police, he tells the policeman that he feels sorry because he saw a man take a baby of his child but he feels no remorse, in fact the cops do take them away but before being taken away they get a call from the mother who wants a new diaper for her child. He goes to the mall and finds the baby wearing it and when he asks what's a baby with a diaper, she replies that it's a diaper with a new man in it.  I don't want to spoil the story more so just keep reading! I loved it! I hope he makes a follow up to this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent movie that I have really enjoyed. I have seen a lot of films recently that are excellent, but this is one of the better ones. The acting is good, the story is good. The plot is good and I enjoyed the film more than the last time I saw it. There are some flaws in the film, but they are minor. For a 90 minute movie it is a decent one. The music is not bad and fits the characters very well, the whole film is very well done.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was actually thinking for a second that my mom made me watch this movie before I would come home because my mom likes to watch movies where bad people do bad things to good people, and this is the second one she told me about. I knew that it was a horror movie because there was a creepy, bloodthirsty man in a black coat. I was scared, but I liked it.   My other mom, on the other hand, was laughing in the kitchen and drinking a glass of water after she got scared.  If you like scary movies, I give this one a try.     
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~I had the misfortune of watching this during a snowstorm one chilly March. I was standing with my friend outside and, as you do, I was looking out across the snowdrifts below. I had come to view the last scene, when John Cazale plays a Russian spy in a bar, while the snowstorm raged below. And then I saw the two black and white films side by side on the old CRT (crisp, vibrant black and whites.) The snowstorm that day was probably the best in a long time, the snowfall, and the freezing winds that came down at night, and was only broken by a few bursts of sun in the morning. This film is one of my favorites, along with The Black Stallion, and all the other great films from the 1960s I've seen on the big screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard that Steven Spielberg was going to direct this movie I had to check it out, just as a fan, as the trailer suggested.  Sure enough, what I got in this movie was a well made little movie that had a lot of interesting stuff in it.  The movie itself is set in an alternate history where the US had won WWII but had become so paranoid about Soviet influence in the US and abroad that they ended up invading the Soviet Union.   We see this in the opening scenes as we see a Russian ship come in for repairs.  It appears to be a freighter but it has two huge American ships in the port.  This ship then proceeds to attack the US ship and it's crew.  One of the two ships that gets in trouble in the battle is the USS Skate.  I thought the movie was just a very fun action movie that could have had more substance.  Spielberg really does a good job in the directing.  When he starts filming we get a lot more action and it really makes this movie look like an action movie.  But like most action movies it eventually gets dull and boring.  Some parts of the movie are just cheesy and it gets a little ridiculous at points.  On the other hand it is still a fun movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a funny movie. I've read reviews that it was a low point for John Hughes' career because it was his first 'adult' comedy. I disagree, this is not such a bad movie, it's just not the kind that makes you look at your life in a whole new light.  I like adult comedies, but I wouldn't necessarily call this a good one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film. I would recommend it highly. The acting is great. I don't know about the story and the film is a little long at 6 hours. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good thriller with a twist in the first quarter which is really interesting as the protagonist does not get an easy ride. This is one of those movies that makes you think, that if that is so then there is more to it that the writer has revealed, as everything unfolds in a very clever manner, especially when one takes a closer look at the character of Sam. He is a very decent kid who has been taught the wrong lesson by his step-father, so it is no wonder that he gets involved in a lot of mischief. The twist in this movie is that, while Sam is off doing some good deeds, his mother, who has made her way to the USA because of his mother's death, goes to find him, so that it is she and not Sam who will get the chance to be the new owner of the ranch. The film shows Sam taking the role of the cowboy, and it is only at the end that the cowboy gets killed. At this point I cannot help thinking that the film could have been much more interesting had the cowboy not got killed. The characters are really quite good too, especially the mother who seems so ungrateful that one can sympathise with her a bit, she is a bit of a mess!   The dialogue between the mother and Sam is excellent and the acting is also quite good.   For an hour and a half it is a real treat and a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is definitely not an easy one. It can take some time to get used to the story line and the pace, and it will only get easier after a while. As soon as I got a taste for the story and the acting. I didn't get lost in the story either. I do admit the music from the score was not the most beautiful score, but it was okay. Overall this was an entertaining watch.  The film has a lot of mystery and a little humor. The humor is almost all done by the main character. He gets caught up in a few things that do not go as planned and that make him think about what he has done in the past that could lead to his current situation.  I really liked the character of Alex. He has a unique look and seems to be more then just a typical bad guy. The story is well done and the humor is funny.   There is a lot to say about this film, so let's start with one of the bad guys. Alex is the head of the organization with the most powerful machine on the world and that is the X Machine. This machine can see the future and predict the actions of the humans. This organization also has some pretty strong and powerful individuals that are involved in the planning of the future.    The movie is interesting in a way that makes you want to keep coming back for more. I think the ending of the movie was really cool. I don't remember all the details but I do remember that the movie ends with Alex in a place I haven't seen before. He appears in a desert and a man is fighting him. I can't quite remember the fight between the two. In the end Alex is defeated by the man and he disappears into a mysterious portal. It is unknown what happens after this.    Overall this movie does have a few bad guys and a good villain. It was a really cool story that I didn a lot and I'm not sure if there will be a sequel for this movie. Maybe in the near future. I would recommend this movie to all people who enjoy a good story and a funny story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  The premise is very clever - in one scene the main character has a run in with the police after running a red light and causing an accident.  My favorite aspect of this movie is the music and especially the singing - it's very catchy and fits the mood very well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really enjoying this movie. The director has a great taste and knows exactly what to do with the character's.  The cast is also really good but I guess that they were asked to appear in this movie and not play the leading roles.  I did not find the movie too violent nor was it really bad and I did enjoy it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie, good time for some chuckles. The characters and the story seemed well thought out and the humour was pretty good. In short this is a good film that takes a while to get into, but the end result is well worth the wait!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An odd-looking creature is introduced as a member of a secret cult in the remote mountainous region of the Alps known as the "Culture of Death". The cult is headed by a bearded man who seems to possess supernatural powers. His cult follows a simple yet highly effective "law of life" principle: "Kill the sinners, save the innocent." The members of the cult believe that they will live eternally in paradise upon the earth. The one member of the "cult" most in trouble is a man named Peter (Liam Neeson) who, like everyone else, lives the life of a human. Peter has a wife and young daughter. Peter is a good man, but not a saint. His wife, Mary (Charlotte Rampling), is not the most ideal mother. She has a nervous and somewhat overbearing way of speaking; she has a bad temper; and she doesn't share Peter's love of the outdoors. This is not to say that Peter is an ideal husband. Mary is not a warm and loving mother. After a year or so, Peter decides that it is time to leave. He goes home to visit his family. Mary's father, who is old and frail, refuses to allow his daughter to visit. Peter gets angry and drives to her father's house. Peter goes inside and finds her mother dead and his daughter crying. Mary wants to kill herself. But Mary is saved from taking her own life by a young German man named Max, played by Liam Neesan. Peter takes Max back to the village and Max has his own plan to save his life. He agrees to kill Peter. At the same time, Peter is being followed by a Nazi officer. It turns out that Max has been recruited by the Nazis and wants Peter for himself. Peter hides himself in a bunker at home. When Peter discovers that Max is still alive, he tries to kill Max, but ends up killing Mary. Max is taken into the bunker with Peter. After killing both Max and his father, Peter returns to his home in Switzerland, with Mary still alive.   When Peter comes home from his mission in the Alps, he decides to have a good old-fashioned meal with his family and then goes upstairs to look at Mary. The doorbell rings and Mary appears at the top of the stairs. Mary says that she can't get in because the door is locked. Peter says that he can open the door and he is going to make sure Mary
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is based on a novel by an American author James Gurney titled  The Fallen Angel  written around the turn of the century, the story takes place in the 19th century, and is an action/drama with a very interesting concept (at least it looks like it from the first minute).  One of the main character is a woman called Maud, Maud is also a witch who was transformed by the demon of the movie which later on turns out to be a demonized angel. A small demon comes to earth after a curse (as it is in all stories), it kills all the children in a large village and the only survivor turns out a boy, who is rescued by Maud and who soon finds himself in the demon's lair, there he meets a witch from a far past who is looking for something, the only solution is to kill the demon.  The story is very good, and while it is a little short, I really like it, it is fast paced, interesting and it gives us some very strong horror images, and the plot is very interesting, I just wish it had been longer to give it some more depth.   Movie Rating: 7 out of 10 stars    If you like my reviews, you might like my other films;  A Christmas Tree, The Christmas Tree and The Grave of the Fireman; 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very entertaining movie with excellent performances by all the characters. It is not a particularly good movie but for the period there was no way to make a good one so this is a good flick. It has a lot of humor and the story is simple enough. If you are interested in the period of the early days of the U.S.A., this movie will amuse you. But even a very old movie can have great effects.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was definitely the most interesting part of the weekend.  What I liked about the movie was that it actually shows you what real life looks like outside the box of Hollywood movies we're forced to watch.  What I didn't like about the film was that the whole thing felt a little rushed.    The movie actually didn't seem to be all that realistic either; the guy is in a world of his own (he is in an apartment in the middle of an urban setting with his girlfriend).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A must see for a young audience! Written in the mid 90s, the movie follows a group of boys who play basketball and hang out at a local gym. One night, however, all of the boys are found in their bedrooms. After some investigation they discover that a local mad scientist has been experimenting on them. This is a fantastic movie, it is the perfect blend of comedy and drama. It is the only movie that I watched in 1994, and I was not disappointed. The plot is quite good, the characters are well built and the cast work together to bring the movie to life. The soundtrack was good, I also thought that it was very funny. This one has a lot of laughs in it, and that is the reason I really love it. The ending made me scream and laugh. The action scenes were well done and all of that made for a great movie! If you like a good laugh and a good action movie, you should definitely watch it! It is definitely not a movie that you want to skip over, it definitely gets my vote for best movie of it's year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original "Lobster Johnson" with Michael Ironside as the title character was in fact an underrated film. I've seen more "silly" movies (such as the one about a "spooner") and I'm sure this one's too. This movie does not focus on being a great adventure movie but on having an amusing comedy. The cast is very good, they're well built, they don't act like comic relief and the jokes are often very clever and original. It has some good effects (including a good fight scene) which is what makes the comedy so fun to watch. I loved this movie from the start until I was bored of the plot at about the 1h 50min mark. This is a comedy so it would have to be good, but at that time it just wasn't. I think Michael Ironson does a very good job of playing a clown who is an incredibly incompetent detective. I love the part where the lobster makes a prank call to a detective's house asking him to investigate the strange disappearance of a man. After receiving the call the detective goes out to investigate and finds a huge dead lobster on his windshield. I must admit, I've never seen a movie about a man trying to rescue a lobster from the police. I loved the part when the detective says he has no idea where the shell came from, but then he realizes that the victim was a lobster, which is the reason why he was killed. It's a funny scene and it shows a good side to the detective. As far as the rest of the movie goes, there are a few good action scenes, but unfortunately the comedy just isn't very funny. The ending leaves a cliffhanger but that doesn't bother me too much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie. I felt the love that is a main character was in here for most of the movie. It was a good character driven movie. There were some funny moments like the crazy ex-cop who was a policeman, and the ex-con who went to prison. The acting was good for most who played the cops and the other good roles were to be found as well. The plot was fun and I liked the ending which was quite satisfying. I hope that there is a sequel out because it seemed that this one was the beginning of a good story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this a lot! It's like a mix between the "Masters of the Universe" movies and the "RoboCop" movies. If you haven't seen it, please go and watch it already. I can see myself being drawn into watching this show.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a beautiful love story. I feel that I've never seen a movie so beautiful as this one. Not that I was expecting it to be. But I thought that when I had my heart broken I would have a romantic film or a comedy and this movie is none of these! This is a romance with a dark undercurrent. It's an art and it is beautiful.   I also would like to thank the writer/director for her talent. There's something beautiful about a movie written by someone who is not afraid to make a movie about people who don't have a lot in life. It gives the audience a way to escape themselves into the world of a story. There is a lot to love about this movie. I don't care if you hate the way people are portrayed here it's still one hell of a movie! I could watch this movie every day!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A short and sweet romance, I love how they play off of each other in a funny way. There's also some good voice acting in the film. I thought there was a scene where the guy was pretending to be a woman because of the way she had her hair up, I also enjoyed a couple scenes in which the main character was a crossdressing woman, and one of the other characters was a woman in drag.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't help but get a little teary-eyed whenever I watch this movie. In fact, I got a little sentimental just about halfway through the movie when the wife takes a moment to look deep into her husband's eyes, but he is too busy to notice or be upset by the emotions he has on his face. As the story goes, the wife, with the help of her sister, an accomplished violinist, tries to bring her husband back from a nervous breakdown he was having on an airplane flight, but it looks like the efforts might be in vain. It seems the man who has to be watched closely is having a hard time staying on his feet with the nervous excitement he is feeling from the thought of what the audience might think when his performance in a live performance is announced. He is, of course, no match for his wife's talent. But he is a fine husband and he deserves to have his wife play the violin with him. There was one particular scene where the husband and wife are sitting around, drinking, having some quiet conversation about their love lives, and the wife notices the violin being played by her husband, and she smiles and says, "Hey, what kind of musician is that? I am a violinist as well." She is, however, mistaken, as he is no musician and has never even played the violin before. He doesn't know how to read music and she thinks the violin is a simple instrument, but she isn't to be discouraged. She tries to play it a few times and she can play it well, but eventually she is able to play just one note and then she is unable to continue with the music and instead just sits quietly. Then suddenly her sister comes up to her and says to her, "Isn't this wonderful! Is it? I always wanted to be a violin player." She smiles and then points to the man sitting near the window, who is also looking out the window but does not seem to be paying attention to the violin, saying, "Look, I think you're better off looking out there. He'll never notice you." This scene seemed to me to be very moving. It wasn't just a heartwarming story, it was the story of a good person who is good at things. In this case the woman was able to use her mother's violin to make a good living. The woman could, in a sense, do whatever she liked so long as it was in keeping with her family's tradition
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie, because it was pretty much everything I've wanted in a comic book movie for a while now, but the ending wasn't so great. I wasn't particularly a fan of the story, though it had a lot of heart. But I'm not sure it was the best way to go about a superhero movie. It was great, and still very funny at times. I'm glad I watched it, though. I'll just have to revisit it when I need a comic-book fix or just to sit down and watch something. I give it a 4/5

The other is a boy who is sent to a psychiatric hospital to cure his father of a mental illness. The girl who was kidnapped as such a girl, in order to get the revenge of her mother. There are different people and different situations, each with its own special characters. But all in all this is a nice movie to watch and I liked it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you don't think we should use our brains before we get our rocks off, I got news for you.   This is a good-bad movie that will leave you speechless.  The director makes up for all the bad writing with a great performance by Jim Carrey. If he didn't act as goofy as he does in this movie, it would be one of the worst films I have seen in a while.  This movie is hilarious and yet it is just as bad-bad as it is funny.

For example, the two men are in love in front of their family.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is all that I had to say about that!!!! Posted by Lina Zatara at 2:11 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ The film opens with a beautiful vista. A forest, a mountain peak, and a river. A large town of a few houses. There are a lot of people and there is a school. The school is called Fürth, and it is where two children are being educated. The older child is named Franz Kafka, who writes, sings, and plays the violin. He is a very talented child, who also has a passion for chess. Franz lives with his mother, Ida Kafka, a widow, who had a small daughter whom she left behind years ago. Franz and Ida's son, Georg Friedrich, is named after one of the greatest pianists in the world, Ludwig van Beethoven. Franz is only 7 years old, but he is already an accomplished performer. He performs for the Fürstkids during dinner and on the school excursion, which involves an epic journey. Franz's younger sister, Florian, is 10 years old and lives with her foster family in a small cottage behind Fürste's school. Florian is only 3 years old. She is the "perfect child," a good student who is always good at whatever she is told to do, except for one thing: she's deaf. Franz notices that there is something not right about this, and she never says anything. One day, he takes a piano to his sister. Flora doesn't seem to notice the noise, although she hears her brother playing with it. Franz plays a little piece on the piano, which sounds just like a child's singing. That night, Franz goes to see his sister, and he is thrilled to see that she is singing. She tells him that she wants to play the piano once more. In his heart, Franz knows that that's not possible, and so he says, "Well, there's a piano in the back of the church. I think if you can find it, I'll play it for you." That night Franz takes the piano to the back room of a church. There, he hides the keys, which he has stolen, and uses them to unlock the piano. Floria finds him, but as usual, she is not interested in a piano, she just wants to go to the town hall. He tries to persuade her, but Floria refuses, and then she throws a little piano key at him. Franz then runs outside to tell the townspeople about the keys. He says that he thinks Floria may

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought I would get into horror films to see what this stuff would do to me, but ended up getting some more of it. This was one of the worst I've seen, but the acting was ok. I was expecting it to be a very disturbing movie but I was surprised to get a very silly movie about an evil clown. The clowns face was so creepy and evil that it was very hard to watch. I also expected to see a great movie, but sadly the film didn't live up to my expectations.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason has its fair share of moments that keep you coming back for more and I am not a big believer in spoilers, so I will not ruin it for you, though I did feel slightly uncomfortable about having to sit through the credits at the end of the movie.  That aside, Bridget Jones: the Edge of Time is a terrific film with a wonderful story and the casting and performances are all excellent.  In this movie, Bratty (Catherine Walker) discovers a book in a barn that is written in an ancient language and when she opens it, Braddy gets in a lot of trouble.  She ends up being kidnapped by a tribe of people who can communicate with animals that have come over from the Middle Ages and Bridget has to rescue her from the clutches of these strange creatures who will do anything to get at the book that will lead to a powerful magic.   I absolutely adore Catherine Walker and it's a treat to see her back on film after her amazing role in the classic The Legend of Hercules.  If you are a Bridget, you are in for a treat.  When the story of Bridget goes from good to bad, I'm not a fan of this but this is the final movie in the Bridget series (as in, we are done with Bradds) and that has to be good enough.          I loved this movie. I really did. Bridget is a wonderfully talented actress who always brings a lot to the table. I liked how each scene in the movie was more than just a set piece and it had a lot in common with the old Bridget books and made it feel like you were getting a book about a real person and I love that a movie is coming out that will be about a person who has really never had a movie made about them and I can say with confidence that is is a character that deserves to be told in a movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, the story of this movie is interesting: a boy who has nothing and is left homeless after his mother passed away and then dies and he comes to London, but he lives on the streets with other homeless people. He has to go to school a lot and he has to hide his real name from his friends or else they will be put in a dungeon and they will have to eat grass. The characters, the dialogues, the performances, were really wonderful: I love all of them. It's a story about a boy and his friends. That they try to live on the street and in the shadows and learn how to survive.   I will never forget that I watched a movie with my friends which is a movie that is really funny and a wonderful movie, I don't know, I think, it is one of those films that I will remember for a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________   The film has a simple, yet beautiful story about a couple of kids. When the kids, who have been abandoned by their parents, become lost in the woods they meet an old man who seems to have lost his marbles. The kids take care of him for a while, but then he starts showing his age, and starts playing pranks on them that end up with them in trouble. It doesn't take long before he's gone, and the kids realize that in order to survive they're going to have to learn a few tricks of their own!   I found this movie quite difficult to watch. Although it is one of my favorite films ever, there is not a lot of detail here. There isn't even a very long shot. It seems that the filmmakers have little idea of what makes this movie stand out, and because of this it doesn't quite stand out either. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, but I'm saying this is not the first, or the worst, or even the last time that a movie like this has been made. This could have been a wonderful movie, and it could have also been a great movie, I'm just not sure which it was. It's a good film, I just wish the filmmakers didn't have so little respect for the old man.    Overall I gave it a 3 out of 5. ______________________________________   Like this: Like Loading...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been watching a great amount of movies recently and this one is one of my favorites. It was fun and quirky all the way through, despite the fact that most of the movie takes place in one room. There is just a lot of stuff going on that makes it entertaining, and you can see why these guys have created such a popular show. This is a must see movie for all fans of good old-fashioned mystery shows.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen a number of "bad" movies in my life, but this one stands out. It is a very well made movie with a plot that was interesting and exciting and the characters all had great personalities. It has a wonderful cast with a variety of talents and all the actors did very well. There is so much to see and learn about this wonderful world, the technology is excellent and they give it an old school feel that is quite fun and exciting. The film is very much about how humans get their jobs and how the roles and responsibilities are different in a world where most people are slaves to the computers and robots. The movie itself has a very strong story line with lots of action and fun and has a strong sense of humor. The soundtrack was very good as the movie was set in a cyber world and the music was appropriate for that setting. I think it is a good film to start someone into cyberpunk movies and it would be a perfect movie to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, but it wouldn't be an enjoyable film to watch if it didn't have a sense of humour and a good storyline to start off. If you like cyberpunk, a good action film set in the 80s, an interesting story, and music to match, this is a great movie to see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great action movie.  The first half is action-packed.    I was worried that there'd be too much action but there wasn't, and I don't think there ever is in a Batman movie. It's just a good watch with a very cool character.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** I went into the theater thinking I would walk out with a big grin on my face. Then I walked out and felt sad. I wish I can say the same about this movie. The story line makes no sense. The acting has nothing good to say about it, and you will have to take my word for it that every scene that took place in the bar was one long shot. The camera is not even in the same general area as the action. I could see it all from a mile away. It really did not matter what was going on in this movie because there was nothing left to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (This movie made me laugh quite a lot in addition to making me think about a bunch of things I like)  It's a movie about a boy who wants to grow up and is afraid of his old man. A story about a small town that becomes the center of a war. This movie is funny, I can't find a bad moment in the movie, the dialogue is pretty good, the actors are all great, they all have great chemistry and that is what makes a good comedy. There are also some good songs in the end credits (though the music isn't as good as some of the other movie's).   There's a lot of talk in this movie. It's a big talk! But it's a pretty funny talk!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Downtown is an unusual movie. It is a story about two people who live in a neighborhood they would have no business being in: New York City.  What do you know about the New York experience and New York culture? Well, here are some of the tidbits I learned: (1) A man's life changes when he meets an attractive, young woman. (2) The two women are very different. One of them is a rich girl who lives in a luxurious apartment while the other one lives in poverty. (3) One of the women is a former model who is trying to make her way as a dancer. (4) They love the subway, so much so that they have a love triangle.    (5) A friend of the woman and the man's friend, a writer by the name of Joe Egan, is a fan of the couple's work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In all honesty, I found this movie very intriguing. When I watched it back in 2007, I didn't really care too much about the story at first, but then something happened that brought the whole thing together to me...I loved this movie.    Plot: The movie opens up with a group of "experts" on hand. They talk about the dangers of drugs like Ecstasy. And they talk about how great the experience is, "the light that shines from the world beyond". Suddenly, they all disappear, and the people who are supposed to be in charge of the situation have a very different opinion on what's going on, especially the leader, who goes by the name of The Black Beast. He tries to find a way to make things better. Well, he can't, because the people he's looking for are all dead. The Black beast takes off after a drug dealer that he had a few drinks with earlier. He's very pissed that the dealer killed his man, but he needs the money. It's then that he meets up with three boys called The Wombats, who are working for the drug dealer. They give him information about a local gang and a mysterious person who can control the police. I thought that this movie was going to be like a mixture of American Nightmare and a Japanese vampire movie. It was really good, and I was impressed by how much it sucked in my head.   The performances were also quite good. I liked what I saw of Jeff Bridges. I was very impressed by Daniel Roebuck. If you're a big fan of his performances, this is an easy recommendation. But he was a little bit different than I had remembered. I don't know if he had just gotten that much older. I also liked the performance of Brian Glover, I thought he did a really good job. And I loved the work of Chris O'Dowd. He got the character of The Dark Lord extremely wrong, but I thought it worked very well.   I think this movie would have made a good sequel to The Abyss. I just wish I could see it again.   The music was pretty good for a horror film (though I'd like a little more in the way of horror music here). But it is kind of cheesy at the end. It reminded me a little of how the music in some of the movies in the Blair Witch Project. It's very obvious that the director didn't actually make this
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never heard of the original series of this show. But once I started watching it, I couldn't get enough. The characters are so very believable. They're quirky, but they're also kind. This show has all the elements necessary for a great cartoon. I can just see the little characters having a laugh together. But all they need is that one special moment! I loved that little episode where they made fun of the little girls who always run around the forest looking for the mythical monster. I love the fact that they're so cute and easy going in all situations. And I love it when they're helping each other out and giving out advice. That makes it all better. They also have some very cute little characters in the background. I think the characters were just a little bit too cute. This anime is really cute and adorable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of my all time favorites.  I love the combination of humor and gore.  If I could rate my favorite movies 10-10.... I would.    A beautiful and very original tale told in a very dark way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this movie, the bad guys have already kidnapped and tried to have sex with the main female character, which is of course, Princess Tania. She says that she's not sure whether she is gay or straight, until she has sex with a guy. And that was the most fun part of this movie! The best part is that we don't need any special effects to give a gay couple any action. This movie is really very good! We can see the love between the lead couple! The chemistry is good, and this couple will be a real romance for some time! I have to say that I had a very good time watching this movie. If you like this kind of movie, don't miss this one!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's always a great pleasure to watch a great movie such as   Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. This epic fantasy is one of the best and the best set in space of all time.  Star Wars is all about good vs evil.  There's no good and evil. This movie has a very dark and heavy tone to it and the good guy, Darth Vader (who I would say is one the very best villains in film history), is a complete badass.  From the moment that George Lucas takes you to a forest planet, you know you are in for a treat.  As we meet the characters, this movie becomes a classic adventure with great characters and an interesting plot.  The story of this movie is actually one of my favorite and one I recommend to anyone even if they never see Star Wars before.  Star Wars and Lord of the Rings (who is one great movie of epic proportions) are not movies I would like to see any time.  This movie is about a battle in space and this movie does not disappoint.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â (4 out of 5) I would like to point out that this movie is not just a horror movie, it is a psychological masterpiece. Â The movie focuses on a young girl who is forced to move in with her boyfriend.  Her boyfriend and the neighbors take delight in torturing her.    The girl doesn't do anything to them, and she is just a kid to them.  They also take pleasure in teasing her, she just sits there, scared.  And then she meets a little boy, he doesn't even look like a boy, and doesn't take any abuse, he is a handsome boy in a hoody.      He starts playing with her, they get along great.  He starts to show her the life of a real boy.  For his birthday they are to go on a train and the train conductor starts talking to him.  (A good movie to play on the subway!)  He says things that the movie doesn't get into, and the little girl is horrified.  It is a wonderful movie, and if you are a horror fan, give it a go. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found the ending a little too simple. For anyone who follows this kind of stuff, I expect a happy ending. I would have been disappointed had there been no happy ending for you.  The final shot is a little sad, and that was before the ending had taken a turn for the tragic.  It is a shame that, as a man who has lived in the city, who has run for political office, and who has made a career of writing novels about people, it was never meant to be.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen 'The Silence of the Lambs' since it was first released.  It is, by no means an average thriller, but certainly not something that will impress anybody either.  From the beginning it sets up it's very simple concept. It's a murder case in the home of Clarice Starling (Joan Allen) a very smart woman who does not trust anyone.  A strange man from a mental hospital calls her with an intriguing offer to investigate the death of a young child.  This is a very clever idea that really comes across well in this movie.  Clarice is a little girl who grows up in a very isolated home. Her life is filled with violence, abuse, and the fact that the house is filled to the brim with a very small group of children.  Her relationship with her Uncle is one of the most disturbing things to ever happen in any of the movies made.  One night she witnesses a child being tortured by another child.   What is Clarice to do when she is invited to be a part of this?  I'm very glad that there are several reasons behind the film that makes it so fascinating.  I loved the ending when Clarice decides to take matters into her own hands.  Unfortunately, when the case is investigated by her husband, she is quickly dismissed as 'a nut job' and then 'the crazy one who won't stop calling'.  If you are a fan of The Silence of The Lambs you will definitely have to add this movie to your collection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The premise of the movie isn't that bad:   Two strangers are having a fight over a girl who's going to a party. The girls are talking about their problems:   A) She's too hot for a girl's party and has a boyfriend.   B) She can't get the guy away from the guy who has taken over her life.   the two decide to go to the party together; however, the girl doesn't have a clue and is going to be too much for her:   to the point where the dude, who was always a friend to her, is now the friend and lover of her life:  .   and in the end, she's not only dead- but will never come back to life. Now what?   Well, if you ever wanted to see an animated romantic movie about a girl that's dead, then look no further than "The Body Snatcher". I didn't find the movie very well written or animated, but that's a pretty minor complaint.   The movie deals mostly with character. There are a few jokes and one or two action moments. A good amount of it involves the two friends, who are trying to figure out what they want to do with the body of the dead girl. They have fun playing a game with her: how do you turn it off? And they do, but at what cost? After trying a bunch of things they finally decide to put a "dummy" body of her in a box for all of eternity:   In the box is a key, and one of the guys says if he can keep it there he's free to take the girl from the party. This is how the movie starts.   "The Box" is a very odd movie. For starters, it's one of those "fun" movies. I never thought I would see a movie that makes fun of a certain movie genre, such as the action genre. This movie tries to make fun of the action/comedic genres. And what better way to do it than to see a young guy in a ridiculous outfit get killed by a bad guy who is literally his opposite. However, there is a certain amount of sincerity to this movie. And I think a lot of people would love to see some comedy in an action movie, or maybe some good action.  . And then in the third act, the whole movie turns into a horror movie. All of the comedy from the first two acts

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen some amazing documentaries in my day. This film was just one of them. My wife and I were both absolutely enthralled and amazed at every single second. I never knew what was really going on in that house! The camera is awesome, and the people were fantastic. It was so much fun to watch a family get together and interact. Everyone seemed to have a great time! Everyone was happy as could be! I don't think it's that far fetched to think they could all have been involved in a terrible accident. I am so glad I went to a great movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was not so great. That's probably a good thing considering it is only 11 minutes long and even then, it's only 6 minutes and it is very, very bad.  The plot is a bunch of bums trying to rob a bank when one of them dies and is replaced.  The script is bad and is hard to follow because of the acting.  If you look around for something to laugh at or something to do, you will not find much.  This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen because it looks like a bad TV movie.  It is a comedy that is only funny when it is being told.  The acting is awful, especially the bums themselves.  They make fun of their own deaths and they act like dumb kids.   In the last few minutes, they have a "good ole fashioned" murder that gets all of the other bums to laugh and then the "good old" guy gets killed, like it's nothing.  At the end, the "bad guy" dies.  You think about it, this is what I would have done if I was a bad guy.  As for what is good, it is a small but charming film about a bank robbery that turns into a murder.  There are some funny characters like the fat bums and the good old guy who is really good at killing bad guys and it's hilarious when the bad guys have to kill him.  A movie that is too bad to be good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I thought the best thing about the movie was the fact that it really didn't need to explain anything in any detail. For me, the film really just showed me a couple of random people having a nice time. In this way, it seemed to be about family and friends more than anything, which made it even more enjoyable. The performances were all terrific, and the film had the feel of being almost a dreamlike short film. It even had a little bit of a "guru" feel to it at times, which is really rare for this kind of film. If you are looking for a laugh and entertainment, you should check this one out! _________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Mummy, I don't really need to tell you how much I enjoy this movie.  As mentioned in the movie's bio (see above), it has been rumored to be a remake of a 1930s Universal monster movie about a mummy with a talking car.  It doesn't get worse than that.  The monster itself looks like a cross between a mutated shark and a crocodile with a mouth filled with teeth.  When you see this monster, your thoughts immediately drift back to the opening scene in the 1930 Universal movie.   The monster is chasing a girl (Diana) out of her town.  He is looking like an unstoppable beast.  You can barely keep a look on your face as you witness the monster tearing through the countryside.  At first I was worried that it might take a while to get from the forest to the town.  I was so happy with the fact that it took less than two hours to arrive in the town that I started to wonder what else they could have filmed with the time and money they saved.  There is a village of people who live in fear because of the Mummy.   One day a young man named Arthur (Boris Karloff) goes out to find the Maitman himself.  The scene is well shot and has the potential to be one of those monster movies that can take you back in time.  I thought the movie played it's hand well and had me genuinely scared, not for the reasons I might normally think, but to show that the monster isn't the bad guy.  One of the few weaknesses to this movie is a subplot about some local farmers who own a cow.  There was quite a bit of gore in this movie but the thing I took away from it was the story of a family going into the forest, and discovering a village surrounded by a giant snake like monster in the middle of a forest.  You can see it's not just a horror movie, but a classic tale of terror.    There is a great scene near the end of the movie where the village is destroyed, people running around screaming.  Another nice scene was near the beginning of the film when a group of people are heading into the woods and there are no monsters around.  This movie is one of the best monster movies ever made.  It is hard to believe this was made in the early 80's, not only because it was made by the same people who made
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm going to start off by saying I loved this movie, I knew exactly where I was going in this story. I was always looking for a good love story and I have been in search of one for a while now. This is it. I always loved this story and it was an entertaining movie. In addition to the movie there were two other things I was excited about that I haven't seen before. I'm a huge fan of the book, it has an interesting story and a great cast. I also loved the fact that the movie kept bringing the love story back to the main characters. I didn't find this film to be overly romantic, but I was very happy to see the two of them together again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you ask how to describe The Hunger Games  or the last few films of Peter Jackson, the best way to summarize them would be to say that they're a very sad, very dark movie. It is full of sadness because the "goodness" of society is replaced by a kind of "tears for your sins". This is a great concept, but the execution is a little bit questionable. We all know about the "reboot" of the world, but there's nothing "original" about it. We're used to that idea, that is. The thing with the movie and the "new" idea is that we're not really given an idea about how it works; we know only what kind of society it's supposed to be. We know it's bad, we know it will be bad, and we're all rooting for the survivors to make it out alive and happy.  The problem with all of the film is that it seems to be just a rehash of the previous films. We already know that it's not so much like the original trilogy of films, but it has the same kind of world. There are very few new characters introduced, and the only people left that the audience still cares about are those people we've met before: Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), and Gale (Kristen Stewart). These characters are good, and their relationship with the main characters is very touching, but they are still just re-introduced. They don't change the whole story or even give us any new information on who they are, so it's really easy to not care about them. The Hunger is so sad, it's like someone dropped a large bucket of pure sorrow onto a table and watched it sink to the bottom. It's about a group of people who must survive a whole year in the wilds of District 13, and when you take into consideration that it takes almost a whole summer to tell this story, you realize why this movie is so great. It shows how cruel, how stupid, and how pitiful the human race can be in their attempts to survive the horrors of the future.  It's one of the most unique, beautiful, and thought-provoking films of the year and it's definitely one of my top three favorite movies of 2013.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The movie is very good, so the whole movie is full of good humour and funny moments. The movie contains strong messages about love and relationships and many other things. The film is a really good movie. The actors are very good in the acting part and it is funny to watch their reactions while they try to make a scene with a guy and a girl. All the characters are interesting and they are able to make you laugh. The acting of many of the people in this film is really funny. They do so well, that you almost forget that they are talking about some real, living people. I wish that this movie were the next one!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    We meet a guy who is a mechanic at a small factory and lives with his mother. He has a girlfriend, a girl named Lisa who is 19 years old. He works at the factory, but his job can take a few years. We have a good job, but it's pretty good in the sense of the "what we used to do in the old days".   He goes for a visit to a woman whom he used to know as a little girl. They fall in love. He's married, but lives alone. He is a good husband and father. He does not like the idea of being alone.   One night, in a drunken rage, he kills his father. They are the only family he has left. His mother has some money, but is living in a small house and needs the money. She tries to hide it, but she can't be very successful.   the movie is told from a couple's point of view. I thought it was a pretty good movie.

If you are bored with the more recent Bond movies, you need to at least give this a try. I am a Bond fan and a big fan of this series as a whole. The first Bond movie was a masterpiece. The 007 movies are so good and a great movie series. This one is good too and for me, it adds to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most disturbing of the films in the movie series I consider to be a'masterpiece'.  This is an extreme example of a strange movie and I'm very fascinated with this film.   The films story follows a girl, Mary, who has the stolen birthday cards of some of the weird people around town.  Her mother has died in an accident, she's under the care of  her carer who is a 'ghost' with the ability to move objects with the claws of a cat.  Mary's guardian, an 'alien' is a kind of spacey looking man in a white suit and a bowler hat and he has the ability move things with his mind.  The 'alien/space-man' comes to Earth in his spaceship, a large ship which, when we see it, is very much like a space-car, but it is very different.   The ship's interior has a huge ball-room with many different different rooms in different rooms inside of it.  In the room where the 'alien is' is the girl is trying to get a birthday card from a child and the girl knows he will get the card if he sees her in the room and the 'Alien knives her to death', leaving the girl unconscious.   At the end of the film the spaceship dives into a pool of water from a very high point which results in the alien/hero being flung out the window in a heap.   There is a nice comic sequence to a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've heard this movie a million times but I've never seen it. I'm surprised that it was well received on Rotten Tomatoes. I always thought that a "penny dreadful" is just a poor man's Penny Dreadful. But it is something different. This is a comedy with a plot that has a beginning, middle, and end. And while some of the jokes are silly, they do have some heart behind them. I love the comedy and it is good to hear Stephen Dillane doing his thing. His performance is not his best but it is not bad either. I loved the ending. It has a great tone to it and even after all the terrible movie it had to give, there is a final happy ending for this tale.  This is a little gem that I wish I had seen when I was younger.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Gerald's Game is one of those rare "slightly more entertaining than a trainwreck" films where it's more a matter of "I'm just not feeling a film as much this week, or at least not in the way I think I was supposed to".  It's a slightly predictable tale of a rich woman dying from a mysterious disease that only she can heal, but in her final moments she's taken over the body of her own son, and he's all that remains.  To prevent this, the wealthy husband (Bruce Willis) seeks her help in finding a woman who was kidnapped decades earlier, and whose murder led him to the young girl (Juliette Lewis) who died at the hands of her mother. ________________________________________  The film is pretty good, but it has the typical "young lady getting into her first man's heart" plot, and for it's budget it's pretty good.  It has some decent gags that the audience could find entertaining and it does a good job of showing what life is like in a rich house, and it's not a bad film.    The only real complaint I can think of with this film is that the film could have been longer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The good reviews are really starting to fly so far - from one star to five and my heart is still in good shape after this. I am an old pro by now and I must say, I am a bit shocked to be saying this as a movie that was made in the 1980s (which is more of a world back then), but has become a cult hit and is now a part of a much beloved series on Netflix with its own "series" that has taken off in the USA (my home for over two decades now).  So it is that my opinion on this movie has changed from what I was sure would be a boring old thriller with nothing but a little bit of heart (that's what we have here) to an entertaining mystery that is a little too good to be true.  I have only watched two episodes (which came out at the same time) and I am enjoying the show so much I can't wait to watch more. It's an excellent thriller that is not afraid to do a little detective work when it needs to, and a good little mystery that has the potential to go places you never thought it would.  But the best part has to be the ending - the best cliffhanger I've ever seen, and the perfect send off for a great movie that started with little but promise but ended with a bang.  For me, this is a must see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Saw this movie at a friend's house when I was 17 or so, I remember it well. It was a teen slasher flick from the 80's. I remember watching it at a time when I didn't know shit about vampires or werewolves or whatnot. This was pretty much the first film I ever saw about them. Anyway the movie was pretty well shot by a local guy named Larry Kren. The plot involves a young girl who gets bitten by a werewolf by accident but when she gets to the doctor she discovers she is actually a vampire. She tries to kill the werewolf but it turns her into a human. The film was made in the 70s and I remember seeing it at some mall.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* ********* It is quite amazing that the movie does not get all the attention that it deserves. I am very happy that it is not as good as it should be. That being said, I found the film to be quite interesting and enjoyable. If you want to be entertained and learn something about the world of the film's characters, you will enjoy it quite a bit. Although the movie is a simple but well-constructed story, I do find its main characters to be extremely relatable. The movie starts with a few people in a cabin in the wilderness. They have a very important conversation that could be quite traumatic if they were told a different outcome. I find it ironic that such a serious conversation can be considered quite cute. The cast is quite good, even though they have a fairly small amount of screen time together. This may or may not have something to do with the fact that the director, Tim Burton, had a part in the film. He seems quite likeable, and when he makes mistakes, he makes them very, very well. I was not sure whether to laugh, cry, or roll my eyes at times. Some of the jokes were too bad to believe, but they are only a minor annoyance. The music in the trailer was very, VERY catchy. Unfortunately, that is not true in the movie. A great song was chosen for the ending sequence, but then the music becomes completely forgettable (and to be fair, the music was excellent as it was). All in all, this film is a pleasant surprise that will not get you off your chair very fast. I certainly enjoyed it more than I could have hoped. ******************** ** My first ********** ***** "The Nightmare Before Christmas" is the one that all kids are asking about. It is a great Christmas movie that, on the other hand, leaves you with an intense desire to jump from your bed and dance with glee, until it's over. "The Thing from Beyond Space" is just that. It takes you along with the alien invaders from the future to the far future, where we meet the aliens in a small town, and then get a brief glimpse of them. The ending of the movie was a huge shock, and I never thought I would feel so unsettled in the face of a good horror film. "Star Wars", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and "The Exorcist" are just a few of the great classics that

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I don't think the film is a bad movie, it's just a great one!" I thought that this film had a great plotline and was well written. But what really made this film stand out for me was it's use of film in a way that is new and different. The story is simple: a poor black man (Wesley Snipes), is forced to work the land, where he meets a woman, a white woman (Charlize Theron). I think that the only reason that this didn't have a longer run time is because there was no room for dialogue in the film. This film is written in third person, and is told from the perspective of the man, Wesley, who can't speak and is constantly annoyed by the man (Snipes) who is there to help him and take care of him (Snicks). Wesley's only job is to keep the land quiet and make sure that his "wife" (Theron) doesn't do any bad things to the land. As the film progresses, they do eventually get together. In a good way of course, I don't mean sex here, but they eventually fall in love. I liked it that they fall in together because it makes the film more realistic, they don't just fall in because they hate each other. This helps them become more closer and helps Wesley to overcome his negative attitude toward Snipes. They work together but don't become friends (I would say they don to like each other but they don´t). There is not much violence but a lot of fighting as they try to protect the land from the evil that lurks in it. The movie did well to make a film that is simple yet it has great writing and acting.

They were both so into it, but I couldn't get over how weird it was. It was very strange and creepy with some really creepy clown moments. This is great for a night at the theatre, or a midnight movie. It has a strange plot involving a man that has a wife with a giant brain, and a bunch of other crazy things happening. I don't usually watch horror movies because I don' think they are very good, but this was so much fun and creepy that I will definitely be watching more.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â You can't go wrong with either:Â The Best Part is the ending and the end credits that feature  the voices of John and Mary from  the old cartoons and they say,  "That's right, kids. The good is the best, and nothing else matters!" It makes me smile when they say this. A great Christmas movie for the family. Â Â What does this film have to do with Star Trek? Â Star Trek III was an attempt at recreating a much loved but much short lived franchise.  The first film, VOY: "Unimatrix Zero, Part I" was a very entertaining film (though I don't believe it was an easy sell) and in this sequel we get what could only be described as the first Star Trek fan film.    What is the point of this movie:  The point is just to tell a story.  In this film we follow a group of kids that make up the crew of a space ship.  As we know all too well, the kids in the movies seem to have a very low tolerance for the problems of the crew.  There are lots of great lines and jokes, and at times the film is very amusing.  I can say that it does not have quite the heart of a Star Trek film but that is probably because it is the very first Star Wars fan film (there was an original Star Wars Fan Film about twenty years ago).  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a modern Star Trek movie but you may find that it is a lot of fun.  At times it does remind us of the old Star Trek  television series, and it has that wonderful feel of those shows. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun movie about one lonely guy whose life goes terribly wrong. It is not really a bad movie since the guy himself seems to be an introvert (like me at his age). He has been working hard for a job for years and finally makes it but the job pays too well and has a pretty bad boss. He starts dating the woman who was his childhood friend who he didn't see in years. She is sweet and funny but is very demanding to her man. The rest of the movie is pretty average although the acting is quite good. There are also scenes which are quite funny. The guy is not very interesting. He is always working with the bad boss while his wife is always in another country. He tries to get rid of his old friends but he doesn't succeed (they all end up getting drunk in a tavern together). And one of the most stupid scenes was when the movie was about his old girlfriend. I must warn you that the movie has some language. You can see some swear words and sexual situations but they are quite tame.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I love this film. A couple of things I wish I had done different.  "Bobby is going to have a baby sometime in the next 10 years". I didn't notice this until the end but how do you find out? If Bobby is still around in 10 years, who would have been his wife? Who is his mother?  Why is it so hard to take a picture when the actor is talking? This film needs a camera angle changed. When the camera is in the back of the truck he has a great view but the first time the camera gets close to him it's like looking at a tree with a camera. The second shot is the same. The third shot has him turning around but the camera angle is not the same because Bobby and the camera are looking at the same spot. The first shot in front of him is not a good look at the character. I feel like I am missing something. I hope this was just a rough cut and that there are other scenes that are just as bad and better with the final cut.   The rest of the crew are great except the one who goes and sits by the TV. Bobby was right, a little background music would have done this film a lot better.     Also, I don't care that the whole film was shot on a minibus. The editing is great and the action is nice.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie, but if it was made a few hundred years ago it would have been much more depressing!  My favourite character was a witch named Nellie, who I think is the only witch I'd take to a battle like this in this day and age.  A lot of people are saying this is a classic horror movie, and I guess it is, it was a classic when it was first released, but I find the remake to have some bad effects.   It's not that the movie is bad, it's that the remake has more problems.  It looks so cheesy in places it makes my stomach roll.  The lighting in the old movie is so good, and when I think about the horrible scenes they did to that lighting I feel cheated.  In the remake the lighting is too bright and it looks kind of dirty and old, the whole effect is a cheap effort at comedy, and it lacks the original movie's great scares.  My rating: 2.5 out of 5 stars The remake is really bad though, not so much that it is bad but it just doesn't get a good laugh out of it.  The movie is on Youtube, here is the trailer:
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It may be a bad movie at it is not a great one, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The film is set in a futuristic world where the humans are a very powerful race and the robots are little more than pets. A female robot, called the Red Queen (who could have been played by the great Tippi Hedren) is sent to an outpost to meet the Humans. There, she meets a small little robot named Catey, who wants to know her origins. The two of them quickly form a relationship (at first it is quite a romantic one), before they accidentally wake up the man responsible for keeping the humans in stasis (it is revealed later that he has already gone mad, so she doesn't seem to be responsible for his madness), and they decide to break the cycle. The film is quite interesting with good acting (although it is an action film) and some pretty good sci-fi as well as some funny one-liners. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a classic, but it's so well made that it's still fresh.  There's a lot of love and affection between the heroes.  There are plenty of good jokes that keep the film going.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We are in for a great ride here, even though a lot of the fun is restricted to the background of a young man who has been thrown to the wolves.  It is a simple plot that is not complicated but is fun to watch, but in a good way. _______________________________________________ I was so eager to see this.    I have seen a ton of films from his other films.  I had the pleasure of seeing his first movie, "Flamenco", the next is "Don Juan", the last "Donnie Darko" and I was not disappointed.  He does not pull punches.  His first two movies were pure fun and I loved the music.  The second movie was a little too close to the previous.  But "The Magnificent Seven" has some good moments and it is definitely a film I would recommend to fans of westerns.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I don't think there will ever be a more terrifying movie like The Shining. I remember going to the theater when I was a kid and watching the movie in which Jack Torrance, played by Dustin Hoffman, has an intense vision of his sister Wendy as a little girl. As I recall, it was a fairly well done movie, although not great, but certainly not the film's weakest scene. The Shining has since been adapted into a number of other TV show's and novels and was used as a poster for the horror movie franchise "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." There are two other films by Stanley Kubrick that were made in 1979 but not made into any great films. The first is called "The Killing Moon." It was a black comedy about a mother and daughter that is attacked by a man dressed as a woman that can do anything to them at a party. The killing moon is a very slow movie and not much happened in it. It was however, a funny movie and it was certainly not what I wanted to see when I saw The Shining the day it was released. The second film is called The Shining: The Official Director's Cut (1980). It is basically a new version of The Shining with a few new things added and it takes place during the summer in 1977. The movie is much better than the director's cut. It's a much better movie than the original movie that was released in 1980.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best of the best in all of science fiction/horror/action movies. I could give this more than five stars but I think the rating would be too low.  It is the second installment in a two-part mini-series, the first being The Sentinel, which has not received a great deal of love in the years following its release. It is certainly not a perfect movie, or even an outstanding one (at least not in the ways that you would expect). The story takes place on a planet with a very hostile environment which has been invaded by a fleet of alien ships. One of the ships has a young woman on board and a crew that is composed mostly of men with no women of their own. They must take the ship to their base and find her to help her escape from the enemy.    A lot of people consider this as the second half of a trilogy, and perhaps so, but I would not count it as such. The first half is a decent entry into the genre, although it does tend to become repetitive.  The movie has been released on VHS, which is an interesting fact when we think about it (but I wouldn't watch it on a regular DVD).  There are a good number of special effects, which you will notice from the first couple of minutes until the movie is over.    A fun movie for all ages, with a lot of humor and fun action. A great way to spend an afternoon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   . What are we watching this time? The movie is a simple and pretty straightforward crime story about a man who kills his step-son to cover up the fact that he had sex with his daughter's lover. There is no more than that. And yet there is more than enough to make this a fascinating, suspenseful movie. It's about what happens to a detective who works to solve the crimes. This means that he is constantly having to face new and different problems, and the same old ones, as he tries to solve all the cases, especially those involving strange women and girls who want to commit suicide. His life is a series of misfortunes and tragedies, and no one knows what really happened to him in life, although he tries hard to do the right thing. He is very loyal to his wife and family, although the people around him have their own flaws. But what makes him more interesting is the fact the he works alone in the office and often has to deal with a number of women who are looking to commit a suicide. I found him to be the kind of a man you can like a little bit, but still don't like because he often makes the wrong decision, and is very cruel to some of the girls he tries too. I find him to still be the only male detective in the movie, so he is a bit too typical. But it's still an entertaining movie.

This movie will keep you amused, and will also keep you on your toes. I really liked this movie!! The story was not original, but it was well told. I love the actors, and the characters were real to life! If you have ever wanted to have a movie about a group of characters who are in a plane that is about to be destroyed in the sky by a giant meteor, then this movie is for you! One of the best films of last year! A great movie!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts off as a simple one-horse-racing movie set up for a quick race: a couple of guys compete at a time when everybody was sick from the winter and there was a lot of snow (for a winter) at the track. A couple of people got hurt during the race. It's one of those films, where the ending is very simple but what it brings to the table is great: a great action scene. A good example of when a film should show you that nothing is impossible and that everything is possible. A must see for any sports fan.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen this movie a dozen times but I still don't know who was the most insane person in the movie, the "master of the universe" or the mad scientist, Dr. Frankenstein.    The movie was made in 1936 by a guy that didn't like making a horror movie like his other films.  He thought it would be too boring, he wanted to make a big old action thriller like The Devil's Rejects or The Man Without a Face or something that had a chance of making money. So he hired a group of men to research the perfect monster which he called "The Abominable Snowman". The group would have the job of doing experiments on animals to create a monster with a brain like a horse, but it would always break free.  After several months of searching, they come upon a house where a girl was going to live.  The girl was called Jane, the monster is a man called Frankenstein, a little boy is the monster's wife and another boy is their child. Frankenstein is obsessed with his creation, even putting an empty jar into a little girl's room and talking about her. It is almost as though he's living a life with him and Jane for some odd reason. As you can tell from the title, this movie is about Frankenstein trying to get revenge on the man who killed him. The rest of the movie is all about him having Frankenstein create more monsters and making Jane's life more miserable than before. The film is well shot, the gore is very well done but it's the crazy plot, the characters that I find so interesting. It's a very dark film, but one that I hope people enjoy. I can't imagine a better way of ending a film than seeing the creature come alive and kill the people it was to live with. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was the best movie I have seen this year! We have all these horrible movies these days. The worst of them is the movie "Saw VI". I didn't know it was going to be that bad. I would have rather not seen Saw than have seen Saw VI. It is so bad it's hilarious. One of the actors, who is supposed to be a bad guy and a bad man, says to the police "Let's see, I'll get that guy and I'll stick him here". The police tell him he is insane and he says "I'm not crazy, you're a very bad man". I don't even know where to start... The writing is really bad. There is not one good joke in there at all, we will go on just talking about it. The ending was so lame I was almost disappointed. I was sure the movie would end in a more believable way. I'm glad I didn t and I didn't want to watch Saw VI to see Saw VI again... I don't even know what to say about it... It was really bad and I don t understand how they can get away with it in America. I guess the budget they have has to be low because they can not afford to use more actors or make it more realistic. The acting is also so bad that it's hard to believe it is a movie. Saw is a good director but he couldn't get Saw VI right. I don' t recommend it at all... It wasn't really a very good movie...The movie has too many bad jokes and not enough good jokes. It has bad dialogue and is very boring. It's very hard to imagine how the movie was written. I really feel bad for the actors who had to do a movie like this, especially the poor actors who didn't get a whole lot of parts and had to play almost all the characters they were in. I like to imagine that the directors thought their film was something like The Exorcist, but it's very different and almost a parody. I just wish the director would have done something different and changed the story a little bit to better match the movie. I think it's so boring.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is absolutely fantastic, a perfect mix between a good and a bad movie: a film that is more like a short documentary than a full-length movie: more like film of a single person and a single place: I think this film is the best piece of work from David Lynch since Lost Highway and the reason why I chose him as my favourite director. The ending has something to say about how the viewer should live his life (what should we do to make this world more beautiful?) but the movie also has something else to say too: about what it is like to be a man. The music is very well done: and the ending is very powerful: so I hope that Lynch will release more movies like this one (the ending of Lost Highway was the most famous movie ending in history!).
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is in the first half of the movie is quite good, as long as you don't watch it too late in the evening you will enjoy the movie. I was not too good at all with the English so I can only understand the movie in Dutch. The movie was very good and was a good story with a good plot and a good acting performance from the cast. There was a lot of violence in the movie, so don't expect a kid's movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am not an expert at writing reviews and this was not a bad movie. But it isn't great, that's for sure.  It's a movie about a young girl who falls in love with a famous playboy, she ends up in a terrible accident and that is that.  There are few things I liked about this movie, firstly that it was about a little girl falling in love, that was very cute and I liked how well the parents played their role in that. I liked the relationship between the parents and their children, I thought they were nice and I really liked the mother. There wasn't a lot of action in this movie but the plot was alright. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think it would be easier to talk about how the movie is written and directed than to just give a good review about it.   The plot is fairly straight forward.  You have a young boy, who is a member of the "Crazy Dogs" motorcycle gang.  However, he is also a really good kid and a really great friend.  He gets a gift from his mother which turns out to be a secret room in the house and all the members of the gang have to get in and hide.  The story seems to be centered around the gang and the events that they happen to happen to them, but there is more going on behind the scenes too.  It is all rather dramatic and funny as they try to outsmart each other and all of them try to make a name for themselves.  I really liked this movie.  There is a good balance between being really serious and hilarious which kept the movie interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sidney Lumet's "The Ten Commandments" is a beautiful example of silent Hollywood filmmaking; a masterpiece of craft. A classic of black and white film, which I haven't seen since seeing it as a small child. The performances are all terrific, but especially the lead, Cecil B. DeMille. One of those actors who has transcended the mere role he played. 3 out of 4 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As always, the visuals are a feast for the eyes. In this case it's the lushly detailed backdrops which take you to a tropical paradise with palm trees, palm trees. There's also a variety of flora and fauna that can be seen throughout this beautiful film. One such example is the large sea turtle which can be found swimming alongside a beach.   The music is also quite lovely. It's not a very strong soundtrack but there's nothing bad in it.  -Loss of control over my senses is a bad thing. I have to leave in a state of shock from how good this movie is. I can't believe that it really happened. The sound is also great. I really recommend this to everyone who loves tropical movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The World's Greatest Super Heroes"  is a story of three teenagers, who come into their own in the comic world of "Superman". This is a fun little family movie. With a fun premise, and a strong lead performance from the three leads of "Chase" (Richard Pryor), "Thing" (Bruce Willis) and "The Joke" (James Woods)  Superman is a funny, entertaining and a lot of fun to watch.  "The world's greatest super hero"  Watching these heroes in action, it has a little "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" feeling. The heroes are able to work together to make a bad situation good, which makes the movie a lot better than it is given credit for. The only slight complaint I have is that the script could have used a lot more jokes than it does.  "Superman"  If there is one thing that Superman does well, it's the ability to work with other people. He is able to learn from those around him, and has a lot to teach his three teenagers.    Superman  has not always been a friendly character; there are times where you wish he would not take his powers seriously, and there are a lot that make him seem like a bully.  But like a lot if good superheroes, he just wants to get on with the job he was created for, so why not have a good time doing it?   Watch the movie here:
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent film about the aftermath of the first world war.  The protagonist is a little boy who finds a body, a body covered in blood, with a piece of chalk, and an object under it.   When this is discovered he discovers that one of the people who was killed had a handkerchief in his pocket with the initials 'J'.    He is arrested by the police.  There is a police inspector, who is known to have a thing for children, named 'Polly'  who is a very sympathetic character.  He takes the boy into her care. After the little boy spends a month with her, he tells her he knows the name of the person who was murdered. They set off to find the person, and Polly helps out. The boy is captured, and tortured.  Polly eventually discovers it is a man who has been killed and then'reclaimed'.  There are other events going on too, some involving the local army, with its head officer being a bit of a bully.  And there are other things too, like the fact that there is some very interesting technology in the neighbourhood. This is a film you need to see at least once, and it would be an excellent way of watching history that never gets told in English films.

The movie itself is a fantasy, of course, and the character development is solid, but if you are a fan of such movies, you will find this film very entertaining. If you are looking for a dark fantasy, there's lots of it. If, however, this is your first "black and white" movie, you won't be disappointed. Don't be confused, though. This is an entertaining and enjoyable movie that is much loved by viewers. Highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~ This is a movie about a guy who is in love with a girl. It is a good love story. ~~~~~~~~~ The movie starts in the summer in Japan. There is a small town there called Tsurumaru. It had been rebuilt since WWII. It has a very old abandoned movie house at its center. In this movie house are two girls. These girls are not really related to each other. One girl, named Tadao, who is 20 years old, has a crush on the other girl, called Mariko. Tadaoh is a big clumsy guy with a big fat body. The girl that he loves, Mariko is just a small, frail girl. They both fall in love. The main character, Tadaos friend who is his brother Takaki, who was not with the war, helps him in his love. Takaki is not exactly an important person in the story. In the beginning, the movie gives a very short story of his life. This small story does not really add anything to the movie. He is just there in his room all day. It does not add a lot to the story, which is good because that is what a movie needs to be good. In reality the movie is very well made. There are a lot of actors in this movie. It also has great animation. It was actually good to watch the movie and see how everything is done. The story is easy to understand and easy to follow. The animation was very nice. The only thing that did not feel true is that the girl that was in the hospital, is not a real person. They make a mistake in the ending of the movie because of this. ~~~~~ The characters are very well done. They all have a certain way to them. They are not just just the average good looking guys. Some are very bad. Some of them are just bad characters. They do not need to be the average. They have flaws but it is because they want to make us laugh at them. There was a scene in the movie, in a bar, where the characters were talking. One of them said something that the audience should not laugh. It wasn't funny. One should not say something that we should laugh at. The next thing is that a lot in the anime has been taken out. There were also a lot more scenes like this movie has taken out of the story and put into a different anime. I think the movie has a lot
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a fantastic performance by Kevin Bacon. The movie is fun in a different sort of way from the "Titanic"-type stories with a few extra special touches.  My wife went with a co-worker to a small independent film festival in San Francisco and she brought me with her.   This is a fun action thriller with lots of action, sex and romance. I did not see any of the special effects in this movie, so I don't know about the special effect of this movie.  I think they should really make a special effect out of this, but the actors were really great. They did a good job in the movie and the special performances of the people did the movie a big favor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best western ever made.   I'm an old man and it's been a long time since I've seen a western. I've watched many westerns on television over the years, but this is a much better movie. It's a film made in the 1930s, and it is just wonderful. The director, John Sturges, was a very talented actor himself, but it was Charles Bronson who made this movie. Bronson was really a great actor, he was a great cowboy and he made this famous role for himself. His westerns are great, and this is no exception. Bronsons portrayal is perfect. He was always a good shot, and that is what you will find in this movie... a pretty good one. The movie was shot in Los Angeles, but Sturges decided that his movie was better in Montana where the scenery is much nicer. The story of Bronson and his daughter is just perfect. They live out in the desert with a herd of bighorn sheep and they try to make a living by making a good living for the sheep. The only problem is that they are always chased away from their own sheep and never get paid. Brummer's wife is dying of cancer, and he and his son are the only hope for the family. The son has a very big heart and gives up his life to save his family from the wolves. So you can really understand the kind of man he is. The wolf who killed his mother was a bad guy, and Bronson is the only guy that could stop him. There is a long scene that shows us the wolves from the front and their attack by Bronson. But it gets even better! The wolves get a little excited at first, and then they start to fear Bronson, because he doesn't fight back at all. He just gets up and starts running away from the attack and just runs through the mountains and never comes back. Well, that is one way to handle a wolf, to just stay away from them and never come back. I always thought that that wolf was a real killer, but Bronson knew how to get along with them, so it worked out. But the real good parts of the movie are Bronson's character and the sheep, because the movie had a lot of heart, and I never had such a good time watching a movie. Sturges was a brilliant director, and you can tell that he didn't want to make anything that had a

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first movie, and I had no idea where to start. I watched the trailer and thought it was about a girl who falls in love with a vampire when she falls asleep, and a few weeks later he's found by some cops on the road. No vampires or zombies. That's right, this movie is all about police work, or in the case of the case that is about finding a guy who killed a cop and is about to kill someone else. So the cop gets the vampire to promise to return from the dead and the story turns out to be about police corruption and a cop who is almost a murderer. So there you have it, a cop, a woman, a vampire. This is a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      It may sound funny now, but when I first saw this movie back in 1987 I was actually a bit put off by its silly plot and the very odd acting (though it is quite funny in spots) because the characters seemed more than a bit strange, and the plot itself was quite convoluted. However, I've seen better things than this (and quite a few other movies!) and I've come to realise that it is not such a bad movie after all.     In a way it is like a cross between The Little Rascals and The Flintstones: a simple little village filled with the characters and their children, all working together to make it through the day; and it has the added bonus of being set in what is probably the prettiest village in the world; with a lovely, warm, sunny setting (although I found it was rather chilly after a while as it got hotter throughout the day) in what must be the most idyllic setting I've ever encountered. The film is very short: it consists of a series of animated sketches set in the town, some scenes of the characters in action, and then, a very brief scene showing the family sitting about in the garden.   I have never seen a more charming and charming little film; it's really quite brilliant.  This is a must see in any family's collection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot starts out slow, with our protagonist being caught in a robbery attempt at a bar (we see some interesting things about a police officer, some bad guys and a good old fashioned murder case that comes to a messy end).   As you watch the movie you slowly realize the movie is an interesting examination of human nature and how we all can get involved with shady characters.   We start off with the police trying to get the person that was with the victim of the crime into custody.  When they do they are told that they should let the victim die rather than bring him back to life.  I loved this line by the police in the movie: The truth is sometimes the most ugly of all.    You may not want to know about the man who murdered a young girl. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the most underrated movies of all times.  A fantastic story about a scientist that goes for the "natural" thing in the world, and of course gets killed by his own invention. This movie is amazing, because it was a perfect movie for me and my childhood years.   This movie will be one of the movies you will not forget about. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pretty amazing. It's a great tribute to the first movie that is a true masterpiece. I enjoyed every minute of this movie. If there is one movie in my life that changed my mind about music. And if there are two I have seen. One of the best movies ever made. I highly recommend this movie, you won't regret this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It took me a while to get into this movie. I thought it would be a rehash of the original 'Killer Klowns from Outer Space'. Not so much. This movie is a very different take on the "Klown" phenomenon. In the movie they are aliens who want to start a new civilization on Earth. However, they first try to start one in Canada. Unfortunately, this is not a great experience. The aliens try to have fun on Earth and get violent with the locals. As we learn from the alien leader we have to stop them before they make too much havoc. It is hard to put this movie in a box with other "Klovern" type movies. It really reminds of another movie I have seen called "Honey" or the "Bubblehead from OuterSpace". It is kind of hard to make a fun and exciting movie like this one. However there is a real danger and it is the fact that the alien are trying to destroy the human race. And unfortunately for them that is what they are in for.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can't describe how great this movie is. I don't know if I'm too old for this kind of thing, but I just couldn't help myself. The acting and directing were fantastic (again, a little too overacted for my taste, but there's a certain charm to that), the music was beautiful, and the characters were wonderful. What's not to love? This was a wonderful movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There has to be a downside, right?  You gotta get in trouble.  That was the case with this film, and it's funny how a film set in the future can be this boring.  And that's why it's a little disappointing to see that it ends on a negative note.  I expected more from this movie, because it didn't disappoint.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's really a movie about the time in which people who would never fight, who would only play chess or listen to jazz, in a real country of real people, the movie is about an Irishman who in 1794 is in a war against France, and a Frenchman who has become an aristocrat, and one day he's about to be sent to war against a powerful country, and it seems that there's a way out to this world of endless battle: A man who has a passion for chess, and who could not play chess in war is going to make a game in which every chessman plays against every chessboard. He wants his love and his life, and also to be able to play a game against God, he has to play against the king of France, who's a very strong player, and the king has to make sacrifices so that the French are losing. And it's a battle. There's a lot of war in this movie, this man has the love of a woman, and he wants to be a good chess player, he does a lot, he becomes a famous player, but he is a very stupid man, he can not see, he doesn't understand, and therefore this movie is a little bit of a satire about chess. And even though I was not that crazy about the movie, I enjoyed the satire, even though it's not the best movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favourite of the new season of Sherlock is this. I have not liked any of the previous three, but this one is excellent. As usual, it is a mystery story with Sherlock and Irene trying to solve the mystery while their colleagues are trying to stop them.  It is rather cleverly set up, but it is still very silly.    I found Sherlock trying to think of a name for his new dog, Mr Pong, before he knew that it was just a toy.   The music by Richard Wright is excellent, but I never quite understood what it meant by "sounds like a dog."  It's a very silly and silly movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â What is the appeal of "The Wizard of Oz"? Â Because it Â is a perfect example of the Â dark Â arts of exploitation.

One of the first films released in New York under the new wave  films of the 1940's,    " The Wizard of  Oz  was written by   Harold Lloyd Â and  directed by  Maurice Ravel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a very fun movie. Not that it's bad, but it's not amazing. It would definitely have been better with more humor and action. The music, while still generic, wasn't that bad. If you like old 80's cartoons and don't know why you don't own this, I'd say watch it. It's a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good horror movie. It has been described as "Tucker's World".  I think I should start with an introduction.  My wife, Laura, gave this movie a chance a few weeks ago, on an impulse.  I would have preferred it a bit more suspenseful, but it would have meant I missed out on the killer, but I did.    The film has a fairly conventional plot. A college professor, named Charles Tucker (Tucker) takes a class and is introduced to the occult.  He does not take this class very seriously. He becomes intrigued and becomes obsessed with what he sees.  Tucker does a lot of weird things in his class.  One day he has a student (Kara) disappear.  What makes this story interesting is that we also have a high school teacher, called Tom (Gage). Tom is the kind of teacher that is always on the top of his students.  Tom also is a big goofball.  It seems that Tucker is very obsessed with Tom.  The students have no idea.  All they see is Tucker playing games all day.  This is not the case of Tucker being an ordinary college professor.  Charles Tucker is a sorcerer.  As the story progresses Tucker is seen to be able to summon various demons (and occasionally do some magic). The demons are more or less benign, so to speak.  However, when the demon "Witch of Winter", appears Tucker makes up a story about how it kills people because it can see the soul of the people it kills.  (I don't know how true that is.) Tom becomes obsessed that Tucker has lost a student and is trying to find it.  And the students have been doing an awful lot of research on "Witches" too.  There is a nice, simple, suspenseful plot.  After Tucker does his thing, the student Tom has lost shows up and Tucker disappears.  For about 30 minutes.  When Tucker reappears again, he does not seem to have anything left to lose.  But Tucker does have a lot at stake.  Some of the action takes place at a beach.  We know that Tucker wants to do a lot in this movie.  In the last act Tucker takes his own life.  Why do people do all this work? Why do the girls put themselves through this?  And how is it that one girl survives?   Why do
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most amazing movie ever!  This is one of the most realistic, the most beautiful, it is not your ordinary movie! This movie give us a story about a child with a very bad heart who have to find a way to find happiness in his new life where everything is different and he has to learn how to live in a world where everything has to be done very carefully. The whole movie is very beautiful, I just hope it will one day be made into a television show or a movie (like the other great movies by Spielberg and Scorsese) 1.                  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial       (1982) I really enjoyed this movie but it was really hard to watch. It has the same feeling as The Goonies where you can feel like your stuck inside the movie.  It has a great soundtrack, very well made, and the acting is excellent. The story is quite simple, you just follow these two aliens and you will find out that they just don't know what they are doing, everything is crazy and sometimes you just have to watch out for that red dot coming from the ground. And it just goes on and on.  The thing is that it could be a great movie, but it is too bad, and too hard to understand. 2.          The Goon (1982 ) The movie The Goons made me laugh so hard I was crying. It is a story with a few characters and a nice story, it's a silly movie with a good amount of humor. The voice acting is so good that I don't even care about the acting when I watch a movie. The jokes are funny and every single scene is funny and funny. The songs are great and I loved every single one of them, and it has a strong message too, you will laugh and cry and love a bunch of people who don't mean to hurt you.   It also has a very nice ending but like I said, it didn't work very well.  I hope I gave you some idea of what movies you should watch and which ones you shouldn't. And please try to be a little more interesting than I was, and please like, comment and share this.  -A

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The third installment in the Troma  film series has a fantastic cast. Michael Murphy is excellent as the film's hero, the great white shark (Sharknado 2 is also a Troma classic). Bill Paxton is also fantastic as a shark expert who is very good at catching fish but seems to be pretty bad at catching people. His partner in crime is a very funny John Belushi who doesn't even show up during the actual shark attack. The only things this movie gets wrong are the terrible soundtrack and some awful special effects. But if there's one thing Troma has proven it's that they have a very good sense of humor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie, so much that I gave it 4 stars.  One of the best films of the summer - and one of the only movies this summer to pass my "stupid movie" test. This film is a perfect mix of funny and sad.    There is a young boy who has a cat named "Tina", that is very fond of him. Tina is the only one that can bring him happiness. On her birthday, the boy is supposed to give her a present. He brings his mother's old piano. He finds it in a closet, so he goes in to pick it up. However, there are two people inside it: the girl is there, and the cat is missing! It's the girl's birthday, and she needs a present for the boy... he was supposed to take her piano to a movie, but there's no piano. Tina just has to get it from inside.   The film starts off so slow. We don't really get to see the story unfold for a few minutes. We just know that Tina has taken the piano, which is the most common theme for children of that era: they just know where to find it, and they love it. That's enough to get us all in the mood of happiness, which was pretty much accomplished by the end of the movie.   and then it gets very funny. The boy has gotten very bored with his mother, and has fallen in love with his sister-in-law, who is very beautiful and innocent. Tina's father is a bad man: he likes to beat up his sons whenever they are naughty. It's up to Tina to stop him, because she is the oldest.  , of course, that takes us from happy-go-lucky to very sad.   a young girl, who loves her brother so much, but is also very stupid. We've heard of the cat before, but this is the first time we really understand what she wants. And we see why.  and then... The boy, and his mother: the story of the girl and the father is the same as we've seen before. Tina gets her gift, but then the parents make her play with the piano for a bit while they talk to the girl. After about 10 minutes, Tina starts feeling sorry for the piano. She tells the boy to give it back to her. The father replies with a sad face: "no, Tina won't allow you

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are some pretty decent performances from the cast. I am surprised the writers didn't try to do something with the character of Tom; I found him to be a bit too perfect, and a little bland. I guess maybe he will get some sort of character arc in the second part, but I think at the moment he is more a 'I am the master of this dungeon' sort of guy. And for all the time that I spent staring at him it is very odd that he didn't come with a more interesting story.  But whatever, as a bit of a mindless fun movie this is a fine place to spend a few hours. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'd forgotten about this one until I stumbled across a review by a "young" guy who calls himself a "filmmaker" who calls it a "fun" story about a "simple" family who "saved" a drowning boy. As I read his review and looked for things to complain about, I found nothing but a pretty average movie.   He writes: "Not a particularly complex film, but that is mostly irrelevant in today's world... It is, however, pretty fun. It is set in a simple house where a young boy finds a toy shark in the pool, and decides to play with it, only to find that he can swim... He lives with his parents and older sister, but the family life gets a bit more complicated when a teenage girl comes from town to visit and get a look at the house, where a younger boy has been drowned and left to die."   OK. The movie is about a little boy who finds a shark in his pool who is clearly his friend and wants to play together. But the shark is actually a ghost who has been haunting the boy since he drowned in the swimming pool, as the ghost can't leave the living room or else he will "come out" and kill the boy. The shark is just a toy, but it helps the boy to swim. But when the shark "comes out," the boy will die. But this is only a nightmare that will pass, because the little boy, having found a friend and the one who can bring him back to life is too late.   with "not a particularly complicated film" and nothing to complain, I suppose that this movie isn't going to make anyone cry, and it's not about a big problem or a tragedy or a character who is good or evil. It's a fun little movie. I guess if you are a kid then it's a good little adventure movie. But I would never want to see a movie like this when I am an adult. It doesn't go where a movie usually goes, and as a young "filmpaper" I was never a big shark fan.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was totally excited to see this movie as this is the sequel to "The Man from Nowhere" which is one of my favourite films ever and it was always a hit among my friends.   This movie was a very good story and not as good as the first but still a good watch.    It really did keep you interested in seeing what would happen to the characters.  While   this is a children's movie it didn't fall into the horror genre and instead tried to give an interesting story with lots of characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- A simple story about two boys and the little girl they both love. The story is simple and the boy has a crush on the girl. When they get lost in a deserted place the boy notices the girl is crying and tries to comfort her. But he is very bad in this field. In fact, he is the worst human being I have ever seen. The next thing he does is to try and eat the girl by putting her under some weird circumstance. When the kid gets hungry he does not stop to think that if he goes to the toilet in the middle of the story he would get wet and he would have to get wet in front of the girl he is afraid of. And the next thing you know the boy is walking in his underwear and the girl has to go with a man to get to the bathroom. The girl runs from a man. They get to a large building and the man turns around. And when the kid is about to put the girl under the strange circumstances the man takes a knife and kills the girl in front the child he is so bad it was so bad he killed a little child. It is a simple story which makes you cry from its simplicity. I would love a version with more violence, as the little boy is the hero of the movie and is very good at fighting. The only problem is the ending when they start to talk the boy asks if the girl died. But the girl doesn't answer, which makes me very sad. If you want to see an interesting movie for a child then you should watch this. Only watch at a time when you are ready to laugh and cry at the same time. -------------------------- 2.5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really wish that I would have seen this film before I died because I was so intrigued. The movie has so many great aspects to it that I honestly couldn't figure out what it was about at the beginning. I figured out what the movie was about pretty quickly but then the movie took off to somewhere different and then I realized what the difference was. I have never seen a movie that has this sort of feel to it. I was really intrigued by all the different aspects of the movie. The best way to describe it would be like a movie version of the original story from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. It has a very dark plot that has many secrets and murders.    It is definitely worth watching if you don't have a lot of time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Beneath the Mask" is a fun adventure/fantasy/comedy-horror film that will make your day a little more unique.  I'm a fan of "Mulan" and this film was very reminiscent of "My Neighbor Totoro."  It also has some wonderful sound effects and musical score that really adds to the film.  It's fun!    "Beneaths the Mask," is a great adventure film that has a few great special effects and a great score.  It was my first movie and I was very entertained.   This movie was released in 1992 and I have not seen another copy of the film since.  What a fun movie!  This one will bring a smile to your face and a little bit of laughter to your day!

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The film opens with a shot of an old lady and a small dog walking down a road. In the next scene, the old lady is at her home looking after a baby. The little boy, who is playing with a doll, walks over to a fire and it lights up brightly. "The light is shining," the old woman says, "I guess you don't see much of it anymore, do you?" A little girl with an arm cast over her eyes comes in through the window. "Daddy! Daddy!" The little girl starts crying and the old mother walks around the baby and sees she's crying, so she picks the little boy up in her arms and runs out. But then the little girl runs off and the little dog comes in and the poor mother walks right by and says, "I guess she doesn't like fire very much."   This is another example of how good a job director John McTiernan (who directed the earlier movie) did here. His films have always been very good in this area. I liked this film, it had a story that was pretty good, and the music, too, was good.   The film was shot on a real location, which was nice. The acting is very good, there was no cheesy lines in this film.

The best christmas ever.   the story is a simple enough tale about a young man who lives a simple life and is just trying to make a living.  As soon as you start watching this movie you realize how great the voice acting is...I love the way they do their impressions.

It's the only time I have ever laughed in a movie.   a film worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A little more than a movie (a good one, not the best I've seen, but a good one), but a great one. This was the first of a series called The Great Horror Movies that featured a number of films that had to do with the macabre, such as the infamous and very macabre Tales of the House on the Hill (the "House" itself was more than just a hill: it was a macabre place that had its own evil doings), the frightful Tales of a Dead Dream, The Horror of Sleep No. 5, and the great Gothic movie- the very macgurd Dracula.  This film is the first one in the series, and features several very great and famous actors.  And there are a few new names that play important parts in this movie, such is the case with the young Michael Caine and the young Bela Lugosi who play the role of Count Dracula.  And then, of course, there's Bela's wife Constance, and his son Karl.    I had watched this film many times already, and every time I saw it I was more in awe, I was a bit in tears, and I just could not wait to get out and see the movie again.  I was actually thinking it would happen years later.  Then, about 10 years ago, I heard the announcement by the BBC that they would be making a BBC documentary movie about the making of this film.  After I heard it I bought a copy, and since I had not seen the movie yet, I went along to see it, and to my surprise I was so much in awe that I just did not want to let it go.  Now it is finally out for me to see.  This film is not for the squeamish people.  It's not for people who think a film cannot be as bad as the movie itself, and it's not a movie for people to see their first horror movie.  The reason for this is the amount of blood that is shown and the fact that it is a truly macabre movie. It's a movie of blood and blood that we all want to see and some of us really want to go on seeing it as often as possible. The movie has a lot of things going for it, including a cast that is great and really brings out the dark and macabre in each of them.  And then you have the fact it is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie. Not in a bad way, just a little slow. It's about a young man who is in love with the daughter of a famous singer. Unfortunately she's a girl who is not of high standing, and has little ambition. So the story begins with the singer having her father's baby. The baby is supposed to be a girl, and her name is Lizzy, but a curse is on her which prevents her from ever being able to speak. However, while she can't speak she can speak by dancing (or more specifically, she can dance to music).  I find this story interesting because of this girl who can do both, and I do feel that when the story gets going the slow parts do get pretty interesting. I thought the ending was pretty great too.  This movie was directed by the director of "A River Runs Through It". I found myself liking this movie a lot. It has a pretty dark story about a beautiful but cruel person, and a nice happy ending to the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the movie? Don't think so. The movie is so slow and tedious that I don't even think it can stand up without an excellent screenplay. The cast is a great one (Rory Cochrane, Kate Vernon), the production of the movie is fine, but the music, the sound effects, and the camerawork are all so bad that you can hardly call it a movie. I do not want to hate it or call it trash, but you do not deserve this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's very unusual in this genre for a woman to be so strong and in charge of a man. In fact, she's supposed to be in charge and it doesn't seem like she's ready for this responsibility. There's a lot of running around in this movie, and the women are always fighting with each other. I thought that the director should've gone for a more romantic view. The movie is a remake of a French movie which had a remake a few years ago. It's a very beautiful film with a lovely sound and wonderful cinematography. A very great movie to watch!

I don't know about the rest of the world, but there are still plenty of books.  So you have these children, or young adults, who go into the Wizarding World where all these wonderful magical creatures live. They're like children again. They have fun and they play with these animals and all of their other friends.    Harry Potter is such a good story.  The people in this movie are all wonderful characters.  And the story has really good moments.  I'm a fan of Harry's best friend Fred (Bart) and his little sister Rose (Caitlin). They are so cute, and the movie keeps them in their home a little.  (Caitlyn and the other children in the movie,  by Susan George) You think you're in the magical world of Hogwarts, but then you don't get a ride on a broomstick.  It's not quite the Harry Potter you grew up with, but this movie has so many surprises!  And it's nice to see Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) again.  What I like best about the film is that Harry has a great relationship with his friends, the Weasley's.  You see the characters in your mind and when you finally see them on the screen you're glad they are the characters you always dreamed of!  A few of my favorite scenes are when Harry has the chance to take one more Quidditch practice and the twins are talking about something or other.  When they are looking at something they say "What?"  But Harry says that they didn't realize until they saw the film that they had never actually talked about that on their Quiddich team before.  But I love Harry and his family.  These children make me happy and I think we should all learn to care about the people we spend our lives with.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts off really well with some great action. This movie was awesome, I was laughing at how it was all done and how the characters were played out so well. There was a great mix of both comedy and action. I really liked how the movie turned into a battle of wills and who will get the best out of each other as there were times when the characters would try to do one thing and it would turn into something completely different and fun to watch.  A really good movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is not that unusual, not that different from most of the other stories about women trying to kill each other. This one is no exception. In a small Mexican town. There is a very handsome young man who is a good musician. He is married, and has a very beautiful little girl. On his way home from his gig, he meets a beautiful woman, she is the wife of a drug dealer and they fall in love. They are separated at the time, they come back together, and in a very short time, he and the girl have a baby and she marries the man, who makes a lot of money and makes her live in luxurious situations. They marry and have a child and that's about it. There are no real conflicts, and the story is about love and how it changes and what it's like to live with someone who is not the ideal husband for you. There's also a scene where the father is driving by and sees the child walking alone and a little girl, no older than 10, crying and walking on the sidewalk. That was the most touching scene I've ever seen, really touching. If you are not looking for a good story, this movie will not be for you, but I really thought I was watching a story with some substance. I just couldn't help laughing at the scenes with the mother (the woman) and her ex-husband in Mexico while they are still married, it was just so sad and weird.    Rating: 4 out of 5   I think if you're looking for something interesting and different, then I guess you'll love this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this film a lot, even though it does not come close to what I want from a superhero film. The film was about a father who is having a difficult time dealing with his son's superhero career and life in general. The father's life changes when he is able to get the super hero he wants to become to come to his house and help him. The son is more interested in the camera than in his father and does not want to see his father for awhile. But as time goes on the son learns to love the camera and his father. The ending is somewhat shocking and the film is very good. The character of the father is not what I would call a likable, so I think the action scenes were great fun to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Maze Runner" is a well-made and well-directed movie with a very well-paced plot. The movie looks good and is nicely shot, and the effects are well done.   "Rita is my hero," says the heroine Rita, and in the end of the movie, Rita seems to be just that - a real heroine.  The story centers on the hero, Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford), a police detective working on a murder case involving one of the most ruthless and mysterious criminals in Los Angeles (played with perfect performance by Benicio del Toro, who did a great job).   The protagonist, Deckard, is an android (or "robo") of a human but with many human like flaws.  He is a very good detective, but sometimes he makes mistakes, because humans are prone to mistakes and human frailties, like being gullible and not thinking too much.  Deckard's most important skill is that he must think about things, and this is what makes him a good investigator.  However, he must not let his emotions get in the way, because it is very dangerous and he will be captured as a dangerous enemy of the police.  It is the ultimate thriller, and I thought it was very well filmed and written by Justin Lin and Eli Roth.  The movie was very much in character; Deckard is a good detective who also has a certain personality defect and some human imperfections.  While he is a great detective, his flaws become even more apparent.  There is a scene at the beginning of the film where Deckard does a difficult task (the investigation of a murder) and after the completion of the work he is very tired, but he seems too tired to sleep.   This is a nice reflection on human frailty, which Deckard always has and which he must accept in order to become a great and capable hero, because he does not want to be a weak human being. This is a movie about character, and there is not a single boring scene in the film.  Although there is a lot of violence, violence is never too strong and the violence is not used as a way to make the story even more exciting, but to show the violence.  Sometimes it is necessary to show violence, and sometimes it is not necessary and the audience is better to be left to enjoy the movie and not worry about what kind of violence we are going to see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A wonderful movie that doesn't hold my attention for long, but you don't need a movie to do that.     An entertaining take on the idea of the film "The Shining"  is presented in an entertaining way by Peter Jackson, and although this is a re-make of the old movie, he and his wife Fran are the perfect cast and make this film a must watch if you've seen the original movie. I'd rate this as 2.5/5. This is not a bad movie, but it could have been more than it was, and there are a few things that don't quite make sense or at least aren't explained.  If you're looking for a movie that will entertain you without a mind numbing amount of information, or if you're a fan of the original "The King's Speech", "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" or anything by Stanley Kubrick or Jack Nicholson and you like a good story about a man's struggle with madness to escape the confines of the hospital, this is the one for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't remember the first time i saw this movie, but I was intrigued, and my friend suggested a film that was about a couple, and this seemed like a perfect opportunity to watch this beautiful film, and I knew I was in for an amazing and emotional movie... the couple's daughter is a little girl named Jessica, who loves to watch the old-school detective films, like Sherlock Holmes, and Hercule Poirot, and was curious about the detective herself. When she is about 8, she hears she has an aunt, Missy (and her niece is called Daisy), who is a professional detective (she has a big red bow around her neck). Jessica decides to try and become the young Missy's assistant, and starts to help her whenever she can. The problem is that Missy is a bit of a slob and is not a very good assistant. Jessica tries her best to help Missy, and tries to be nice to her, but she finds out that Miss y is a bad assistant, but tries her very best to be the best one. So she ends up helping Missy to solve cases, and of course getting into it. I was really surprised at this movie after seeing Sherlock Holmes and Heracles and a few other movies, that the detective genre can be a bit over-sexed, but not this one. I feel like I saw a real detective, which the movie does a beautiful job at portraying.  I do feel like Missy was supposed to be more of a "good sidekick" but she ends coming across as annoying for the most part, which is also a little odd, since I feel that a bad sidekick should at least come across as funny occasionally. But she doesn't quite work like that, and you end up wishing she was more like Jessica, to bring a little bit of humor and fun, or at least an "adult" sidekick. I guess her only real redeeming feature was that she was young, but in the middle of the movie she looks around like she's in her late-twenties.   The writing is good and it does a great job at bringing out the emotions of the couple, so that even when Missy does go off the deep end, it isn't too much. I really enjoyed watching this movie. This is a pretty good movie, and if you have the time, it is worth watching. It has a great atmosphere to it, it has

I also love the scenes where the characters had to do tricks.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this recently on The Black List and I really liked it. It's a film about a young girl who has been abandoned by her abusive father. The father in this film is very violent and sadistic and does all sorts of terrible things to his daughter. However, the girl decides to take revenge on her father by killing him. After the father has been killed, the daughter decides that she would like to live a normal life with a normal man. She goes to visit the man to ask him to adopt her and give her a family. When she meets him, she tells him that she has never been abused and that she doesn't want any of the pain she felt when the father abused her. He refuses to consider her and doesn't consider himself to be the mother figure she is asking for. Then, he rapes her in front of the camera as an act of revenge. It was awful, but the movie was fun and the director did a good job with it.  The music and the acting were very good as well.  10/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: t's hard to imagine a more powerful, affecting and ultimately beautiful story about a child. I was a child when I first saw "Duck Soup" in the theater when I was seven years old, and I remember that feeling of being transported back to the "saddest" period of my life when it was still a crime to be gay.  I thought it was very moving and very funny, and it made me feel so sad, but it made even greater joy in seeing how a man who had no hope for a future became an activist and started a movement that has turned our country into a paradise for LGBT kids all around the world.    I can't think of a more important story for any child to know about.  I recommend this movie to everyone who has a child that's gay, to find joy in the struggles and the triumphs.

And, in one scene:  "He's got a box. And when he opens his heart he opens the whole world. When he opens to love, all doors of sorrow and all doors through which the souls of those who've passed away have gone are thrown open."  I will always remember how great and honest and gentle it was to see a man who looked like me as a man of courage, the first of the big movie hero who was so different from his peers because he really cared and who believed that there is a place for us on this earth. If you're a Christian or a Christian-type who has had an experience with the Holy Spirit, or you know how it works, you know this man and he is there for you in all things. He didn't make this movie to make money off of it. I am sure that he did not do it in order to make a movie that would make a big splash. He did it because he believed in a place where a child can be brought to God. He does not look in the rearview mirror, he looks in the front and looks forward. He doesn't care what you think or what you don't. He will be there to help you when you fall. He is not looking for sympathy. He wants you to know that your loss does not have to be permanent.  This movie was a gift from God. The story was written by a great master in art and I am so grateful that it was. It is a masterpiece, but the way they pulled the story together and the quality and emotion in the film was so unique and wonderful that this is my favorite film ever.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic "graphic novel" by Charles Schulz in which a small boy named Bill, his dog, a dog named Dogberry and a cat named Catbug (all of whom are named for the color of their fur) play the part of a comic strip-like comedy and fantasy set in the 1930's. Each episode contains a short sequence (in this case, the classic "The Flying Dutchman" segment) in which characters from the comic strip come to life. They can be funny, frightening and even downright mean-spirited. The humor is not very sophisticated (not unlike that of an old-time radio show with only "funny" characters; the writing is simple), but it is nevertheless interesting. The plot also is well drawn and the characters are memorable. I liked them all and the "Graphic Novel" would certainly appeal to kids, particularly those who like the old time radio humor of the 1930s.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~ In my opinion, this is the greatest film about a dog in cinema history! ~~~~~~~~~~ You may not have seen it before, but you have probably seen it after. This classic movie is about a mutt named Doggett who, after being left to die in a cold cellar, awakens to discover a whole city of people living inside. The film was shot on the streets of New York and is set in the early 1950s. This scene of the movie shows how much the movie has evolved over the years: The dog is now a huge hit with the women of the city. Dogs are now a fashionable accessory. It is a joy to watch. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The great things about this movie are: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen the original Star Wars trilogy (because I was born before they did), so this movie is a nice little treat. It is also a classic space-set adventure story, with plenty of laughs.   It is probably the most well-known and beloved Star Wars movie.  In 1977, George Lucas made a sequel to Star Wars, but it was a huge flop, which only prompted him to make what is perhaps his best film, the Star Wars prequel trilogy.  The film stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Harrison Ford, and James Earl Jones.  Lucas has stated that Lucas wanted to take the classic movie that people loved, and make a great prequel to the movie. The original Star Trek   was the first show of Star Trek. The series ran for three seasons, and in its original run it was well liked by many. Star Trek: The Next Generation   has been considered by many to be the best Star Trek show. It ran for seven seasons.  When Star Trek (2009) started out, it had the same cast.  This is the only original film in the franchise that was not filmed in a space ship. Instead, it takes place on the planet Vulcan.  Star Wars   is a three-parter that was directed by Richard Marquand and stars Harrison Ford as Luke Skywalker and Harrison Ford again as Han Solo.  It follows the prequel story that is set two decades before the first movie. A group of smugglers are trying to evade a bounty hunter.  I like this movie a lot.  A nice sci-fi adventure that takes place in a galaxy far, far away. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie, and a funny one, with a nice plot.   The first hour or so is pretty dull, just enough to start the story.  One of those old-fashioned "what would happen if...   What would happen, if someone stole a bicycle.   I liked how the characters were different, different personalities, but they were all likable.  I love the bike thieves.  The characters are all pretty much the same, all goody-goody, and all are pretty much stupid.  When they make a decision, all seem to know what they are doing and they get away with it.  It is almost too simple a story to be a classic, but the humor is good enough.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Barely alive" is the best documentary about the end of the world. A film where you can tell a bit of story and get an insight on the world in the year 2050. "Barelly alive" has a lot to offer: a very dark look at the nature of our species, and how we got here. If your looking for a serious film about humanity's end, this is not the one for you. I'd rather watch a good sci fi film than this. I didn't mind the gore, and it's not too gory, but I would have rather seen a more lighthearted and humorous look at life in 2050 than the bleak tone. I did not think it was a masterpiece, but it certainly wasn't terrible either.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm very glad I've discovered this film! The plot is simple. Two guys are at the airport trying to get home to their girlfriend who's on a trip. A man is trying to rob the airport. The robbery is successful, but not even when they're chased off the plane, the hijackers are able to steal $10,000 dollars. They fly home and the hijacker's got them trapped. The good guy manages to break out from prison (I like to say he escapes) where he's found with the girl. They take a ride back to the airport, but they don't have a penny to their names, so they have to go back to his old job as a security guard at a diner. He's a bit reluctant to take the job again, but he agrees because his girlfriend has a wedding next weekend and his job means he can have time for that...  My dad brought this on me with his "you can't play with my toys" attitude. I don't know why this movie was made, it had no plot, and the plot is just filler that is just to add to the movie. There was no real chemistry between the actors, but I guess a movie of this nature had to have some and they didn't work out. I have always loved this movie, and I haven't seen it since it came out in 1972. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not a huge action flick lover but I am really looking forward to this one!   This will be great if the action is good enough.   Gangster Squad is one of the biggest action films I've seen in a while.  GANGSTER SQUAD is a buddy action flick where three buddies try to stop a high-speed car chase that the bad guys want to make.  The movie has all the classic elements you'd expect from a crime-oriented flick with plenty of gunfights, gun play and of course the usual suspects: lots of bad guys.  But it also has a fun soundtrack that adds to the movie, and also makes the action look pretty damn fun!  The action is very well choreographed and you get all kinds of great looks at the action set-pieces.  Unfortunately I can't seem to find any trailers for the movie so I don't know how it's all going to work out.  There's an awesome score by Chris Viscardi who's great as always!  The action is pretty great with a pretty decent amount of gun play.  Gangster Squad features Chris Pine, Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr, Mark Wahlberg, Liam Hemsworth and the late, great Kevin Spacey.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************* "The only thing that makes a bad picture good is bad writing." - David Lynch ************************** There's a good deal of "blunderage" in this movie: most of the time it just isn't good. And it has to come from the original script, a book from the 1950's by Charles M. Schulz and the movie director's own "manual" that he had written and made up while they were in a rehearsal room. Schulzy had also used an earlier movie script he had in his possession at the time. But, when it came to writing his own "style" for this movie, he made it up as he went along. (A copy is available at the Schulze-Hirschberg Archives and Library.) He used two actors who didn't do much of anything, and who were cast because they would fit the role. One character, the "mature" scientist, was not played by a man. He was played by his wife, who looked like a man, which did not do the movie any good. The other character, which was the one with the big hair, played by the good-looking woman who plays her husband. She was so bad that Schulzing did not want to get rid of her. At least, he didn't, and he let her continue in the role until she finally gave up the part and quit, as did the man. The movie itself is a bit dull, but the writing itself is really bad. The characters are either ridiculous or ridiculous in the wrong places. And even Schulzenstein himself is given a bad character, who is a complete and total jerk. He takes great liberties, makes up ridiculous plots, and then gives all the characters names which are very strange. One of the most ludicrous characters is a "mangy dog" named "Doris." He comes up with a plan to get his wife back and ends up getting his hands on a pair of scissors and some "dental powder," which he believes can do the trick. This is supposed to cure her of some sort of "disease" which she thinks can be found by rubbing it on her back. And he does that, and it works for a little while. But his wife doesn't believe that. She even takes to wearing a headdress in order to try to make him believe her. The film makes no sense at all: it doesn't do anything but talk about

The cast is pretty good and the humor is really amusing. The director, Stephen King, is great in this movie but the writing is kind of cheesy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie that is full of heart. It has wonderful, heartfelt characters with great laughs. It is not long that one understands how the main characters really feel about each other. You get to know them and really see how they are made of pure love and loyalty to each other no matter what is going on in their lives. It's also a nice surprise that there is a gay guy in the group. His name is James who also helps out the main couple to make some repairs to the car. The characters and the acting is terrific. I don't really care about the story very much because it really is not a story. It comes and goes in a flash of moments with very little real meaning. It feels like one of those shows where they are trying to say something. You just don't know what. The story is actually pretty silly and I was laughing.

Why did you want to get a new car at that time of the year?  It is not that it is winter so you don't like it, it is that it doesn't have a radio.   - James: Yeah, well, I thought there should be radio. I had the radio in my car. So I was thinking what do I do then?  - James and the Radio: What is a radio?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The two main protagonists are both a little clumsy, but you would do well to put their shortcomings aside. As a general rule, everything about them has a "perfect" and beautiful air about it. I was surprised, for example, by their knowledge of the weather. Their knowledge of it is not just a matter of habit or a matter they developed gradually.   One thing that is striking about the movie is that the heroine, Tanya, is a very sympathetic and caring person. She lives with her elderly widower husband in a cottage at the beach on the south shore of the Côte d'Azur. The film opens with the usual dream of Tanya as a child:  The sea is blue.  That's the kind of scene this film has. You are always drawn in by the way she sees it. Her mother, who, while very different from her daughter, looks at her with a smile (an effect that is very attractive and evocative), and is always attentive to her needs.  In her dreams, Tanya experiences a whole set of strange events, from the moment she gets her first sight of the sea to the time she sees a child's face that has been washed up on the shore. These dream experiences also include some real events: 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A really really weird movie. A big man (David Bowie) is at a place in the sky and decides to stay there. The story, in the beginning, is really simple, yet very funny. We have a guy who has a big house, but no bathroom. Every day, in order to wash, he has to take a ride on a plane that goes in the air. It gets really bad, but it is all worth it. David Bowie, on the other hand, does everything to make the humor even funnier. He is like the big man, only he has a small house and, more importantly, no bathrooms. The only thing funny about this is the idea of a flying car, but the performance, the humor, and the story put it over. It's just very silly.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie about a very sad story: a man who lost his love one year before his marriage to his wife was getting ready to celebrate his birthday. It was a very beautiful wedding and a very happy birthday to the happy couple. But there was a big problem: he didn't see her for another one year. His daughter (in this film also played by Aya Cash) left him and left him alone. But in a very funny scene he met a new woman. A good-looking woman with an amazing talent. And a beautiful story. This movie is funny, beautiful, moving and sad. It is all that a comedy movie should be. It has a lot of jokes (a lot more than usual) as well as good and witty scenes. It even has a strong message that I have tried to show. The message: never give up. A very important message. I also like how this movie was never romantic. In fact the movie is very funny and funny it needs some laughs to be very enjoyable. But it is not love story.

He said that he has a new girlfriend, she is a very pretty girl and very good looking. In my room, I had a bottle of wine which I made him drink. He was sitting in my room and he went to my wife.

I had read about the great adventures of Tom Servo as a kid, and then I heard about him again (from a guy who had just seen the first film as a teenager) and I thought I'd check it out.  I found the characters charming and likable. I loved the idea of Tom doing an old TV show, and finding out that in some of the old episodes, the guests were more intelligent than he was.   The stories were humorous and some episodes of the show were funny, but I didn't find a true stand out episode until the first episode on Tom's father (Dr. Who). It's an old man, a very old man but he does things on time and keeps himself to himself.  He is obsessed with time travel and even though we don't see the man's face during the time travel episode, I liked his character.  This is a great movie for anyone who doesn't get tired of the same old stories. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie with some amazing special effects.   The film is very well written and has the potential of being one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.  From its beginning you realize the possibilities of what you can accomplish with a simple two-shot camera.  The characters are unique and the story has a little sci-fi.  In conclusion:  I love this film and I will see it over and over again.  I've found no bad words to say about this movie.  It's the first sci-fie film of its kind and it could be a very interesting one.  We are introduced to a man and a woman trying to escape a ship which has crashed.  There is a large alien ship and we see the alien crew coming to get the man and woman.  I think that this movie is really good from beginning to end.  All in all this is a fantastic movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character, J.D. (John Cho) is a brilliant psychiatrist. It is a bit of a letdown when a psychiatrist doesn't need to be the first in the room.  He just starts the meeting, says good morning, and then goes back to his office, where he begins with the same old routine. He sees patients, prescribes a drug to them that is just what they need, and tells them when it is over. When it is, the patient leaves without a word and he has to say goodbye. The next day, when he sees the same patients again, there is a little problem. They have different ideas about how J. D. should see them and how they should feel about him. It does not matter what the patients say, their thoughts don't change at all. But J.d. doesn't listen to that. He wants to see them again. He starts looking in other wards for a new psychiatrist to see that night. What he finds is that there aren't any psychiatrists at all in the hospital. Not that that is any problem. Dr. Gregory (Kunal Nayyar) is the head psychiatrist and one of the most popular and successful doctors at the hospital and Dr. Andrew (Jonny Lee Miller) is one of his interns. J.B. (Zach Braff) is J. d.'s fellow intern and he also knows nothing. He is not very smart, but he is very nice. J.d.'s mother (played by Angela Kang) is also a psychiatrist and does not have any particular feelings either for J. J.'s father (Martin Starr) is in jail for murder so his family are scattered around the country and he doesn't see them that often. The movie starts slow, but in the end it gets really awesome. I am very glad that I went along with this film and I enjoyed it a lot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a nice movie.  For many, the movie may sound boring at first because of all the stuff that's going on, but I have to say the scenes where the movie shows that it really is good are truly worth seeing.   This is a true gem from 1960's and one that I will not hesitate to watch again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original 'Godfather' comes back in a big way. This is the best movie by director Francis Ford Coppola. If you like the original, than you have to watch this. It is a fantastic movie with a wonderful soundtrack. It really is amazing to see the family come together and stay together. The performances by Don Johnson, Al Pacino and Philip Seymour Hoffman are excellent. I would not be able to wait to see them all back together again for a whole new movie experience. I think I'll give the original a 9.5 out of 10 rating.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was very skeptical about this movie because I didn't want to put too much of the bad with the good...but it's just that good! It's definitely not just a generic, but a very unique action movie, that's for sure. So how can it not be good? Well, there are so many things going on in this movie: The acting is good enough, and the plot was written very well (that's another thing that's great, even though it is not so well executed). You never get bored watching the story, which is really refreshing. Also, for a movie that takes place in a war zone, it's pretty realistic, if we can even call it that. Most of the action has to do with a group of special forces, and they are very well known for their daring missions and for being fearless and fearless killers. But even then, they are not perfect. You have the special ops team, the soldiers, who are trained by soldiers they have trained for some years in the United States, who have no problem with killing a man. And finally, you have some soldiers who may not be so perfect, but are still good for an action movie. And that's why the movie works so well. There's only two problems with this movie. One is the acting, of course. If you look at the first half of the movie, you won't get to see anything that the actors can do. There are a lot of times the actors have to use a mask so it makes their faces look fake. So you may not even be able to notice when the actor has been seriously injured, or even killed, but you would notice when they are in their disguises. The other problem is that the writing is weak. It's not that bad, but it's not good either. It can be a good read, but there are many scenes in this book that don't even make any sense. It just keeps throwing different characters and situations in the audience's face. But it's still a good book...it's just not good as a movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** * The first time I saw this film I was really not impressed by it. I had no ideas what was happening, and thought it was just a comedy about a bunch of drunk sailors who all decided to have a big row in front of a pub for no reason whatsoever. I loved it. Then my boyfriend, who is an artist, had a look at the movie and told me "I have to tell you something. This is the most brilliant movie you've seen in years. If you have the chance to see it, do so." So it was. * I know it can sometimes feel as if Hollywood gets to Hollywood and then some "new kid" comes in and steals the show. But, The Man Who Knew Too Much has made me admire the very best films about the people who worked in Hollywood. If they hadn't left out some of the people, and there are some good scenes in this film, this film would be regarded as the best film about the Hollywood movie industry, the best Hollywood film I have ever seen. This film is about the very old Hollywood studio system. It is the story of the film company that ran film and TV, and it is the ultimate in the old way of Hollywood production and management. It was all about the movie making machine and it was very clever, yet it was often unfair. *I am very pleased to be able to recommend this film to a new generation. It shows the true story of Hollywood, but without the sentimentalism about the studio system of the '40s. A brilliant, and hilarious film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie had me in a good mood after a rather tedious and predictable ending to "The Great King Kong" (The movie was too short, I didn't like it either.) We were sent back to King Kong's jungle to see what would happen when his old friend Konga (the one that got kidnapped a couple of times earlier) returned in a giant robot to challenge our King Kong. It is a good idea to get the robot and have it take on giant enemies which is good in a game but in a movie it was just a terrible idea! The robot simply can't do anything and as soon as Konga gets hit by a bolt Konga's head is blown off in a very cartoonish way! The best bit is Konga looking at a huge tree and screaming "KONGA, KONGA...KONGAAAAA!!!" to which we wonder "Is that the one? How did she get that size?". The movie was also a lot like "The Man from UNCLE JOE" where we have a large robot that has nothing but stupid dialog in a rather weak movie. It took too long to get through the film but then again the movie would be a lot better if the robots didn't exist.   Helpful with the fact that a couple months prior to the beginning of the film we are introduced to a new character, a man named King Konga who is trying to return to his homeland after it has been invaded by the giant animals, the monkeys, the crocodiles and the other wildlife, who are controlled by the evil Konga. The Konga, along with his crew (the pilot) are trapped on the island by the crocodile. When they finally make their way to the Konga and his small ship, the ship is destroyed by the monkeys and Konga is captured and imprisoned by the animals. After some time we see the Kongas getting fed up with the monkeys. The monkey is then destroyed by Konga during a boxing match, this causes the Kongaman to rage and he flies off after the monkey to get revenge. The rest of the movie is just Kongs flying around to get back to his jungle and to get rid of the animals he has killed. The film is a bit dull but there is a lot of fun in watching them get defeated.

If you feel nostalgia then Japanese films is the best kind of entertainment.   If the movie is good then it will make you feel a smile because of the good performance and acting.  I highly recommend watching it because you might forget all those bad things you have seen in movies and anime. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have only one thing in your life that needs to be done and then it is done.   This movie does a great job of presenting the story and setting.  This is a great time and will give you great amusement, good laughs and a good time.  It has the typical bad guy who gets his revenge after getting humiliated.  He is the man who would do anything to win and is a big man.  The bad guy is a tough guy who has the most interesting voice in all of movies.  If there is something that this movie can be bad for a little bit, it is the dialogue.  Even the actors have it from time to time. The voice acting is okay but it may be a bit hard to understand the speech.  Although the story is not complicated and does not go in a different direction than others, but it does not need it.  There is nothing that is unbelievable.  All I think is that this film is a good one and I will watch more of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I would rather be at a zoo."   It's a classic "mystery" movie, set at a circus, and I have to give kudos to the author/director, who doesn't hesitate to bring the story to a close in the most dramatic and dramatic ways possible. The music is pretty much what I expected: dark, sinister, with some light and dark tones. The only downside is that I can't help but think of "Crazy Horse," which I know is a far more modern film, but in retrospect that's probably unfair to "Chocolate Town." In the end, I'm happy to have finished the story, but I don't think it will be a favorite among mystery fans.   The only thing that could have been better than this movie would have been if it had been made in the '80s and not in the 30s. There is too much sleazy talk about sex in this movie: a lot of "I'm not a whore, I am a slut!" stuff that doesn't make me feel all that much more sympathetic towards the performers. I mean, I suppose that's understandable in a "mysterious" movie (and a somewhat cynical one at that), but that kind of thing usually only works for a few films before they get old.   that "chocolate" was probably intended to make it even darker, but it kind of ruins the effect. The scene where the clown is talking to the actress while she's under the table and looking a bit unwell is absolutely horrible (if you look closely you can even see one of the performers' nipples through the dress), but the clown looks so much sexier. I think the director had to use the makeup artist to make him appear less gross, because his makeup just doesn't work as well with the makeup on. This may have been a case of having too little money.  - April 8, 2006not a favorite of mystery fans  Reviewer: michael - favorite - February 4, 2006  Subject: Not for Mystery Fans This movie is a great example of how good a story is not always appreciated.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A young couple is driving home from a bar when a small boy jumps out in front of them.

The boy quickly disappears as the couple drive through the streets, and the next morning the mother finds a big stain in the kitchen sink. This is not a joke.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â If you liked Â Â (2007) Â, then you Â should check out Â A Monster Calls. Â It is the best horror movie I have seen in a long time.  Director Â John Carpenter makes an amazing movie with a great cast including, Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, Billy Bob Thornton, Tim Curry, Michael J. Pollard, John Glover, and of course, Bill Skarsgard.  The film is very scary, with some very well-made use of suspense, suspense-filled camera movements, and some good use of special effects to help add to the suspense.    The plot is a good balance of the supernatural (this movie is set during the night before Halloween), but the movie also has some laughs and scares in it.  For the story, it was good, but it would have been better if the film was more focused on the character development of the characters, which was very uneven.  I would recommend this to any fan of horror, because it is well-acted, and is very funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is about a group of men who find themselves in a situation where they've all just shot, or have just shot their wives and girlfriends and then they've gone out and done the same, or shot a drunk who had just walked in on the men. The man who had been playing pool had walked into the bar and gotten shot. One of the guys in the bar had decided he wouldn't be that man anymore and so he shot his wife and a couple of girlfriends, then he and another guy walked over to the bar. The guy who had played pool walked in and said "You're all in trouble", and then he did something to the guy playing pool. The bar owner had already had the guy who was doing the pool shooting, and had shot him himself. As a result of that one shooting, the guy shooting his wife had been killed and one of the two other guys who played pool had been shot, so they had all taken him in because of the fact that he shot all three of them. They had to go in and get the bodies out, which they did. The movie ends with a close-up of the bar owner holding up a shotgun while he looks in the door frame.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this movie I enjoyed the story well enough and I would recommend it to anyone.  It was funny, it was well executed, and it was done in a really cool way.  The movie begins as three characters (two characters were so annoying and so useless in the movie that I couldnt take them seriously, the third one was a hero, who did a good job of showing some emotion and acting in the scenes, but I wasnt really excited by him, I just wanted them out of the woods) are in the woods one night when all of a sudden some kind of creature comes up and starts biting them until they die.  Then they come back to life with no memory of what happened so they set out to find out who or what was killing them.  They found that out and it seems that the creature was a small girl named Nell. She was a little girl who came to the woods because she was the only person to ever know that her mother had died.   She lived alone in the forest in a hut that looked out over the woods, and they think she has a secret.  I dont really like her at first, but by the end of the movie she really came alive. I think she could have been the perfect movie villain but the writers of this movie failed to get her into the movie.  Also a little boy from the woods (he was really annoying) was a really interesting character who did the right things at the right time in the right way. The whole story took about two weeks to come together, because the only thing this movie did that was really cool was to change the names of the characters, in addition to just having them appear and disappear a bunch.  There was a lot of dialogue, but not all of it was necessary.  The movie had a lot going for it when all was said and done.  But the writers made a mess of it so its up to the viewer to decide if a good little movie really can be made out of this or if some of the parts could have be condensed.  If you like horror movies then this is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: **************** * An interesting look into the life of a young man who goes to a high school for the deaf and blind, and does his best to be a well-behaved but lonely high school student. It's a movie with a lot of heart, but not for it's characters. ***** I was going to call this a slow movie, but it isn't. I mean, really, the whole thing's just one long action scene in a parking garage and a few other locations. I can't say I thought the movie was really bad, just that it was very boring. I really like a movie called Goodfellas, and I think this might've been a good follow up to that movie, in terms of characters and story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this movie is going to be a classic. I just have no words for this movie.  The film opens with a man in a suit (Frank Oz) sitting in the front row of a theater (of course) where he has a chance for a private audience with the President. But his chance is limited because the President is getting his annual "haircut". The President is in his forties and is bald from birth, and his mother used to shave him daily and now he is about to get it done.  Oz gets very interested in the President because his wife, the first lady, is pregnant. She had a child out of wedlock and had a hard time raising the child. So far there is no indication that the President was raised with much of a family or he might have been raised very isolated. Oz knows he could be a good father and will try to make a connection, but then there is the President's mother (Jane Birkin) who has never had any contact with the man since he was a young boy. But at least she has a son to look after. In the movie, as a result of a "scuffle" with another guest, he ends up with a hair cut himself... And not from a person...  In the second act Oz discovers that he is very attractive to the President, but she is very uninterested and refuses to accept him at the stage (in the theater) and instead takes the stage with a member of the audience who does some very odd things. In turn Oz gets even more interested, but this time he gets a little too involved because this fellow has a very peculiar voice, and he ends-up kissing a woman in a bathroom of one of the hotels that the film was shot at. They end up with sexual intercourse...and the President gets very pregnant in the last few scenes.   If this movie did not have the last twist, I think I would still be recommending it. Because this is an amazing movie and is really an excellent way to start off any season. I know the "classic" may not be for everyone, but you should give it a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This movie is about a young and sexy young girl named Sophie, who is a waitress. Sophie gets a boyfriend named Patrick who is married but they are a happy couple with a very cute baby and a very hot sex life and he is always in love with her. Now, Sophie and Patrick have a little girl named Alice, who Sophie is still trying to get pregnant. After she is pregnant again with Patrick, she wants more. Sophie goes around town looking for Patrick but doesn't find him. She calls up Patrick and tells him what she has been up to. She has found a guy she can't believe and doesn't see why he should get her. Patrick seems a little down on his luck. He has gotten into lots of trouble and he has run away from home several times. Now Sophie thinks it is because of his child support payment and that he does not have a job. Sophie doesn't know about his son and she doesn't want his son to grow up to be a bad person. So when he is about to be arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, he begs Sophie to take him back and they have an affair. Now there are many good sex scenes in this movie. Sophie has a lot of sex scenes with Patrick and she has a few with the police. This movie is a pretty funny one and it is really enjoyable. I do wish there was more of Sophie. I would have liked her a lot more in the movie but that is really only the problem with this movie-that the movie is all about Sophie and none about Patrick. It doesn't really seem right or right at all.

I love the humour here, I think it's much funnier than a lot of the comedies from the '80s.  The best bit is the final shot, it's absolutely hilarious.  I'm amazed this has been made in the first place, the humour is so good I laughed out loud almost every time.  A great laugh, great fun, you should watch this.  This is not a dog movie, this is about a bunch of idiots who like to pretend to have a pet dog.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was actually a really good movie. A movie that has its moments but that doesn't mean it can't pull off some pretty great scenes and it is just good to see a good director work on such a nice looking movie. It was made even better because it has a very nice soundtrack that was awesome and the voice acting was very good. It wasn't very original in the movie and that is a good thing, it takes a couple scenes from other films and adds them to it to make it better and it works. I recommend this movie to fans of science fiction and great movies that are made with a lot of heart and a good sense of humor and a story that is very enjoyable to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a lot of fun, and it's one of those rare times where a film that I would normally not give a 5 to, turned out to be good! I'm so happy that Hollywood has finally done a remake (well, with only minor changes in the script) of a cult classic movie about a young soldier that was a lot like me - the only difference was that I was a member of the Viet Cong and the other guys were all crazy hippies, so I was the crazy hippie-biker-spy-warrior-cannibal.  If there's a silver lining, it's that the whole story is a little too long, as I don't think the film made much of an impression on people during its original run.    This movie really took off for me when I heard of a sequel, and I'm glad to see that it was one!    
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ You should know before you start that this is a good old fashioned campfire tale with a great cast of actors. They are all good. The story is about a boy who has the ability to read the dreams of anyone he wishes by the magic of a lamp. Soon he can read the wishes of people like a magician. He gets caught up in a game between the rich and the poor who believe the wishes are curses. The poor are told of a girl who is the next to be crowned Queen of England. A young man named Peter is the best guesser of her dreams. He has read her dreams many times and knows that she has a secret love. There is even a girl named Mary who may have more power to grant the wishes that the poor boy has asked for. As you might expect, the poor get the short end. It is a pity that they had to watch this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can honestly say that I found this movie to be a fairly pleasant experience.   My only criticism towards the movie is that it's a little too long at times (about 8-10 minutes more than it needs to be).   But what's really great about this movie is not the length but that the story is such a good one.  While it's not a particularly good story, it really holds up well and is a fun, fun, awesome time.  I know that it looks a little old-fashioned compared to today's movies but in its time it had it's own sort of charm.  For one thing there's a lot of kissing and hugging which is old and old-timey and fun.  Also, there is also some good music in this movie, most notably a lovely, mellow, and very beautiful song at the end.  In short, this is an old-school classic that just needs to get on DVD.

The country is full of films that aren't exactly bad (The Great Outdoors, The Wild Party is certainly that), but they are rarely anything to rave about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was really surprised to get a copy of this movie. I've never heard of a film called Lazy Susan. I know about it now, because I've read the book written by Michael Cunningham. So, I'm not surprised by the fact that this movie, which is directed by Robert Altman, would make the top of a list of the best movies of the 90's. It seems like Altman does all the things he is famous for, including, of course, the characters in this movie (who could forget that one girl, the one who keeps doing all the household chores, the ones who are so innocent and yet she makes such a great girlfriend for Altman to be with). The movie starts with a man who goes into the bathroom and is startled to find that he has the perfect body. The problem is that this man has an addiction to women's beauty that will stop at nothing to keep him from getting his body back. The addiction and the body are actually two separate problems. A body is a beautiful woman, it's the rest that's the problem. The best part of the movie is when he finally gets a body, after all the hard work he's been putting in with his addiction. I had to look up Altman and see if there are other movies by him, because that's how great a character Altman is. This movie was great! The story, for me, was the most interesting part. It's based on a real situation in a small town and the main characters were so well done it made me laugh. The movie has a very light tone and the story is a little over the top and cheesy, which I don't mind because the characters are so well written and believable that you just can't help but like what they're doing. If you enjoy a good story, you should try Lazy Sue. I thought it was worth getting.

My wife says, "It's not a bad idea to see someone else." I could care less if it's a lesbian couple or not.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't think this was a bad movie, but just a slightly boring one. I felt like I was watching an American version of The Deer Hunter. The acting was average, but not bad.  The film was shot in beautiful, wide, color, color that has to be seen to be believed. The plot had you questioning why the movie has two leads (which, in this case, means two leads in the body of a male and the female lead) and why no one has killed the serial killer.    However, the reason I loved this movie is because I saw the same kind of film in a theater a year before this one. It is an old film (1952), but I saw it again and again. I never could figure out why they were in this old movie, and why everyone loved this film.  As for this movie, it may have a slightly different plot, but I wouldn't put it in the same bracket of The Black Dahlia or The Body. I would watch this a couple times and come to the same conclusion: The Deer Hunters was a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that this film is the best of its kind. It is a very good story about two friends, who meet for a coffee while they are walking home after a long day at a job. They begin to get to know each other better, and soon they are on a very exciting journey. The movie is well paced, and the story is very well done. The dialogues is very good. I particularly enjoyed the first few days of this adventure, when the two friends go from a small town to a larger town where many adventures await them. One of the best features is that there are many scenes where the two of them are together in a cafe. This is very romantic. The ending is excellent. You might want to give this a try to see what all the hype is about, but if you are thinking about it, wait to see it on tv.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a great movie and a good thriller. It has a great twist when you realize how the man who had killed his wife and daughter in cold blood got free from the hospital and went to his neighbors house and then started shooting them. There is only one thing you can say to the people who think it is just a movie to kill all people like the guy in it: It is really the first horror movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you don't mind going to the woods and shooting a few birds then this is a beautiful and enjoyable movie to watch.  The story has a fairly original concept as it shows us the story of a couple who get into a little dispute with a bear who lives in a nearby forest. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked it. I like this type of stuff, if you want to be "un-picky." I like the music (although a lot of it is like the rock score of the 80's) and it's quite witty. It's a bit pretentious, although that's not surprising. It does what it sets out to do, it entertains, that's all.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- ------------ It is an enjoyable film that deserves to be released more than it already is. -------------- ------------ As always from the director of "The Last Emperor", "Makoto" (Kaneda) is a man who was a great general of the army (but also a tyrant at times) who has lost his crown, his position of power and his honor due to the fact that he was not able to save his country from the military dictatorship by his fellow generals. --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The Last Emperor: The Legend of the Emperor and his Demons is a movie about the life and times of the emperor, Hirohito who lived from 1889-1912. For the last twenty years, he was trying to live a quiet life on a farm until a powerful demon, whose name I won't mention, appeared in Tokyo to conquer the country by force. At the last moment, Hirohsito's mother appeared before him and gave the emperor a message to send to China in order to avert the invasion and save the country. But the emperor didn't send the message and he was captured by demons. The demons then decided to use his daughter and take over the empire and to prevent them from taking over his country, Hirohtitou, he is forced to fight against them. The film presents the battle between him and them by using a film projector. The demon that is named Koshiro (the name of a village in Nagasaki) is also a film maker (I think this is how he wants to express his hatred against humanity, for he was also one of the demons in the movie). For the purpose of the movie, the demons made an army of soldiers that was controlled by people with magic. Hirohitou and his followers, who are the main characters are able to resist the evil and make it look like Hirohitsutoki was actually in love with the demon princess Sessyokusha (I found that this is also how the name of Sessiokusha was presented in the Japanese version of the film), that is why the two fell in love. The movie also has many scenes with Hirohita's family and his friends. For example, at one point he is walking home from a train station and he gets lost because he doesn't know where he is. Hirohtu tells him to follow him because he might need help. He comes to a house and finds out that his daughter, who was playing with her dog, is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tobie Blake and the Unexceptional Dream  is a comedy that manages to capture the feel of the film genre with a great set-up and a great cast all with a very memorable performance from Toby Blake.  While this is a relatively unimportant comedic role (for him and his small role), it is an important part of the comedy genre for sure.     This is another film that is well shot and very entertaining and this is another one of the greats in the comedy sub-genre.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an awesome movie I must say! The movie is about the first time i see an alien who shows himself on a small screen and i think it was a bit late when he showed up but i had to see it. It was very well shot, i loved all the alien people who are on this planet. The first time when a space ship fell to earth and a scientist who has done very good work with the aliens was kidnapped (for not that much) he was saved by a little alien baby (that looks like a boy) who has a special energy and a very special personality. The little baby then tells the scientist how all the aliens of his race like to eat their children. The baby then runs to the mother who has fallen from her spaceship to Earth and is in a hospital. He talks to her and talks to the doctors (they look almost human) who do not believe her that she is a baby and they tell her that the doctors could do better on her. The mother then tells her child that he has to get the baby out of the hospital, she will try to find a doctor but she does not know where they are. The child then tells them to go down to the place where his mother is. The movie ends with a very cool moment with the mother, child and the doctors coming down on the space ship (which is also a spacecraft) and the planet where the aliens are from to see the doctors on the screen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (March 8, 2004) I loved this movie. I've heard it mentioned a lot. I haven't seen it yet and am very looking forward to doing so. It is a story about a little boy named Jake who runs away and finds himself in a forest. There is no explanation for Jake. No real plot. No characters. Just Jake running around. The trees in the forest are pretty to look at and are pretty bright with colorful leaves and lots of flowers. A couple of the other scenes were cool. I also liked the way the movie was shot. It's mostly still photographs. I loved the background music. I don't know if this is one of the "good movies" that I look forward to because the ending and the ending of the movie is really great. I liked the fact that Jake gets a dog. It also had a great ending when he went back to the cabin. I do wish they had left a little more for the ending. It would have been much better. This movie also had the best ending that I ever saw. I'm definitely going to see it again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A solid comedy about a poor guy who becomes a successful businessman. The plot follows his plans to steal some old people's money by robbing their vault and then getting caught. I don't see much of a difference between The Adventures of Brute Force  and The Big Lebowski.  I think I'll go out on a limb and say it would be easier to write a review of both.  That being said, here is my review:  I have to admit I'm not a fan of movies with a very broad comedic theme.  It's usually very predictable, with a lot of predictable characters, and usually has pretty poor performances from both the leads.   However, The Big L, starring John Larroquette as a guy who steals old women's money.  The story follows him as he tries to find the owner (played by Edie McClurg) of some large cash box.  As the box is opening, it's obvious that someone is trying to get it out.  However it's not enough to break into the vault, and he is caught in a shootout at the front door.  This being said he manages to escape, get the money, and get the hell out of there.  Then the owner and some thugs come looking for him, and as they chase him he hides behind a giant statue.  At the end of the movie he escapes once again, and leaves the statue behind as a parting gift.  I think this movie is a pretty fun ride, but isn't quite as good as The Adventures Of Brute force.  3.5 out of 5
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an awesome movie. It has everything that you'd want in a movie like this. It's got a good script, a great cast, awesome special effects, and a very well paced story. It was a fun movie, I just wish that the ending was a bit better. I wish the movie had more action and it would have been perfect. If you are a SciFi fan and enjoy the story, then this is a good flick for you. If not you won't be disappointed with this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie so much! I knew it would be good. I watched it again and again to see how well it held up. When the film starts, there are a couple of guys who have been playing in the local country music bar. They just want to have a beer with a girl. The bar is a local dive bar. This could have been any time in the 1980's. It has good music and the dancers are really pretty. I really liked the costumes and the costumes on the dancers were amazing. I loved the scene they had when the guys dance with the dancers at the end. It is amazing how much this movie shows a little bit of our world from a different perspective. I hope the movie has a sequel because I hope this film gets made again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a "real classic".  The story starts off with our main character looking in a magazine for a girlfriend.  Then he notices this girl standing right in front of his car.    She's very attractive.  He tries to get a picture and she says no, but he'll leave a note.  There's one problem: She can see through his car...   When he opens the note he sees that she's a little... off.  The two of them start talking and he decides to ask her out... at the club.  At first she's not interested.  She says she doesn't have to meet a guy like that.  Then he asks her to come over to his place for a movie.  But that's where the troubles begin.  Her sister is a pretty girl, so when he goes over to their house, she takes the opportunity to seduce him.  One thing leads to another, and one night he tells her what he wants: a girl who won't hurt him.

In addition to being funny, DFW is a good writer; although I feel he should have written it more carefully and with more depth.    However, there are some good moments.  This is one of the few rom-cartoons that I enjoy and I enjoy it for what it is--a good story.  I'm glad that I've made it this far.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a simple movie about a man who meets a girl who wants to have a baby. But when he falls in love with her, he becomes the victim of a horrible case of 'accidental pregnancy'. They are living as husband and wife, with everything to lose. However, she keeps asking him to do the things that most of us would consider unthinkable. They go to a country that has not had a female president since 1979. She is going to help her country become a country with a female presidential candidate. They are all very happy to have her as president. He has to help them with some jobs and go out and play. But there is one thing he doesn't like. They live with a young family that is having some problems. And one day there is a car accident. His mother dies and the father is gravely injured. Now that he is at a very bad time, he comes up with a plan to win the election for his family. With the help of a young secretary (played by Gilda Radner) he can win the presidency by doing very dangerous things. But of course, there is also a little problem with the girl's pregnancy. This is all played for laughs in a silly, fun manner, as he takes every occasion to do it.  Overall Rating: 8.0/10

The man who lived in the cave, however, was an evil man who tortured his victim and cut his head off.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen the film many times and I'm finally getting around to watching it again. This is one of the few films that I can see and appreciate for its humor, the humor it gives. The movie is very well written, it's simple, but yet has enough depth to make it interesting and enjoyable. The script is very good, and it shows that it was the work of a talented director. There were some very funny characters in the movie and the humor worked very well, though I don't understand much of it now, though my impression of it as an adult is pretty good, despite the movie being about 10 years old.   For those of us who didn't grow up with this sort of humor, this was a funny film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last few days I started to wonder what is wrong with the world, I could have done without these ridiculous people from my previous life, and that they were a pain in my rear end in that time. I found myself being annoyed with some things but there was a certain charm to their antics that kept it fun. The actors all performed well and the production values were great. It's a classic tale of two animals, one that wants to stay alive, another who loves him. The animals were so different but it wasn't too long before the two began to bond and it was great to see their relationship grow. In fact it was the second part where I felt I was watching a sequel to a much older movie. This is really all you need to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good "couch movie" about two friends living together while they wait to graduate from college. Both guys are rather immature in their youth, both have a lot of alcohol problems, and their relationships are constantly strained. The sex is pretty good, but it's nothing special. There are a few jokes and some funny parts, but the actual acting is pretty bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The new "The Mummy" is a good action thriller with a few laughs. I loved the new story line which made it a more interesting film. The movie is very action packed and is great fun. "The mummy" (Andrew Lazar) has been working as a security guard for 20 years. In one of his job and most important, he works in Egypt, guarding the Great Pyramid at Giza. The most important thing is he still has the key to the pyramid. He has been on the lookout for it and now it is time for him to make the trek to it. After a bad experience he decides to take a break in a deserted village and has a run in with a strange guy, named Zagara, who is a local. They talk and get to know each other. Zagura asks him to get rid of a young boy he has caught, who keeps stealing things from his father's house. As a side note this kid has a name in Egyptian, and this guy tells him he is his son. Zaghara's father lives in the abandoned building he works on. His father is a powerful man in this town. He keeps the young people on a leash that he controls like a dog. When he goes to work he has to come back to the house. He tells Zagar to stay away from his house, but Zagaria is curious about it. He is convinced this is the place where his father has buried his wife. "I can't leave my dad's house," he says. "He doesn't want me to go." "Oh he does," replies the father and tells Zagharia to stay inside. Zagonah's father is afraid to lose his son and he will have to pay the penalty for it. At night Zagaro leaves home with his friend and meets a man who is also looking for his father. He brings them together and they go off together on a search for the pyramid for the first time in 20 years and the first real adventure. This was all fun and a little too short but the new storyline was interesting to see. " The Mummy " will be available on video soon. It is being released by Universal in the United States and they should be available soon for rent or purchase.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It had some interesting themes. There were some moments that I didn't expect to see in a horror movie, like when we see the monster, there's a brief cut to black, then we hear screams and someone yells "He's coming! He's here!". I don't like the sound of that scream. I'm a sound guy, so I know how to make things sound scary, but it didn't scare me to no end.  One thing I thought this movie was about was the love between father and daughter. They were very sweet. A good movie. Not great, but a good one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film after viewing the trailer for The Big Lebowski. The film is directed by James Gunn, written by Rian Johnson and stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista.   The story is set in the future where the U.S has become a dictatorship ruled by the President and his wife and he's in charge of all the military bases, so everyone is scared that the aliens will overrun the US if a war is fought. A young scientist named Bill Snotlick (Pattinson) is told by his uncle the President that a government expedition to the asteroid is sent out. The scientists are to gather scientific information and to find out if the aliens are really there. Bill's friend Dave (Ben Mendelsohn) goes with Bill and his uncle to the expedition base (a giant spaceship), where they find a group of soldiers who seem to have been wiped out, along with their families. When all the soldiers go crazy and attack the President, Bill and Dave have to go along with the soldiers to get out of there. The movie doesn't spend too long setting up its world and there isn't a whole lot of story here. Instead of setting up the main story for the film, it jumps around a bit and just sticks to the main characters, the scientists and their research.  When Bill and the others get there, they are told by the military that there is a small, harmless alien race that's living in the asteroid, with some of them living among the humans. This is the first of the alien species we see and they are very little in number; they are just little red creatures with small heads, which doesn't make them any more than a decoration. It's a bit disappointing that they aren't given any depth or motivation, but they are there just to be there. They are there for the audience to see. This makes the film kind of annoying to watch because all you get out this film is the alien, but then we are not told much about their society. The first aliens we see have very strange ways of looking at the people, which is interesting. They're also incredibly stupid. I guess the idea here is that as soon as the humans get a taste of power the aliens decide to go into a state of depression, they all become so depressed and just do nothing but sit around, watching and waiting for something to happen.  After the first alien attack the army gets all the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first saw this movie at a science fiction convention back in 1987 when I was a child. I remember thinking "That's the strangest movie ever made! How could a movie get made like that?" At the time it was a hit, and a pretty good one at that. It was a pretty funny adventure story set in a world where the people who built a time machine (a car and two men on a motorcycle) accidentally opened a wormhole. What happens is they are transported back to the year 1939 and all of the big cities are in ruins. The film is all over the place but it's really just about the adventures of a man named Doc and his two companions (they had one other guy, a girl who plays the piano) who have to figure out a way to make things right. The director, Robert Siodmak (the same guy who made the excellent The Wild Angels ) does a good job of creating a unique world with lots of mystery but you can't help getting sucked into it. If you liked The Wild Flowers and The Wild Bunch and The Day The Earth Stood Still (both excellent movies), this is an excellent one. I don't think you'll get the same thrill from this one. If anything, it is a little boring at times and there's only so much suspense you can manage. But don't let that deter you - it's fun!

Review This film is about a guy named Eddie (Robert Loggia), who is a tough guy from Detroit, who goes to LA to try to become a big star. He tries to be a part of the gang, called "The Family" which are all drug addicts. He has a great time with these bad guys, playing pool and getting into a lot of trouble. He loves women in this gang, except for one of the guys, who is so mean that he hurts Eddie's pride. Eddie is also a drunk and a lot more stupid than he thinks he is.  This is a fun movie with a little bit of a message. I also love a good gangster movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a teen-ager back in the 90's and my father gave me a copy of the movie "It's a Wonderful Life."  This was a beautiful film, filled with beautiful people who are all working towards one another.  It's so sweet to have a woman who has never been given a chance, be given the opportunity to do anything. __________________________________________________________________ It's a great movie. It tells the story of a man named George Bailey (Russell Crowe) who lives in the small town of West Virginia with his wife Ida (Joan Fontaine) and their three young boys.    It takes place during the depression, a time when many of the townsfolk were starving or worked as day laborer, and they do not see it.  George Bailey has been trying to be a good father to his boys, even giving them a bath to keep them from getting sick or cold.  Unfortunately, the people that live in town cannot be trusted, and it has been long time since the town has had any work.  And then the one who is most like George Bailey and most like his wife is called out of town to go to New York City.  In West Virginia, George is the best farmer there is.  Ida, who is a very independent lady is also very well off, and is the kindest and sweetest woman you can imagine.  But that is George Bailey. He is self-centered, lazy, and selfish.  It is his children who are his true friends, even when they are older and they are afraid of his selfishness.  A small part is given to the woman who is the love of George Bailey's life:  The Woman is a wonderful woman.  She is so sweet, so gentle.  I could not get over the way she looks at George on the set of the wedding and how he looks back at her.  As he leaves to go back to New Jersey, George's daughter tells him to come back soon, and tells him the bad things that will happen in New York.  The scene is set to a great song, " The World Will Not End ", with the lyrics "It was all over, but the news was still changing / I had no time to change, the world will not end."   And in West Virginia that does not happen.  For George Bailey is too poor to go for the "good news."  He lives in a
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________ The year is 1963 and a girl, Holly, has been forced to return to her mother's New England farmhouse in Connecticut, where she has been raised since the age of five. With the family gone, Holly must now deal with the strange events that have been happening in the house. Her mother has not been seen in a while and when her sister comes to visit, she finds the place deserted. When she enters, however, she sees a man talking to her. Then the man disappears. With time passing the story becomes stranger and stranger until the final moments of the film when Holly is confronted by a man standing on the steps of her sister's bedroom. When the woman's hand falls down Holly is hit on the head and collapses on the floor. This time she is left for dead; her body, on the bed. Soon another girl, Sarah, shows up in the room, and she and Holly are soon joined by two male companions. They begin to dance and dance, while the camera follows them and is almost at a standstill, while they move about the room and then back inside, with each new group of two or three men joining. The music changes and the film cuts to a shot of a black man in a suit standing in a room with two female figures - the first a blonde and the second a brunette. The two women then walk past Holly, the blonde on one side of her and the brunette on the other. When Holly passes the black man she picks up a piece of paper and begins to write. The black man looks at it, then says "I've had a lot of time to think". Then he walks away and returns with two other men. They look around the room - there are no pictures or other objects - then they all go out of the room. The shot returns to Holly, who continues to write on the paper with her quill. This lasts several minutes, and then the music changes again and the music cuts to shots of the black figures - they are sitting in a circle with sticks at their feet. They all appear to be young and are very much in tune with each other. Then they all laugh. Then another man (the one standing between the two brunettes) gets in the center of the circle - Holly then looks at him then turns to the camera and continues to draw with her fingers as the music swells and we get a close up of the three figures with the black male

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this about 10 years ago or something, I believe it was in Germany, it was actually directed by this other director, the movie is about an American guy that goes to the Middle East to fight in the war with the Jews.   The story is about the American guy who is supposed to be a pilot, he flies to the middle east to kill all the Jews as he sees them in their homes, but he can't do it.  He is also shot down and the Israelis rescue him and bring him back to the States and back to his family.  This was actually filmed in the United States and the movie was made in 1980 and since then it has been out of print, but it's still in my collection.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie. If there is a silver lining, the ending is pretty much a spoiler. But overall, it's a great movie. The acting is good, the story, while a little cliché, is pretty believable. Some of the actors have gone on to bigger roles and I feel as if they were being rewarded by the fact that they had a good time doing it. If you haven't seen any of the other versions of this movie, I highly recommend doing so. It deserves a watch and you will be pleased. The final two scenes are awesome.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We get to see one of the most compelling performances in a film ever made by a starlet. At the time she was only 16 and so was still a bit too young for the screen, but when she starts she is a natural.  Her face is so cute and her body has a feminine elegance.  We also learn that in the early days of filming she wasn't sure who she was going to be playing because of the casting director, which in retrospect was no biggie because  you don't need to know that a film is a big box office bomb to be in a bad film.  But this movie is a box office success.  It stars Marla Frazee and it has a very simple story about a man and woman who are both in love with the same man who has a problem with being an alcoholic.  Their lives are affected by it.  The script is very simple: the two lovebirds are in love, they don't work out, they have sex, the man leaves and they both die.  A very simple, straightforward story.  This is not a movie made for starlets and this one is not made for teenagers.  It has all the ingredients of a good time which also happen to be a box-office bomb. But then  it does have a lot going for it.   There are a lot of good actors in it and none of the roles are played by women.  I loved Marla and the girl I saw in the pictures I saw were pretty close to their performances.  All the actors are well known and are talented and good at their roles.  And it has the most beautiful scenery in the film.  It's very hard to make a good teen film but this one did a good job.  With Marla, the movie is not good but it is not bad either.  She makes the two characters she is in love together and the story is not complex but its still interesting, interesting enough for you to want to watch it over and over.  Like I said before the only part of the film that is not for teenagers is the alcohol scene.   We get a good laugh every time we see Marla do something stupid, especially when she takes a drink from the beer that she has left in the car.  When she takes the drink we see her taking her pants off which was another amusing element to the film because it reminded me a bit of a girl I know (
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I really like this movie. --------------- The movie is very interesting. The movie takes place in an American prison in early 1940s. --------------------------- The Prisoner: -------------------------- The main protagonist, who is a soldier in the war against the Axis during World War II is called 'Prisoner'. He is a very intelligent man who has a pretty good life. He is quite popular with other prisoners, also his cell mate. A pretty big fight between two prisoners breaks out. Prisoner is killed. It is supposed to be an accident that killed him. But how can a prisoner die from an accident when there is no doctor there to heal him? The 'Doctors' are too busy to get to the spot and get him a proper medical care. So, he is killed again. But the 'Doctors', despite their best efforts, cannot do anything to the killer. But, somehow the evil person gets away. Prisoners are told to get rid of him in no uncertain terms, no matter what it takes. But can a man die so easily from an accidental death? It is all made very realistic, that is it. The story can keep you for a long time and will make you think about the war in a new way. -------------- Rating: -------------- --------------- ------------------------ A great action movie which is very entertaining and easy to understand. ------------ I'm going to watch the movie again...  favorite favorite favorite favorite  Well, this is not a classic movie per se, but for this sort of story, I suppose it will have something for everyone. It's like a cross between 'The Manchurian Candidate' and 'The Last Detail'. It is the first of many such "crime of the century" movies that we'll get in the 70's and early 80's. It certainly puts the "prison" in "prison". The film is very long. It does feel a bit long. I think one of the reasons the filmmakers shot it in 70mm is to cut a bit of the movie, but I don't understand how they managed to cut it down. The acting isn't very good. I can't really blame them because of the time limitations, or they wouldn't have needed to use so much. I believe they only filmed in 70. The cinematography is very good and the music is very well used. The sound effects are very good, though the voice-over for the "dead" prisoner sounds a little forced.

Write a positive review about a good movie: -------------------------- [I'm sorry to be short. I know that some readers may wish to avoid it, but I have an obligation to present a good example of the way science fiction and fantasy can be done today. Yes, I'd like more, and I know we have the second half of the film, but to me this is about the best science fiction picture ever made. The only "question" I have with this picture is: how did they do this?"] --------------------------- This picture was one of the first that came out on American video. It was made in 1977. It is a classic of the old school science fiction. And I don't mean old school, I mean like the old-style science fiction films were made. They had a sort of a futuristic feel. And they were about the future of the world. The city is now being destroyed by the evil scientist, a guy named Stacker Pentecost. And the story goes that a group of people start taking matters into their own hands and the rest is pure science fiction...I mean, it was the kind of "science" that was going on back then. The planet was dying and the only chance to save it was to "reprogram" the Earth. They would have to make them more "human". One person they send with a small device that would "re-program" people. And then one morning you would wake up and they would have turned you into a normal, happy human being. No matter how much you ate, what your color or the way you dress, nothing was wrong with you. The story follows this group of normal people who, by some miracle, are able to save the planet by changing all the people on the planet, using a small computer called a Cog, which they created and which is based on the same technology as the computer that was used to "make" the people of the future. The plot seems to be a rather simple one. The humans of the planet have gotten too lazy and they have gone and done it all for themselves. But they are too lazy to "think", they just sit around and do whatever they have been programmed to do and live their lives. One day, they run into an old man who wants to "save the planet", but this man is a complete idiot who has no idea what is going on and he turns out to be their best friend. But he doesn't make the "mistake" of saving the planet. He
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I've never been a huge fan of horror movies, but in the case of this one... this film is pretty great. It's a bit over the top at times. I was quite scared at first and it took a while to warm up to it, but once you get started, this is one of my favorite horror movies of all time! I loved the way the story is told, as well as all the gore in the movie (although it's not really gore, it's just there to add to the atmosphere.) But one of the best things about the movie, and what makes it my favorite, is the ending! That ending is simply brilliant! It is an awesome idea to have a monster come out of the sea that could kill a whole ship and a bunch of people. The movie does a great job in showing the horrors of this situation. You see this huge beast with a fish for a head that starts to feed off of these men... you think it's bad, but you'll go along for the ride. It doesn't take long to find out that this is a very bad, very dangerous situation. The monsters in this movie are the most horrifying I've ever seen. The whole cast is great in this one. The writing is great and the direction is excellent, it is definitely worth a watch. It'll leave you terrified. I loved this movie and I hope you will too!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I had a wonderful time together watching this movie and it's the story about a mother and her kids who are traveling the country looking for their father. They stop in a nice little town by a river to get some wood for a fire and they run into a man who is looking for a young girl to help him with a farm and he runs into the wrong family who thinks he is a drunk but is a very nice person and tries to get the young girl back. They all go to the next town where they run out of money and they are going to have to get someone to help them until they find the young lady. When they find her the man they were looking for the other man asks if he can sleep with her. She turns him down flat as she doesn't want to sleep with a married man. They find that his father is a deadbeat so they take her away and he keeps looking for her to bring her back and she finds that he has lost his job and is too old for her. He also keeps her in bed and he sleeps with her until she realizes that she has never slept with anybody before and she wakes up and gets the heck out.  The end of this movie is very funny but it does have a good ending and the children do go on to live a happy life with their new found parents and the family of the young man that they slept with. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved the cast of this film and I really enjoyed the story.  The way it was told was good and the way that it was done really set it apart.    I did like that the director didn't waste a lot of time and went from one subject to the next in a very short amount of time.  As for the acting, I thought everyone had fun and were really good.  I was glad I had the chance to see the film and it really made me feel better about my life at the time.   The story is very interesting and I do like it when movies do a good job of showing different sides of the people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't want to come to you all with an 'I told you so' sort of review, because we've all seen the previews of this thing. And for those of you that haven't seen this movie in which a group of teenagers are on a school field trip to a rural village in the Middle-East, you get the idea. It's a story about children being taken on what can only be described as a crazy adventure, only to find a more dangerous place behind it. Now this is a good thing. I know, but for some reason I can't get over the fact that the movie is set in Israel, and that the film isn't really about the kids going on this trip, but rather about Israel itself. And not to get into a long, wordy review here, but here goes. I think this is one of the best movies of the year. Yes, it starts off with some really stupid jokes, and not just that, some really dumb characters, but by about half way into the film, they're stopped and we're treated to some truly good, really funny, really touching and touching scenes (which makes you want to stay until the end!). A bunch of teens on a field trip is a great theme. This is a movie made for kids to see, which I think is a pretty good thing, and if you've got young kids then you're going to love it too. Also the fact this movie was made in 2014 really shows. I'm sure there were far better films made in the year 2014, but I've gotta give kudos to David Fincher for trying to show a new style of film making (for his age group), and how he handles his actors. And to the movie makers, the fact you're making these films for your kids, I like it, you're welcome.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To begin, a really fun movie. I felt at ease with the characters, and I was able to see them as a united family. The comedy really works for me here, and it does take some work from the viewer too, but it really works. If you don't care at all about the movie itself, then you will probably enjoy it too.   I didn't really see this movie for comedy. I like comedies, and sometimes I need to laugh, but for a comedy it does not work. For starters, there is not much actual comedy. Not much going on here. There is not a lot going on that will keep you in a light mood. There are no jokes. The only things the characters talk about is how much money they have, what they think about each other, and how stupid their respective boyfriends are.    The funny scenes I did not understand was how stupid the characters seemed to be. It wasn't that they said something dumb and that's how it stuck. It seemed like the characters were just saying stupid things that didn't fit what was happening. Sometimes the camera would get in the shot and take a shot, but I wasn't sure what the hell was going on. This is where things started to get a little disturbing. It seems like the girl that was trying to be a girlfriend to the character is actually a little kid who is pretending to be her sister. They would be playing around, and she would be pretending to pretend to be the little sister, but really she was playing around with her sister's body. It was a pretty weird thing. After this weird thing started happening, it would be a nice cute scene, but after a short time, it was back to being a gross thing. I could get off on watching these kind of scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Mummy starring Tom Cruise and Annabelle Wallis is one of those rare examples of how to make a good film out of a bad one.  This was the film that made Cruise look his best, and it was also one of the best films to come out of Universal in the 90's.    I have been a fan of Cruise ever since the first installment of Born On The Fourth Of July.  From the first film to his new adventure in the Underworld series, The Mummy, Tom Cruise has been an amazing success in the acting world for the last 20 years.  He has been very lucky to make some of the most popular franchises of all time, and I can't wait to see what he has in store for the new film.       I didn't expect anything more from the Underworld movies before I saw them.    After The Mummies  I was so disappointed in what I watched that I thought it may never happen.  In all honesty they seemed rushed and rushed to the point of making you hate these characters.  There were so many times that I hated the writing, and the direction was just so rushed in every scene.  The new characters are a bit more well rounded, but they have one of most unsympathetic villains that I have ever seen.  I could not believe that a movie made by Universal was this bad.  If you love the Universal characters then I don't recommend you go and check this out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------ "The Thing" is the first film in the first movie series about a science fiction film entitled 'The Thing'. The film follows the life of a scientist called Henry "Big" Morton (Oscar Isaac), who goes up to the Antarctic to find the wreckage of a submarine which disappeared there in the summer of 1957. The expedition consists of him, his crew mate Henry (Walton Goggins) and a young scientist (Melanie Lloyd) who is also sent up. All of them are working together to locate the object. The film is full of action and it shows how much danger they are in even though there are no other dangerous creatures around. The action is so well done that it is a hard film to watch. The only thing that could be better about it is that this was the first time that the film was used as a feature film for television. The way that the story is told is so compelling that it really made it a great horror film in that it gave its audience a real scare. There are so many great things about the film, such as the characters, the action and the atmosphere that makes it a very strong horror film. The sound also does well and the director has a great deal of confidence in that he really made a horror film out of an ordinary science fiction plot. ------------------------- - Rating: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Movies to watch:    -   The Thing (The Thing) (1958)  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The title "Tales from the Crypt" probably tells its story.  From the very first scene a man is hanged by his own hand.   He tries to warn the people that the vampire who takes his life is coming so his friends will be saved but everyone knows that no one can resist that curse!  After he is hung, the man looks around for a way to survive but finds that the only way of escape is to be buried alive!    The story starts as a normal horror story with the man being a bit scared and going into the ground and coming back up like a zombie.  Unfortunately the woman running the museum also notices a strange smell and goes into the grave in order to find out what has become of him.  It is not the end of the world that he is a vampire however the story leaves a very bad taste in people's mouths and is considered among the top vampire movies that were made during the 30's in the USA!   The movie was made in 1932 by the legendary Jack Clayton who would later on make some of the horror classics of the 20's.  I saw this movie when it was released in the UK on DVD in 2007 but it did not have a US release in 2004 after the original film was made for the US market.  When I saw the movie again it was in 2006 for the first time (and was a bit confused about the film as I had forgotten that it was made overseas and not just in America).  It was a great and enjoyable horror movie but I was not impressed with the direction they went with (and it certainly lacked any of the trademark vampire qualities).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this movie is good but I would never watch it again. I don't understand why the movie doesn't play off this story. It's not about the people in the story. The people in that story are completely irrelevant to the story I think. The movie is about this woman who is a mother and decides to take a vacation with her children. Her husband dies and the children need to get a new mother for their father. I thought the movie played out like it was a horror story with a twist of some sort. The twist isn't too bad except that it was really boring and I found myself rooting for the kids. It could have been played on the horror side with the twist ending but it was just a bit of a bore to me so I gave up on it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you start watching "The Shining" it's clear to the audience that it's a scary movie about a haunted house. It starts out with a young couple, Jack and Wendy. Jack is a normal, kind, intelligent man with his life back together. This movie is actually more about Jack getting a little bit of help from a girl named Wendy, who is an attractive, smart, caring woman. A couple of months ago, Jack was going through a hard time and he and his wife took a big trip to see Jack's friend, who works at the movie theater and is working on a script which is about a man (and he is almost always played by a man) who moves in next door to a family with three kids. Jack starts working there while the kids are being spoiled by their father who is often drunk and makes a mess of the place. Jack goes around town to talk to the other movie theater employees. The kids go to the movies too, and Jack is having trouble trying to get them to enjoy the movies (one of the kids tells Jack that they should try something new, but then Jack looks at his watch and realizes that the movie will be on in a few minutes) Jack and his brother are watching a movie on television when the kid who is supposed to be their cousin walks in. The kid says that he doesn't know who Jack's cousin is. They are both watching a television show about two brothers that have to save a damsel in distress. In this show, one of the brothers is a guy named Steve. Steve is very popular on TV and is a big movie star. He is also a big guy that can handle his liquor and doesn't like doing things in front of people. His mother is very much in love with Steve but has never seen the movie he is on. The two brothers don't realize that their mother has seen Steve on TV, and are sure that Steve is a total stranger. Jack asks Wendy if Steve is her cousin and she responds that maybe she has a nephew. Jack doesn't think that his mother would have seen his cousin so soon after the kid's arrival. Jack and Danny are on their way out to play a game when they see two girls getting into an argument. They think that they are looking at a kid in the movie, because he looks exactly like Steve. The girls, who are both more attractive than Steve, walk past them and Jack starts trying to talk with them. They say that Steve isn
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We don't usually get a second chance to see Michael Rooker and his gang of friends in the Marvel universe.  In fact, you could make a decent case for them being the only ones who do.  It was actually quite a nice surprise (not that it wasn't always the same thing) to find a real sense of humor in this film.  The plot was simple enough, but the humor of the film was so good you actually cared about their characters.  They even made a great appearance by Kevin Smith's Smith (as a character played by him), who just happened to be a former student of their college.  This was an enjoyable film from beginning to end, and while it's not a good Marvel comic book movie, I'd still recommend it.  Posted by Kevin M. at 3:49 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ _________________ ____________________ My name is James (James Rolfe) and I am a 28 years old man from the state of Washington, now residing in Atlanta, Georgia. This movie is the first of a series of movies called "The Rolfes", which are a trio of professional American Wrestlers who work as a tag team. They have a match about every couple of months, usually at a place called the "Bunny-Ranch". There's lots of bad blood between the three of them and one day the owner of the place, who has been in business there for about 10 years, decides that he must give this place a good shaking. The story of this film is basically about the bad blood that exists between these three men and the general bad feelings that exist between the fans. ______________ _____________________ This movie, by the time I was finished watching it, had become a piece of trash. They were pretty good wrestlers, but the general concept of the entire plot was crap. They had a match in a barn and it was supposed to be over with, and then... BOOM! We see that their match had no ending. They are supposed to have been able to finish the match and leave after it and they weren't even done! The match lasted the whole rest of the film. Not only did the story suck, but there was no reason to believe that this was supposed be a wrestling film and to top off a movie that was basically a piece the trash, the actors who were in this film did not even deliver a bad enough performance to redeem the product.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To think that I'd end up watching "The Secret of Nimh" after the great first episode of M*A*S*H was a great surprise. The ending of MASH was one of the best endings I'd ever seen and this is a great continuation of that. It feels as if it's been happening from the very beginning of the show and I think it's one of a kind. I don't think I will ever see a show like this again! "The secret of NimH" is an epic tale of a German soldier who was captured by the Japanese, tortured, turned into a human guinea pig for experiments and eventually became their best assassin. This is a brilliant story, an action-packed thriller and a great show. I just can't thank them enough for bringing us this wonderful episode with MASH and we're going to have so much fun watching these episodes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most beautiful film I've seen in a long time. I really liked this movie. I think there's a lot of great ideas in there as well as a nice story. The whole thing just feels like a movie being shot on a small, handheld camera (which is a lot more interesting to see on film). There's a certain charm to the little scenes.  There's no dialog in the film, and when there is a dialog in, it's very well done. It almost feels like it's written by a person watching it live and not necessarily an actor trying to pull off the voice.  There's really no point when the film breaks away from its setting and actually gives a story. I mean, it feels like every scene there is something going on.  It's also nice to see how people are so passionate about something. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember my first day at the movie theater. It was Halloween in 1988, and we were in a little theater called the Magic Castle, in Hollywood, California. The show was titled Ghost Town. The director of the film was Michael Douglas. He made me laugh for the whole show and I was hooked from there. This is a very silly movie. It is an original story about a group of kids that decide to go ghost hunting. They all like each other and they all like ghosts. The movie is silly and is made well by Michael Douglas and Jack Nicholson. The ending is hilarious and even better than the last scene of Halloween II.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** A really good movie. In this world where people have super strength and speed, there would be a time when they used that to help a crippled man. The man's name is Gantur. He was walking on the street when the thugs from a crime family attacked him. They beat and broke his legs. Then they used the super strength to kill him. And when he was dying, the thug that he helped called in a friend called the Big Daddy, who also had super strength. When Gantu's friend got back to his village, the Big Daddies said: "We can't let a man die. We have to save this man from the hands of these murderers and the assassins. Come, we have to take down this bastard." Now this is the reason why Gantus gets super strength from his master. When he learns what happened to him, he tells the Big Mamas: "Gantus can take down a man! There's only one problem! He's really slow!". This is not the only time that Ganturs' master makes him feel weak. Another time the Big Mama sends his henchmen to a place where Ganture lived and made him go through one of the toughest trials in the village: he had to run from four henchman and to a trapdoor, which they had also put in the path he had run. The hench men fell in and the trapdoor opened. A giant was trapped in it. Ganturus saved him but the Giant was really big. So Ganturas is able to pick a place to climb up to him. When that giant was ready to crush Gantures, the hench man that was going to kill the Giant threw a rope to him and said: "Please, don't crush Gants! Please get out of the way!" Ganturies went up to the giant and knocked him off a cliff. Now the Giant fell in a pit where Gants was hiding. The giant was also too fast for him to get up and when he did Gants found a way to escape. And now, he came to the village and told the Big Mom and her kids and they gave him a new name: Kuri. ***************** But the Big Mam was a villain! ********************* She was evil! And not only that: she was so evil that she took over her village. She thought that if she destroyed it and made it into a city

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is probably the only good one.  It takes a few risks, but they all pay off.  The movie is all about the characters.  It's a love story.   The guy, who plays the main character, is a really nice guy.  He's got a big heart and he loves his sister.  As I said, he's also a bit of an asshole.  But he loves her, and he wants to find out why they can't spend more time together.  The movie starts with the bad guys threatening the guy's sister. And then they kidnap her.  After the kidnapping the bad guy wants to make a profit, so he sends a guy to kill the girl.  Because a bad guy has to get his point across.  And when he is out looking to kill his sister, we see her in the window.  For the movie to end, the good guy goes to stop the bad bad guy. But the bad one just kills him.  What a dumb guy. The movie is full of funny moments. It's very well acted, but the only one I found that really took my breath away was when the guy was looking for the girl who disappeared.  When he found out that she had moved out, he was overjoyed.  I liked the way they showed her walking around.  Another funny moment was when they were walking down the street, and a kid is running in the middle of the street.  Now the big mistake was when he said, "Goodbye."  Instead of, "Thank you," I think he should have said,  "Good luck" or "Good going." And then he walks away.  There are a few minor things to nitpick, but other than that it's a great story, and it's definitely worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When this movie first hit a few years ago it was a huge hit. A film with great dialogue, amazing story and a really cool soundtrack (not to mention great performances). Now with a remake and everything it looks like a total flop. Well I'm not going to say it is bad in a negative way (although a few of the scenes are cheesy) but it is not as good as it was 10 years ago. Yes it is a remake of the original but not as original as in the original. The same things are done but now the story is almost completely a rehash. They have put a lot of money into the plot but there is not much to it anymore. The dialogue and story is still there but the characters are almost forgotten. The music is pretty good but it really doesn't add much to the movie. The only thing that made it better was that the voice actors were in great shape.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sons of the Devil is the tale of a group of brothers and sisters who live in a small mountain town in the Pacific Northwest where they grow up in harmony with a mother and a father whose faith and support is the foundation for a happy, happy family.   When a boy named Tom (played by Jack Black) is attacked by a monster, everyone turns to them for help.   But when his parents are killed in a boating accident in the night, they all wonder where the boy went and have been missing him.   The monster in the woods is actually a boy in drag and his true identity and motives are something of a mystery.   Things really get complicated when a strange lady (played, in what is surely a role-reversal, by Frances McDormand) appears on the town's doorstep who seems to know exactly what has happened to Tom.   Written, directed, and acted by a veteran of the comedy circuit, this film was a hit with audiences at the Sundance Film Festival.   A remake has been in the works since the mid-1990's and seems to have been a huge hit, so the film's writer, director, and stars decided to reunite in the hope of making a feature film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________ As a movie with little to no plot, and very little characterization, it's no surprise that the movie had a bad reception from most reviewers on IMDb. What was surprising was that most reviewers were mostly positive. I really wanted to like this movie. It was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It had a nice style and a great cast, and that's always a good thing. Although, there are several plot holes, a few odd decisions by the director, and a very disappointing ending that made me go... "whoa, is that how you'd like to see the end of a movie?" Overall, this was a fun movie with a good cast and an enjoyable style. However, the flaws were numerous, and even a decent director should have been able to solve them.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is not a comedy as much as a dark comedy. As much as I like the humor, it has some pretty heavy undertones. However, it does bring some of the horror of a small town to the large country. The movie is definitely not for the squeamish. But it does contain many of the familiar features of the Old West. I've had this movie on video before and found it fairly funny. So it seems that I'm not alone in my love of the movie. I'd say, it's the kind of movie that should not be forgotten.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a short little movie about a man who works in a restaurant and has his wife, two kids, and a dog. The movie has nothing to do with the whole'meat eaters vs. vegetarian movie' thing, it's really a simple story about a little man who wants to eat his dog but is scared he'll get sick. When he does get to eat it, the dog dies, causing a terrible scene where he loses control and goes crazy, as well as the owner who has to call the police, who show up and scare off the man. All of this is a bit of a relief from the rest of the movie where a few people are involved with the meat industry, a woman trying to sell her own meat, and some children trying to protect their home from being eaten. The main story arc has a few minor characters who appear and eventually disappear. I wouldn't watch it just for the meat eating, but I like the fact that this movie was made in the early 20th century.   Oh yeah, the ending is kind of funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As expected of a movie about a bunch of weird, deranged, and dangerous people, the movie itself is not really one that I would go for, but I suppose that's the point.  In this movie, a young girl (Tricia Cornwell), and her friend, (Toni Collette) take a ride in the "Cemetery". They meet a group of old, creepy people there who talk about the death of their loved ones and the mysterious "Dead Sea", (a place deep in the Dead Sea that has no sunlight). They then try to help the Dead Souls of a person called "Rudolph", a guy who is in his early seventies who is trying to figure out his own life.   A young man by the name of "Culpepper" helps them and after a while, they get involved in a whole bunch of shenanigans that they didn't really understand beforehand and the movie doesn't really start making sense until they find a strange machine.  A mysterious man named "Dale", (Ben Johnson) comes in and tells them that he can bring the spirits back to their bodies if they will pay him and then they go to the cemetery. Then they meet a bunch more old folks, some of which talk about all sorts of things that aren't entirely understood (or at least not completely understood to the characters in the movie). Some people also start acting crazy and doing strange things that are not entirely understood.  After the movie begins, they realize that a group called "Mister X" (John Cleese) and a woman named "Penny" are somehow involved in this mess and they do a little more investigating. This ends up not being entirely well taken care of, though. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There isn't any real reason for this story to end. It's been told a thousand different ways, and every time a new version is published it feels like more of the same. A lot of stories fall prey to the "hero needs to grow up to save his people" problem:    Well, the original story is pretty good, and there were a few nice surprises in it too. It had a few flaws - for instance there's the issue that everyone in the world knows all about the Black Panther and he doesn't even want the name, but he's pretty much a good guy and it was nice to have him back. But I'm not sure the sequel can deliver the same story. It is very different from the first version. The bad guys are much less interesting - most of them are still very bad, and all of them have one thing in common - they know Black Panther. It seems the writers got too carried away with their "twist" ideas and were not very good at keeping the story interesting.  I was actually pretty fond of the story before. I've heard it before and like it so much that I would like to have heard a sequel. But unfortunately I've had to wait two decades to get a sequel so if it were any good it would probably already be published. So I think it's safe to say there's no chance I'll be seeing Black Panther Part 2 on the big screen. But hey, there are plenty of other ways to spend $6...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best I've seen in a long while. I really like the way the two heroines fight and I have to admit they are really sexy. I don't think it is the sex that is the best feature but the acting that it gives. I do think it would have been better if they had used someone who knew the martial arts and I didn't think their fighting style looked like that. Overall this is definitely worth a watch and one of my favorites to date.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie from the first time I saw it and haven't watched it since. My first thought when I heard about the sequel was "This is going to be even better" and then I watched it. I thought the character's chemistry was fantastic and it seemed to be more of a character focused movie. I loved the way the actor's were playing the characters and it was really interesting to me. I was happy they didn't show the scene where the man got the bullet in his head, I loved it. The ending is really good! I would recommend this movie to everyone who is a fan of movies, music, and tv. I recommend the movie to anyone who likes a good thriller with some suspense and comedy thrown in. I didn't laugh once, but you should look for a good laugh here as a lot of the humor gets old pretty quick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, this movie had a great story, great characters and a plot that had twists and turns in it. Then you meet a girl with no memory but who is able to recall the past. Who would have thought that in a movie so serious and heavy handed, a movie about memories and love would be so funny. The movie starts out on a nice note. I really didn't like the name "L'Estrange" though, it sounds too French and not French enough. It was the story, the characters and the whole plot that made me laugh a lot. I have to say, though, that this movie is not the greatest I've ever seen, but it is a very good movie. The character development of all the characters was very good. And yes, the movie is heavy handed in some places but that can be a good thing for some scenes. And in my opinion, it is one of the very few French movies I've seen (well, okay, it's not a great movie, but then again it's a French movie made about a French guy). I think it's very funny, not so much on the action stuff like we saw in some other French movies like "Crimsons". In fact, this guy plays by Richard Attenborough is one seriously funny guy and when he's having a nightmare, I loved it. At least when he talks, I did. He speaks in French all the time and it's the most annoying accent I've EVER heard. I mean this movie takes place on the Isle of Skye. Where the French accent is so popular, I was sure it wouldn't be the right choice. However, the director and the writer put a lot of thought into it. The scenes with the English boys are fun as well. They are also very serious about some things, but still have a lot to laugh about and this movie makes me smile a lot about our English heritage. I thought that "L" was directed by a very nice person with a very solid French sense of humor. It has great acting by all, especially Richard Attencamp. It's a great experience to be a part of this movie and it will stay in my collection forever. I was also looking forward to seeing it again when it came out on DVD for me to watch over and over again. Now, it would have been nice if the movie was a little longer, but with this short runtime, I would not complain about

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A few years ago the studio that brought us "Back to the Future" and "Rocky IV" made a movie called "Ghostbusters". They were obviously trying to take the credit for some of the early popular science fiction movies that had come out the previous year. And the result was a very good movie. I really like the special effects for a time and the action scenes are fun (especially the subway stuff). The movie doesn't feel like "movie" at all. The plot seems to be more like something that would be found in a "Haunted House" type story. One of my favorite Ghostbusters is a short film with all of the original actors (the ones who played the original Ghostbusters). It also shows how easy it is to do this kind of thing. It has all of these things working together to create an entertaining movie. And even the plot doesn't really get too complicated. It's just a good old fashioned ghostbusting movie with all the action and humor you would expect. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The fact that this is actually a movie, instead of a movie made just to cash in on the success of the film Star Trek:  The Motion Picture.  It is a movie that is so good, that you'll be glad it's not a movie.  One that will make you wonder just how many people really are still in the dark about Star Trek.    A movie that will keep you entertained and talking about it for a few days afterwards.  "My name is Jean-Luc Picard.  The captain of the Enterprise.  I would like to thank my commanding officer, Dr. William T. Riker.  As you can see, we have an excellent crew."  Star Trek, " The Inner Light  I found The InnerLight to be the most original Star Trek movie to date.  If you've ever wondered what it would be like to see a completely new Star Trek film, this is a good example of what you might see on the big screen.  This is a story that doesn't rely on the familiar tropes and characters.  All of the familiar elements that come from Star Trek are incorporated.  We're introduced to the crew of the USS Enterprise when they return to Earth from their space mission.  They are welcomed by the crew at the Enterprise where they find out about a deadly asteroid approaching the earth.  Then, it's time for the Enterprise to go into orbit around the asteroid and find a way to stop it from striking the earth by altering the trajectory of the asteroid.  At first, it all looks so simple.  However, you'll soon find that you're watching something that's truly original.  There are a lot of interesting plots woven throughout the film.  It has a great cast of characters and even has some memorable voice over work from Leonard Nimoy.    What makes this stand out from the Star Trek movies made before is the fact that we see the crew members do a lot more than just sit around and watch the crew talk about how to save the world.  You'll find that the script for this movie is full of surprises.  My favorite character in the movie is Spock.  He's the only one that's a real scientist.  Spock is a much different character than you're used to seeing in any other Star Trek or Star Trek Movie.  In the movie, Spock says "I am not a machine. I cannot be programmed. I must be
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went to see this as a film to watch with some friends before a dinner party.  They liked it quite a bit and I did too.   It's really a very good comedy!    The movie starts off fairly funny.  I think the writer, Jim, had a great time in New Zealand filming this.  He's a very funny man.  For whatever reason, the first thing he thought of was to create a whole set of fake New Zealanders.  This was supposed to look like a set of tourists from New Zealand who just happened to be staying in a hotel in Hollywood.  After getting them all to come to the hotel, the guys get to have a good laugh in each other's presence.  They then leave on a wild goose chase to find a real tour group.  The tour leader of the group is the owner's brother, Mike.  When Mike gets into a little bickering with the tour guide, the tour group gets a bit worried.  Mike is a good guy who has a good life, but the family of tour guides do not have one.  That's when Mike is hired for a short time to run the tour company.  But Mike has a secret.  While there are three of them on the tour, Mike had a fourth member on his payroll, a guy by the name of Bill.  Bill is the tour manager for a few nights at a time.  After some more bickery, and some hilarious mispronunciations by all the members of the tour party, Mike is sacked.  It's funny seeing how Mike doesn't want to leave the hotel and all the fun he is having with the fake New Zealers.    This film also had lots of "dumb jock jokes".  When we first get to see the fake tourist group, we see a bunch of the characters in the hotel lobby.  Before we even know they are fake people, they are the only ones who seem to understand Mike's humor.  In one scene Mike comes in to see if the group are still here.  As soon as he sees them, he is laughing like there were never any New Zealand tourists around, let alone fake New Zealandese.  One of the funniest things is when the fake tourists are getting ready to leave, the fake Mike stops the tour to tell them the tour is over for this week because the whole group

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Raymond Chandler. This is a classic tale set in the 1920s when gangsters of the "old school" like Al Capone (Harold Pinter) and "Gentleman" Frank Costello are in the process of turning the city of Chicago into a criminal haven. There is one problem, however: Frank Costeller's young son is missing. Frank wants the world to know about the missing boy. But his friend Jack is a hard and fast detective who refuses to believe that a missing boy can be a victim. His suspicions become reality when he stumbles across a gang of murderers, who kidnap Jack. However, Frank's determination to find Jack pays off when the gangsters are killed one by one as Jack is taken to Frank's headquarters. The gangsters, who are all played by actors, are a little rough around the edges and it is clear how much trouble they will get into. However they are also an entertaining gang. The plot is very interesting but the screenplay, however entertaining, is over long. I found the movie enjoyable and quite good. As it happens, I also enjoyed the "crime movie" genre much more than the "gangster" genre.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Crazy, funny, well directed and well written. I liked the idea of a couple of girls, a nurse and a doctor, who have been together for over 100 years. When they were newly married they had a baby that was then taken away. The wife was given the baby and the daughter the parents left with in the trunk of the car. They lived a very quiet life in a rural area for a couple years. A young family came looking for their lost father but they had no clue that it was their father. I just hope the book comes out before it becomes a commercial flop.

The plot is to follow the actions of three individuals that are members of the        Rikers Island jail cell. These three individuals are:   George Harrison,    a sad old man,   played by Harrison;  his faithful sidekick Joe Boyd (played by a very good Richard Dreyfuss),  a     mentally retarded young boy,   to  act in his stead for three days;   Tommy Dorsey,, an extremely stupid and   physically frail young woman who is to act in the place of Tommy Dorian. The plot of the film is as follows:  A young woman named Miss         The film is not a great example of acting in that it is filled with a lot of  glorious stupidity,  and the   character of   Miss   Harrison  is a complete and utter moron!   This is an obvious case of a person that is not mentally capable of living a normal life, it is a comedy in that they play all the parts of the characters in one take that has more than a slight resemblance to a performance by  George   Harrison.   Harrison is a character who is not well and should not be allowed to represent a society that allows him to be in jail. This is a very bad movie that has the appearance of being a very entertaining comedy, as well as a pathetic story about a pathetic old guy in the center of New  York City!  I give this one a 4 out of 10!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film opens with a short, but very effective, flashback of the events leading up to the events of the film. The film has the typical high school "I've seen the ghost at the school dance" setup, but it also has the "This is the year of the ghost" plot twist.  While the two aren't the usual pair of young lovers, in this case a very attractive girl named Lacey is apparently having an affair with a boy who is also a student at their school. Lacey's boyfriend has a crush on her, and is also friends with her crush. When his crush notices that Lacey has moved out, he invites the two into his home and proceeds to have a sex-drama with his boyfriend. Lace has become the victim of a ghost! While the ghost seems to be having a little fun with Lacey, the other students and other people in the area don't know how it got there. The story of a young lady getting in over her head as a victim of the supernatural, while the story of her boyfriend and other kids at their schools get involved in their own problems with the paranormal is something I have seen plenty of, and it is a very cool film. I will see this again just to see if Lacey will be able to break the ghost's hold on her!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "In a genre of'mystery of the century,' the picture of the young girl's search for love will keep her entertained, but not too long." – New York Times "Rafal Pawluszewski's new film is superbly made and deserves a huge audience. It is not the first film in a long sequence about the search for the Holy Grail. In fact, it's the fourth. " The quest is by far the most interesting, the most intriguing, and probably the most authentic of them all. The filmmakers are not trying to make the story of "The Seven Keys to the Grail" more popular. Instead they focus the story on the characters and they use the Grail as the primary focus of the story. Theirs is not a "girly" story; they are very serious about the quest itself. "The seven keys to the grail" are the keys the knight in shining armor, with his friends, the King, the Witch, and the Lady of the Lake, who is supposed to find the Grail within seven years. Each member of the group is supposed, by his or her own desires, to have the "key" to the great treasure that lies within the walls of the castle. The knight in armor is the only one who has the key to the Holy Sword; the others, and especially the King and the Witch are not interested in the Grail, and are only interested in power, wealth, etc. As the plot develops, the characters learn to use their abilities as they gain the power to achieve the objectives. The film is based in a fantasy world, where magic is more real that in our world. The magic used in the film is similar to the magic used by the Japanese warriors to defend themselves against the Mongols. They were able to use magic in a very effective manner which has not yet been surpassed. The story is full of adventure; it follows the adventure of the Knight in shining Armor. In the beginning, the film shows the hero and his friends in his humble place in the castle, surrounded by a few servants. Then the hero becomes the head of the party and he makes the first and important step towards his goal. There is a story about the Knights of the Order of Malta. They are the only society that uses magic on a regular basis in Europe. However, they are no ordinary knights; they wear long swords, which are said to be the only weapons that can resist the powerful magic of the Grail

The story is straightforward and easy to follow.  I was a little disappointed that the ending wasn't as dramatic as I was hoping for.  There were several moments when I thought that my favorite character died, but he miraculously survived and it didn't make much of a difference.  However, it was a great way to end the movie.  Overall, a good action movie that I recommend.

It focuses on a group of inmates, the "Bugs", who get caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse. They become so used to the life of crime that they forget that it is just an entertainment that they may or may not enjoy.   The actors are all excellent; Tom Berenger (a nice guy), John Candy (a great role model, who just plays the best part), and Robert Duvall (a fine character actor).   I was a fan of the Bugs before I was ever in jail; they all made me laugh out loud.  The dialog is brilliant; everyone keeps saying, "Don't look for the exit!" in a very well-written and funny way.  This will be a great laugh with everyone you know.

The two boys, named Harry and Tom, find themselves alone in a small hotel, and while Harry is having no trouble fitting in to his new environment, it's Tom who has some serious problems getting used to his surroundings, which seem to be a perfect replica of the hotel where he used to live. After a night of drinking, Harry and his friend Charlie, who can't get enough of Harry's 'new' friends, decide to take on a job for a day. They are to meet a man who is having a party at a local hotel, but before they can do anything, a drunken Tom, and his friends decide to go to the same party. While trying to get the two boys in the car, Tom gets into trouble with a cop, and Harry's girlfriend, Lucy, who gets the boys to stay at her house for a while, in hopes of giving them a break from the bad boys who keep knocking on their doors.

I would love to see this movie in theaters because a lot of thought went into this movie, the dialogue is great and the action is impressive.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie opens with a couple having dinner at a country club in a golf course full of golfers. After they get some drinks and make the decision to head out to the country, they end up driving around in a hot rod and get a stop from the police for running a red light. They drive off to go on a picnic at the lake but they crash into an old lady at the edge of the lake and are arrested. After being put into jail, a woman comes out and the police put the woman in a chair and ask her if she is a virgin and she says "yes". They get her on a chair at the jail but the woman tells them that they are not doing their job properly. The police keep talking about the woman giving a child a bad name but she keeps saying that it is not the child, it is her. The woman tells us that her husband has been stealing from her and that she will not stop until he is caught.  The movie moves on to the woman at the end of the day who is very angry at the police. She tells them how much she has been abused and what it feels like to be hurt. When they try to arrest the husband of the woman she yells and kicks him and knocks over a lamp and it is covered in blood.  When the couple gets out, they take a few steps and they get hit and run over again. The wife gets into the car to drive away but the husband gets in and she goes over the top. He hits the woman over the head and pushes her off the bridge. This is about as horrible as this movie gets. They finally find the husband and the wife is in a hospital and then they try and get to the lake where the murder took place.  At the lake, they run into a woman and they fight and she starts crying and then the husband kills her. It is horrible. The couple goes back to the couple's house and they are having a meal but there are no children.  It is a very sad and depressing movie. A very good movie if you need an anti-war movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dirty Harry is a good thriller (if you can say that about a film about a man with a gun, a black suit, and a long time in a no-win situation), in which a good guy (Harry Callahan) is in a position of great power. The only thing he doesn't know is a terrible secret that may get him shot (a woman is murdered by him in cold blood), which is in danger of getting out (in the old Western way, the killer gets his hands on the real killer; the bad guy has also learned a lesson not to mess with the good guy. One can easily believe that if the good guys in real life couldn't shoot the bad guys in film, film would be a lot duller). Harry, who has a lot of trouble controlling his emotions (he is also a murderer himself, but Harry wants to live and is unable to), sees the other killer on the cover of a movie (an early silent film) in which he is shown as a hero. The killer was a young boy, who is really no-good. He has a real-life problem, which is that he has killed two boys, and it is obvious that one killed before the other. Harry does nothing to stop him, but just talks to the boy and asks him how he really feels. He's a good man, but he cannot do the good things in this story, and the good-guy hero (who happens to be the real guy) is just not enough to put things right. There is something very moving about this film. Harry wants so much to take his revenge, but the real bad guy, who was the killer in the real-live murder, doesn't want to do it. The film ends with Harry telling his son (I am a bit embarrassed to say that Harry was my father's friend and that he used to come over sometimes when he was sick) that he can "look forward to something bigger". He was wrong. 1/5 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original movie's story is a simple tale about a man who wants to make a living by selling "mystery" pictures (and who, in one scene, wants to be a police officer who investigates things like this). His plans are foiled by two boys (played by Robert Mitchum and Peter Ustinov, both of them great; they've been doing it for years) who happen upon him working on a picture and ask him about it. He gives the boys a brief description but gives up on it and instead offers them a picture of a woman who has killed. In true Hitchcock style, he tries to keep these boys from getting the picture; then the boys go to the police and the picture is found by a man (played in a good and amusing manner by David Alan Grier) who makes him an offer he can't refuse. The woman in question is found murdered at a house in New Mexico, not in the middle of the desert. We also have the usual Hitchcockian set piece in the form of a long night out with the boys and the police. But then the good Mr. Houghton returns to investigate the murder (played with aplomb by Donald Pleasence) of the man who gave him the picture. It's a perfect, well-done mystery, and you should watch it.   A movie, in short, that is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces; an entertaining time as well as a fascinating look into the life of one of Hollywood's great filmmakers. The Good, The Bad, The Ugly is a great movie. The good are all fine actors and the bad are all excellent villains. What really makes The Good, the Bad, the Ugly special is the way in which it works. Hitchcock doesn't just create his plots, he takes each one and makes it work. You see, when I first saw The Good in the original movie in a theater in Toronto I wasn't convinced it was a good film. I thought it might be a great thriller or even an enjoyable action movie. In short, I was wrong. The Good works because of that incredible sense of invention by Hitchcock. He creates the plot, then you follow that plot. At the same time, he shows you how it all works on the big screen, and it all comes together to make an effective and memorable movie.  Of course, what makes the movie special are the performances. For my money, no one in Hitchcock
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A small town high school girl discovers the world of adult film, a world she's always secretly wanted to enter. The movie starts out with the typical high school, girls who want to be the "top" and girls who don't know who they are. This is also the time of puberty. The girl's interest in her body changes drastically. She becomes more interested in the male teachers in the school than her male friends. And it's not long before the movie takes a turn that is so outrageous it leaves one in a state of shock.  This film has a unique style. The girls appear to be wearing normal clothing, with their hair styled, but their clothes are very tight and they look like they're about to burst. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's a bad movie, I think.   It is a movie that is very bad.  What it really is is a cheap movie that has not been made right.  It had some people who were very poor actors.  You get in a car and you think you are going to do well, but it is all a lie.  "   The film is about the old time gangsters on the run and they take over a casino and become the rich man.  The only thing is that they keep doing this and do nothing to stop it, yet they think it is good! I would not recommend this one at all! It is bad and if anyone is into this kind of thing then it will get a bad review... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm going to assume you know this movie pretty well already, since it is an extremely well-made classic. I can't believe I had never seen it before (I don't watch much action movies). I've had to go out of my way to find a copy to watch this year because I was excited about it. There are things that stick out about this movie, like the music, the editing, etc. If anything it's a little too safe. But once you see it, you understand why it was a cult classic in the early 70s. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a great fan of movies like this. I feel they are just about good enough. I wouldn't pay money to see this movie. I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of this movie, I don't think any of my friends was. I like my sci fi with a little more depth. I don' think it would be a good purchase if you are looking for a new sci fi movie. It is good for a laugh and maybe a little of romance. There are a lot of scenes in this movie which I would say are better than the ones in the TV show. It also has a great finale to it, even though it is not much of a ending. This movie is not a classic, and you would like to see a different series after this, but this is not the one to do so. It has a lot to say, I really liked it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Citizen Kane" is one of the best movies ever made.  It is the first great movie for that era when all the top movies were like: "The Godfather", "The Lord of the Rings", "Twilight", "Dances with Wolves".  Even today people say "It is a shame that the great movie did not receive a bigger prize," like the great classics, like:  "Casablanca", "Gone With the Wind", "Somewhere in Time", "E.T.",  "The Exorcist" and "The Wizard of Oz."  These are some great movies but none of them are better than "Citizen-Kane".  "Citizens Kane" tells a very important story.  The story is the good old American story and it is told by the famous movie star, Orson Welles.  Orson was a great actor and is a brilliant director.  He used to make movies before the famous one "Cab Calloway".  He has made very good movies like "The Magnificent Ambersons" "A Hard Day's Night" and  the great movie "The Lady from Shanghai".  But, he made the perfect movie about Orson, the "Cabin in the Woods".  It tells a great story about Orsons, about the movie "Cockfight" of the 1930's.  "This is a story about what makes a hero."  The movie is not a typical hero movie.  Instead, it tells a story of Orsion's life.  Well, it is not his personal life, since it was filmed long ago.  In addition to that, the movie has an amazing plot.  A young man is kidnapped and he is forced to act as a playboy.  The story begins in a strange town and we meet Orson.  The town has become a little town because of the growing population and it has a bad reputation of crime.  And the story starts with the town hero, Orsional, being forced to come to the real world and take a job at a factory.   Orsion is a very ordinary guy who is going to do the job with his family.  There he becomes very familiar with the life, the work and the people that he will soon meet.   The town is an ordinary town with an ordinary family.   He is a normal guy who has a job
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the sequel to "The Lost Boys" which is a very good movie, but I can't imagine the film being made by Spielberg. It's just a complete waste of time to be honest. The movie starts off with some very slow and awkward shots of kids running about with nothing to do. Then we have the hero, Sam (Tom Arnold) playing football, he seems to have a good time, but the camera just lingers on him so he seems very bored and there is always something to watch around him, as if there were more of him that he is shown to see. Then one day we have a terrible accident and the school principal finds out that Sam is the only survivor. He is very depressed and thinks he is dead, but then the school nurse comes into the room and assures him there is still another student that might be alive. So we have another group of kids trying to cope with life after they have all gone missing. It is a really quite sad movie, the story is pretty pathetic and most of the people who were in the school are now in prison, Sam is really the only one that can be bothered to go through with his football team and have to go to school. But then there is a new girl (Michelle Phillips) that Sam has a crush on, who also appears to be depressed and she is a bit too good for him. In order to try to cheer her up Sam asks some of his pals to help him make his way into the school, but they do not want to help. It seems that if anything they just want to cause trouble for Sam and are just as bored as Sam is. The story moves around pretty much like an episode of the childrens programme, there are a few good bits and pieces here and there, but apart from the usual Spielberg nonsense, the movie is completely without substance.

I liked it because it's fun to watch a good little kid ride his horse through the countrysides... it's like a cross between John Wayne and John Wayne in the western... if the old John Wayne movies and John Ford's old westerns could make love, this John Wayne movie makes love....

They make a living there and soon get involved in local politics, but the local Sheriff gets involved too.  (1925)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It really is a shame that this movie has not been more well-known. It is a great old movie! The first half is a lot of fun (which makes the movie about 35 minutes long). It is the old-fashioned story about two brothers who play cards at a house in a small town. They have very different characters, but they are always playing cards. It would be a great movie if it had more cards. I am sure it would be even better if it was all black. The ending of the movie is really funny and well-done. If you like a good old-time movie, then this should be on your list.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is well-done as well as it is unique. The film is a good adventure tale and a good romp in the woods. Its action scenes are well put together and it is a fun ride. The character cast is strong and there are some nice action scenes. I recommend this film to those who like good horror and an exploration into the world of a young girl.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a good-hearted drama about a lonely-hearted guy, a wife he married who loves the opposite sex. He never had anyone. He is lonely, he is in love with a woman who is the only other human in his life.   When the wife returns to her homeland and moves in with her husband, he asks her to stay there and to be with him. But she refuses. She is a woman.  The husband does not love her or the woman. The wife is really good at helping her husband in the house.  They live in a house on a very small plot of land, with a garden and a chicken coop.  Now and then a man comes to take the chicken coo and the wife looks after him. He takes her away.  Her house is only for her.  At the end of the movie, when she is with the husband, she is very unhappy because he says: " You never loved me.  I will never love you.  You never cared about me. You never told me I was good enough.  That is why I feel bad when you don't visit me and don't speak to me. And I don't want to see you in this town.  It was good knowing you. We should have gotten married."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I've had my fair share of sci-fi. There has been a few that I've found interesting but this one really caught me. I watched it at 11pm on a school night, it felt like the best of them. I love the little touches about the crew. When they were fighting in the ocean, one of them got a big cut and it showed. There was a little girl that ran up to the group and a bunch of fish that she ate (there were three fish that looked the same; that's good!). I thought they were very creepy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dangerous Liaisons  is a romantic comedy that has been made into a comedy with a good screenplay and a good cast. It's got a strong cast with a few stand outs including Sean Young (from the original Dangerous Liaisons ), Elizabeth McGovern as her wife, and John Travolta as the father-in-law who tries to get a girl into his bed to teach her the lessons of a great man. In the end, the movie does feel like a romantic tragedy, in which everyone is falling in love, but it doesn't really seem to be coming from the relationship between the main characters. Travoltec (who played the younger Travolettes) and T-Bone (in an impressive portrayal as a widowed old man who must deal with his new wife) are both nice characters and it's great to see young John T-bone playing a major role. I was hoping that the plot would go somewhere and get more character development, but the story didn't get anywhere to where I wanted it to go. It was like watching a comedy that had been given the name of a romantic drama. And honestly, I can't say I enjoyed the film a whole lot, but I can say that if you're a fan of a good comedy, Dangerous Liaison  should be on your radar. It would make a good addition to your DVD collection.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent movie from beginning to end.  It starts out with a very well written scene of a young man's mother leaving her daughter in the care of her brother.  She has no money, no help and no friends.  This is the kind of thing that gets us to want to do something for poor little poor Sophie, but it just becomes too depressing.  Sophie is an orphan who has no relatives in the family.  That is, until she runs into a small village and is told that a big brother, a brother that she only just met, is trying to raise her there.  When she arrives he gets lost and Sophie has to go and bring him back to his family to tell them that he is okay.  The poor boy is found again in the woods where he has to run and hide in the freezing cold until he can find some friends to help him out.   Eventually he gets back to Sophie's village and starts having fun again with his new friends and his little sister.  He also has a sister of her own at a nearby town.  Her father is a very rich man and has a beautiful wife whom he never seems to spend enough time with. Sophie's family is poor and they get sick and she is forced to take care of the sick and weak, so that they can eat.  One day one of her sisters sneaks out and gets arrested for stealing a little goat.  Sophie and her friends come up with a plan to get her sister back so that Sophie can eat her, but that backfires when she catches Sophie cheating on her mother with her friend in the next village.  Finally a very angry Sophie and her best friend decide to get revenge, and take care off the village that made them.  There is a really good ending to this movie and I wish I would of had time to read a little more of it but I just enjoyed the movie too much to read all the little back story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (This was directed by J.G. Hertzler but the movie was more of a documentary about the film industry than a biopic. That said, it's still interesting. It covers many aspects of the movie world: music, film, drama, politics, politics. It also explains why some films were successful and others weren't. It shows why many directors went on to the big screen to make a living, even if the films were sometimes just average. It's not a great movie, but it's a fascinating look at the business, the politics, and how it affected society. It is one of those "must see" movies that will probably stay with you for a long time.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd like to start by saying that I don't own a cell phone; but this movie had me texting and emailing it to my friends, friends who don't even watch television. I am so impressed with how this movie came to be.  The script and dialogue is spot on and if you watch this movie, you can tell that one of the best writers in the business is working with one of his best friends.  This movie is a big-headed, self-centered, self obsessed teenager and he's trying to do too much with his life. He's just a high school student with no direction in life.  This movie has many of the same character traits that many a Hollywood romance movie has:  high schooler, has a crush on the class president, has dreams and aspirations about his future, wants to go to college, and in many ways, he's a good boy; but when he meets this girl, he falls in love! But as the movie progresses, he starts acting out and becoming more immature and out-of-control than a 14 year old can be. But who's the good guy?   A movie for teens and older audiences.

You must see this movie!" ~The film director's brother, John Waters "One of the great American classics. I have seen it a few times, but each time I think I'm seeing something different. It's quite an odd mix of films; it's strange and exciting. John Waters is the most gifted and original American filmmaker. A great gift from the gods!" ~Linda Blair "John Waters' THE DOG SITTING ON A CUSHION (1967) is his magnum opus. Waters shows us a world where ordinary dogs are ordinary people. With such high production values and an unforgettable soundtrack, this film will stay with you long after you leave the cinema." ~Seymour Cassel, Academy Award-winning screenwriter
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** Love this movie, and it shows. This movie is about a group of men who want to go on a vacation in the South. A man in a wheelchair gets his legs blown off by a train and decides to go to the next town and get a new set of legs. He meets up with an old lady who is a dancer and decides that they should have a dance and she agrees to have a song with him while they are there. She's an old friend of his father's. There are quite a few good scenes in this movie. The main character makes up his mind to go away and goes to see a doctor to do his legs. The doctor is kind of a jerk and only does what the doctor is told to do. The old lady doesn't think that it's a good idea to let a man go on vacation in such bad weather so she keeps on singing while he goes along the rails to get the leg he wants. The girl dances with him and they laugh it up and it gets kind of hot and sticky. There is also some humor in the movie. If you like comedies there is a lot of funny scenes in here to keep your interest for awhile. *********** 5 stars for the first movie I ever watched. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is hard to find a movie so perfectly filmed as "Horsefeathers". A masterpiece.   The story of these "horses" is quite simple. A group of old ladies decide to take a vacation during the autumn. They set out for the seaside at a place called "Horsesmouth". They travel in small boats which are made of canvas and wooden planks. The boat is infested with snakes and flies, so the old women decide to spend a little time "in the saddle". They stay in the boat for three days. In the morning they find a strange ship. "The Sodor Horse" is on the way to the sea. After a short voyage the crew of the Sodor arrive to the port of Horseshoe. They are welcomed by a group of pirates. They decide to rob them. In a fierce fight they destroy all the boats and the crew. The pirates flee and the old ladies get into the boat. The men of the crew are killed. They all try to take the boat back to their home town, but the boat is full of fish and the men cannot get to shore. The old ladies are so tired they get into a boat that can only take two of them. They go all around the island in search of a fishing hut. Then they are caught by a fish that kills them. After the death of the old lady one of her daughters takes over the horse. She goes to her father to ask him for money for their boat, but he does not want the money and decides to kill her instead. He makes her take up the reins and tries to walk her back to the shore. It is very funny because she does not think she is dead!   Another story: In a house of three friends and a cat all of them are talking about "The Big Green Man". They say that they were in a town where they saw something green, they were running around and the cat thought they were looking for a dead cat. Then the three friends were sitting outside drinking a beer when they saw a man with two large, green wings coming down on a horse, and after he was thrown onto the ground, they saw three little green men flying up to his head and the third man was trying to grab him. At last, he landed on a tree! The three old men say that their friend could not live after that, and the people told them to go into the house and wait for the

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really solid, realistic looking film. With a plot that's as good as the name (I didn't quite understand all the dialogue) and a cast that's a bit thin, the film succeeds because it captures a few moments of the essence of a group of friends: friendship, passion, ambition, and love. The story of how these friends formed their bond and how the first meeting took a wrong turn, only leads to the movie's ultimate ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie on my birthday in 2000.   This movie is a must see for any fan of the horror genre. It is not so scary for the main characters to be murdered in cold blood, but that is the way it happens.  The movie gives you a complete look of the world. The way the characters are shown in the world is amazing.  In the movie the characters do evil, but do it for a good reason. You must see it on a big screen if you can. This movie really should be made into a TV series or maybe a movie in itself.

The movie is about a man who is in a relationship with a woman but has to leave because she is not willing to have sex with him. His girlfriend, who he thought was a lesbian, is a homo. This is another movie about two gay people who meet and decide to break up, but don't and come back in love. The story was ok. It was funny, very funny. The guy did all the things that were funny to do. I didn't like the ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A young man in his 20's goes to see "The Great Train Robbery" in London, England.  What a movie!  It is a great adventure with a good ending.   This movie is the quintessential English story, and it has it all.  When the villain is caught, he is put on trial.  The detective asks him questions about how he found the villain.  He explains that he was standing in the train station and saw the thief.  This is a perfect story and perfect ending. And the voice of Mr. Todhunter is perfect:  This was a good story, a good film!  Rating :   A movie in which the train was stolen and the villain was caught.  The plot goes as follows: The main character (John Walker) is a train robber.  His goal is to steal a train in which a rich family was sleeping.  John's plan is to wake them up and take their money.  But the train is stolen and then the villain (David Campbell) is captured and tried to be put on the train, but it doesn't go and the train escapes.  A train is later found, with two of the robbers still on board.  Since they did not get their money, the two thieves are condemned to death.  In this movie, the train thief is John Walker.  And the train robber is David Campbell.  One day, the main character finds the train he is supposed to be on and he is the only one that can get it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You gotta love that the story of this movie is so damn good, you can even laugh out loud at it. I loved the character of the "man" who is a really evil and bad person. And then the way they were able to show us the "other side" of how these people live and how they work, as a family. It was a real pleasure to watch and I found myself laughing very hard. All the characters were real and real people, some more likable than others. One of the people was like a "good little boy". One of my favorite characters. And the "evil man" is a good villain, but not too much of a bad guy. I just think this movie will make a good "mockumentary" with a little bit of action to it. It will make you laugh a lot and make you smile a lot. Enjoy the movie and let it entertain you!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this film as a preview the night of its release in my local theater. In a nutshell, it follows the main character, a detective assigned to investigate a series of murders of prostitutes in a very grimy, dark and rundown New York City district. The films is a dark and gritty, dark story that really makes you wonder what went down in the first place. It follows a detective who is in the very early stages of his career, a rookie who has never been able to get anything right in his short career and is working his way up in the ranks to become the best detective in the city. His first client in a major investigation is a wealthy businessman, who turns out to be an abusive pimp and his mistress and is about to have the case moved up to be his next victim. This case is quickly forgotten and forgotten about, although I still can't help but think if it wasn't for a mysterious and mysterious death of one of his female underlings, who is found on the floor with a pair of stilettos still attached to her, this one might never have come to an end. All in all, a pretty good story, a bit bleak at the beginning but then it begins to slowly reveal itself. It certainly seems as though the film has a lot to show, as the detective finds himself struggling to find out what he is up against while trying to find his way to his next "victim". It doesn't really make for an easy watch because of the dark and disturbing nature of what goes down and the way that it is often filmed but then you find yourself cheering for the protagonist as he attempts to solve this crime and he does get a bit lucky when the victim is found. The violence in this one is a bit over the top and the sex scenes are all rather tame and a bit hard to watch but I think the film is more than capable of carrying itself without a lot of unnecessary scenes. It also has a fairly lengthy and fairly suspenseful ending and as I have mentioned, the detective isn't given a lot time to find that out. Grade: A
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What's here is a pretty good film. I'd like to add that in any kind of fantasy story it's a good idea to have a female character, especially one that can stand up to the main character.  Serena does so with aplomb.  The story itself is pretty well done.    A good fantasy film that's worth watching, no matter your age.

After his escape from Nazi-occupied France, Léon is recruited into the Vichyer's secret service and becomes a spy, although this doesn't mean that he is happy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the great classics. It has a timeless quality to it. A very good classic. Great casting and script. The one thing that gets missed out are the great performances by the young Kevin Costner as a young man trying to fit into his life and the terrific performances by a cast of greats. The best film made in the 40 years of MGM, the music, the story, the acting, the direction and the cast are all excellent! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was going to see this movie, because I read a review saying it was "the movie that made a difference" and that was it.  But the real "movie" is the way it portrays the life of one ordinary, normal, kindhearted and humble man.     The other characters do the occasional good thing and even help him, but they are mostly just supporting characters.  At the end, there are a bunch of scenes that do NOT have anything to do with the ending of the movie, which makes the movie much better, at least for me.  I think this is a very good movie!  And I hope there will be a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my first movie watching experiences was watching The Princess Bride. I don't remember what the title or the plot was about but it was about a girl and a guy who had a big sword that they had to get the love of the princess. I have been a sword-swinging lover ever since.  The movie starts out pretty slow and unassuming, I had seen the movie so many times before and yet I was never sure if they were going to do the sword fighting scene in the forest or if it was going to be a short montage to the beginning.   But as the movie went on I was so impressed with the fighting in this movie. I didn't see the princess as a typical damsel in distress but a woman who was strong and brave even though this was a film about a princess and a man who had to save her.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â The opening shot of a black boy jumping off the top of a building was the movie and it was good.   A boy in his second grade class falls and dies.  He gets up the next day and is told to bring his homework, his school book, to his class. Â It was the first time my son saw a white boy go to his death.    The class is divided into three groups.   The only white male in the class.    One group is to write a response to the newspaper article about a black student who was thrown from a school bus.  It was very easy to see the effect that the race of the victim has on the community.   I would recommend this movie to my students and their parents.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last House on the Left" is a well made movie by the great Stanley Kubrick.  It is a "found footage" movie with actors being shot, dragged and drowned in murky water.  It's not really found footage but it's found.              It has a lot going for it.    Well produced and acted with excellent photography and makeup the movie is a fun romp and one of the best films from the 1970's.  I had to wonder how someone could be so cruel, yet so likable.  Some of the scenes were so funny that you had to pull your hair out laughing, like the kid that throws a piggy back and the guy who thinks the girl is his ex-girlfriend.  The special effects of the movie were well done and the characters were well written.  It made me look forward to seeing the new episodes.  A great movie if you like found footage. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The good: It's a great action movie that manages to tell a story about two cops who have to work together to solve a murder, both cops are really great. There's some great fight scenes throughout the movie. The bad: ~~~ ~~ ~~ It's the first movie I've watched that I didn't like all that much. It's not bad but it's not good either. In the beginning of the movie, we see a young man go by the name of "Chico" who is being abused and killed by his mother. Then we cut to see the cops and they try to bring him in. ~~ The second thing is the whole "tentacle girl" thing.  This isn't really bad but not very good either, we can't really figure out what the tentacle is supposed to be.   And finally this is a movie about a cop who wants to solve the murder. I mean really, did you think that this movie was going to give the character something new? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last three movies have been okay, so this one is a decent movie. I don't think this is going to win any awards, but it is entertaining enough to entertain anyone.  It has all the right elements and it is a nice departure from some of the other movies this team has been working on.  The story is simple; a police man (Michael Peña) finds himself involved in an unusual situation that is more like a video game than a normal cop movie.  It is a well done movie, but doesn't have much to do with the series.   Rating: B
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My second time to see this one, I am glad I took the time to view this film in it's original form with a strong British accent and a good deal of humor. It is truly a good watch. I enjoyed it a lot. ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ I would highly recommend a viewer to view it again at the old theaters in the back of the movie theaters. ~~~ Thank you for the review. It was indeed a pleasant movie with a lovely story. I found myself laughing throughout and enjoyed the banter and banter between the characters. I didn't find anything too offensive, although it was quite violent and a bit graphic. I certainly was not offended. I do believe that there were a lot of other films of the 1930's that I missed and was thankful to see it here in its original form.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a good enough movie critic to give a negative review to a movie I love so much.   So...  ... Why do you watch movies with subtitles?   In my opinion, subtitles are the worst part of movies.  Sure you can still follow the action but sometimes it doesn't flow right, sometimes it takes too long to get back to what's important.  I prefer the movie in English with subtitles.  "I am not a doctor..."   - a young boy "It's the greatest thing ever, I'm gonna die!"   This movie was so good.  The story was brilliant.  Even though it is short it is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  If you love a good detective movie and a good action movie then this is a great movie to watch!   I watched it on a date with my lovely wife who is a fan of the movie.  It's funny, it's sexy, and you'll definitely love this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Loved the film, and the first few scenes were a nice change from the typical Hollywood fare.   The movie's storyline involves the kidnapping of a family (and a lot of children) from New Hampshire in 1971. When the parents return home from work in the summer of 1971, they're not sure if they'll be able to return. Their son, Chris, is about 12 years old and his mother is on the verge of breaking down as she tries to make sure everything turns out okay. Chris' mother has always looked at herself in her husband's eyes, but the last two years have been tough on him. His dad has died at age 56.   for me, this was a very interesting film because it really got into the psychological side of people who are involved with something like that. They're often very good at what they do and have a lot to deal with, but they're also very frightened of what might happen.   The movie also focused on how the family would cope without any communication. There was a couple of flashbacks for these folks as they went about their lives. A lot of people don't realize how traumatic these experiences can be and it shows very well on the screen. The movie itself was good. The acting by both Chris' parents, as well as the older Chris, was very good. I liked it so much that I just kept turning the movie over. The pacing was good, there was some action in it and it wasn't too long. The last ten minutes are interesting and really add a twist to the movie. The film ends with a great cliffhanger at the end and it was well done. There are a couple things I didn't like, however. The first thing I would have been fine with is the lack of voice over narration in this movie. There is a very simple explanation for why each person in the family is in the movie (with a few exceptions) and I think the audience could follow the conversation. The second thing I found odd about it was Chris' father. I know that he died about 10 years before this movie takes place, but it was so obvious that the filmmakers just made it up. If this movie had just been a family drama, the lack would be very noticeable. The ending (which I believe is what happened in the book) was also weird. There seems to be a lot more mystery about the disappearance of the children. This really could have been a terrific film, but there were a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very fun movie. The special effects are great, the story is fast paced, and the performances are all very good. The music is good too. The only thing I don't like is that there is a long "cut" of the movie where they are all in the middle of doing something else. That should have just been a longer part. It would have given a more complete picture, and more time to work with, and it would have been a better movie, too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good, entertaining movie. There is an awesome scene where the characters get on a boat and set out on their journey. The boat has a little window in the side where the sea is going to be.  They see the waves coming in and all the sea creatures are there. It's a wonderful scene. I always feel that I don't need to see the movie in order to enjoy it. There are a couple of references and references to other movies. I thought that the little cameo from the Beatles was pretty neat.  This movie was directed by Steven Soderbergh. Soderberg played an agent and was hired to write a play about the murder of a prostitute. However, he was fired when he failed to find any real evidence to prosecute her killer. He goes back to Hollywood with money to write another murder mystery. He makes it a secret that the police are on to him, but he can't tell his wife about his failure. This is very good, suspenseful and funny. This may be the best movie that Soderburg ever produced. It is very well written and interesting. I recommend it to everyone. I don�t like mystery movies and this is a very good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never read anything more wonderful than this. I loved this film, loved this story, loved every part of it, and love the fact that it was made and directed by a person that made that movie the other day. I feel like I should be at some sort of party. I feel I should have been in the theater when it was released, I just adore this film, I just love it, it is a very good movie with a lovely and very special story.  I liked this movie alot, I felt the movie could have been better, the characters are all so similar I had difficulty watching all three of them, all of them seem so real in the story of this movie. I know what you are thinking, why was the movie made in such an expensive way? Well, this movie just so happens to be the kind of movie that is produced by a small, new studio that is trying to build a name for itself. The movie will surely not be an A-list movie, but the story is very good and I'm sure the story will appeal to many, it was quite beautiful and the story was a lot of fun to watch.

They are well done for the most part, and they all have a unique look to them. The action scenes were good, and the music is good as well, but it is really all about the characters. That is a good sign. I wish I could tell you that you'll get to know a lot more about these people by watching this movie. But you'll only get the good parts of each one of these characters, and it's hard to enjoy a movie about a group of friends. I will say that the movie was enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For all its flaws, this film is a truly impressive piece of historical fiction and a wonderful watch, from beginning to end.   It is a period drama that is set in and around the great English city of London.   In one way, there is nothing particularly remarkable about the film, which is basically a straightforward story about a young man (played by Christopher Lee) whose life is changed forever by a chance meeting with a beautiful girl (played with wonderful grace by Juliette Binoche).   It may seem like a one-trick pony, but this was actually the best of films that I've seen in recent years that feature the story of a young boy coming of age.   At least, that is how the plot is presented.   The characters were not very well thought out.   They could be described as stereotypes, but it seemed to me that if they were to have their own stories, they would have been very different.   I enjoyed watching these people live, so that is a plus.   If I have a complaint, it would be that it is not as simple as simply putting a girl on the guy and having a good time.   This is a film about life, and there is a great deal going on in the background.   There are two important men involved in the story, both of whom are very much in the spotlight.   One is Lord John Russell, a man who was born to be a lawyer (his father is an Irish nobleman).   His father, Sir Walter Russell, was a wealthy landowner and he died when Lord John was still very young.   His mother, Princess Augusta, died when he was young. He is sent to live at an Irish convent for the remainder of his childhood, which does not go well.   He spends much time being a troublemaker and his sister dies from illness when Lord Russell is 15 years old.   However, despite this, he does well and he is made Dean of Westminster (a position held by the current Archbishop of Canterbury).   At the end of the film he attends the wedding of Princess Augusta (played again with great grace by Kate Winslet) and the future King Edward VIII.   Lord John is a much older man by the end (he is 68) and he makes the best out of his situation.   Although he does a few things he is not very good at, he has great qualities of character and he becomes a great friend of the hero, Tom (played in a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fantastic movie of epic proportions with a truly impressive screenplay.   This is probably one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time (which is saying something).   It really makes the most of what the book has to offer and adds in the most original plot twists and characters that I've come across (including the very original main character).    There are some really brilliant moments.  This really is a movie that does for swordsmen what the Sword and the Sorcerer did for wizards; it's all about adventure, adventure, and more adventure and that is the ultimate movie fantasy.  It's also just one of those movies that just feels like it came off the page. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fantastic, exciting, and original story about the life of a woman in the late 1800's and her relationship with her father. One of the best films I have seen so far. My rating : 6.3 The real story of Mrs. Miller Murdock, a former schoolteacher, decides to leave the small town in which she was raised to take a life of adventure. He takes off with a young woman of his acquaintance, Mrs. Linton, who is a seamstress in her own right. He offers her a job, with one condition: that he will remain the whole year in the new city of Chicago, and that he should be her employer and friend. He never expected that she would accept his offer, but as a result she must now live with him. It was not until after the birth of their first child that he realized that they were destined to be one and the same. He still hopes that he can continue a somewhat normal life in the town of Carthage, but he can't. His first wife's sudden death, the loss of his children and his son by his second wife leaves him totally destitute. To make ends meet, he works in the laundry of the old family, who give him a place to sleep in the attic of the house. Moral: Don't be that way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is so good, that I could not watch the ending until it was over. The story is really well done, and I really like the characters. There are some strong scenes where we see that the hero is the most intelligent person in the world, and it shows. You must have seen it a thousand times, but the special effects are always awesome. The special effects were amazing. It is not easy to explain why the special effect in it are so amazing, and that is a good thing. It will take you by surprise. But then again, I am impressed that the special-effects is just perfect.  And as always it is a true story that is written and directed by a genius and we get to know more about him. This is a great movie.

It takes the viewer through the ups and downs of a young man's life. The movie has been made in the style of a western but with a hint of a Chinese setting as well as having a good amount of action. The plot is predictable and has a very weak ending, however it does make for a good watch all around.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Lolita" was a movie that I had not heard of nor saw before that had a lot of the things that I'm looking for in a movie: suspense, action, suspenseful music. The movie was a good time. The plot was very suspenseful, you had to stay on your toes in the first half with the killer who had already killed a girl so many times, now she's got another and it looks like it's going to be a big surprise. The killer is played by James Mason, the same guy who played "The Shining" (a movie that should be more famous than "Lolitas"). But "LOLITA" is more than a good actor, she also has some great lines. She's a killer that has no conscience, she kills for the thrill of it, and while we know this from her past we don't know whether she is guilty or not. But the killer does try to convince us that she has some redeeming qualities and we don`t want to believe it.   A big part of the movie is also the music, which has a great mood and great tunes. While I don't have much for the music genre, I found the music to be great. The music could just keep me going and while the movie didn't quite keep up with the music in the beginning it does in the second half.  's first half is a good one, you get the killer getting revenge on a girl who has gotten him in trouble, and then we get a new character and a new girl in the story. The first half was good but didn't have enough suspense to make the movie all that exciting, and the killer seems to be the only one who wants to be in that situation. While the first part is good and there were a lot more killer scenes than in the movie, they felt out of place to me and didn't really make the story more suspenseful. In fact, the movie lost a bit of steam with the first few episodes. In the second part the killer is caught and then they go back to the story, but in the very beginning of the second act it seems the killer has been caught and we are not sure what will happen next.   The killer in the third and final part is really good. You'll get a lot from his death scene in that movie, and I hope that the sequel will be much more suspensey. Overall the movie had a good action scene and

I liked this movie and I'm glad it's here. It takes no prisoners and gives a good, suspenseful ride from start to end. It also has a decent cast of characters, but only the very important ones are played by professional actors. The rest just sit around and do their little thing, like a bunch of amateurs. It's great to see such a great future cop doing his duty.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great and very funny movie. It stars Tom Arnold, an astronaut who decides to become a police officer in a small town. He gets to the place and starts to do his job, but it doesn't really fit what he's used to doing. He meets a pretty girl and they decide to spend more time together, but in the end it doesn'n really go the way Tom wants it to. At least that's what the audience thinks. Tom has no problems making some good detective moves that help the case, but sometimes that's all that Tom is. He needs more time to mature and get a job. And, as is the case with many police movies, a lot of things happen. Lots of action! The movie has a funny and entertaining plot. Tom Arnold does an excellent job with the role. If you want to see a good detective story, do yourself a favor and give this a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ You might like to read the review by an editor, and by a movie critic, but for those who want to know what the movie is about (a few sentences about the film): I like to think I'm good with a camera, but in fact I'm pretty bad. (and even I don't see what the film is about, I only saw a few minutes before I knew it was crap.) This is the story about a girl named Sara who's going to the local art show. She is looking for her friend who has gone there with her. She has to go alone though the girl tells her if she leaves she'd be in trouble. So she goes and the girl says if she needs help to tell her friend that she'll be back later. Now the girl's only friend is a nice young girl named Anna (Lena Winger). The rest are mostly old people, I think they were in their fifties. Sara's dad is her older brother. The other dad is the other brother (and Sara's friend). So you have two guys, her friends and the guy's dad. So the girls say they'll be right back. Anna calls and says that if her brother hasn't come back by noon, that's fine. But she wants them to go to the art show later that night. Well, Sara is in the museum (it's really a gallery). All this time, Anna was watching her from the window. She sees the girls out and she calls the girl but nothing. She then goes inside and calls the other girl, too, but nothing, she also tells her to go out later and she will be back. So then Anna goes out but she doesn't get there in time. By the time she's back in the house, the girls have gone and Anna sees that her house was damaged. So there was a fire. She tells her friend to get some candles and some things, so she could help her. But Sara doesn't hear her. So now the girls are in the backyard, the house has burnt down and it's really bad. So one of the girls says that maybe it wasn't fire but she thinks that someone was in there. The girls try to get in the attic, but the attic doors are stuck closed. Anna takes out her pocket knife and cuts the metal shutters. As the girls stand looking up (they are in a really strange part of town, no roads, so no one knows
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a fine film that had me on the edge of my seat. It had good performances, a gripping story line, and a wonderful sense of humor. It takes place in the early 20th century, where two rival gangs are battling over the same girl. The film starts with a murder, and quickly establishes it's characters. It's a very violent movie that had a lot of good scenes, including one scene with some interesting shooting. It shows you that some people are just not cut out for life and, on a lighter note, did I mention that the main guy was a really bad ass? That's for you to decide, I don't want to spoil it for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like zombie films, this is a good film, and its not that bad either.  It's really well made, and the production is very good.   The characters are realistic, and are not very funny.  They're just plain realistic, in that all of them are just "sick", so that you can get a good feel of what it's like living with them.  It takes place in a zombie apocalypse, which is well done.  I did laugh at the most silly things, and it's not that great a zombie film, but it is an enjoyable one.  The ending is a little confusing, but I found the ending quite enjoyable.  This is a pretty good zombie movie, and if you like the zombie film genre, this one is good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Old Days  is about a pair of old friends who go on a road trip to the West Virginia gold fields in search of a mine which has been dormant for over 70 years. They make their way through Pennsylvania, New York, Pennsylvania again, New Jersey, Indiana and all the way to a place called "Garden of Eden" which is described as being filled with dinosaurs and an Eden-like environment. Once they reach Eden, they have to deal with the problems that can arise from that kind of environment. In the beginning, they learn how to live and survive in such a hostile environment but after awhile, they start to see a different kind of good, when God has his ways of creating an environment which inspires them to be good and goody goody. In short, I felt like I was watching a TV movie about the Bible story with dinosaurs in it.  It just about made me laugh out loud at least once.  The Old Guys  was an interesting movie that took some creative liberties.  It tells the story of two brothers who come across a cave containing some mysterious artifacts.  These artifacts are said to be some form of time travel device which was used in the Bible's creation of the world. The brothers decide to take the artifacts back to the Old West in order to get some answers about the artifacts. While there, the brothers encounter a group of Indians, a "tribe" named "The Chunkies," and a tribe of wild horses led by a wild eyed gunfighter named "Rudy".   The only problem is that the entire film seems to focus on how the brothers spend most of their time fighting in the desert, a desert which has many "dirt roads", mud pits, cliffs and the like. There isn't too much of a story in this film other than these two men and the "tribes" they encounter while trying to get back to Eden.   This movie was interesting in that some elements were borrowed from a story from the Old Testament called the Book of Genesis.  Although this was a good film, it could have used a few of the features that make Bible stories exciting, like the fact that the brothers do some pretty good fighting.  This film did show a very dark side of the Old Westerns.  As it was narrated by one of the older brothers, we learn that this film is more about the old guys traveling around to collect artifacts rather than actually finding something
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________  I saw this a couple of weeks ago and it's a really good film. It has an extremely strong storyline and it shows in the excellent acting in this film. The film is also really dark and this may turn off some people but I was really excited to see how it was going to develop so it was good that it took this time to tell the story properly. The ending of the film is very different and it was an excellent way to show the different aspects of the story and I enjoyed that. I would definitely recommend this to anybody with an interest in detective fiction.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well acted movie about the life of a young man who was born as a boy and who grew to become a man of the law. He took his law degree and worked very hard as a prosecutor at the state level but his wife found a way to keep their family afloat during the tough times. It is a great, entertaining film with lots of humor. I like the title and the way that the movie is set up. The young man is in his 20s in the city of Cleveland and is quite a tough guy. He is a good prosecutor, has a strong moral code, and is very good looking. He comes across as a great guy who has no problem putting others first to get what he wants. He has a pretty girl as a wife who does not live up to her man's standards. She can be as much of a bitch as the rest of them. When they get together, things do not go well. They are a very dysfunctional couple that is a bit of a comedy of errors. As you can see from the title, this is about a man who gets his law license and a girl who gets her law degree. They get married and then go off to work in separate places. It sounds like a pretty common story but it is very well done with a terrific cast that is all very good in the film. It also has a wonderful song in "Love for Sale" by the famous group the Allman Brothers and one of my favorite songs in the movie "Sugar Baby" by Roy Orbison.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you've ever heard of The Big Lebowski, then this movie isn't much to brag about either. I was surprised about how much I liked this movie; I mean, I don't normally like comedies (and really, why would you?) so I was a little skeptical about this movie but I didn't really care too much. The movie was funny and it was a good time. My only gripe was that there was an ending which kind of made no sense, but that's just my opinion. In short, The Big lebowski is a great movie. I enjoyed the characters, I enjoyed watching the movie, I liked that it was so short (only 90 minutes) and that it ended so funny.   Posted by Andrew Harkins at 8:28 AM No comments:
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (12 out of 22) Not my favorite movie of all time, and I don't think it's even a good one. But I did like seeing Robert De Niro play a guy who is an expert in various forms of street fighting. It's good for a chuckle occasionally. It has a great fight scene in the subway, in which a gang of guys get into it with some of the same bums that were in the movie "Bad Boys" back in 1973.  The Bad News Bears 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Gorillas in the Mist" is a movie I will never forget and one of my absolute favorites.  It is a great film to watch at one time as a kid while watching something totally unique.    "Gorilla's" story is told from the eyes of the two gorilla brothers Gorilla (Lars Bjertson) and Gorilla the Bear (Kelvin Harrison) and their mother, Gorilla the Tortoise (Ernie Hudson). The movie starts out by showing how the Gorillas are taken by their father, a Dr. who wishes to have them all killed and to grow the population. But the young girls who are the offspring of the Gorilla father are the ones to save the day. The girls are the key to the rescue.  " Gorillas in The Mist" will always be one of those classic science fiction movies that the entire family (both boys and girls) can enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a viewer, you get the feeling that this movie was made for the screen. It is really well acted with real chemistry between the main two characters. It's all very nice and realistic. You would not think that a movie made for film would be so much fun or cute. The music is great and very catchy and you would not have minded a few of the lines. This movie is really good to watch and not a terrible one at that! The movie really goes to the heart of what it means to be a boy or a girl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A wonderful movie that is all over the place. There are plenty of plot twists, and there is a decent amount of blood (which is welcome). There is very little nudity, and it takes a long time to get to the good stuff. The ending is very good, but it lacks a little bit of heart to pull it off. Overall, a nice movie, and a fun action adventure film.

I think some of the cast members may have been better on Muppets Tonight than they did in Muppet Treasure Island.  However, the humor was still good.  A couple of people that aren't so good in that show are still pretty good on this one.  If you haven't seen the show, I think you will be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sidney Poitier plays a very tough, no nonsense man who gets tired of all the shit that is going on. It is an interesting film but there is too little of the shit going on in the movie to get into it.  The acting is excellent all around with a very fine performance by the late Poitiers.    The director of the movie,  John Milius was born in Chicago on November 28th, 1924, making him one of the youngest people in that city to make it big in the movies.    The movie starts of like any good Western and plays like it in the beginning.  A lone man who is trying to get from point A to point B in the midst of a harsh desert environment.  After a bit of shooting, the movie turns into an adventure tale about a man who travels through the desert on horseback.  At times he is alone in his quest, but mostly he is part of a band of adventurers and there are plenty of fun scenes in this movie.  It is a bit short but it is really enjoyable.  The acting is very good all the way through, I especially like the part where we see a young actor at about 18, and we can see how he grew up in some tough times.    The movie had a small budget and yet it was a big success.  This movie has a good amount of action scenes and an interesting plot.  If you are a fan of movies like this one, do yourself a favor, give this one a try!   This movie was the first to be released as part of the MGM's Treasure Island series of movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a brilliant film! The movie has a very unique art style and its very atmospheric, however I felt like this movie needed a little more depth than it already has and that is where the real fun begins, I have to say this movie has one of the most entertaining and well written characters I have ever read about and the cast is perfect, I like the way they handled the first half of the film, it is a little rough around the edges but you will have a great time with this one. There is also a lot of nudity and the violence is intense but there is always a good reason for it, the actors really know how to bring it and the story is just a great watch, I give the movie a 9 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to mention that the only scene where a lot of things are shown from the perspectives of various species is the one where a giant squid falls out of the sky and lands on a giant egg which causes the whole thing to explode.  This was one of those movie moments that I will never forget. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really loved this film. In fact, I really really loved it. It has a great story line with excellent acting and effects. It is an enjoyable film. There is not a moment in this movie that does not have a good scene. There are not many things in this film that do not do a good job. The movie does have it's problems. I thought it was quite poor that the film would have more action than the movie was supposed to do. If the movie is meant for kids, then they did not get the message that there are bad people that are out there that take advantage of us. I think it is a very well done movie. A great job on what was intended by Disney.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* "One day, a strange bird appeared at the hospital. He was an Asian bird, who used to come to the hospital at dawn, and was very friendly." "Now, you know what the nurses said about him? They said he was very rude. He used to make a huge noise whenever he appeared, and he would make all these funny faces. He would say, 'Hello, hello, hello!' I mean, you could see he was having so much fun. He made such a huge racket." "But in the morning, he disappeared. He disappeared and never appeared again." "Oh, the nurses thought he was a monster and tried to feed him to the cat, but when the cat refused, the doctors said that the cat had been eating it. So, the hospital was very worried about the bird and it was put in a cage in the attic. "At first, people thought that it must be a real bird...so, people began to call the bird 'Little Bird.'" -Source: Wikipedia
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a very well-done remake of a French novel, with a French voice-over by Jean-Pierre Melville.  You can hear the French accent perfectly as the people in the novel do, but the film is also good on the music, as well as the acting.   I really do believe this is a remake of Le Diable du monde, although the English version does not seem as good.  I don't know why Melville's version is not better known but it is so very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie and felt that it was good. It was the most depressing movie of the last few weeks. The bad guy is a "human clock" that comes up every day and decides how much time to give to the humans. It only wants to eat the humans and to be left alone. But, then the man falls in love with a girl, the girl tells him that she will love him even if it means leaving him behind. The good guys come up with all kinds of plans to help the clock. But the bad guy wants more of a beating and decides to leave it at that. Now, what if the good guys came up with a really good plan to save the humans? Would the clock give up or try to save people?    The only thing that didn't make me cry was the bad guys. But if you are going to watch this movie, it would be good to watch it before the movie ends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is great.  We start with a group of men trying to decide if they should be the first and only humans on Venus.  It's a beautiful day, so the group decides to head there as soon as possible.  There are several small problems as they head to Venus:   Their spacecraft is damaged so they have to go on foot to get to Venus.  There's a chance that Venus will be destroyed by a meteor falling on the planet.  They have a problem with the meteor:  While on Venus, the astronauts are visited by a number of different groups of people in order to ask for donations.  The astronauts have an interesting time on Venus:    They get to meet a young man from Earth who has been chosen to be an ambassador to Earth from Venus. He explains the rules of the planet:       All people from Venus live in groups of five.           Each group can have one or two people and these people live together as one family.   This is the only way the family can communicate with each other.  There's even a large statue that looks like the president.  The Earth has a population of over one billion people, and the group of ambassadors will represent us on a number planet like the one in this movie.  This movie is fun! It has some really interesting ideas about life on a planet, how humans interact and deal with each others. It's also interesting to see how we evolved in the past in terms of technology and biology.  I really enjoyed this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To my mind, this is a very faithful adaptation of the novel and this is certainly evident from the very first moment when I heard the score. It is a perfect fusion of orchestral and classical music, so that the first three minutes are wonderfully dramatic. The rest of the movie is in a similar vein as it should be and there is little else to say about it. This is a solid, enjoyable movie. It's not a masterpiece, but it's good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a story of two boys who were born in the same hospital but didn't get to meet each other until they were both adults. One day one of the doctors takes the other boy on a short hike with the intention to let him enjoy a nature retreat. They are accompanied by a girl who's an avid hiker as well. They spend most of their time together. During the hikes they talk about their childhood and dreams as they reach some natural sites. The girl wants to know a lot about the boys and their friends. She even shows a lot of interest in the boys' friends.  The movie is short but has a lot to say about friendship and nature.  I will add some reviews:  This movie has a lovely soundtrack and some good performances. There is a scene at the end of the movie where a cute guy is telling a story. It is really funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised that there weren't many surprises in here. It's a very straightforward story about a girl (Spencer) who lives with her grandmother (Mary) and her stepmother (Nancy). A few years ago Spencer got pregnant by her stepdad's best friend (Lyle) who she didn't want, so she tried to kill him. And when the baby dies, Spencer kills a stray dog in revenge. It seems simple enough when you say it out loud. It was very well written. The movie is about the girl being put in an orphanage with her sisters. And then, as a punishment from her parents, it becomes her duty to raise puppies. She tries to learn to read, but ends up being unable to do so... There are plenty of funny moments, such as seeing Spencer's dad, who is an alcoholic, come in and start singing a song. It makes the movie a bit funny, since you know it will only ever come across as a terrible joke. Also, the movie's name sounds like a bad song. I didn't find it too much worse than a bad movie, actually, it's quite good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- My favorite "comic" of the year, and probably the best so far by the studio. Written and directed, the story is funny, and yet touching as well. It has a lot to say about the modern American family life, and I enjoyed it. Not for the faint of heart. For lovers of comedy, the first time I read this, I wasn't surprised it was a big hit. I'm not one for the "comedy" genre, but this has the energy to go with the content. It's a great story and well acted. I'll probably get a DVD/BluRay one day. You can not do better than this for comedy. You would have to pay a few hundred bucks to go see it live. Just a funny movie.

At one point a car drives at me.  I thought I was going to die.  The best thing about this movie is the ending.  It is not a movie about a bunch of kids playing cowboys and Indians in an Indian camp.  They go there to stay at a "Indian" summer camp. The Indians are cruel and cruel.  But this movie shows the violence that happened in those days.  This movie is based on a book by E. E. Cummings called " A Visit from St. Nick ".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film follows the story of a single mother in her 50s who works as a cashier at an ATM. She is divorced and with her young son living with her father. When her estranged husband returns home, she is forced to go back to her family with his family. She returns to her home with his parents to find that all family is going on a Christmas vacation. She then begins to go through the Christmas wish list and is forced into trying to fulfill all of her wishes. There are several Christmas scenes in this film including a Christmas morning in front of the TV and it shows that this mother is the most festive of all in this Christmas movie. Her son gets on the bus while they go to visit her family and they end up singing "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus". One Christmas Eve the family goes out to dinner and when they come back in the living room her husband was sleeping while she had gone out shopping. She gets a surprise when Santa Claus is revealed to be her husband and she tells her son to kiss him. That evening she has to decide to either kiss him or keep quiet. The best part about this Christmas is when they have to go get a gift from Santa. There is a huge fight that breaks out over whether or not Santa Claus will bring them a toy. I felt a little bad for the kids and felt sorry for the dad who had a huge argument over something that is the same as a candy cane.  In Conclusion : A very nice story about a single mom in her 70's with her son who is a teenager. Very nice performances, and a nice message to the younger generation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film's plot is really interesting and it's a shame that we're not able to experience all of its beauty.  When you first hear the opening credits, it's one of those opening credits that really just jumps out at you like an out-of-focus flash from an action movie that you've seen a million times before.  But what's surprising is that the action is really good too!  This is a film about a group of women who have just been rescued by a mysterious stranger and in their excitement get to live in a new home.  We see that the group is in love.  There is a little love triangle going on but that's all we see.  This really is a very enjoyable film to watch!  There's a lot of action, even in the scenes of the rescue.  All of the action sequences are well done.  And although there isn't much of a plot, there's a sense that everything is coming together for a good purpose and you're going to be glad to be out of the house.  That's what you're supposed to feel and the ending just feels right, although you'll probably watch it again and again to find out what happens next.  I don't recommend it to people who are easily disappointed and don't like their romances to be heavy handed.  The film will appeal to those who like to see people do fun things and the characters are nice enough.  As stated before, this isn't a romantic movie but it is definitely a fun action film that you'll want to watch at least a couple of times.  If you like romances, you'll enjoy this film too.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________ Well here's a movie that isn't going to win any awards, and is probably going to get a few "Who cares?"s, but I liked it! It has a great atmosphere, good characters, a mystery, lots of laughs, action scenes, nice music, and the overall pacing is a little slow at times but it gets going quickly and has a lot of great moments in it that bring the movie to an exciting conclusion. In fact most of it is just great and there aren't a lot negative points that I can think of, there's a little underdeveloped romance that goes nowhere (as a guy it's somewhat annoying but in a movie about a high school, why do they really make the romance so underdeveloped?!), a scene at a school dance that is very nice, and there's some great moments with the band, and of course the music is great! If that doesn't satisfy you, there is a bit of a problem with the ending, that I won't go into in this review, but it doesn't really matter and it doesn 't take away from the movie itself, it still has a very good movie and is worth seeing. __________________________________ Pros: ____- Great atmosphere and action scenes- It's not a comedy- It has drama- Great characters- Great music, great special effects and a great ending! Cons: _____- It feels like the entire movie is a setup for something else (but who cares, it was still a good film!)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good comedy, I don't know what to make of it since it is a comedy.  I am a woman in my 40's who thinks she is pretty smart, and I am a man who has no idea how to make a woman smile and laugh at the same time.    I guess it comes from me being a bit shy at times, and since I am the only man in the place, it's hard for me to make myself understood, so the woman is always the most obvious target.  Then there is this new girl, she's a pretty girl but has a mean disposition and will never get any love no matter how clever she is.  If you are a man, the best thing to do is make the lady you fancy smile and be happy.  I did just that once, so I can't complain about it.  There was a time, when I got so much shit from guys, when they would make fun of me, they would say I am pretty and so forth, and they would laugh and mock me.  It was quite annoying to me and I never liked them.  Anyway, this is a little movie and I like it because it is like a bad comedy movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first 3 minutes are incredible. When they show your family members crying and screaming while you get shot, you have no idea what the hell you're watching. The rest of the movie is the same thing, but with a different ending. The ending is a very long, long shot of a car that hits the building in the middle of a crowded street and explodes. It's a very cool ending. If you don't know what to expect in a sci fi movie, then look no further than this one. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars. The only problem I have with it is that the final fight between the aliens and the humans is over in 3 minutes, and I feel like it should have been more.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ If you are a film buff, you can only praise the great work done by John D. Russo in this film about the famous movie "The Godfather" This is the second film that director John Russo made after he got the position of director after Francis Ford Coppola, who had made "The Conversation" in 1981. The character of Al Pacino plays the role of John Gotti. We will meet all the people who was involved in the organization in the film "TheGodfather". The movie is set in the time of the early 1930s. The great film is not only in the role and of the story, but also in the performances of all the actors. The story is told in the chronological manner with great attention to detail, and we see the whole of the life of the gangster and the gang. This was the time when the Mafia was at its peak and the movie gives a lot of satisfaction in portraying the Mafia's activities. John Russo is the best director who is not known from the movie "Apocalypse Now", which is a fantastic movie, but John Russo did a terrific work in this movie, and also in "Apocalypsys." As a movie lover, I highly recommend this film, because I enjoyed the action, the drama, and the characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Darkest Mind" may be one of the better psychological horror films to come from Romania in years. This is a film that should be seen by all. I think it's not as bad as some films I've seen from Romania (and it might well be better than a lot of them), and the effects are very good. The film is about a little boy who has been diagnosed with severe anxiety and psychosomatic blindness. His mother has taken him to see a doctor who thinks he can be treated with a kind of magic potion, and they hope that the potion could solve the problem. Unfortunately the potion doesn't make the boy feel better (he has no sight in his eyes), so he has to wait for more potions to show a new miracle. But the effects don't last and the boy's condition does worsen. He can't get to school, and he keeps going back and forth between his parents who are unable to cope with him. He's becoming more and more withdrawn and the other kids stop visiting him. And eventually the authorities are called in to investigate what is happening and they find some strange things in his room: strange paintings of a dead family, a book about the occult, and a strange machine in the attic that seems to control the boy. The people who live in his neighbourhood know that something strange is happening, and so they come out to investigate. The next day his parents find a note about the mysterious book, so they start looking for the book and the machine, trying to discover what is going on. The movie is a slow burner which, although slow in its pace, still manages to create a disturbing atmosphere. The children aren't really seen much, but when they are it is just to add a creepiness to the film. This kind of film works well because it keeps the audience wondering what might happen to the family if they don't look into the book or the machine. If they had come out sooner, the parents wouldn't have seen the book, but they might not have noticed that the boy is becoming more isolated and withdrawn. A lot of the problems are created by the child's parents who don't listen to him. I also like that the film creates a sense of mystery without making too many'reveals' about what's really going on, which is nice for the audience to wonder if it's all a dream or something really scary happening. The only problem I had was that sometimes the film doesn't do enough with the children

This guy was an emotional, sensitive and kind guy with many faults. When I met him I was surprised to see how gentle and gentle he was. And he wasn't shy in showing his feelings when he's in trouble. I am so glad that the movie makes you feel the pain of this guy who is so vulnerable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Son is a good family-friendly film that is set in the early 1900s. It features both the story of James A. McCune (John C. Reilly) and his friend, Mr. Klim (Gary Sinise). They are on a field trip to the cemetery where McCune's mother is buried. During the field trip McCune and Klim find a grave where a boy lies with a mysterious stone in his hand.  When they go home they have a frightening encounter and are unable to bring themselves to say the name of this boy. In time they discover that this is a cemetery where ghosts go to rest. The ghosts themselves are the ghosts of dead children.  It is a very interesting film as it deals with the death of children and the ghosts they leave behind. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ The only problem with the movie are the characters (except the two little boys and the kid with the little dog) I was never really that interested in them but the movie didn't need them, it had something to say about being a little kid with a dog and some really cute children, I was glad the movie had a happy ending. I would like to see something like that in the future, I could see a movie about this happening but it would probably involve some really sad kids and maybe that would be the best ending to the movie, but instead it's just a cute movie, no one really has to be sad because it's a funny little movie about friendship and the world around us.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw my first screening of "The Girl Who Played With Fire," I knew from the first moment what a special film I had just seen. This film follows the life of a young girl, Shoshana Berenbaum, from the time she was born until she passes away. A talented artist and a gifted writer, Shimon, along with Shoshanna Berenberger, a shy and timid girl, grow up together. As Shimon matures, he falls in love with a girl named Shoshanah (Sasha Pietrovna). Shoshannah also tries to avoid meeting the boy, and tries to remain as "normal" as possible, with the help of her sister Mira (Ami Piatigorsky), who is also very talented. However, in the end, it is her artistic talent that causes Shoshanda to be rejected by her family and the whole town. As the story progresses, we see the different lives of these siblings and their friends, whose lives are shaped by their artistic talent.   ~ The Girl Who Lived   ~   Sasha and Ami are so cute and funny! You can tell they've been in love since they were kids! I'd love to see a sequel for this!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good:  For some, this might be a good entry point into the genre. I've already seen enough 'horror' movies to know that 'horrible things happen' in our world. This is nothing like that. It's not a horror movie in that sense at all. It doesn't have any horror elements at all, but it does feature the 'hero' fighting with a bunch of bad guys and the bad guys are not monsters...they are the heroes! I actually found myself rooting for them a little, in that I knew the heroes were going to beat them and they were going up against the authorities, but when the bad stuff really starts to go down, it can't be avoided. I would have liked to see something better on this side of the ocean, but this is a very good movie and well done. It was good to be back home. The bad:  I think a lot of people will dislike the first half. I don't feel that this is the case, but I didn't like it either. I can't really explain why, but something about the third act dragged a little. It made it feel like there was a lot more going on in that end, but there wasn't. The rest of it was ok, but not really good. Some people like to complain about movies being too long, and this one definitely didn't seem to be very long. The characters were not developed enough to be liked, which was disappointing. I do find myself liking the bad guy, especially. I hope we are going to see more from him in the future. Overall, this is just a really good movie. It is a nice departure from the norm and has many thrills. Recommended for fans of: old school horror movies, and good acting.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A beautiful, enchanting, enchantingly funny movie from Japan. I always thought that this movie was going to be an oddity, and it was one for me. It starts with a man with nothing going on in his life but an unfulfilled desire to know if a beautiful Japanese woman he's known since college is beautiful (I have never been able to find a picture of this actress, which was a shame; she is really something). The woman is beautiful. The man can't help thinking that the woman is just for his sex. That is, until the woman shows up unexpectedly... and turns everything around for him. The movie is told from the man's point of view, which is very funny. I was very amused. The woman's beauty, and her character is just perfect. This is a must see for anyone who is interested in Japanese movie. The cinematography is lovely and the song is fabulous. A lot of people complain about the Japanese subtitles, which I guess is because it is not in English. I did not mind, even though I am not that fluent in English, but those who are would probably find it a big turn off... I had a good time listening to the song, as well as watching it. Definitely recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this on a Friday morning. The movie was very well acted and produced. The cast is good (even though it seems that everyone has to leave with a scar) and the movie is very violent, but it is well made.  There were some really graphic scenes, but they were done in a humorous way to create suspense.    And just like in every great western, the horsemen are very brave. I saw the movie on a Fri afternoon. The film began with a "man in a cage," and I did not care because the opening was so well done. The man in the cage is a man who wants to free himself from the shackles and chains that have become his life. There are a number of scenes in which we learn his history, his family, his past and how he came to be locked in a metal cage. The story was told in an entertaining manner. One scene in particular was very interesting and I felt it was a good idea to show it in a different way because I think many films show how bad the man in prison is, but the film made sure not to show his brutality. We learned that he has been beaten for the most part of his life and it has made him hate life.  I did like that the opening of the film showed the man being chained and tied. There is a great deal of violence shown in this film. The horses are shown in action, as well.  I did not have a great time watching this film, but a good time at least. There were a few scenes that really made me think, "Hey wait a minute..." I found it interesting to see how the film tells the story, but I did really not care about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________ I'd heard of this before but didn't actually go for it due to its reputation as a "bad" movie - bad on several levels - which is quite true. But that reputation can be more than exaggerated. This isn't a bad movie, it's just a bad way to make it.   First of all, this is an adaptation of a non-film by Robert Bresson (who was not exactly an unknown at the time) called "The Virgin Spring". It was a fairly big box-office disappointment, even though it was quite good in its own right and the film was shot with great attention to detail. Bressons adaptation was made from a story he had first published in the 1950s and so as far as I am aware it has never really been adapted by anyone else since then. It has been described as "the last of a small school of cinematic masters" in which Bressan is clearly the crown prince (which he is, at least in the novel version) who happens to grow up on the wrong side of the tracks to be taken under the wing of the very eccentric and eccentric Monsieur Rastignac. It's not exactly clear what role these two men are meant to play, except that Rastigacs career was basically doomed at the end of his life, so it isn't exactly clear why Bressones got to be the king maker.   a long time ago in a galaxy far far away...   Bresson's film was written in such a way as to make the hero look like a total failure. As an example, the character of the villain is a completely different character from the one in the film, but there's no doubt that this is exactly why his character was written the way it was: he's a complete lunatic who lives in a huge castle, plays a great deal of golf and wears his hair in a big topknot. In fact, at one point Rastigs name appears at the top of the screen and he tells his daughter "I don't have enough for the dinner table... but I have enough to eat...". That's about as much as Bressontts version gets right! In fact he tries very hard to justify what's written here by saying that they really meant it when they said that his character is a very "unhealthy" man. I would add that he looks a bit like a cross between Dostoyevsky and a character from
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was amazing. The best. The characters were wonderful and the story was just a little too dark to be enjoyed by all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        I have a few of these.   The first I remember seeing was a good one in the 80s.  This movie was made by a man who had been an anti-war film maker before the war, then he wanted to be a film maker during the war.  I don't remember all the details of the war but there was something really moving about the movie.  The cast is great: Robert Ryan, Jack Lemmon, James Cagney.  He went on to make this movie so I have not seen it recently and I am sure it is good.  A solid comedy from Hollywood. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! You think your a good shot? Look at this.   The movie has some flaws. The sound is terrible. The acting is bad. The movie is made for old people who are afraid that they wont make it as a hunter. The best parts are when the hunters and the prey are in the same boat. I think it would be fun to watch an old lady and an old man play their roles as they are trying to catch a giant fish.  , but the old men arent bad actors. I did laugh while watching them trying to shoot this giant fish off the coast of Maine.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What better way to close off a summer month than with a movie as good as Star Wars: A New Hope?  The special effects were great.  You just felt it on your chest when Han Solo went into hyperspace and we were all excited for his future adventures.  When I first saw Star Wars for the first time, I had no idea I was looking at a very big picture.    George Lucas was able to blend science fiction with all of his other influences to come up with something that was both fantastical and believable.  It has a strong plot that takes place in the years between the destruction of the Death Star and the Rebellion taking the planet, Alderaan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sisterhood is Powerful is one of the most touching and emotional movies I've seen this year. It's like watching a child's first ever movie, one which they will watch over and over again, as we watch as an older brother and his younger sister struggle with their own personal crises while trying to find a place to belong.  The performances from the two main characters are absolutely beautiful.  A few years into adulthood, a girl is leaving for college, and a group of friends and relatives decide to go to the school to wish her good luck.   The movie is very much about family, and as we learn more about each character's personal tragedy, we get to know each character better.  Sisterhood is powerful isn't about each characters ability to get ahead, it's more about their struggle to find themselves, and how their own lives may have taken a different path if not for this family's efforts.  A film made by a married couple that is not afraid to express the emotions they hold.  The fact that I can't imagine being in a similar situation is a big part of why I love this movie.  You know I really need to watch this again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched quite a few good movies in my life and this one, I felt, was a very good movie, which I enjoyed. It was also very witty. I think that we should all have a good laugh during a bad movie. It had a funny ending. The voice acting was good. I felt that I could understand the movie very well.   Overall, I enjoyed this movie. There are many movie lovers and critics, who feel that good movies are very rare and that the worst ones exist only in the movies. I disagree. I can count on my fingers the movies I've seen lately, which had a very bad movie feeling. There must be some good ones and there must be also many bad movies. If you are a film lover, you may find good movies even in bad ones. I recommend this movie to everyone and to everyone I recommend the movie "Don't Die on Me".
Write a positive review about a good movie: n its way to the top of the heap. n its short 1.5 hours it tells a story about a small family living in a quiet rural town in the US.  In this way it is very much like a "small town" movie from the 1940s.   It is a very sweet film that deals with all the simple questions of a young girl trying to have a normal family life.  It is about a little girl who grows up in a small town and tries to have fun with her friends.  That is what this movie is about.  The script is very sweet, it is funny all throughout the movie, the movie has a happy ending, but you will not get that happy ending unless you watch the whole thing.  One of the most important things in a kid film is to teach the audience a little about the world.  My advice is to go out and see this movie with your friends, not to sit through it alone.  This movie is a must see for any young kid.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a pretty good adaptation from a novel by the late Robert A. Heinlein. The book is a fairly serious look into science fiction and space colonization. It's set several decades after the death of the human race. It has a very optimistic outlook. It makes little sense at first and it does not make sense at all later on. You will see lots of space fights in the film, including the first one on the space colony, and lots of explosions, and you will definitely feel something when the colony ship flies by a star. The film is very good and I would recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been waiting a long time for this movie to be released. I thought the script was so good it would have been great on the big screen. But this is NOT the film I was hoping to see. The film is based on the book of the same name written by the late great William Faulkner. The story of a man named Harry Bailey who went to the woods to make a living selling tickets to a ghost story show. In the woods he finds a strange child that is being hunted down by some evil people. But the good news is the child has a plan to get back to its human parents. I really enjoyed this flick and it did not disappoint. There are some nice effects and a lot of good story in this flick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie because it features a bunch of great actors that can play different roles really well. Even better than the actors, the cinematography is done in a way that you can only appreciate a movie after you see it once, for instance, when Johnny gets hit on the head with a baseball bat, he goes into shock and his legs seem to be broken. The scene of the scene (which I forgot to see because it's not interesting) is just the same like that of the previous movie except that it's shot from an angle that makes you see the whole room from a different angle. It's interesting to see him walk around like that in a movie because he's not like this in real life. There is a scene, where he is in the house with his parents, and they are talking to each other. But it really is nothing special because it is nothing remarkable. He's a good kid, but it doesn't feel like he's trying to impress anybody. I guess this is because the movie is about a kid who's in love with his girlfriend, and it's easy to imagine that his parents don't like him.   In the end, it's a really good story. I haven't seen it in English before but I like how the director explains things in the scene. The character's name is Johnny and he's in high school so the movie deals with the typical stuff about a high school boy. The movie will appeal to kids who are into sports, because it has a great plot (one of the reasons I saw it) and is easy to watch, especially if you like sports. I like to see a guy hit the ball from a distance and run to a spot, with the ball hitting a brick wall which makes a "THUD" as he gets up and runs.   The ending is a little confusing because there are lots of different shots and scenes in one scene (especially in the end). It's really hard to make sense of what's going on. But you'll know where it's all coming from at the end.  I'm very interested to see where the movie goes. If I'm not mistaken, this movie was written by David Mamet.  in general I like when a good plot is mixed in with a good story and a good soundtrack. I don't know what's more exciting than that.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best western comedy to come out in a long time. It's not good in every way, but that's just the point.   In the past we have had westerns with an epic or action theme (Man of La Mancha, The Searchers, All the King's Men), this film is more of a Western with a lot of character development.

It's not really a musical but a comedy that features a cast of great stars and great performances by them. It has a great storyline with great performances from John Candy, Fred Savage, Tony Randall, and John Belushi.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorites from last summer. I just hope people don't get the wrong idea about this film and don't confuse it with The Good Son.  This one is actually very sad. I saw this one at Cinequest one night and I think my mind got blown away.  I'm not a big horror-movie fan but this one did something very special and it did so from the get-go.  As a child I would watch this film at night after I got home and listen to the radio.  This film has just the right combination of scary and funny.  The movie opens with a boy named Michael walking down a road to buy candy.  He comes to a fork in the road and the boy decides to go one way to the candy store and the other way to find a tree house.  When Michael gets to the sweets store he sees the store clerk running away while the store is being robbed and then it seems the candy counter has already been emptied and no one is around to grab them.  Michael runs into a store where he meets an old man who says, "The clerk's gone crazy!".  The old man says,  "Why don't you come to me? I'm the old man.  We'll cure the clerk by taking some of his pills."  The clerk then appears before the old woman who says the reason why nobody is around is because she's scared of this old man!  I love these films!  This one has one of the most unique effects in the genre.  Each of the people in the movie who is scared is actually shown running in the same way that we would when we're running late for school.  I could watch this movie over and over again until I drop dead from exhaustion.   Michael's mother is seen running behind a wall and saying,  "Don't look behind you.  Come on Michael, let's go".  Her son then sees a strange creature running behind the wall.  At first Michael and his mother believe the creature is just a man chasing another man.  However, the creature runs up to them both and when they are close enough they are scared enough that Michael starts screaming and panics!  The next thing you know the old fellow and the young man are standing on a rock and the old person says "Michael!  Michael!"  After that the old guy turns his back and we see his face but his body

I've always wanted to see a decent version.  This one has so many moments where you're just on the edge of your seat.  It makes you want to see more! I've yet to see something that really makes you laugh the way this one does.  The best part about it is not the vampires, but the family and friends of these people.   They've gone too far to go back to a simple life, and they're very much a part of that life.  I like the ending, and it really made me happy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------- This movie is a classic and a movie I recommend to everyone! I do not know why but it is something about this movie that has always stayed with me and I would watch it again with pleasure. The movie is about an eccentric man who has been living in a small town. His life changes suddenly when he meets a handsome stranger who tells him about a place in Florida called "The Emerald Isle", and where he could find a woman he would love more than anything in the world. He starts to make arrangements for this trip and plans on staying there for a long period of time. The man does all he can to win the woman in his life but it doesn't always go according to plan. So, he has a nervous breakdown that results in his being thrown into a mental asylum. This man, being a man who is driven by his dreams, and a man whose dreams are always in the right place, finds himself in the Emerald Isle. He begins to make friends with the islanders and they begin to help him to make his dreams come true. This movie may be a dark film, but I always appreciated that. The people who are there are very nice and kind and the director is very good in creating a mood and a feeling in the audience. The ending is very satisfying and I'm sure that if you give it a try, you will like it. Rating: ------------ 1.0
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  "It's not just the plot I don't care about. I hate the character. I don.t want to see a character get killed over some stupid plot thing. That's one thing I don`t agree with at all and I'm not even going to talk about the music. That was one of the worst parts of this movie. It is like an old movie that's been made again to be worse then it was a decade ago. But again, for me the main attraction of this is the story and the story line. I think this was going to be a bad movie. That`s not the case. There are a lot of good actors in this movie and I liked them all. I know I have seen all of them so far and that it won't be the last. The actors that weren't good in this film were the ones who are good in the future movies so I guess the movie is just bad to try to make good. _________________________________________  Starring:   Michael Keaton:  I am not really a Keaton fan. I thought he was pretty good in his first two movies but they turned me off very fast. Now, he seems to have forgotten that he has an amazing face. That face just keeps coming back to me and I don `t know why. I mean, he is an amazing actor. His acting is still so good though that I can`t help but to root for him. I would like to know more about that other guy and what the heck is his deal. You know, other than being there to help out with the plot, nothing really. I just want the man to get away from all this. Why is he the villain? That's a very good question and I really don't know the answer. __________________________________________________________________________________  Bruce Willis: I liked Bruce Willis in the movie. I liked what I saw in the trailer. I knew that I wouldn`t like a movie about a serial killer. Not that I hate it but I hate people who do stuff like that. What I liked about the movie was that it`s a good combination of some of the actors. Bruce Willis seems to be the leading man of this film which works for a lot. In the beginning he seems a little goofy but that`s just because his face is so bad. And I liked his character because he is the one who gets the credit and the best part
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As usual, the film that is 'The Last Airbender,' the newest entry into the wildly successful, very popular, cartoon series of the same name from Nickelodeon, comes to a fantastic end. I really loved the story and the animation and the characters. The action, the songs, the dialogues, the scenery and everything else was so well done. I never watched the first season, but I had seen 'A Whole New World,' 'Fang-lash,' 'Aang and the Dragon Warriors' and 'Avatar: The Last Air Bender' and all of these were absolutely delightful. I knew I would enjoy this one very much. I wish it was longer. It seemed like the creators only had two seasons worth of story to do. It had two stories in one. It started out with a good beginning.  The story is great and has a nice beginning to it. A girl, named Toph Beifong, decides to leave her family, and is picked up by the Fire Nation and taken away to work as a firebending teacher at the Air Temple. It didn't seem all that complicated to me at the time. I was excited because I loved this show and wanted to see Toph get back into action and find the Avatar. It took three seasons, but Toph finally did, and she found the Avatar, although not in the traditional ways. She eventually found him after he saved her son. It seems the Air Benders were being attacked by some kind of evil creature with a huge body and a huge face that used fire as a weapon. She fought it off, and after some time she returned to a peaceful Air Temple and a place called the North Pole. I liked this story. It was nice to watch the young girl get back in action. I am always looking for more stories about the old characters and Toph was a great way to do that. I would have liked a few more episodes, but it was good enough and enough episodes to fill a year. I thought it was a good, fun adventure with a lot of humor, and I thought the characters were all very good. I recommend this series.    I really enjoyed this series and all it brought. I highly recommend this and all their other cartoons. It's a whole new world for me! I never thought I'd have that many cartoons! It'll be a while before I get them all! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's kind of depressing that I have never been able to get into a good horror movie. I loved The Blair Witch Project and Silent Hill. The Witch and Silent hill are two of my favorites. And there are several good ones in the movie. The best is called "Passion." The movie starts off with a lot of bad things happening. A girl finds herself in a wooded area with several guys who are talking about killing her. She has no idea that this is going on. They get her alone and she is in pain. The guy says "I hate to tell you this, but I'm going to have to kill you. The only thing I could think of to do would be to stab you in the heart." The bad guy says he will not do that, and she says "Oh I know you'll hurt me... just hold still and wait for me to kill me... Oh, it was so hot in there. I can barely stand it." At this point, the guy says that he needs to take off some clothes. The girl says "okay." So the guy takes off his clothes, the girl starts kissing him. After a while, the guys pull the girl back. Then the guy stabs the girl in the side of the neck. The guys come to find her dead on the floor. The next thing she says is, "I can't feel my legs, is my leg dead?" The guys say "no, she's dead. And now it's time to kill them." They say there are two ways to kill a person, a slow and a fast way. So the guys start shooting into the wood. They also throw some other items into the fire. Then they walk off...   That was pretty much what happened to this movie. This is a sad story with an awesome ending, but it's all kind of weird. The movies does have good visuals, it has a good score, and it has good acting. I would recommend this movie to those who like horror movies with a good story and some cool visual aspects.

He does not have very good luck in the beginning, being kidnapped by one of the thieves just before they steal the gold he was carrying (it is one of three gold ingots that the thieves take from the other victims). The thief then proceeds to rape the man and force him to become his "servant". I have seen this film and I really liked it. The acting was also quite good. One of the female characters is particularly bad, although it is not all her fault (this is an old movie and she may not have any insight to the way she behaves). In addition the film shows some good dramatic comedy and drama, despite some of it being very silly (some of the jokes are not as funny as they could be, but they do get very funny). The story and characters are rather well done and the acting is also pretty good. Overall this is probably one of my favorite "romantic" movies.        See what I mean?  Well, I would like to watch that movie again! It is quite funny and it gives an interesting view of a bad guy. The movie also has a good soundtrack and I especially liked the song "Losing My Mind" (I am not sure whether this is the same song as in the movie, but the first time I saw this song I fell in love). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie, a must watch for all. It will take you to a place you never wanted to go, but you will still end up there.   The whole story is well-paced. The story is about a guy who gets a job at a hotel and is taken in by the management. The manager is very nice and helpful to him. They give him a great hotel room to stay in, and a nice room for him to sleep in. It's in a private room and there are curtains and the room is made in the best way.  There is an odd feeling you get from the movie that it is taking place in some kind of dream. It may seem to be a nightmare, but it is a dream.

I highly recommend this movie to any one who enjoys a great time watching movies.   - May 3, 2004The best of its kind ever  Reviewer: lukehughes - favorite favorite favorite - April 10, 2004  Subject: What a disappointment The main story of this is very weak and repetitive, especially the second half. I had trouble with the acting and the writing. The dialogue is quite simplistic and the music is very poor. It is a great idea to have a story from the perspective of the child as we see the world from her perspective. But there is too little effort made to show her as a child so I don't understand the reason for her to be so strong and why the bad guys want to kill her. In addition there are also some things about the story that are really annoying, such as the fact that the bad guy kills his victims as he tries to escape. But it is so long ago that he is just trying to find out what the heck happened to his wife and daughter. It seems like he could have saved them if he would have gotten up out of bed. It's a shame that this movie wasn't even as good as "The Dark Knight". - April 3, 20046 What a disappointing movie that leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.

A fun idea, and that was only a good 2-hour movie, so I could probably go and see more of the others.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a nutshell, a young woman and her friend come across a little girl in distress. In a little town full of strange things, they come to the local hospital to help the little girl. At first the girl looks ill, but then she speaks to the little nurse. Her voice is a mixture of laughter and tears. I can't help but feel sorry for this poor little girl, she has been separated from her family, is alone in a strange place and her life is in danger. There is an undertone of a horror movie, but there is also a very touching character. This was an interesting take on a horror-movie, it wasn't a shocker but it was interesting and fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (10/10) The movie itself is about the struggle between two groups: the good guys who help one of the kidnapped children (the protagonist is an orphan and a "loner" (one of those who are basically brainless) for the good of the country, and the bad guys who want to take over the country. The good guys have to decide what's better, the "liberty" and "dignity" of the children or the dictatorship of their leader who wants to be king. The main character is the orphan (I don't know why that name is used for a child) who is brought from his home in the countryside to the city and trained in martial arts: he has to learn how to use guns, how to make a bomb, fight like a warrior, how not to lose his life to bad guys. His parents decide to take him away to his uncle, but his uncle has been killed by the bad guy before. So what? This is just a little movie, really. You can just forget about it after a while.   (10/11) The film is directed by John Carpenter (I guess). The production was not as good as on his earlier movies, but it's still pretty good. It's a small picture with low budget, but the performances of the actors and the story tell is really nice.  There's a lot of characters and some interesting situations.  The characters are very good: the two protagonists (the orphan and the good guy) are interesting and the other members of the two groups are more or less interesting, but not as interesting as the protagonists. However, I have to admit that I have a great amount of fun when watching this movie. It has a lot to offer, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't like the first Carpenter films: this film is a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film was about a girl and her little brother whose mother has died, and so her mother's daughter who has been growing up with the mother and has gone off to college is now in her old age, so the girl decides she should go after her own daughter. She and her daughter go looking for her and while searching for her in the forest she comes across a boy who is also in the process of finding her, and both come face to face with the same kind of monster who kills the girls. And they start fighting each other.  That's basically it, it's a little girl who doesn't know her place and a little monster who wants to rule the world, that's all there is to it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In addition to the "realism" the show tries to deliver is a really cute, funny-funny show that I definitely recommend to you if: -you like otaku anime -you hate moe -you liked The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya -you want some cute, goofy shows -you enjoy the show -you are a Haruhyansu fanatic And now back to the review:  The show is a comedy where there are girls that can transform into a cat and that are all around a cat girl with a cat, that's basically it.  It's pretty much what we can expect from a otaku-like show about girls transforming to a cat.  The show has a rather cute story that gives a good balance between comedy and drama.  Some other people might find the show a little "silly" but I found it to be hilarious.  As an otaku show, you will not be disappointed.  But if you prefer moe girl to otaku girl, then this might not be for you.  There are some scenes and jokes that seem a bit "cheeky" but are actually quite smart and funny.  That's just how a show should be done.  Personally, I thought the girls in the show did very well and they are a lot cuter than their moe counterparts. There's a lot of different characters and a lot that happen in the first episode so I won't go into any detail.  I think it's best if the viewer watches each episode and gets to know the cast more.  For me, the show is very well developed but I definitely want more episodes so I can see all the characters interact.  Like I said, you are not gonna find "cute" anime here.  Instead, you get a show about some cute girls transforming into cute cats.  If you like that kind of thing, then check this show out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In an attempt to get back to his girlfriend Amy, a former marine who he thought was killed in Iraq is driving home in Los Angeles. A few weeks have passed and a number of strange things have happened: his car has been stolen. He then finds out that the girlfriend was alive and hiding in his apartment building and that she now plans to take revenge on the military and on the world. With her will to survive and great weapons that can cause global destruction this woman is a force to be reckoned with.   This movie is a bit slow at times but is pretty entertaining. I would suggest this movie to people who have watched some good movies in the last 20 years and are looking for a good action film to show their support. There are a couple of things I wish were different: There is no sign of the military forces and no weapons of mass destruction in the movie. There is also a lot of sex. It's too bad the sex isn't on the screen. It'd be a lot more entertaining.   was very fun and entertaining. There were a few of the actors are very good. I especially like that when the police chief and his lieutenant arrived they were both extremely nervous.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Halloween II (1981) is a more faithful sequel to the first movie than most of the other films of the Halloween series. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though some of it is a little too cheesy for its own good, but the overall movie has some good scenes (which are a little more well-known), and does a very decent job of adapting the first film's events and atmosphere. That said, it's not as strong a film as the others. The scares are mostly the same, the acting is average for the most part, and the story is a bit simplistic. It is a decent second Halloween film that is just better than it has any right to be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In general I'm not a fan of old fashioned gangster movies. Some of them are alright, some of them suck. For whatever reason I liked this one. It has a lot of charm, it is not very serious, it does have some action in the beginning. By the end of the movie you will believe that these guys can get all the ladies at any price. I've already watched a lot gangster films, but I don't recall seeing anything as good as this one and it's a shame it was only directed by a mediocre director. That said, this is a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that The Avengers is a perfect, entertaining movie. The plot is amazing and really well done. In my opinion it is a great piece of work. I think it might be the best of all the Avengers films. If that's not enough: If you have not watched The Avengers yet, I highly, highly recommend watching it. If you are a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Marvel is owned by Disney), then it is one of the best movies you can ever watch. The music is brilliant, the cinematography is stunning, and the writing is hilarious. In short: An amazing movie with a great story, amazing performances, and awesome cinematography. It has everything the Marvel movies need.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of those rare horror movies where a family gets separated from each other as the girl is kidnapped in a strange forest. She gets to her cousin, but she is not what she seems. She seems...well, she's just a little girl. That isn't bad. It isn't even bad for a horror movie, especially for the time. The film has no pretentiousness, no over the top special effects, and no over dramatic plot line. The only bad thing about this film, is the acting. Not too many acting performances could be said to do it justice. The lead was really fine, but it is nothing that will make you believe he is the scary one. The other characters, don't really help him. They are really good as well, not memorable. Just the rest of the cast are bland.  The ending is a pretty good surprise.

If you have not seen this movie and would like to check it out I would recommend you watch this movie in 3-D. There are some funny and clever jokes and it is actually pretty funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say I am not a huge fan of the Matrix trilogy, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well the trilogy turned out. I think I would have enjoyed it even more if I had been born and raised in a different era (in this case the 80's) to understand the movie's deeper meaning. This movie is a brilliant story of man trying to do his "Miltonian" duty in becoming a better person. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of great movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this movie is great! The main character is a girl named Tessa who is born into a family of thieves. When the thieves break out of prison and threaten her family, Tessa decides to join them to get revenge. In doing so she gets the opportunity to see who she is really up against and she learns the hard way that while she may be born into thieves, there are still plenty of good people in this world. The movie has a great plot which I enjoyed watching and Tessa as the main character really showed what a strong woman she is. Tessa becomes good friends with another thief named John Smith who is very similar in many ways to her father. They work together to steal from the corrupt police who protect their families. The other thieves were really not bad I thought the plot was a good one and I do not think this was a bad movie for the price of $4.00. This is a great movie, great cast, great plot. If you're looking for a good laugh, this is a good place to go.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story centers around a "ghost" who was in a "bad neighborhood." She used to be a "happy girl," but one day she went to find a "good job."

Well, the good old "good old days" are coming back to life, so if you love the classics, you will certainly enjoy this movie.   What a charming movie. I have a feeling that the "good little girls" in this movie can't seem to find their place in the modern times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What I liked about the movie was the cast, and the plot was really good and fun. There was a really good love story. I'm giving it 8 out of 10    Rated 4 out of 5 by Mimi from Good, but not quite perfect. This is a very funny and enjoyable film. I liked it a lot. However, I would have preferred more than 2 endings to be revealed. Also, the film suffers a little from the lack of character development. That's my only serious complaint about it. I was happy to see that the producers/writers were able to make a sequel to their classic comedy, "Dumb and Dumber." And the new cast is wonderful. They were able, however, to bring a little more personality to these roles. I don't think it is enough, because the original movie is great on its own merits.  Reviewer: Kalee M.

I wasn't sure if I'd like a guy who got lost in a machine and couldn't find his way home, but I had fun seeing him try. You know that "What if..." sorta thing?  If some kind of alien planet had come to Earth and we've all turned into some kinder aliens, or were in some other way better off.  It's kinda hard to think of it, but maybe I've never really thought about it that way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To put this movie in the same bracket as it's peers would be an insult to these great films. It's a fun little movie that has the potential to deliver a good laugh. It is a story about a group of "dads", one of which is playing golf with his young wife. In a moment of carelessness he puts his finger in the hole and the ball flies out and into his daughter's lap. She picks up the ball and puts it down, then picks up another and puts them down in sequence, one to the left and the other to the right. As it falls she kicks it forward, and with great force. Then she looks up, and, you betcha, it's into the mother's lap! This is the beginning of my favorite dad movie ever, with such laughs and good humor.  My Dad and Mom are going to see this movie on Saturday... I guess if my family is ever bored and the need arises it will be a welcome break. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Both Worlds (1978) was the last Star Trek movie. The story revolved around Captain Kirk and the new ship, the USS Enterprise-A, which was equipped with a new saucer section which could house a new weapon, the plasma beam. The mission was to go beyond the Alpha Centauri system in a long, perilous journey through three hundred light years of space, with the goal of finding a new home for the Vulcans (the old Earth race) and finding a way to destroy the Borg (an evil Borg collective). The crew of the Enterprise fought the Borg, which took over the crew of an alien ship. As the Borg made its way to the surface, Captain Kirk had to take drastic measures to save the planet and his people. He took the Enterprise, its crew and the Borg's ship to the center of the universe and shot them with the weapon. Unfortunately the beam only destroyed the Enterprise's saucer, but not before the Borg captured Spock and took him back to their hive. The Borg were able to revive their leader, the Queen, who was the original Borg from the 24th century. The Queen offered to allow the crew to live (or die) in exchange for them taking her son to the Enterprise so that the crew could continue their journey. The Enterprise had to go to the "center" of the Universe and destroy it. After destroying the Borg Queen, the Enterprise returned to Earth. The crew lived happily for a time, but the Federation's future was in danger, so Captain Kirk ordered them to leave immediately. But first the crew took the crew into a galaxy where the Borg once ruled. At the end of the movie, it is clear that the Federation was a failure, and so was Kirk's ship. The only good thing is that the whole series is available on DVD, so if you missed the last movie, you can watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's pretty good. But like I said, it's not exactly Star Wars. It's a really, really cute, fluffy movie, that feels like a family film, that isn't very well written, and doesn't really give you that feeling like a film in general should. However, it does leave you with a very warm feeling, because it doesn't have a lot of plot but it is great for the amount of cute characters it has. They will make you want to come back for more, and even though it does end on a cliffhanger, you will want to see more.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't usually write reviews of movies I haven't seen, but after seeing this movie I was impressed with how well it plays off the film's very silly premise, it is basically a parody of the old "cutesy-cal-ludes" which are pretty much the movie's only plot device, but the movie does a good job of throwing in everything in between the film. The only complaint that I have is that the movie didn't really make much use of the original film's great soundtrack which is always a plus in any cartoon parody, the soundtrack also has the same kind of good '80s retro sounds that you get when you've been to a retro concert.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a must for any fan of horror. The plot is great and a horror fan will love this movie. The story is a mix between a vampire movie and a western.  It takes you on a ride with a group of women and all of their antics and problems as they try to get revenge on the serial killer (I liked that it started out with a serial killer) who killed them off one by one. I like the western theme with guns and horse riding in this movie and there were lots of close shaves.   This movie was a bit more violent than some of the others and there are scenes that get very graphic and not for the faint of heart.  If you like the vampire movies I don't recommend this one because the women in this one were way too pretty and too smart for a guy like that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was in a little club with three of my closest friends that included a large group of college students and we had this huge room with a big back yard. All of us had to have our photo taken. One of us was from the state of Connecticut and had a little group of us and her husband and her family. We all went to the library, did some research to learn about each other, then I took the picture. After that, we had a good time with my husband and his wife (my friend) who had a bunch of her family and friends. There were about 10 of us in the room with about 15 in the backyard. The girls that are the older generation had a huge fun with all the boys. The older guys had an interesting time too, they had some really good times. I really had fun that day too! There is some nice singing on this song about what they were doing in their backyard at that time and what that looked like (with the trees, the water and the sky). The guys had a blast with a little competition, and the girls were so cute with their dresses and hair. We just laughed with them all. There are some good songs. I think there were a few songs that had great verses and a couple that were more of a nice song. The song that had the most verse of me was the song for the girls that all the guys were singing to. It was a fun song, and I was really enjoying listening to it. If you like the movie, then this song will definitely be good for you to listen to. I am so glad that I went. Thank you for giving us a song from a movie from that time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The End of the World" is a movie that is hard to review, if only because it's not even an interesting movie. It is just a bunch of guys watching a film about aliens who try to get rid of the last living human on earth. There's some cute stuff at the end of the movie but I really didn't care for it. It's just a big, boring space movie with a plot that makes no sense. It was also made by a guy who also made "Planet of the Vampires." I don't know if this guy would make a good director of a film but he sure is a good actor. If I only had a million dollars to spend on a movie, this would be it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was lucky to finally see this movie in theaters last week.   This movie is an action film with a very good story line, with great fight sequences and some great scenes of the characters.  The only problem with this movie is the plot.  Although it has a few good scenes, the plot is a bunch of crap, and it takes way too long to get to the good stuff.  I found it weird that the characters were not on screen all the time while fighting.  A very interesting movie that is great action, and a fun film to watch with some cool fighting scenes.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jrj from awesome movie   The best movie about martial arts   Rated 5 out his by davecabrera from The best martial arts movie out there! I never saw martial arts movies until this movie. I got into it right away. The main character is great. He has a great fighting style that is so realistic it is scary. I love the fights. The martial artists are so realistic. There are so many cool movies that are like this. I am glad this movie came out this year. It is awesome. I highly recommend this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ When I heard about Aeon Flux, I knew I would probably like it. While it's a movie about a couple of dudes in the late 60's, it is actually about life in a small, rural town in Alabama.  The main character is a man who has just found out that his wife is having an affair. This guy is like a father figure to the other two guys in the film.    The film has a great cast that includes John Huston, Steve McQueen, and Dennis Quaid. It looks like a really good picture.  They were able to make all the characters look very realistic and believable.  It is a movie that shows how people react to these kind of things. I liked it a lot. It was very funny and I can definitely see why it has so much acclaim. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I recall, I watched this movie on a whim as a child, and then just watched it over and over again until it reached The Twilight Zone's original run time and was released on video. It may have been because I was a huge fan of the movie that I ended up watching the movie over and again from the first viewing. I'm not kidding when I say that this movie is a total work of art. Everything is presented perfectly in this film, from the acting to the music to the art direction.  It is truly an honor that this film received such a large cult following during its initial run. It is a masterpiece and can't be found online for less than $15.

I love the fact that it was an animated film and not a live-action film. It's a great idea to have a group of characters living on a boat together. I also liked the fact the characters were not real life actors. They were all real life friends and had a great time. I was pretty much laughing my way through the movie, as well as some of the songs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, The Bad And The Ugly: A Cowboy Legend is a pretty good cowboy movie to boot!  I really enjoyed the look of this movie and the characters were cool and the story was cool as well.  This is a nice Western movie if you don't mind some pretty cool scenes.  I was surprised at how long it took for this movie to be released on DVD.  However, with its great cast and very good story, this one deserves to be on the shelf!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story follows a high school student named Tetsuo who dreams of living in the city. On a day in October of that year, Tetsuou is walking to school when he falls on the street and gets impaled by a car. He is hospitalized and the school nurse tells his father to get his son out. His father then sets out on a journey to the place of the accident. I'm not going to lie. This movie doesn't make a lot of sense or really have much of a story. You have a lot going for it. The acting, the music, the animation, it was all great. The story of the kids trying to find Tetsou's father is really neat. It's a bit hard to follow, because we don't really know who's who or what's what. In fact, most of the scenes that we see the kids in were not in the book and are not shown in the movie. The movie didn't have much to offer, but this isn't exactly a bad movie. It was pretty short (only three minutes, even though it is really short) and if the author had put more effort into the story I believe that we could have a more solid movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an extremely funny movie with an absolutely hilarious script by the brilliant Robert McKimson and a perfectly directed comedy from Joe Rubinstein.   McKimsen and his writing partner Ed Hahn give a whole new meaning to the term "the funny bone".   The two of them create a wonderful picture of everyday life in the upper East Side of New York where a gang of criminals tries to get by using the "Bobby Brown" method: rob, burn and leave.  Bobby has been shot and left in a coma. He awakes to find that his gang have been all but destroyed by a fire-fighting squad. He finds a note left by his father and decides to return to the old life of crime. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was looking for something to watch with my 3 kids when we had a family holiday at home so I decided to go on the Netflix app. I watched the first half first, then the second half and the whole thing was great. I loved it and can't wait to watch the whole first and then the 2 part 2. It's definitely worth it. It was also a great start to the summer.   Recommended:

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good film. This is the kind of movie that makes you laugh, cry, and feel sad all in the same. This was one of the very first movies I ever watched. It really has a good story, good characters, and a good ending. The whole time I was watching this movie, I was thinking about what I could do to change myself to be in the right. This movie is like that. You can be good, and you can be bad, and no matter what, you will still be good. If I had to give this a bad review, I would say it is a great movie that is worth watching if you are in the mood. Just remember to have fun and have the time of your life. - April 21, 2009The best movie ever made
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I have to say that the first ten minutes or so is pretty great, and the second one is even better. The acting is good and the way it's told is quite nice. I was so glad to see that this movie was actually an action movie with some humor as well as some fighting, and it is great that it is set during the World War II. I don't know if this movie will appeal to everyone, but if you are into action movies that you like movies like "Rocky" and "Rambo" then you'll probably like this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After reading about it in the article about "Coraline", I was curious about seeing it. The film is based on the book by Stephen King, and has great use of its title. I was happy to get a glimpse of the film and find a lot to like about it. It is, as far as I'm concerned, a very scary movie. I found myself afraid most of the time I was watching it. I suppose there is no better way to scare you than to have you watching something scary, with the constant presence of a strange green glow that can only be seen at night, or even by those who are very, very lucky. When there is a good story at the bottom, a good cast of actors, and of course a good director, you can find anything you're looking for in a movie called "Carrion".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is the only movie that i have seen so far that shows the true life that is the life of a "lion-hearted woman".  When you see that she can run a small town as it was in the 70's (when the lion was still around), you know that this is a classic!  I really liked the story, and the ending made this great movie even better!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fine and faithful adaptation of an interesting novel about a man and a woman who are on the run from a ruthless and evil crime gang.  It is a great idea and makes the world feel as though it is more real and menacing than the film's own title suggests.    The best part of the film is that it manages to not be too dark and too brutal.  The plot is all the best parts of the book, but there is much more going on than is shown in a film about a gang... the most interesting of the gang is the leader of the 'Boson' gang. He's a very sinister character, but he doesn't play the role of a villain. He is just an everyday person living his life doing his best to get by with what little money he has. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Lincoln" has the feel of a long, slow film. It is a movie with a small ensemble cast.  I am not a big fan of movies in which most of the characters are just one-note stereotypes.  One-note is good for laughs but a movie about Abraham Lincoln is not one- note.  It has a great cast and is a bit darker than I had anticipated.  I found myself feeling a little sympathetic for the people who did not get to go off to war.  The film does not have any obvious weaknesses but it does not do well in one or more areas.   What to watch:  "What would Lincoln want?" It is great that "Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" gets two things right.  It has some great cast members and it has a story that is about the man who changed the world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (June 30, 2011) This movie is good, just not great. The movie has some good scenes and some bad scenes, the good scenes are the ones where the story has a purpose. This movie has the most "interesting" villain ever. His plot is rather strange and you cannot predict it, it has a "hidden story" behind it. It was also a good plot that had a goal, not only that, the villain had a "plan" that he was going to fulfill, that did not go as planned at all... I think you'll find it interesting and if you like good comedy, action, and dark plots, you'll like this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the third of the three major "Takarazuka" movies, and it is not as good as the first or the second. It isn't as good because of the first two episodes, it is much better this season. The main character, Takao is a very weak character, not only that but he also has no friends, his father and teacher both hate him, his sister does not want him, everyone hates him and it makes him sad all the time. However, his older brother, who is a girl, takes care of him, he is very strong, she is also a very strong character and does all she can to make her brother happy. The girl also does not hate Takao, and helps him a lot. Also there is an older brother who can be seen when he wants to help his brother, he also doesn't hate him and helps her brother to a big extent. But he is a bit lazy, and can't stand to be around Takao. The whole thing is very cute and is made even better by the music which is very good. Also, I can see why the movie is called "Taken and Ane" it is a beautiful movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved that it wasn't a complete waste of time but a great time at the same time.  And it was a great, fast-paced movie!  For me it was my first time watching such a story told through the eyes of a very young girl.    She is the one that's always running with the group which always tries to find the way back to their hometown.  However, one day when they run out of water and only have a thin trail to follow, something catches the girl's attention... The most important thing about this movie is the fact that it tells you the entire story of the story...   but the way it goes about it doesn't make it a complete nonstop story but rather a series of short episodes that tell the story of every one of the characters.  The story doesn't feel rushed and there is never anything that is unnecessary or even really unnecessary.  It's simple but at the right time and it is very well told.  If there is a movie that you should not miss out on this year it is this.  A good time, a great movie, a good story....   The only reason why I gave it a 5 is that in the last minutes of the movie, I noticed it to be very similar to the story that I was already familiar with...  This is one of those movies that people will fall in love with!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hans Christian Andersen's The Prince and the Pauper  is a funny, dark little short story with a twist. The Prince is a noble prince with a royal bloodline who has lived all his life in a castle which he has grown to love, his beloved wife and his two cats. One day he's told that he's to wed his daughter to the poor but kind Prince Henry of Lancaster. The prince is happy to do it. At first things go well. The bride is beautiful and the ceremony is very well attended. Unfortunately, the young prince soon falls under the spell of his new bride's cruel and abusive husband, the Paupers. Soon the poor Prince is being used for the Prince's own personal amusement, playing with the little cat. The only ones who really understand what's going on are the Prince and his mother, but the old woman is frightened by her own son. One night the two old women are about to be attacked by their jealous step-son when they stop to rest on the stairs. And so ends the story of a little prince who has learned a bitter lesson about how the world can be a cruel place.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------- Well, if you're going to watch a John Carpenter movie, you might as well see a John Wayne movie. This one is pretty damn close though, and even better. A fun movie with tons of cool cars and a lot of fun. The plot is a little hard to follow, as its basically the same thing each time, but it does get there. The ending is a pretty sweet one that gives the feeling of ending. I enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it if you like John Carpenter.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~This film is a pretty nice actioner which gives a pretty great introduction to the world of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. The acting is good (especially, as the cast's names would imply, from various eras) and it manages to give some nice exposition on the history of the world through various characters (including the one voiced by Bernard Cribbins). I have to admit I was slightly let down by the ending which left me with the impression that the story would be resolved at the end of the film (it won't) but then things start to get a bit silly and I was glad I was able to put the film down before I reached the end. ~~~~~~~~~ Summary: ~~~~~I don't like to see the story to any film get an end, but this is a story which has a bit too much potential to actually wrap it up in one single film. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The League Of Extraordinary Gentleman - A Brief History ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The tale of Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest creation, The League. The League was started by Arthur Conan- dell and it has since become a household name. The most famous member of the League is Professor Harry Houdini, but there are others who are also notable, such as Sherlock Holmes, Lestrade, Dr. John Watson and Dr. Watson of the Victorian world. Many of the members of The Leag are also famous for their roles in other works, such Sherlock Holmes and Sherlock Holmes of the present day. ~~~~ Introduction ~~~~ One of the things I like about movies is that I can always find something to discuss. So let's begin! The League - A Little History ~~~ ~~ ~~ The League as we know it today was first proposed by the then-unknown Doyle. It became a popular topic of discussion within the community of the day, both in and outside of the club. In 1903, Houdin, the most famous magician of the century (although he wasn't even a real magician - he was a magician who worked with his mouth), had created a number of the most amazing illusions ever seen, among them: A "cub", a "lady" of some sort (or perhaps a woman), and some objects moving around a room, and these illusions were displayed in the club as well as in a book called "Mona Lisa - The Greatest Illusion in the World". This book had a little pocket of it at the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really cool film and it is great to see such a classic made into a great one.  The movie begins with a black and white photo of a girl in a classroom.  You look closely and you can see a lot of small changes have been made but the story is still one of the first ever science fiction films made.   It's interesting to see how far the story has come in a short amount of time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After playing several games of "King of Tokyo" in a hotel room, I decided to do something different and a little strange: I decided I was going to go see a movie at the Japanese National Theatre in Seattle.  It was packed: the crowd was rowdy and loud (it was a Wednesday night), and people were laughing and cheering throughout the movie (the acting is very bad).  But they were not laughing at the film.  They were laughing at and cheering over a man who is about to get his penis chopped off.   The movie was called "The Big Red One" (also known as "The Monkey's Paw" in Japan), which has an American star, and an English one (although I don't know why - I'm guessing he just looked like an American and his name was "Pikey" because he was wearing a large green "P" hat), but a Japanese star (the famous "Yukio" who I'm sure everyone has heard of).   I have to say this film was better than I ever thought it was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is great how this movie depicts a young boy named Kudou who lives a tough life in a small town. Kudoh is raised by his uncle, who is an abusive old man who beats up his young son every night. One day Kudouk sees an old man that he calls a "God" and is given the ability to fly. However, Kudo's dad does not believe this because he feels that there is something wrong with this man. So, he decides to get his son exorcised from the old man by force. He does this by killing him and then making up his own story about what happened that day. Of course, the people who know the truth believe his story but Kudok does not accept it.  Plot : The story of what happened is very similar to what has happened in the Japanese horror series "Bakemonogatari". However, the way the story is told is also very different in how the scenes are laid out. It follows a similar style in how it starts out with Kudoku being attacked and Kudooka not believing his stories. However it all ends up not working out for him and the reason why he attacks him is very interesting as it is explained in a lot of depth without relying on violence. It also involves several characters who all have their own ideas about the man and the people that hate him. There is also a lot more to this story than just the man, it involves things like the town's law enforcement, the church, the police chief and the old woman who has a huge stake in everything. This is just a great story, with interesting characters and twists all throughout.  The soundtrack is also pretty great, I love the piano and violin in the background for some reason. Overall, this movie is a good one with an interesting story to it.

A roman operetta, a musical based on a famous novel, a war movie, a comedy and then a mystery.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found the film to be very well made for a summer movie. The performances are solid but I have to mention that I have never been a huge fan of the old Batman comics. In my opinion the character was written out of existence and his actions looked nothing like in the comics. The villain, Mr. Freeze, was the best villain Batman has had in a very long time. There was nothing over the top and the villains got the job done. In fact the only thing the film lacked was a Superman to fight with. I'm glad the movie stayed true to the comic and did not turn Batman into a super hero like the films have been doing lately. There were plenty of memorable moments such as Batman throwing Robin around the room, Robin going on a "mission" to get rid of Batman, Batman using a tazer on the bad guy, and of course the classic "Batman's Revenge" sequence. A very entertaining movie that I enjoyed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been wanting to see this movie for a long time now. It reminds me a lot of The Omen (a movie I'll talk about later) in the fact that the whole movie is based on an alleged story told by a group of scientists back in the 50's. The scientists claim they are able to predict the future based on their experiments with a particular formula. It appears that the future doesn't go according to plan however, when the scientists make a mistake and try to predict who will win the world championship, it doesn't end up working out too well. If I'm to be honest, this movie isn't very impressive and it lacks the visual appeal of a good action movie. I've watched many Hollywood action films that have a lot to them. There aren't many good action movies these days. I think this movie is a bit above average, but maybe not too good. It's fun as heck. A lot of the action happens on the road (not in a good way) and the story is pretty entertaining. This movie takes about 50 minutes to get through and is a good time for the family. The kids all seem to be quite young.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've noticed this being discussed a lot lately but it's actually a great movie with a great story line.    This is a movie that's good enough to be a great action film.  Even though this is a great film there are plenty of silly scenes, such as the time the doctor has the patient in a room and is giving his diagnosis to the patient: "I am looking in the mirror and see a bald man. Well, you must be very bald yourself." I mean, this is good. It's a lot of fun and it's good to see a good sci-fi flick.  Also, there are a few action scenes where the characters do some good work.  There are a couple of funny scenes in the movie but they aren't too great.  Overall, this movie is great and well worth checking out if you're in the mood for good action films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Somewhere in the heart of the Appalachian mountains a group of men find themselves in a bind.  In his haste to get off a road that they were just coming off of one of them falls through some woods.  He crawls out and goes to the hospital, and there the doctors tell him that his leg is fractured.  They then take him to their operating table where they tell him all the odds are against him and that his only hope is to try and live to see Christmas. The movie opens in the hospital and we're told that the patient is a young boy that's been out jogging with his little brother and then went to walk the dog.  Just before they go to leave he's seen a girl.  The boy has a small wooden dog and when he tries to catch it in its teeth he doesn't get it.  His brother looks, but can't find him either.  All of a sudden a car pulls up in front of the house and the boy jumps in and runs back to his dog.   When the two come to they find that the girl is gone, her dog is dead, the woods around them are full of dead dog and the woman they left behind is missing.  This time the dog finds the boys.  But when it starts to follow it's owner it is attacked by another dog, and then a fox.  And the boys have one shot at getting away before things start to go downhill. This is a movie that has a lot of humor in it and is entertaining from the first time we see a boy with a dog and then another little girl and some foxes.  There is a great story here that I really enjoyed.  I also really like the voice of the boy and it's a good story that the viewer gets to know and love.  It was nice to see someone like Robert Redford at the age of 86.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Noah's flood is as real as a rainstorm when it comes." - Roger Ebert   If you know the Bible, and if you're an evangelist, you will know this movie. If you know anything about Noah's flood, this is the one to show it. If we've been through this movie before, we know we are going to see it again because it's so good and it gives us so much to think about and talk about. This is a powerful film.   Noah is a pastor who lives in a small town called Sodom. He has a wife who's pregnant and has been faithful to him. It turns out that she doesn't want to have any more kids.  . She has been living with the family of her ex-boyfriend, who is going out on the road with a new bride. As time goes by, Noah sees the difference between what he used to believe and what he now believes. It's all about God's promises. He knows the Bible tells him the world will end on a certain day, but he also knows it could come any day.   "We can't trust God anymore. We've been given the world, and we're taking it." It's a beautiful and powerful film that shows us that we must be ready for what God is about to do.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been watching a lot of old movies and this one is one of my favorites, with the same character as it's predecessor. This film is a great example of how to make a very simple story turn into something special.  The story starts with a beautiful young girl named Lola who is running away from a cruel man. She is followed by her uncle who lives a simple life as a poor farmer. He seems not to care much for his niece, he never talks to her except when he thinks the world is ending. So one day she runs away and tries to find her sister. She eventually finds her sister and they get together and live happily ever after. When they are leaving their father gives them both money in their younger years so that they have something to go on. But as I said above the uncle soon dies and the wife soon runs off. What happens next is the typical fairy tale plot where the good brother tries to avenge his father and the wicked princess does the same with her evil brother. It's a very good little flick that just happens to have a girl in the lead role.  You can't judge a book by its cover, 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm pretty sure I would have enjoyed this movie. After watching a trailer, I started thinking it was another "Wizard of Oz" kind of movie where we all lived in a magical kingdom in the forest with all our fairytale characters running around and having fun. I was hoping for a more exciting story, not another campy romantic comedy filled with campy costumes and acting gags. Boy was I surprised at how much fun we had! And I mean a LOT of fun. There were moments where all three of us were laughing hysterically in our seats laughing at a joke that had been made at a certain point. There was lots of laughter, laughs filled the entire theater, so much so that I even thought a little of the "Witches of East End" movie had been shown before. We all enjoyed this wonderful movie and were thoroughly entertained.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    At it's core, there's very little of that "good" about "Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return". There's also not a great deal of "I'm watching MST3K:The Return because it's great" to be found, although that's a much smaller problem. It's still a good show and the new cast members are a nice addition. It does a great job of capturing the spirit and sense of adventure of the show that never quite went away. It may not be the best show the MSTies ever did, but it's probably the best one they're ever made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  " I will say to my fellow Americans, that no one has done more to bring the message of the Declaration of Independence to the peoples of this earth than John Wayne. In one of the more dramatic scenes in his life, John Wayne was involved in an exchange with his older brother, Wyatt, with the latter demanding that the latter join the American Army in order to be able to help the former's wife. On learning this John Wayne, who had to enlist in the Army during World War II (to fight alongside the American soldiers in the European theater of the War) refused to do so, to the consternation of the older Wayne. After several months in an Army base in North Africa, the young, handsome, charismatic John Wayne is sent to serve in a base near the Egyptian border. Although his superior officer was less than impressed with the young star, Wayne soon became a much more trusted soldier than his officers. On one occasion he was sent to destroy a tunnel, and it was then that the young Wayne had the opportunity to do something remarkable. John Wayne could speak a dozen languages, as well as German, French, Italian, Spanish and English, so he was given the task of destroying the tunnel (with one of his men shouting to the other: "Go, go, go!"). The Germans dug the tunnel, John heard it, and as soon as the men had begun to work, the American was ordered to attack, and his first shot broke a row of German soldiers who were already on the move. The two Germans who were trapped behind their shields fled to the side of the tunnel so they were not seen by the Americans (the other had been standing close to the entrance of the hole, when a German soldier had fired a shot in the tunnel). John Wayne and his men followed the German soldiers to the tunnel and fired a second time when they had entered the hole. They fired again and again until they were satisfied that they had killed all the Germans. After this amazing feat the men celebrated in silence. John could not contain his excitement: "I feel like a hero." At this time Wayne's father, who was in Florida at the time, was able to contact the American army and Wayne was soon recalled. Wayne was again assigned to a unit near the border of Egypt. There he met General Donovan, who, as the commander-in-chief of the American troops in Egypt, wanted to meet John Wayne face to face. John did not wish to appear at
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about a group of people who are having a birthday party for a famous person. The person is so rich that he gives the party to every kid in the group except for two, who are two years apart and have never met. It turns out that they are in the same grade (or at least are close) and that the person is not rich, but has a big house filled with things like a swimming pool, ice machine, and even a horse. These kids go to the party, the party goes on, they get the things they've been waiting for, and a fight breaks out and a cop is hurt (with a broken neck). When the party is over the kid who has been with him the whole time is jealous and wants to leave. But since he has a huge house and everything else to himself, he has to stay and wait. Eventually he can't wait any longer and leaves, and it is the end. I really enjoyed this movie. It had a good story to tell, a good cast, and well played by all the kids who had roles. As for the ending, I didn't like it either. At one point, I was wondering why he was standing there, when the cop was hurt and he was the one who was fighting. I just didn't see why they couldn't have just shot him there, where he wasn't getting hurt any more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A young man who is only nineteen, born in a remote village in the mountains of central Georgia, is living alone in a strange house, and has a new girlfriend, who is just shy of nineteen. There is little to distinguish this young man and his lover from anybody else, not to mention any previous young man or woman. The young man is, as he has often said, like a good boy, who can't have many friends and who knows too much about people of other worlds and places. But his life is not of little worth, for he is at the bottom of a very great social pyramid, where it is only the upper two levels that can be enjoyed: the top, the aristocrats of the world, who rule and do not know what they do, the middle-class, who work hard but have little to do with the outside world, and the "lower classes," who are only too ready to serve their class. It has been suggested to me that this story could also have been written about the life of the early Christians, which was a long time ago, in a very different time and place. However it is not a good book for children. If you ask me why so much is written about "Gunga Din," I must answer you in two words: ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ "Guns and Bullets" is a true story, told with a mixture of realism and humor by a Georgia boy, a good hearted boy, full of promise, who has a dream: to go on a long, lonely voyage of exploration through the unknown world and to find a lost Indian tribe. As he takes off in his canoe for his expedition, he finds himself alone on an island, but a strange woman who speaks the languages of the people who dwell there is eager to take him with her, and for the next twenty-four hours he learns the strange language, the ways of life, and learns his destiny. This is a story that will have you looking back with wonder, and longing for the days of your youth, and years ahead to come. A must read.   "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" is the name that a great many writers who came later wrote about the small town of Sleepypoon, Indiana. Most of them, including those who wrote best, went into a state of deep depression after writing their first book. The fact that this writer stayed in this state to write his second book was simply a lucky accident.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A really good movie, the acting is very good and it is a good story.  The movie starts off with a man having his life totally destroyed, his wife abandoning him and leaving him and his little boy in a very bad spot, he is a very poor man and he needs some help, as soon as he turns up at a hospital where the chief of the department says there is a woman in a coma and he doesn't think she will wake up.  However he has a chance to help her, he calls in a man who he knows from when he was in an armed conflict, the man is named Dr. N.  The man then begins giving the man, a chance for his wife and child to live a better life and the woman does, as a big smile graces her face.    The hospital staff has a very short attention span and the hospital director who doesn't have a clue about what he is doing, he will do anything to get a medical career.       There are several scenes that are a little bit too long, but this is the nature of the movie, it is too long to be a good thriller or a good drama, but it is better than a mediocre film, as it has some action and a good storyline that makes the movie very enjoyable and the ending makes it quite a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the movie I was looking forward to seeing. It was a good film. There's no great special effects, so that's not a major plus; however, it did have a fun story and good characters. There are only three minor problems: 1)  There's a little bit too much talking 2) The characters aren't fully developed; there's also some plot-holes; and 3) the bad guys are just plain evil. I can't say that I am a fan of the "cage" style of film, although it's a good one to watch once in a while. A lot of people seem to like it, but not me. I didn't hate it, I just didn't enjoy it. The movie wasn't bad, although not outstanding. I would suggest that a good horror film should be suspenseful, yet scary and not scary at all at the same time. I thought this film had just a bit too many plot-hole's and characters I was bored with; and I didn'st like the good guy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was only a little kid (I'll always remember my mom saying to me, "you will grow up to be a man someday"), but this movie took me by surprise. I'm not really an expert on this genre of movies, but I'm an expert here.   This movie is not for the faint of heart.  The action starts off with a car-crash that leaves some serious blood on the windshield. Then the people inside the car start coming out alive, but only because they all got caught in a tornado. This movie has a lot going on, and it all makes a ton of sense. I just can't get enough of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very well-acted film with great humor and a sense of the surreal.   The story is about an old man who has moved to the city of Paris to see his sister, and the woman he has come to love. But her life is as bizarre and strange as his, and it seems that he can never leave her alone.  It's an interesting mix of the dark and surreal.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are some bad movies, but this one is great. It was the first movie I've seen about the life of a real estate agent in the 1920's, but a great movie to be sure. The acting is strong, the story is interesting, and the music is good.  A movie that is a must see if you are ever in New York.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good time and a good comedy/drama. I thought that the two main characters were funny but it was just a matter of time for them to get together and get married. I like a good romcom as much as the next guy but this is not one of them. The way in which the romance between these two is handled is a tad predictable and the way they deal with the problem when they do come together is also predictable. One good thing that this film does is that the dialogue is as funny as the funny scenes themselves. I guess the good things about this movie is that it is very entertaining, yet not too over-done. It is a nice throwback to the good old 70's.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this when it was first released on TV, and I couldn't stop laughing for what I think is like hours.  The story is very simple, it's a couple that travel around the world, and a bad guy that wants to do them in.    The action is excellent, the music is great, and the dialogue is great.  The plot isn't that complicated, but it has enough going on to keep you entertained.  I really liked this movie!   I can't speak for anyone else, but I found it to be hilarious.  I loved seeing the couple interact with everything in the world.  That's the real fun of this movie: seeing a couple's adventures and their reactions.  This movie was fun, and funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love all of the movies from The Wizard of Oz, but it was always hard to decide if we were watching the most recent one or a classic that had been made 20 years earlier.

The movie is a little bit more serious than the others but still just as silly.  You will like the comedy and the adventure.  It will be good to hear how these adventures are going to unfold.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't give this a great rating, but if you like to see the best of Star Wars, with a twist, and with characters so well-defined you don't know who they're supposed to be, and who really is the bad guy, go see this film. I think it's about the best movie I've seen in years, except for The Empire Strikes Back. There's a lot of story to keep track of, with some of the funniest moments in the movie, and the best effects you've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This has to be my new favorite movie. I love my books, my kids, and my friends, and I love being an old woman. But lately I am having this weird feeling that it is time for a change. So a few months ago I found a book called "The End of the World As We Know It". I got it as a birthday gift and couldn't put it down, and then I got the second book a few days later.  It's so fantastic, and at this point my wishlist is running at almost 200 books.    Now I just need to read "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" before I can be prepared for that day.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sicario is a very well made film, and a very tense film as well. I was very taken aback at some things in this film, I'm pretty sure it's not the type of film you see in a big budget film these days, however you're unlikely to see anything more out of this film than the occasional very creepy and tense moments.  I was impressed with how the visuals were used and how strong the film's themes are.  One of the things I particularly loved about the film, is how it deals with themes such as violence and drug cartels and that this film is a story about a very complex set of characters and how they interact and what they all think about each other.   I can't wait to see this film in theaters, however if I was to see it in a theater, I'd be disappointed as this is a great film but I'm sure it wouldn't be able to compete against some of the other films you can get now.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a great movie, that I could only wish was ever made a film. The fact that it was never made is really a shame, because it has many great scenes and characters, which really shows how great a writer is at writing in a film and at doing so, I feel the only bad thing about it is the story line, which is really really terrible.

If you love good comedy, you need to see this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When your main character is a vampire who can't get a date with an average joe he tries to be normal... He takes the time to learn how to ride a bike and goes to a museum for an adventure.  All he has to do is ride his bike and make sure not to hurt the people who are mesmerized by his beauty (except for a young girl)  She is the only one who can see the beauty in him but all of her friends are scared of him and she is the most innocent and sweetest girl in the movie.    What makes it a great movie is the animation is very high quality and the characters have all of the human traits.  All of the scenes are fun and entertaining.  I'm a sucker for a story with a vampire.  So far I have seen two others by the same writer, Vampire Girl and Werewolf Girl and all I can say is if you like vampires then go watch Vampire Girl!!   And the soundtrack is a great choice.  It is the perfect combination of classic pop and rock music.  Like I said above, an epic adventure with a sweet and innocent girl. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's funny, it's quirky, it has a lot of heart, and it leaves a good feeling about the characters.

I'm glad that it had so much heart to it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a masterpiece! One of the best movies ever made about the mafia. There are no bad scenes in this film, but a lot of them are bad, but some are not bad at all. It is a good action movie with nice music. I would like to say something about the film. When i was little i have watched a lot tv series. One of my favourite tv series are " The Streets of Chicago". My dad bought that series for me because i used to watch the tv series all the time in the car. I still watch that show to this day. But this is the first time that I have ever watched the film " The Mob ".  The film has a lot more characters but this is it. It really is one of the great films that have come out in the last few years. The film is really good and I recommend it to everybody. So... The film shows how the mob and the Chicago police came into a partnership in the 1940s to fight the war. In 1944 they set up a crime boss of Chicago, Joe Cannone who was a rival to the "Big Boss" Joseph Valachi who is the boss of the Chicago mob. The story is pretty good but in the end, it is kind of predictable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had to get this one, I loved the first one and this one is almost identical, just in different locations. This is about a man who was the world's greatest boxer from a young age till he retired. After his retirement the owner of the gym offers him a contract to fight a boxer in Russia, and he agrees. It turns out that Russian boxing is the best boxing in the world, it's not even in the top ten, and this man is coming to compete with the best, he's also getting old, but still he's not giving up. After all he has his family to look after, so he will have to keep fighting.   The movie is pretty much a fight for a guy to keep his head above water. At first I thought this was pretty weak, it made him seem pretty lame, and yet there was a lot going on here, he had his own personal trainer, as well as his sister and a girl who was supposedly his fiancee. This all was going on and there seemed to be some tension between them but he couldn't quite keep a job and they had to rely on his trainer to train him, so it didn't make much sense and he looked like a weakling to me, but it was really fun.   be  I watched this movie in Russian, but the translation didn't really make it better. It was pretty bad, I think most of it is just translation problems and the script seemed too simplistic. I can't really say how much it affected me but I was definitely watching it while looking for an easy way to pass the time.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the first movie I have seen that was actually good. I liked how the guy was trying to save the girl. The movie does have a lot of swearing but it's not that bad. I am not really a big fan of the girl, and I feel that the guy should've died. But it was nice to see her try to save him, which really shows what a good guy she is. This is also the first James Bond movie where you can tell who is the bad guy: the baddie is a girl! And she is in love with the badboy. The girls part is a good one with her singing, and the other good thing is when the badman was chasing her it really made the guy look like a weakling. The rest of the movie was okay, nothing bad really happened, but you would expect that from a Bond movie. I also liked the movie because it was a little different than a 007 movie and that's a good thing, you can't be the same Bond every time you come out of a helicopter and he runs away. If it wasn't for the bad guys I thought this would be good. But I like it better than the first Bond movie, and it was pretty good.

There isn't much to say other than the movie just made me happy and smiling. The plot itself is simple enough and the story is pretty simple in the beginning as well. Then, as a series, we come across the characters from all over the world all with their own problems and struggles.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been meaning to see this for a while now. I thought I could see some kind of horror movie about a kid in an insane asylum and then I remembered the director was Japanese and all that. What a great choice, the story is interesting and the film has the atmosphere of a traditional Japanese movie, even though in this movie a whole different style of story is used and there is a great deal of supernatural elements.  There are some interesting characters, the old lady is very disturbing and the ending is quite tragic.  I've read a few other reviews of this movie and they all say the same thing, if you are a fan of horror movies like The Shining or Halloween, you're gonna love this movie, but I must say that the style is a bit different and you might see a different kind of movie in the end. I didn't see this film for too long, but it was a real treat and I am glad to have found this great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just finished The Wolf Among Us by Brian Michael Bendis, which is a good story with an interesting central character.  The Wolf Among us starts off pretty simple with a guy who wants to kill a wolf because he was afraid of the wolf's strength.  He gets chased around by the wolf and is almost killed once by the giant wolf. He manages to defeat the wolf by fighting him until he is knocked out.  Now the wolf has to hunt down the man who wants it.  This all happens in a little valley on the east coast of the United States.  Bendis has always done excellent work on his Wolverine comics.  The Wolf among us is the best part of them all.  It has all the elements of a great superhero book.   It is dark and has all kinds of cool characters.  I especially liked the character of "Hank."     It is not a very well written book. There are some scenes in which you can see that Bendis doesn't understand a lot about how comics work.   The dialogue was awkward at times. I think he was trying to make the book sound more epic and epic was not his forte.    He is trying to portray what a superhero comic should be, but it doesn't work because the story didn't seem epic and the dialogue didn't work.  I highly recommend this book. Overall:  The Wolf among Us is a well written story with some cool people and a good cast.  While there are flaws it is worth the read for those who are a fan of Brian Michael Bends works.  There is nothing quite like a good comic book.   I would like to see more of this story in the future, maybe we should have some more super heroes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an awesome movie. I like the first and last act because they are a little more dramatic. I was a little nervous because its in a movie theatre and the people who attend are all older. But there was no one to speak to. And I was able to talk to a lady who was at the other end of the aisle who told me that it was a good story. I thought it was the story of a woman who got involved in a story that was told to her by a young man who she had a romantic connection with. I hope that the director was able capture as much of the life that the movie depicts as the movie itself was. If you like films that you can enjoy at home with the children you can do this movie. The music was nice and there were some funny moments. I also had a good time watching this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't believe this is a movie about a "mole"...I know right. However, this movie is so well acted, and the plot is very cleverly written, that I think it must have been a huge challenge to get the actors and actresses to get into character for such a short amount of time. If you enjoy a film with great actors (and not just the actors who do the voice-overs. There is plenty of great acting as well, and I just love it. There's even a cameo by Michael J Fox, as the character of the mole...who was a very good actor. If the movie really is about an "evil mole" who is sent from outer space to bring an epidemic upon the US, I must say that it is the first movie that I have seen that has the main character as the mole. The film is a little confusing to me at first, as it starts off at a restaurant, with a woman being killed by a "mad bomber", and everyone being in shock about what has just happened. Then, out of nowhere the mole enters the room, takes a seat next to the "lady", looks around the place, then moves away from her, and goes over to the other lady, and then talks to her for about a minute, and takes her phone from her. The story is simple, but the characters are all so well made it's hard not to be engrossed, and to be entertained, as they all talk about nothing in particular, and just keep talking about things that are happening around them...things that are obviously happening to a lot of us (you just have to check the TV in your car every morning). As a bonus, I just found out, that there is a second (and last) sequel to this movie! If you can get it (I don't think there is an on-line release), I highly recommend it. It's a nice little film with some good acting. It is a very well-acted picture, and if you like science fiction, I think you will enjoy the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a funny, lighthearted, entertaining film that will do little to bring you up short in the middle of your lunch hour, but it will entertain you for the most of the film, with a fun plot and a good pace. I've heard horror comedies where the main character is a child, but this is the kind that is not afraid to show a few adult life experiences, such as a divorce (the main female is the one with the divorce) and getting out of a custody battle. I like the movie, it's got a good cast, and good timing, that makes for a funny and interesting film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this sequel of The Godfather saga, Marlon Brando is back as the mob boss Sonny Corleone. Marlon was so successful with his film debut in this film. Sonny Corso returns to his family's territory in the north of Italy and he is looking for something. There is his son Michael who wants to return to the family and the life that he knew and his wife Mirella. Sonny asks to take Mire Bella to their old home and there Sonny wants to live the old way again. He does not want Mire to marry again and for Marlon to be the boss and the only one who can get what Sonny Corone wants. Sonny decides to hire a beautiful dancer to marry Mirello and in the meantime he asks Marlon for some advice. But Marlon refuses his request and Sonny goes back to his old way of doing business. Sonny meets a lovely young beauty named Anna Maria Corleoni and she is in love with him. In an attempt to get Mire, Sonny decides he would like to destroy the mafia in Italy. He has hired a Russian gangster to join the mob and is ready to destroy it. He meets Michael and decides to kill him. However in the end of the film Anna Maria comes and asks him to marry her and Marlon cannot refuse.  In the ending of the movie, the mafia does not die of revenge, but they are completely destroyed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is based on the first novel by James Fenimore Cooper. As the story goes, in 1871 a young black man, David Niles (played by the late John Carradine) is walking down a lonely, winding road when he comes across a strange man. A man on a horse with a long sword. The odd encounter goes on and on until Niles begins to have nightmares about the strange man who kills men in broad daylight. It seems as if the man has some mysterious power to kill those who cross his path. As Niles wakes up to find the horse is gone, he begins to try and get rid of the mysterious figure. Niles soon realizes that his encounter with the man is just the start of something much bigger... This is a film that was made to be enjoyed over a long evening with a good cup of coffee. The special effects have aged well and are still amazing in 1986. As one who grew up with black and white Western films, these effects are a little dated now, but they were incredible back then. As for the characters, there were really only one or two that I could remember (especially Niles), but overall the film was still enjoyable. I loved that Cooper wanted to portray a dark and moody atmosphere in which the viewer could sit back and enjoy the story, but never really got too far along in his tale until the film reached the conclusion.   The Last Time by James Weaver (1970) Another one of Cooper's films that came out at a time when this is all the rage. A little over a year after The Man Without a Face, this film was a bit more of an interesting and atmospheric take on Niles's tale of a masked killer stalking the woods. It also shows the different ways in which ghosts can appear and act to some people. But the movie was a little slow and the ending left a little open-ended.  Ghost Story by James B. Harris (1967) I don't like many of Cooper films, so I really don't know why I included this one here. It's not bad, it's just not that good, as I've always said. The film is about a young man who, during a camping trip, gets killed by a bear. He's then revived, and then finds that the person who revived him is not him. This is only the beginning of a series of things that lead up to the man's discovery that there are people out there who
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hey folks, This movie is a great one! It features lots of humor, romance, and action and is set during WW II on the streets of Germany, so that you get to see a wide variety of different scenes all over Germany as well as in Germany itself. The characters are quite well designed and are nicely drawn by the famous artist Karl Koch. The sound effects are all excellent and well placed. And the music is well done, but it doesn't stand out all that much. And most of all, it gives you a feel for life in Germany during WWII and it does not disappoint. This is definitely a movie you will enjoy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What I love about this movie is that it has the elements that I look for in a good science fiction film:  good story, a well written script, a good cast.  This is one of the best "first person" movies I have ever seen, and it is a well done film that is not pretentious about its subject matter.  I am not a big Star Wars fan at all.  It's more of a nostalgia project and the script is not very good.  I think George Lucas was doing a movie of this kind a long time ago, but I can't remember which one it was.  This story is very well done and the dialogue is very natural.  The only problem I had with the film is it tries too hard to be like Star Wars.   The plot is about a space explorer who has to find a new planet after his ship has been destroyed.    This guy has to do research to find his friends.    It's just a waste of time, but at least it takes a different approach from the Star Wars stories.  If you are into science fiction with a good story you should give this a try.

Overall, it was a fun movie. It was also good to see the monster in action again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In case it isn't obvious, the film is really about a boy, and a boy who falls in love with a girl. This is obviously not a film that can be enjoyed without a little imagination. It was produced by a group called Dennie Smith's Film Corporation in the early 1950's, but the company itself is a somewhat obscure one: a group of American filmmakers who took out a loan from the U.S. Bank to produce films and eventually sold off their studios to another group that continued producing films of their own until the company went bankrupt.  Dennie Jones, as the group's original founder was a good-natured sort. He came to California in the late thirties from Georgia, and at first his company was quite successful.  He wasn't a film buff. This film is actually from 1941 or 1942, and you can read a bit more about his films here:
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have a bit of a weird bias when it comes to old movies. When I was growing up, my mom would often send me to see this movie with my Dad when he and I were visiting from out west. It was a fun time for all of us, so I am happy this classic film has a new life, not the kind the original version which I think is much more interesting. It's still a wonderful flick, a good, funny, and even sometimes tragic tale of love and loss. It is also not nearly as dark and depressing as it could have been. A good, dark comedy with a tragic ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â I've heard of this movie for years but have yet to see it. I can't wait to see this one! The story of a couple who decide to get divorced by going in for a big divorce fight. As the husband gets frustrated by the wife who seems unable to fight in the ring, she pulls out a gun and shoots him. So far so normal. Then the wife's father shows up and takes the gun. So we are now into a full on fight. This fight is awesome. The fight is about as good as the fighting scenes in a Quentin Tarantino movie. The punches and kicks are so good! I've seen more action movies in my life than this one. This is a full fledged action movie. I loved this film from start to finish. I'd give it a 10/10 and an 8/10 in character. The characters have great chemistry. The fighting scenes were great too, lots of quick cuts and high quality camera work. Â Â   This movie is really good. The fights are awesome, the music is excellent and there are some really good scenes like the one where our character gets blown up, one of the best explosions in a Tarantino film.  This is a great movie from start till finish.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, I don't know about you all, but the first three parts of this movie seemed rather dull to me. It seems that even Hollywood wants to be more "cool" than it is, and the movie is a sad case of that. So I can't really recommend this movie to anyone, especially as it was made way back in the 60's...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this is a real treat from a great filmmaker. The story of an alien who decides to visit a planet that is teeming with life...he comes across a colony of genetically engineered humans, and decides to help them to overcome their genetic shortcomings. This is a sci-fi movie that is so imaginative and clever. The story is simple but so full of energy.  The alien is portrayed by a truly great actor (Richard Gere) who plays it very convincingly...he is an alien in a human body, and he is so very charming in this picture.  I just love the way these humans are portrayed.  They are smart, very clever and extremely funny.   Although the movie is not very well made, the humor is very good.  It also has a very strange romance with a strange alien and a beautiful lady.  I do not think it was the best picture of the year, but it is a good one, and a wonderful story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the early '80s, there were a lot of crappy, low-budget horror movies about the paranormal. This movie was on a whole other level. As soon as the film starts, you have this creepy feeling. You know there's something wrong here because of the creepy music, the creepy, eerie lighting, and the creepy atmosphere, it really makes you feel uncomfortable. It was scary even if the movie isn't. I can't even explain it to you. But I hope that you can watch it on your own before you judge a movie too harshly.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â A good comedy. Â It's very funny and has quite a few jokes.    This is one of the better comedies to come out in the 80s so I'm really glad I took a chance on it and gave it a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never thought I would see a movie that had nothing to do with what it's about: a woman and her daughter going to a family funeral in the woods. But that's where these movies will always stop.   Now, let's talk about what this movie does have going for it. The character of Mrs. Bensley, played by a fantastic Patricia Neal, is very interesting. She's an introvert and a pretty strong and unassuming person, but she's also got a lot of character.   with a very strong sense of humor. She has a pretty good job that keeps her pretty busy, but it isn't a very lucrative job. Her family is still very poor, and they're getting older and older. She doesn't want to go to the funeral because she doesn't think she wants to be there. But she just has to see her son. She is very uncomfortable because she and her husband were forced to separate by her husband's alcoholism and his drug abuse. He's a pretty ugly guy, and she's afraid his kids will find out. But her son keeps on getting into trouble, and then there's a little incident with a girl. I'm sure you can figure out the movie's main point.   The plot isn't very good, but the plot is pretty good. It's very slow going, but I wasn't bored. I didn't really like Mrs.Bensley. She was supposed to be an introverted, poor, family woman with a strong sense and sense of justice. But I don't think Mrs. Neal does a very good job of portraying her in this movie.   It's also the only movie I watched with a friend. We watched it at a friend's house. It was pretty nice because we'd both get to watch different movies.  I think this movie will appeal to people who like movies where people are trying to get away with crimes. If a movie has to do anything, it's have a plot. That's pretty much all this movie had to do. But it's not a really bad movie. It makes some great references to real events of the past. It is a great reminder that there are a lot more people who need justice than there are people who are willing to put themselves through prison.   I think this is a good film. It just doesn't do anything much. And it does a pretty bad job of telling the story it wants to tell. I was really
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie about a bad situation!   My son is an aspiring musician.  We went to a music studio in Boston to work on a track.   The song went over well but I was quite upset to see the producer.  He seemed quite disappointed with my son.  I had given him a couple of things to play and he kept saying I didn't sound like an Indian.  They had given us a few guitars, a bass and a couple pedals to try it out.  The first time he played he blew our minds but they were not impressed.  We took the instruments home and were ready to start rehearsing.  My daughter went in and asked the girls in my family to help me.  It was a little awkward but we got along fine.  As my son worked on the music he had this vision.  At one of the songs there was a guy that stood up on his chair.  His neck was so long his entire face was covered by this long head.  This guy was a very tall Indian. The song ended and the guy stood up.    He started to speak to my son from behind.  Soon he was speaking to us.   As we were talking we could see the music of the guy playing the guitar.  Now this was the scene that gave me the greatest chills.  When he was done talking he pointed over the balcony.   We sat there and watched as this tall and muscular Indian with a long neck walked on his knees, put his head over the edge, and jumped off the roof.     I would not want to meet him.   There are no words to describe the feeling of my heart as I watched this scene over and over.  To this day, it is hard to watch this film.  There is one scene in the film that I wish I could change.  In the middle of the film is the scene where a man is on his way to a concert.   This man is dressed in a very frilly dress.  On his way there he stopped in a field near his car to give a little girl a hand.  These were the kids who helped me on my music journey back to the states.  Once this man left he went to the car and the girl followed and then she ran back to her mother to tell her that her favorite singer had fallen off the ledge!    There are many people I wish were still alive.  If
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I do believe the movie is pretty accurate but, like all good movies it takes a while to get to grips with the story. That and the dialogue can get a little grating, some of it, that is, when it is not laced with a bit of "the-hell-homes-fire". But what the heck, let me take it easy. And the movie does not really need the help of any other person, it is a pretty good story. I liked it so much because of the characters, I think I could read them and I would. The action is also good, the whole set-up, from the car wreck, the arrest, the investigation of the place, all to get the truth, all set up to the point where, when the murder took place, it all came together. If you are not fond of violent crimes and crime-solving, don't watch this movie. But for those who are, I do not think they will be disappointed.  The Bottom Line: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a lover of the genre I will always have a special place in my heart for the classic French thriller. You've probably guessed this from the rating, but let's just say that The Wages of Fear is the quintessential thriller. I've never seen anything like it and the fact that I still have a fond memory of it is one of those things that simply makes me happy. It's a beautifully made film, a genuinely chilling piece of cinema and a thoroughly enjoyable piece of escapism. There's a genuine sadness about this one, a great sense of dread and unease. The movie begins in the late 19th Century where a man, Dr. Thiers (Maurice Benard) meets a woman called Madeline (Mélanie Thierry), who he believes to be the reincarnation of a family member who was murdered many years ago. The story takes place during a severe French winter where the world seems to be descending into madness and tragedy. And then it cuts to the present where Madeline, a young female nurse, has found herself caught up in the middle. But who is behind the mysterious events that are threatening to push both Madeline and her loved ones further into the void?   I had the chance to go to the Cannes Film Festival the year this was released in France and was lucky enough to see it on the big screen for the first time there. It made a significant impression on me. The atmosphere of the film is perfect for its era and a true classic. The film looks stunning and the effects were very impressive. As an old-school horror movie it manages to pull off all the elements of a great classic.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very good movie about a strange man named Bobo Smith and his family, a very eccentric family. They seem to have all kinds of odd relatives, one being a man and a woman, a cat, a bear, a duck, a dog, a monkey, a frog, a horse, a pig, and even a cat that is a snake. These strange relatives often have a thing for each other, and this family seems to be the most eccentric family in the country.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For some reason, one of the more popular films about the Vietnam war is The Deer Hunter  (1974) by Hunter S. Thompson.  I remember watching it at age 13 when it first hit television.   The movie is about a cowboy (Brad Pitt) who has been in the Army for two years, when he is shipped to Vietnam.  He has been stationed at a base in Thailand and when his unit is sent to Vietnam, he decides to be a real man and joins up with the Army.  Pitt's character is a former Army officer (he spent two years as a major), who has done a stint in the infantry before being sent to the infantry.  His career is put on hold when the Army is sent back to Vietnam so he can serve in the jungle in the company of a Marine officer (George Kennedy).  Pitt is in a lot of trouble because he is a poor shot but he's a "cowboy". The entire movie is extremely violent and disgusting with all the "bad" things happening. It's like a nightmare but a violent one.  In the middle of the movie, Pitt gets hit by an M60 machine gun and falls to the ground, dying. The movie ends with the line "I am a deer hunter".    The movie was so violent that the movie could be banned if shown in America. It is one of my favorites, and one of Pitt's most popular movies.  I was fortunate to have a copy when I was young and I still have a tape on VHS. I recommend The Deer Hunt to anyone who wants a movie about the war, a cowboy, and the horrors of war.  About the movie: The Deerhunter (1974) is written, directed and produced by Hunter  S.Thompson. The film is about Hunter's experiences in Vietnam during the summer of 1964 with fellow Vietnam vet, John S. McCain, who is also a Vietnam vet. Hunter served with the 2nd Cavalry Division and earned two Purple Hearts. He has a reputation of being a "bad-ass" or at least that's what he is told. This is Hunter's first film since his film "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" and he did a lot to redeem himself from that flick, but  The Deerhunt  was the last time Hunter shot a gun.  This is a very dark and disturbing film about a war between the United States and the Viet Cong.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hollywood has never been better. It has been so long since I heard a good song that I can't remember what the movie was about... but then I looked it up... It's a musical about a poor old man who gets a job running a movie theater. The old man hates people. He says this because he hates the idea that people would like his movie. One night, a little girl (who is, as they say, "dressed like a horse") has gone missing. At first, the old man isn't concerned, because he says she is just "like a dog," and then he remembers: "It is not a dog who steals a horse." And he runs into a woman, who looks like a cat... who says it is a horse, and asks him if he can save her. It's so beautiful... and then she tells him: "You can't take me with you. I'm not a horse. I am a girl." And it is just wonderful. I could quote a song or two... but instead, I will quote the song itself: We're all just children when we're young But you grow up, we grow old... And that was a beautiful thing to watch and just to think about and just a good time to watch it...
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ It's a good time, and a good story. The film takes the genre very seriously and treats it as such. _____________________________ I'm just not sure how it could possibly become a classic. _________________ The movie stars a young man who takes up a quest to find the lost treasure of the island kingdom of Drangleic. His quest leads him to the ancient island of Lothric, which is also home to the infamous sorcerer Vanian, a fellow sorcerer who has turned against his fellow sorcerers, including himself. Vanian is one of the most entertaining characters you'll see in a film, and it's nice to see that he keeps his cool under any situation. --------------------------- The film is a little slow for me to say, but then again I'm not sure what to expect when dealing with a story such as this, so it is worth watching. It does start out slow, but it does pick up and I think it really goes into overdrive towards the end. _____________________________________________________ A story with a little bit of a twist: _____________________________________________ There is a big difference between a good and a bad magician. If you try to be good at magic, you have already gone far in your way. --------------- To view the film in its entirety please click here.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie at several different times, and this is the best showing of it. If it were not for the "wink-wink" jokes that always made me feel sick. The movie is very dark, with no happy end, and with more than a few graphic sex scenes. You can find the movie in any public place, but avoid going to the theatre. I was quite disappointed with this movie.   It wasn't really bad. It wasn`t a bad movie, just not a very good movie. The only way to explain it is if you had a really bad night at the stag night, and you go out with a bunch of other guys in the middle of the night, one of whom is your mate who is not quite ready for women.  It seemed that the first half was about that, the guys having a good time, and the girls just being a pain in the ass. It seems as if the second half is about this other guy. He was a real piece of work, and was only on screen for about 2 minutes in the movie (the rest of the time he was just walking around the house and looking at the girls). He was very handsome and had a very sexy voice to boot. The one that was the worst was the one called "Mack", who is just a pretty bad boy. He really didn't have a good personality in the film, and just seemed to be there to act up the girls and keep the boys interested. He was very annoying.

This is one of my favourite movies of all time! I'm not a huge fan of the classic film 'Eagles of Death Metal' but that doesn't take away from my love for 'The Eagle'. It's really great, even if the song is kind of cheesy. The scene in the cafe was really cool and I love seeing Krissy dressed as a giant eagle. It's such a fun movie, very funny and full of fun. I loved watching Krissy in her red-white-and-blue t-shirt. If I could choose between being Krissy or Anya, I would choose Anya. Krissy, on the other hand, is a great girl and very nice to watch with a giant eagle's head in a red t- shirt. If that wasn't cool enough, the movie ends with Krissy being saved by Anya who then flies Krissy away on her bald eagle head to a world she has never been to before...

I don't think I would like to watch it again.

It should be seen if you like action, martial arts movies, this movie is not for everyone, but there are some good moments of action and martial arts. The story, story is not original, and the action is not so good, but the story, and humor, the jokes and the characters in this movie are very funny. It is a good action-comedy, if you want a good comedy you really need to see this movie, the action scenes are great, the fight scenes are funny, it is a comedy, it was made for the funny people who watch action films. It was a good entertaining movie, if a bit not so original story, but it still has good humor. It can't be good if not original to say the least. There are some minor things that need to be fixed to better this movie. I hope they improve the story some more, but we can't wait. I gave it a rating of 8/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bartender is an excellent comedy, and an absolute gem of a movie to boot.  I'm a huge fan of John Cusack, and this is a film he has delivered many times.  The acting, the jokes, and even the characters are all absolutely hilarious, and it has enough action to keep it from being an all too familiar genre comedy.  I have no doubt that this was just one of those "one-shot" movies, made by someone with a couple days left to go.  This is a movie that could easily fill a weekend.    If you like this movie, and you enjoy John C. Cusacks comedic talents, then you should definitely buy and rent this movie.  You won't be disappointed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film has been in the public eye for over a week now. It is a fun story set in an old French restaurant in Paris. The young chef, the young waitress, and the young cook all have one thing in common. They are from the Parisian suburbs. The older sister, Jean, comes from a rich family from the outskirts. She is very proud of her upbringing and is jealous of the young couple who can afford to live in such a nice area. Jean is also a bit jealous but she is jealous. The old sister is always teasing them about their lack of manners and she doesn't care what is going on in the world. Jean and her parents are very distant.   The film is set in a French restaurant called Les Halles in the 15th arrondissement of Paris. It has been shuttered for more than 100 years. Most of the exterior of the restaurant has been preserved but what is left of the interior has been kept in a state of disrepair. This restaurant is frequented by everyone from the rich to the poor and the French people. Every night, during the meal, the waiter would give out free drinks for people who wanted to leave a good impression. There were always very many people visiting the restaurant.  The restaurant is run by a very wealthy, rather old, old couple named Jean and his wife. These people make a lot of money and the restaurant makes a lot for Jean and Jeanne. The restaurant has always been the center of Paris and the most popular among the people. It was a great place to be but the poor people were not as welcome and their food did not taste as good.  These things are not the fault of the owners. The owners of the establishment were not always there and the poor folks were not getting the best of the good. Jean's parents are not happy about their son living in a place like this but they do not know how to handle it. It takes some people a while to get used to such a luxurious home.  It is almost the same story as a movie set in Los Angeles called "Gimme Shelter".   I was able to buy a copy of the French movie at the movie theater. This was my first time seeing a French movie so it was great to see a film where there are good characters and no bad ones.  If you like to hear an English story about a romance there is a new film called "Clerks III".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought this was a good idea. I had not read the book so I didn't know what the plot was about. And I was hoping for a great film. So for once, I was disappointed. The story took me 2.5 hours to read through and I was bored in the end. I think that is because I wanted something more actiony, and I don't have an affinity for fantasy stories. The actors did not do any of their characters justice at all, the film seemed rushed and didn't really feel like a whole lot of work was put into it. It could have been so much more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw this movie about 30 years ago. It was directed by a man who's known for directing films that will get you in the mood for a good laugh. One funny scene after another followed, each one funnier than the last. In fact, if the movie didn't contain a good scene after that funny scene, then I wouldn't be mentioning it at all. This movie is a classic that will stay with you a while. If you like comedy, then this movie has it. If, however, you don't like comedies, then you should stay clear. I have a feeling that most viewers of this film were probably laughing the whole time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** The movie is called "Blackout" and it is actually a really good movie, but its pretty short. It is about a guy who loses his job and then gets a gig on a construction site on the outskirts of town. He meets a girl who lives down the road and the two of them get together and its just fun to watch. The movie was shot very well, very crisp, a little too fast but it is a good way to get started with a movie and it was also shot with a decent camera but it was definitely the last film that I saw that was really in this style. I hope that there will be more movies in this vein because it is really really good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I did not go see The Dark Knight Rises until the 4th of June and there was absolutely no reason to do so. I could only go to the theater for the opening scene. The scenes which followed, I found boring. I am amazed that there were not more characters added. It would have been great if the villains were added to the picture. I loved the idea of Batman and Joker in the same movie but this idea did not develop the movie or the plot. I also didn't feel the love that I had for Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. If Nolan's previous movies were more of an adaptation of the first two books of the graphic novel series, this film would have received 5/5 stars and that would be too bad. There was too much dialogue, a lack of action and not enough humor. The villain Bane is a nice addition but he did not make the movie, it just made it a little bit better. I would have liked to see more Batman and Batgirl in this picture. And to top it all off, all the villains who have a role in this film should have been killed off in the first movie.

One soldier (Rudolph Valentino) keeps on fighting (like the movie) and is cured and then dies. The movie ends with a Roman emperor (Al Pacino) talking to another emperor (Christopher Plummer) about this movie. Then, in the credits, we see a big smile on the face of Al Pacino.

At least the ending was a good one.  5 out of 5  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As far as horror movies go, this is the most frightening I've seen!  It's a nice combination of horror and suspense, and it does the job so well!  The movie is about two people, a young man and woman, who live on an island.   The woman is a nurse who is suffering from some kind of disease, and her husband is a priest who has lost his faith in God.  They're having a fight over how they're going to get on the island. One morning, they wake up in a strange room with no windows, no doors, a mirror, and no lights.  The man, named Robert (who doesn't like the movie and won't answer my questions), finds a small, beautiful bird in a cage and tries to get the bird out.  After an unsuccessful effort, he finds another bird that is so tiny he can't see its entire body.  Robert thinks the bird is his grandmother and starts to carry her out of the room to let it out.   The bird then gets angry and bites Robert's hand, and he then drops a knife and begins to panic as the bird gets smaller and smaller.   While Robert is freaking out, the woman goes outside to get help, but all she finds is a man in a black coat who seems to know who she is.    She thinks he's the one to get out of this room, so she tells him they've had a quarrel over religion.  She says she believes God doesn't exist, but the man refuses to believe her.  Then she realizes it's the same man who is in her house the whole time (it's her neighbor who's not there).  After a series of strange incidents, it becomes clear that the whole world is a nightmare, and that the only way to escape it is to go back in time to 1845, where they both lived.  This is the reason why the woman doesn't want to leave the island, so the man goes and gets her a key to the cabin and a gun to protect her. After this event, the movie becomes more psychological.  As I said, the main tension in the movie is between the two characters.  Although they can't talk to each other, they are able to see each other's true feelings.  However, the plot has so many twists and turns it's hard to keep up!  The characters' reactions are quite good.  If
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most important thing to remember about this film is that it is a classic noir thriller (the term "noir" refers to a type of story in which crime usually happens in broad daylight). It is about a woman who gets robbed (one time). We see the whole thing as it happens, from the perspective of the man who robbed the woman, and of the policeman who has to solve the crime.   But how? We see several shots of the crime scene. We see where the crime took place, we see what happened afterwards, we get a sense of what happened at the hospital, we learn of the identity of the suspect by looking at his photograph, we hear a statement of the victim, we feel sympathy for her, then we see her take a knife in her hand and she stab him. And we see a good shot of him on the ground. But the rest of the film is about the investigation and the arrest of the thief, and what happened later.   a classic "novel" noir, and a good film, a lot of fun...   P.S.: if you like to look closely at a man who has a knife held to his back, there are a lot more shots like this.  ...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen the movie more times than I can count, and I find myself going back to it from time to time, especially when I need to pass the time and watch a movie with my nephew, who I live with on the weekends.  This movie has aged very well.    "I never thought I'd see the day...that some kid would come out with a rocket ship in it!" ( The Rocket Ship Came from Outer Space ) It's a simple yet ingenious idea:   a man with a special rocket ship (that is actually a giant spacecraft he built from scratch), built in a space station, is sent to another planet with a very limited budget, with the idea that the ship can reach other planets by rocket.  The basic idea behind this movie is that the man's name is Jim Bell (George Wendt), who lives in the little town of Gurnee.  What he is working on there, is a very innovative rocket to the other side of the solar system.  He has made it possible for other cities to fly to the distant planets as well as to his own.  In order to launch his vehicle to the Martian continent Mars, he's having trouble finding the ship.  While he's looking for the ship (on the planet Venus) he stumbles into a fight between a man and a group of evil space men (that are from planet Earth) that want his ship. It is up to Jim to save the day and rescue the ship from these "space men".  The movie is a comedy, and if you are a fan of films with a lot of humor, you really shouldn't miss this one.  And if you like to watch "space movies", you probably also like this movie as well.     And the best part about this movie?

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The first thing I thought when I heard about this film was "Why does no one say this is a wonderful story" I thought this was a beautiful adaptation of a beautiful story by an awesome playwright who is a great dramatist. The cast are superb. The cinematography is brilliant. The music is beautiful, the set pieces are beautiful. The story is so well told and the story of our beloved protagonist, the young man named Bill (the son of a slave owner) is so endearing that I felt I should see this movie again and again. ____________
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** I've never seen anything more powerful than the scene where a young girl goes down a flight of stairs and stops dead in her tracks and stares up at the ceiling - the ceiling which she is unable to move - because the stairs have already ended. I'm still in shock. It had the effect of an all-embracing lightness on which the entire film swoops and spins. *************** This film is one of the best I've seen - it has a lot to say, and it says it well: we're not talking about a man and woman of the same mind; we're talking about two people living in an almost totally different universe; we've got a very sophisticated and very clever film to make sense of the way in which their respective lives intersect. ******** The film, as a whole, is like a perfect triangle: first of all, an absolutely absorbing, almost hypnotic meditation on the relationship between the two people we are meant to be interested in: the girl, who is a typical, self-confident, good-looking British teenager, and the man, who we are left in no doubt is a genius. The story is as much about the way they live together, and their love affair, and to what extent the man and his wife can or will cope with what each of them sees as the limitations of a marriage that is, in fact, the only marriage possible, while in themselves each tries to live a life of her own choosing. It's a fascinating movie, even in the way the story is structured. The way the movie is constructed, and how you can think of it as a picture of two people's lives. Then we have the way it unfolds: the story, like many films of this type, is told as a series of fragments, a sequence of events, in one long shot, with a small cast of actors that are all very much on the same page, and you get a feeling of what it might feel like if everyone was actually on the one level. There are scenes with people doing strange things, scenes of them watching each other while they talk, scenes where they both sit quietly and wait, for the other's turn to speak - or even just sit and watch each other. It is interesting that one of them turns out to be the narrator, and that the whole thing is being constructed out of conversations they have had, because if they could talk, I don't think it would have made any difference, and

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story in this movie is told with a lot of action and lots of bad guys, which I didn't like. But there's nothing wrong with the plot. At the very beginning, we learn that a very old lady named Mademoiselle de Paris has come to the small village of Côte Rouge, France to live with her cousin Porthos. Portho is an old man who was once a lover of Mademoielle de France, which she has since forgotten about. But then, something happens that makes Mademolière de Paris to return. When Porthous arrives there, Mademouette de France makes a terrible mistake and gets pregnant with their child. At that time, Porthou has no other choice but to leave his hometown and find a place to work and live. But he hasn't heard from his cousin since he left. A couple of years pass and Porthouch returns and the couple is already married. After the death of Porthoch, P.D. is forced to join an army and get rid of Mademan's curse. There, he begins to learn about his wife and their child...   This movie is great! It has a lot action in it! It is very fast paced. The plot is fantastic. I loved how the movie is a mix between a mystery and a thriller. It's all very intense with lots of fighting scenes in between. The ending of this movie was a surprise! I had never expected such a twist on the plot, which turns out to be very important to both characters and the story. I like how it ended and I hope I will never see a film like this one again!  Helpful I'm very sorry that the movie I mentioned in the beginning is not a horror movie.It was a thriller which was a little too much for me. I can still remember every detail of the movie, and that's all that matters.But if you like the movie you should probably go to the movies. The movie is based on a real event and it's good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie had me in stitches from the beginning and had me wanting more of the story. I am really looking forward to the sequels to it!! About the author:   A true fan of the horror genre, I enjoy watching horror films and reading about them. My favourite films are: "Dawn of the Dead"  , "The Evil Dead", "The Devil's Rejects" , "Bloodlines", and "A Nightmare on Elm Street". I can't say that they are perfect films, but they're so much fun to watch. I really want to go to the set of the Evil Dead remake, I know it is going to be amazing and I am so glad to have seen it. My next favourite film is "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This is the story of two young people whose paths cross in some unforeseeable fashion in an isolated place: a remote, remote island called the Great Island. These two meet and immediately start talking about girls... and boys... and love and the beautiful things that can happen when you let someone in that you love for all of one night.  It's a small film, but with a large heart. It's about relationships that don't have to be broken or changed by circumstance. This is the type of film that can make you laugh and cry, or at least cry a lot while laughing. I was never so emotionally invested in a movie before, in fact this film is a very romantic romance film with an undercurrent of fear and isolation that makes you wonder what could be worse than being alone and surrounded by a crowd you don't know. The acting is good and the directing is top notch. I think it was made to be viewed in as much solitude as possible and it worked beautifully. As much as I would have liked to watch it again, that's a lot of money for a movie I wouldn't watch again.   ~ G.R.R Posted by G. R.R at 10:04 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'd never seen this movie.  I was curious about a movie I saw about a group of people who travel from town to town and become really good at playing music.    At some point, they meet the main character, a very cool looking man. The movie is very cool. It's got great acting, good music (even if it is all in Japanese), and a really good plot.  It's just that at the end of the movie, the main characters end up in a hotel.  Why would a hotel be like this? What did they have in common? Oh yeah, they play music.  I thought it was a bit bizarre at first.  One character played a jazz piano and a woman played the accordion, while the man played the guitar.  The woman's character is dressed in a very revealing outfit, which I think is rather odd to say the least.  However, there's a great song in the movie which I find really cute, so I wouldn't change a thing about the movie. It was a fun movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a fun movie, and one that I found quite compelling. There are a few minor problems (mostly with the cinematography and acting) but overall this movie was interesting.   The movie is set in the year 2000, and it is a world where the aliens have already conquered (by force if necessary), and the United Kingdom and France have a civil war to decide their future. The movie takes place in the small town of New Zealand (I'm a New Zealander) where there is a young man who is a high school graduate. This high school grad is a member of the "Dance Team", a group of people who love dance, and he works hard to get to the top of the dance team. The "Discovery Team" (as they are called by their instructors) are members of a "Racial" group who are also high school graduates; they are "The Outlaws" and are the world's best dancers.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of "Lolita" is simple and sad: The daughter of a rich family is raped by a man who offers her a job in his factory. She works there for almost a year. She is a beautiful child of 14, beautiful legs, perfect body and the only one who does not ask for money. Soon she is raped again, and is sent back home to spend her last days of happiness, where she is tormented by the memory of her cruel tormentor. After being raped once again by the same man, she is sold to an evil man. This man is a very sadistic and sick man. When he comes to the house, he asks to see the family picture. He looks at the girl's back for a long time, and then asks, "Lola? What's that beautiful back there?" She asks him who that is. He then says, "You are his baby." He then brings his gun to her and, pointing it at her, he tells her that she will be his whore for the rest of her life. As she cries he tells him to "take it and shoot, you bastard", and shoots her dead. She will never see her family again. This film is about this girl who is raped and murdered by the man she loved. I think this is a really good film. I've seen lots of horror films from the 60's and 70's, but not a very good one. This was one of the films of that time. One of my favorite horror films. And a very original story. I like all the different characters and the different plot lines. The characters are believable and the action is very creative. There are some very special effects and it looks very original. "Loliita" has become my favorite film. It is so sad and disturbing and very interesting. I am very glad I got to see this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I will be honest in saying that I wasn't the biggest fan of this movie in the beginning. That may be due to me watching the movie again and again, but it wasn't until I saw the commentary track for the Criterion Collection DVD version that I finally understood why these were the very first Star Wars movies to be made. The best thing about the commentary is that, unlike most, it was done in full, unabridged, complete and unabashed (including a little video-game joke thrown in)! For once, the Star Wars fans really get to be heard, and not just in the usual "it's okay" response... this isn't a movie about Star Wars. Instead, it's a movie where we really get a feeling for the characters and the world. It's not just about the battle of good versus evil; it's about the human struggle to make the decisions that affect others in their lives. It doesn't take a genius like Lucas to figure out that the characters are people, and that people make choices for good or for ill. It just seems to happen, that the world can make a mistake or two, and yet still keep itself from total destruction. The characters have their quirks, they have their problems, they fall in love and hate and even get married and become fathers and children and mothers and fathers. There is so much heart here that this movie makes even the best of Star Wars look like an afterthought by comparison. It is a movie that is worth getting into, no matter what kind of fan of the franchise you are, or what kind you want to be.  A review by Steven L. Stuhl.   In this Star Wars film, we're left with the impression that we've seen it all before. It opens with a battle on an unknown planet with the Imperial Guard and Stormtroopers, who look and sound just like the troops from Empire Strikes Back... but they're in a different uniform. The battle is won by a rebel fighter pilot, but his aircraft is damaged... and then destroyed by the Imperial forces. He then crash-lands on a planet that looks like a desert. In a canyon, there is a group of Imperial soldiers. The leader looks just like Darth Vader from A New Hope, but with a black helmet and a red and black tunic. In the desert, two rebels are talking. One is Luke Skywalker, his cousin Leia and the other is Han Solo... who looks nothing
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight was an absolute blast.  It's a Batman movie without the dark and gritty, without any blood and no violence.  This is a good batman movie, it's got great action scenes, it has some great story moments, and it's good in general.  The movie is not perfect, the acting can be sometimes cheesy and cliche, but it's all pretty much fine.    The film will keep you going forward with this Bat-villain in a way that is hard to describe.  There is some good chemistry between Batman, Catwoman, and Penguin, the three villains have a very satisfying dynamic.  And there's still a Batman-mystery to be told in this film.  It's a good sequel.  I highly recommend watching this movie for all the classic Batman fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first and third movies of the series are pretty weak, but the second movie is actually good!  The story is about a detective in Tokyo, who is hired by the police department to solve a murder. The victim was a woman who died from a knife wound to the back. And of course, his solution is: he will ask the police to investigate the murder, if they will come to Tokyo to do the same, because this is the perfect murder! After the murder the detective gets caught by the corrupt detective who was in charge of his investigation. But his only solution is a bribe, and the corrupt guy tries to get his way, even at the cost of his life. The story follows him and his new friend, and there are also some good stories of his friends, as well. It also shows him working as a detective by himself in order to find the murderer, and he often has troubles with his own colleagues. He also needs to find out who is the murderer and why they murdered the woman...The movie is very fast paced and the action scenes are a very good touch. In addition there are some interesting situations in his investigation, and also some of his personal experiences in his relationship with his friend. And if you are looking for something really good, with plenty of action and good characters, then this is an excellent movie.  - C - C+ The following three movies are all pretty similar in that they feature a detective, who finds himself in a very big crime. In each movie the killer is more clever, the police more inept than in the first ones. And so the detective finds it more and more difficult to solve the murders. The third movie is better than the other two, but there are still some problems in the way the detective solves the murder in the last movie. - A - The following five movies are the best of the entire series. They are well adapted from the novels, and they are very interesting in the original story line. The film starts very well, and shows just the basics of the crime that the detective is on. When all the crime is done, the detective and his partner go after the murderer. And the story continues to move very well from a detective who needs his partner's help, to a detective alone trying to solve one of the major crime cases the police are currently dealing with. In the later movies the detective has more troubles with the police. But the characters he works with are very likable. The best one
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As we have said a couple of times here, The Thing from Another World  is one of those movies that people have been talking about for a long, long time.  We first saw it at an early age, sitting in the back of our family's truck, while the kids were playing a game in the driveway.    It was an early film, released in 1950, with a long production time. After the film ended I don't even know if I could tell you what it was about.  For a long time it just felt like an odd sort of horror movie.  Some of the effects were very odd and not very convincing (as in the case of the floating eyeballs that seemed to be a very old man, his skin looked too pale to be his skin.)   The movie was never successful on the big screen, it did pretty well in the smaller theaters, but never really took off.  Then in 1985 the director, David Cronenberg released The Fly, which was a better movie than the one that came out at the time.   After that people began to talk about it again.  It would probably be hard to get a distributor willing to put out a movie with such an odd production and with a film that had so many oddities in it.  This one was directed by George Nolfi and he was given the budget to make the film he wanted to make.  Nolfian was a director who was never afraid to experiment and it showed.    He did not want to repeat the failures of previous films and decided that he would only use the effects seen in other monster movies, instead of building his own.  We are not talking about a lot of effects here, the special effects are very weak, but it does provide a pretty eerie story.  As was the norm with Cronenberg films, there is a strong sexual content, and a very heavy amount of nudity and blood.  I should say that there is the odd nude scene that might not be for all audiences, but for me this was a pretty good watch.  To summarize The Thing From Another World would have to be an odd movie, but a really good one with some great special effects.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ I saw this on the opening day at our local movie theater. The movie itself is a bit slow. It starts slow and even though there are only a handful of scenes that are well acted, they are all brief and the pace is slow. After about 10-15 minutes, there are more scenes which are more interesting. There are some very nice close ups and sometimes the images and the characters look very much like what they are suppose to. There is a very interesting story and there is quite a bit of dialogue, but I am not really sure if it is explained or not. The characters are not very believable. The woman and her daughter are both very much in love and they go on about all kinds of things, mostly love. There will be a few laughs at least. You can see that they are trying to make a good film, but one that is slow is probably not a good idea. And a movie in French which has a great title is not that great a film in itself. ____________ See it for $9.99.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - It is a really bad movie! I don't know what kind of "cinematic" artistry this movie is trying to achieve, but it is never quite enough. The story is pretty straightforward. Young American teenager, Chris, is living a dream - playing guitar with a famous rock band and getting the attention of the entire world. Unfortunately, when the band travels to a remote country to play a concert, the entire country, including the young girl from the band, gets a little excited at the thought of "Rock" in the country. What follows is a very bad movie. The "rock" isn't really rock - it is a bunch of weird, uncoordinated and unmusical dancing, dancing, (which is fine for the concert), and there is no musical instrument. They all look kind of lame and are generally unenthusiastic. But the song they play, "What Does the Fox Say?", is the worst. It is awful! There is absolutely nothing catchy or interesting about it. It's just about two old guys and a woman singing "What does the Fox say?". There are very few jokes in the movie - there is one at the end (a very silly one, I think) and a very dumb movie - if you want to be entertained by "Rock Music" then this is probably the worst movie for you. And I say this as someone who has seen "Rock of Ages", "Rocky 2" and "Rock-A-Boys". The only reason I give it a two is that the ending was kind of funny, even if the first half of the movie is about as bad as you can get!  - So, basically, this movie doesn't have anything to do with Rock, but I can't stop watching it! So, if you have seen any one of the other movies I mentioned, then you should probably just move on...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The idea of a "perfect family" is almost a joke in this movie because of the very fact that the father, in the movie is really a psychopath and there's a constant struggle between him and his wife, but there's really a lot of good things in the story. This is a film that should only be seen for the characters but the directing by Jean-Francois Vallee really makes this film worth seeing as a movie. This movie is funny, it has a lot to say about the society that we live in and it will keep you reading the paper.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love sci-fi, and I love The Terminator, and in many ways, The Terminator is a little like the latter. You know, it's a movie about robots, who make their choice between human life and the promise of the machines. In this, the story is quite different: it's about a time machine: a device that would allow a man to travel to the future and bring back a human baby, who has been stolen by a man named John Connor (Lance Henriksen). He gets his chance when he meets his future wife, Sarah, played by Linda Hamilton. She is a child that has been raised in a human family, and they have agreed to help her get her future family back. But she finds herself in the past: she has been rescued by a group of soldiers, who have taken her in (she's been "rescued" from a woman named Laura), and she's taken with them to find her mother: the woman who kidnapped her. They don't find her, they never did. But they're looking for her, and now that she's gone, they decide to keep her alive. A young boy, played wonderfully by Michael Biehn, watches helplessly as his family is forced to endure the indignities of being hunted down by a bunch of murderous machines. But the movie does one better by setting up a very strong plot that goes on for quite a while and is very cleverly woven together.   The Terminator features a great cast: the late Christopher Plummer is terrific in the Terminator role, as well as the younger actors, including Anthony Edwards (the kid) and Robert Patrick (the Terminator). But I can't help thinking that the most important part of the movie is the young boy: Robert Patrick, playing "John" - the kid who's being hunted by machines, and is rescued by machines. He is a perfect, innocent, innocent boy. He grows up with a family, loves them, and has a relationship with his mother. He knows he's going to the past to bring his mother back, but he knows that this is going to be a difficult journey. It's a beautiful thing to watch the little boy growing up into the teenager that we see in The Terminator:  It's also a very emotional story about a boy who loves his mother and has an idea of what the future may be like - the future that's really not that future. You don't see that future in The
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie gives a very good ending but, I think, the movie should have ended much more happily and better. The ending will appeal the audience with this movie, it was a very happy ending. But the ending is not the true story of this movie because the story is really far from the truth.   I really appreciate it when movie can show me that all is not what it seems, that some people have to struggle and fight to survive, especially when there are no heroes but the strugglers and the struggler alone are brave, brave men and some of these people will lose their life because of an unwise war strategy.  This movies is really like a movie that never ends, just the end to the journey.

I also wanted to know what was going on in the town. I liked some of our group's conversations, but I am a big fan of the "mystery" genre, so, I felt a bit disappointed. But, this is a good start and, I am looking forward to the next chapter.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot:   Rita Ora is in the hospital, recovering from an accident which she had when she was a child.    She was playing a game that required the players to make up one word each.  It's a simple game but she thought it would be a fun activity to do with her brother and her mother.    The accident happened in their house and her husband was out.  Rita thought it was her idea to go to the movies but the mother thought she was taking a walk.  She goes to the movie with her son and tries to find out if it's worth going to the theater and getting a good seat.  Then her friend walks in and they both end up in the theater together, because of course the director didn't think they should watch it together.  But Rita is enjoying the film and the other couple is talking about it.  While Rita is getting bored, her friend turns to the camera and tells everyone that a couple like them should stay together.   So Rita is watching it with her mother and has to sit down on the couch to make room for her friend.  In the movie the couple is having a love scene and then they talk about how they can't make a marriage work.  The ending is a lot of fun and Rita just loves it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly  by Sam Peckinpah is one of the most frightening movies I have ever seen.  I have seen it twice, both times as a child, in the second grade.    For a moment in the movie, this is the movie where I realized that Sam Peck was actually a good director.  The movie is shot in long takes.  This is the first time that I saw that style.  It is a very unusual style that allows the story to breathe.  With this style, they were able to tell a great story in a very short time.  The story revolves around a family that is not being taken care of.  There is a man who owns a saloon who is a bad man.  His daughter has the talent to sing, but her singing is always ruined by being on the road with her mother.  They take her singing lessons from a piano teacher, so this man is able to keep her safe.    Then there is the uncle who has no idea who his son is.  He doesn't like him because the nephew's uncle likes him more.  So he becomes a bully on his son.  When the son comes home, the son is a complete jerk.  Then there's the father who wants to go away from his son for some reason.  In the end, he gives his son the piano lessons, but not before leaving him a message about how he didn't like his singing.  I don't think that we get the full picture of this man and what he is like.  Maybe it was a good thing that we only saw him in a single shot.  If you liked the original film, you will love this one.  As stated previously, this movie was shot on location.  Each scene is shot with a long take.  Sometimes the camera moves around, sometimes it goes back and forth, the camera is very precise.  Once in a while we get to see the actors at different angles to their characters.  Some scenes are very dramatic, some are comical, and some are just plain bizarre.  We see some really great sets, such as the saloon and the town of Chigaco. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie about a boy and a girl who go on a camping trip after a failed movie. They stop in a town (as there is very little that is nice in the country). Once there they find a strange cabin and a couple of young people living inside. The boy and girl are attacked by the strange creatures but the girl is able to use the powers of a dragon. She becomes a beautiful dragon who is very good at fighting, and she is also pretty (though not a handsome looking one). She gets some help from one of the young kids who is named after a dragon but he is really a very weak one. As he struggles to fight some of the creatures the boy becomes a real Dragon, which really helps. There is a whole other cast of characters that have a lot of fun being pretty in this film, such as the young couple, the old lady with the magic book and the dog. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** What happens when a very young girl wants a man and a young boy wants a girl who are each very excited and then it turns out that the young boy is actually older than he looks, and has been hiding his age from all the boys for the past few years. When they find out and the other boy gets a girlfriend of his own. It turns out they are very similar, a guy who has a very nice wife who thinks him a genius. They have a beautiful child, a girl named Charlotte who loves music and wants to be like her mother and a younger boy named Willy who lives next door. The movie has lots of humor and is well animated but I did wish I was more immersed and into the family as the story unfolded. The song by the main songwriter, the famous, the late Ray Parker Jr. was a nice break from the serious nature of the story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like "The Matrix" and "Fight Club" before it, this movie is all about man vs. machine. But there is something interesting about this movie. The story is simple enough: the main character is a guy who is trying to solve a problem he's had since the very beginning. He's an average guy with no particular talents, no particular gifts, but what's interesting is that he does seem to have a plan, he does know more about his situation than others think. He has some interesting ideas about life, and he's trying to realize it. He doesn't have an easy time. But this guy does seem like he knows some important things...and he does. He goes on a number of adventures, solves some problems, makes some friends. But then he meets his problem, which is a lot more complex. The movie does a good job of letting you know that what seems simple to him at first glance may seem like a far-out far-cry to others later on. The characters are all rather odd, and the way things are resolved is just bizarre. It's like a scene out of "The Terminator" or "The Day the Earth Stood Still." And you'll wonder why these weird characters are so popular among teens, and you'll be interested in what comes next.   "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" is another classic of the genre.  The movie is pretty much about how the world really works. The way things really work are things like money, power, status, and "the system." In other words: the system, the way everything works.  In the movie, the main characters are a group of four guys that are trying to break into the system. They make a plan to steal a secret weapon that is being guarded by the CIA. But they run into trouble because of their plan. They are all very close to the real world, and they all find that the system is rigged against them. The plot thickens...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A true American masterpiece that will be watched again and again."   A great movie that has a huge cult following from every aspect, it's a true classic and will stay in your mind like the "Star Wars" Empire Strikes Back. This movie is probably the best sci-fi movie of the past 20 years and probably the first true science fiction movie of a director who's worked on many other movies such as: "The Last Crusade", "The Terminator" (1984), "Independence Day" (1996), "Titanic" (1997), "Rambo: First Blood Part 2" (1990), "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (1989), "The Matrix" (1999), "IndianaJonesandtheElephant.com.com" (2002), and several others. I just watched the original "Space Jam" on Netflix (at 2 am) as I write this review so I have seen this movie a lot before I saw Space Jam. I am not the biggest "Star Trek" fan so I was shocked how many people were really into this movie. I didn't want to watch a "Star" Trek movie, especially a new one. So I'm glad I didn.t but I definitely re-watched the whole movie about a year later and it was still the best movie of 2008. I don't want too spoil anything to the people who've never seen this. It's a great movie and it has a great future. I know I'm going to be watching it again for years to come and I'm sure many people will also be watching this movie for years because of the great future they foresee. If your a Trekkie, a Trek nerd, or a Star Trek fan like I am, you will love this movie and you will think about it often.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are like me and just started in the film-making world and want to learn about it, read a good review about it from a great filmmaker about his experience.   I know it has a lot of words and I do not understand all the nuances of language (even though I speak good french) so the film is not perfect but very interesting.   to make it short. it is a true tale about a "family" that has a house in a town called "Mont St. Hilaire" where every single time you drive by, you always see them. You see your father and your mother and the children with them and you can't ignore the fact that you are alone in this house with a bunch of people.   The children (I mean not children but the adults - not that they are in any way bad) and the adults live in one room, in order to keep them in order, one of the women is always on the phone, the man works as a handyman and there are also two maids working at the house.   the woman has to clean the house, the children have their own rooms and the man is there to cook. Every morning and afternoon the three people sit at their desks talking with the children or the man or talking to the maid (the woman). And then one day, the maid gets angry and calls the women to their room, the woman comes to the door to find the woman with a gun in her hands and they argue while the man has to come and make them both calm down.   was a very good movie that I liked and I could see the characters and the way they talk very well. I am sure that people would like this movie, if you are looking for a "normal" look at this kind of family and just want to watch. I hope that the makers will make another one because I am waiting for it!   hope to see a new one soon!   the makers of this movie deserve a Nobel Prize!  :)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Grand Illusion is a perfect movie. It is a film that tells a story in a realistic manner, it is a story about a dream, it focuses on how real people are not how they seem. This movie, I think is a masterpiece, I really loved it, it makes you feel like you are with your friend, your child, or your mother, watching the Grand Illusion with her. It was just so good, I had the time of my life with this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have a good time reading about the lives of the other cast members in this movie as it is pretty much the same cast as in "The Little Prince" except the main character (Bart) is now a grown man with an older partner who is the only reason he is able to go out and take care of his family. He is a real sweetheart and the chemistry between him and Anna is fantastic. It is funny that the main female character is also the same as in the French movie "The White Princess" only she is not as pretty. I don't think it is too original or original at all but it is still funny. I also like the idea of a circus that is really similar to "The Adventures of Robin Hood" with different animals and a clown as the star. This movie is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time as it keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. The ending is just a little too fast but it does make me laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good little movie.  It is probably the shortest of my filmography but it does a good job of telling a nice little story.     It was interesting seeing how this guy, a lawyer from Chicago went to see one of the more famous lawyers of the time in New York:   Rufus T. Firefly.   He had just run into a lawyer named Ellington in Chicago after a case involving a man named George Tilton who was caught in the act of stealing a horse.  He wanted to see Firefly but he was afraid he wouldn't make it to the next day of trial.  They also got to talk about the movie they just saw,  My Fair Lady.   It was a bit much for an old lawyer to watch so he had an interesting conversation with this newbie in the room.  The guy seems a little surprised at first, like he has never seen a movie before.  One of the first things he gets wrong is a quote he says about not seeing anyone but "people on the screen".    I do like how he talks like a movie star even though he's an old man.  I'm not sure how he became this successful at his law firm and his relationship with the clients but it looks like his passion came from watching movies and playing the guitar.  After a short meeting with a woman he finds himself being chased by a dog.  You can see him grow in this movie, his eyes are no longer a blank stare but now full of fire which I like.  As you might guess he ends up losing the chase and ends up walking home... by horse. Well if it's a dog you have to shoot. The movie has a very good script and it isn't afraid to let you think about it and think about what it is trying to say.  It is very short but it was a good way to end the year for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Travis was great and a fun character in this movie. My only issue is the fact that he was constantly acting and being "overly" funny, which made it hard for me to not laugh a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw the trailer of this movie I thought that it might be a sequel to a tv show ( The X-Files ) called "The Unusual Suspects" from a TV-show called " Unusual" that was made in 1990. I wasn't too interested as I thought it was a cheesy, too many plots, and not enough mystery. I decided to watch the film thinking I would be bored after watching a 90 minutes movie. But I was surprised to find the movie quite enjoyable. The story is very good and the acting was amazing. The film also has a lot of humour, and the atmosphere was perfect.   The X series is known to be good, I thought this film would be a bit boring. I guess I was wrong as it was good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** This movie is like something you've dreamed about! It's a story about a man who believes he is an ancient god. He gets a message from the gods that he is their new messenger and that one day they want him back on earth. He does not know how to deal with it so he decides to go back on the planet. But soon he finds a girl who lives on the surface of the planet with her people. But when they are attacked by an evil alien creature, the man goes back to earth to help the people. After helping them, the old god returns but this time he has two problems, one is that the people are getting old so he needs to find a new human to help him keep his powers. This new human is named Tawny and he is a boy but even more so, he is very intelligent and he also has some special powers. When he's not busy, he likes to read. I think this movie is fantastic. It has everything a great movie needs: great story, great acting, good animation. It's about an old god coming back to the surface to help a little boy who is stuck on the alien planet. And it's just a beautiful movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Big Lebowski's" is a movie that is fun to watch and is a great example of one the best movies from the 1980s. The movie is a parody about the classic rock music of the 60s with John and Margo both playing guitar with their respective guitar solos. The songs are catchy and the movie is hilarious and extremely well done. If you like "The Blues Brothers" you will love "The BigLebowski".    the film opens with the characters drinking beer and drinking themselves into unconsciousness. "LeBowski" is about a man who has a big appetite for drinking beer. The narrator (the Big LeBowski) is a millionaire whose big appetite has been fulfilled by a new product called "The Dude". The product is a guy who smokes a cigar with a small pipe attached to his pipe and a big fat beer bottle, and his beer bottle is a little too big for his cigar so the guy uses a little water to drink the beer. He then proceeds to smoke the cigar and the Dude, who is also smoking a cigar and drinking a beer together on the couch, has a little disagreement with the Dude over a movie about his brother, the actor Jeff Bridges, being an alcoholic and living in a dumpster. While the Dude does manage to finish the movie without being a total failure, his brother Jeff Bridges is seen being an amazing drunk in the movie "The Rainmaker", which also happens to be the one and only movie directed by Joel Schumacher ("Top Gun", "Predator") at the time. During the drinking the Dude asks his brother how Jeff Bridges's life is and he replies that he lives in a place called "the Dumpster", and they just had a fight with the neighbor over the noise their dog makes. And then the Dude continues, "So Jeff Bridges lives like an alcoholic with a shit-eating grille and doesn't have a girlfriend." The Dude then proceeds with the song about Jeff Bridges being an actor that was once nominated for a Broadway Award, and the song is about his life and how he was a good actor who was just a failure in other areas, especially as a drunk. As Jeff Bridges walks out of the room with his guitar, the Dude tells Jeff Bridges to go back in and play the rest of the song, because Jeff Bridges won't ever be an actor. Jeff Bridges tells his brother about the fight between him and the neighbor and he tells the Dude that

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Shining' is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. That is not to say that it's bad--far from it, in fact. The acting is top notch as well, and the story is quite well written with some interesting twists. I really appreciated that this film had such a strong message about the dangers of mental illness and how easily people can end up with such a condition, something that is a theme throughout the film. I recommend this one a very much.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------------------- "The Man Who Knew Infinity" (1974) is a good film about a man who can see what people see, see the future, and predict its coming with great precision. This film was a hit with the general public as it was an effective science fiction thriller that was well made. I did not like the first time I watched it. I thought there were a lot of things that didn't make a lot sense, most of the story seemed to be based on a bunch of myths, and as a result, it took a long time for it to really sink in. This time I found it much easier to take in, and enjoyed the film, with much fun being had by the characters. There's a lot in this film that is very strange and wonderful. It's a funny story as well as a sci-fi adventure. The film begins with a character called Paulie (Benny Hill) who goes to investigate a problem he thinks might be an asteroid or a planet on collision course with Earth. He takes a vacation from his family to do a little investigating, and when he arrives back, he finds out that a new space ship, the "Space Avenger", is being sent to rescue him. Paulie believes that there's a war between the aliens and the humans, and while the humans are in the majority, the aliens are in control. After the Space Avenger has saved Paulie, he's told to get his clothes on because the spaceship is about to blast off. This spaceship takes Paulie to a planet where he is told he can see people and creatures who are in great control. He tries to warn the others and they turn him into a lizard so that his mind doesn't interfere with their plans. Paulies plans to alert the others don't work, and instead they're forced into playing chess. Paul and his friends are also not able to help the others because of the lizard control. Paul is told that he will be executed and he and his other friends are taken into a black hole and the ship disappears in space. Paul tries to alert everybody that there will be more rescue from a ship that has taken the same shape as the space ship that was lost. Paul does this, and gets them to tell him what is going on. There are several adventures in this movie, and they range from Paulie's attempts to help those he loves, to trying to save some humans he has come to respect. While "The Space Avenger" is the biggest
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like the movie. It's good. I liked it a lot and have watched it at least a couple of times.  It has that old school feel, it's not too cheesy but it's still good, the comedy is good too and it does well to keep you interested while a little bit of a slow burner that can feel a little underwhelming once the movie starts, a lot of people are complaining on the youtube about the acting but I thought they were all good enough, and there are a few funny gags throughout the movie, like the one where the guy is talking about the other guy, and a group of other people say "I'll tell you a joke, tell it good, you stupid dick" and the guy responds with "you've really got a funny bone" and that sort of thing.    The ending is quite interesting too, after all that, you don't really care about the guy. You have no love for him, and you don?t really want to see him get killed.   This isn?t one of the better films,  in terms of animation quality, and even in terms of plot, the plot is very weak.  The movie is a mess from beginning to end, the characters don't get any development, or even any kind of depth, the story, even if it was interesting at the beginning is a complete mess by the end,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I've stated elsewhere on the Internet, I was not an admirer of the original Indiana Jones movies, mainly because of the cheesy dialogue and the story that was given about the good doctor, and even though I loved the second series, I thought it was a bad idea that they made one more movie with his character (after the original trilogy) that did not fit the new age image of Indiana Jones and it was not as enjoyable as the first trilogy which I found to be quite enjoyable. The sequel does not live up to the first two Indiana Jones films and it does not make the first one a better movie, but it is definitely better than the second.   The movie picks up almost a year after the end of the first film and is about Dr. Jones, a small town doctor, that is hired by Colonel "Cowboy" Riley, and he and Jones are hired to investigate a plane crash. Jones is hired to the job by Dr. Henry Jones, Sr., the father of Dr. John Jones, who works as the doctor who is going to make the autopsy report on the passengers and their bodies, when the plane crashes.   a man named "Captain America" (Bruce Campbell) makes the same crash and a couple of days later he is found alive and well by the folks at a camp that the Jones family lives at, so that is the reason why Jones was hired to do the autopsy of his dad's body. Jones and Campbell are going to take the bodies of the passengers to the doctor's parents and then to a local hospital so that they can be transported to London, England.   for unknown reasons Colonel Riley hires Jones and Jones is in England and Jones and his friend, a man called "Pig" (Sidney Poitier), who is also in England, are on the search for the aircraft (the plane) because there has been a number of plane crashes and no bodies found. So the group finds the plane but are unable to get a hold of the pilot as they are not sure if he has made it back to base, but they manage to find the ship, and take it back. But as they leave the ship there is a fire and Jones falls into the flames, but Campbell saves him, and is almost killed by the flames when Jones saves his life, and also saves Campbell's life. When Jones gets out of the water, he realizes that Campbell is missing and in fear goes after the ship to find him,

When she dies, he goes out to collect the money to be paid to him by the coroner in case he can prove the shot was from the man who hit her in the heart.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------- It is an exciting and entertaining thriller, very well edited, with superb special effects and a great lead actress in the role of the assassin of a high ranking officer, who, with great courage, tries to save a man she does not love, even though in fact she loves him dearly. She is accompanied, by two other soldiers who, although they do not want to be, are very much impressed and are determined to get close to her, to see if they are really worthy companions of their beloved comrade. A wonderful cast of good old fashioned British characters is given to us, and we all laugh, cry, smile and admire as the adventure unfolds, until they lose the officer and the girl together in the end. The story moves at a great pace from one scene to the next. There is some romanticism in it, but it is not emphasized too strongly, and there are many scenes of humorous and tenderness in which we realize how strongly these characters feel for each other. The action scenes are wonderful as well, which I have never seen in a movie. I did not read the book, nor am I familiar with its author, and I have been told that he was very good. A very good movie is that, which can be enjoyed by both children and adults. Rating:  8.5/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of the Twilight movies. This one was different.   The film is based around a man who gets caught up in some bad luck. It begins with his old highschool crush, Maud (Kimberly Adams). Her father is in a hospital bed, dying, and she is going to marry him. That night, he shows up at the door, but it turns out he just wants to see her. That's all he wants to do is see her, but the girl just can't seem to get out of her bad mood. She tries everything to get him to go away: drinking, cheating, and lying to him. The girl has a good heart but is driven by her ego. She is so angry that she lets loose a bunch of thugs to steal a car, just to spite him. They do so, and get caught. Then, Merv (Michael Wincott) appears and he seems to be able to fix her mood. The good news is that Merv thinks that if Maud takes him back to high school she can be friends, which will lead her to finding someone who can keep her in her good mood.  It works, and Maud and Merv start to be friends.  But, the movie takes a turn when Maud is tricked into trying to steal another man's car, which leads to a chase.  The chase is all that is left of the good mood, and the girl is very hurt. She has a lot of resentment. She wants to get revenge, and it takes her into a new relationship with a man (played by Stephen Baskerville). It is a good turn, but I didn't really care about the movie.  As for the characters, they are okay. Most of the girls are pretty well written, and I was interested to see if Merv had any feelings for Maud. He did, but there wasn't enough of them. I would have liked to see more of that. The dialogue is not good. I don't care much about the dialogue. I am used to it now. I think it would have been better if all the guys acted like the boys in High School Musical. I liked the music, but if I could change something, I think that the song, "I Am a Girl" by Sheryl Crow would have worked much better.  I did like the idea of an all-girl school.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure if this is a good film, though I'm certainly enjoying it. I found it interesting, thought-provoking, and entertaining. While it has more action than most action films, I was never bored. It's a story that's all too easy to watch, though the ending isn't exactly a happy one. I'm really interested in what happens to this little family in the coming months, if there's an actual sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I watched Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan I was blown away.  After having seen it a handful of times I'd heard a bit about it before so I wasn't expecting a lot.   I was quite surprised by how good it was.  The acting, story and direction were all on point.  This was the best Trek movie for me and I enjoyed every moment of it.  One of my favourite moments, I must say, was a close up on the Enterprise's warp core being blown up.  It gave me chills.  I also loved the special effects, like the hologram when Khan goes down to Earth.  They looked terrific.  And I always found the music to be wonderful, like when Khan's eyes turned back to the Klingons and the music played over that.  Star Trek films often have a kind of 'Kiss-ass' feel to them.  Unfortunately, the kiss here doesn't feel quite that way.  For a film which was in full effect and full of action, I was disappointed by a couple of its more traditional moments.  In the end, I'd have liked to see another Star Trek adventure.  My favourite scene is when Spock explains to Kirk why the Klingors are more aggressive than the Romulans and then when we hear a Romulan ship is attacking the Klingon ships.  After a while I was getting tired of it though.  At the end it does kind of feel like the end of a great adventure. I guess I should have seen this earlier, especially since I liked the first one so much.  2 out of 2 stars for this one.  (The original Star Trek 2 is better)

A brilliant dancer and talented boxer, he also happens to be an excellent fighter and has one weakness, which is a fondness for the ladies. "I was born in a stable," I said to myself. "When I grew up, everything changed. My name was changed to Karloff. I worked in the circus, the cinema, the theatre; but it was only in 1926 that I made my Hollywood debut. The film I am about to show you, and which I am very proud of, is the one that broke box-office records at the time. It made me millionaires, and my life was very interesting. "Now we come to the present. "On the first of October I was playing a poker game in a London hotel with a number of famous American stars: Spencer Tracy, Jack Benny, Charles Laughton and Jack Palance. "The game was so bad, as you know, that the game ended before the first cards were played. I had a strong feeling that it wasn't going to end like this. However, the good cards won my hand. I began to think of it as a kind of game of wits. "We're about to see what we can do with a good poker player. "At one point, when I was leading the players very closely, someone came up behind me. He was a big and scary-looking man, with a huge belly. When he stood up he looked like he was ready to attack me; but the next instant his big belly fell down onto the table. I felt a slight twinge of fear, but then he smiled and pointed to the big fat belly and told me it meant I was in trouble. He said he was going to get the fat one and the weak one and then he'd eat both of them! So I began laughing! "But I'm very afraid of him," I declared. "How could he do that? He has such a terrible belly. It is like a tiger! It looks as if he would swallow me whole. I don't know whether I should laugh at him or cry. "However, he kept smiling and I continued to laugh. He pulled out his wallet and I picked up his wad of bank notes, which cost him about two thousand pounds. After that he didn't have any money left. "He said to me,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What I like about this movie is that it is about a boy who loves his father and his father loves him. Both of the parents are very sick and they live in a nursing home for most of the movie. I love this movie because it is a very sad movie. The best thing about this short is that we only see a little bit of the nursing home.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I'm a great admirer of James Bond, I'd go a great distance to be in the films, but I don't actually believe in the character at all...   The film is a lot of fun from start to finish, and I hope it will do well in the US, hopefully this could be the first of many films that could be made to appeal to an American market. I think a good Bond would be made from a more American perspective."   ...read on...   The story itself isn't great, but what can you expect from a Bond movie? The plot is about a spy called Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who is trying to steal the most rare and expensive piece of jewellery in the world, the Golden Flower. He sets out to be a good spy, not to cause any harm to innocent people or anything like that, and he is caught, the film ends with a few lines about an elephant. It's a very long and boring film, it is quite silly, and the dialogue is pretty hard to read. The action scenes in this film are fun, the special effects are good, but the action here isn't anything to write home about. It has a lot in common with the earlier film Goldfinger in the sense that there's a lot more gadgets and cool gadgets used than before, in fact a lot is borrowed from the first movie. But the action is a bit predictable. The villain is more like James Bond than Blof. There's a scene where Bond gets arrested and a character comes on and tries to tell him that he is a good person, but it is pretty obvious that they are just trying to help Bond out. And to make matters worse, there are some stupid scenes where people do some pretty silly things. The plot, as I said, is pretty bad, and it is only one of the bad films made by Eon Productions.   I really liked the movie when I first saw it, and there are lots of references to the original movie, I mean there's the flying car, the Vespa that runs on helium, the flying-ring and a lot things to be like a fan of Goldfinger. You really can't beat a good goldfinger. But I never got the feeling that this would be a great movie. I'm still not convinced that this is the greatest of the Bond movies, and to me, James Bond was never the best of the films. But for
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't know how to rate this but after seeing it i had to give it a 5 star, it was good in many ways, I liked the direction the characters were moving in, the fight scene was awesome and had a funny scene where he got his mask out and put on his hood but they still did a great job on it, I enjoyed this movie and hope they do another one. Helpful of the mask and his family are all good actors. I don't know if it was intentional but when they all got on their masks, it made me think of "Jaws" and that was a great idea. I like the ending because everyone was dead. This is a very good movie. I was not looking forward to a sequel to this but it was so good that i thought to myself "Why not?" The plot and plot twists are very good.I didn�t know how To find this movie i never thought it was that good. I loved it so much that i had a hard time going to sleep that night. If you like horror, a great monster movie and a great twist to the plot that will leave you speechless, then by all means go watch this movie. You will love it and it is a shame that they didn't do another film.There were a few things in the plot which were a bit hard to swallow but all in all there was a twist to this movie that you will find very interesting.Overall great movie, good direction and a well written script, i give this a 4 star
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main story takes place in a small town called Chilmark, where a young woman finds a way to make a fortune selling dolls to her fellow girls and selling them to men and men wanting a girl to play their doll.  She works with the only other girl on the small island called Porthos, to run a toy store together.  One day she gets a message to sell her beloved doll to the local shop owner.  The owner sees a girl in a dress selling dolls and decides to buy her.  It's the story of a girl with nothing to lose who is able to buy what she wants.  I was a bit disappointed with the ending in that the doll owner seems to disappear but it is not the end.  After all is said and done I'd like to add that it isn't a bad movie and I think it was a nice one to watch.  A bit cheesy in parts but funny in other parts. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that a lot of critics will agree with me: It's not the smartest movie, but it's one of the funniest. A group of students on a field trip to visit the White House stumble on an unusual historical artifact: an iron-casted skull of a Native American warrior, who was decapitated on the battlefields of Mexico in a battle that many believe was lost by the United States. An army medic's attempt to preserve the skull by melting it down into cast iron is foiled by a local bandit, who steals it back and returns it to the battlefield for a burial.   As a storyteller, David Gordon Green is brilliant, and in this movie he gets a lot right. The humor is based on what is at the heart of the story: the clash of the two warring cultures. The comedy is not only about the ridiculousness of the situation but the real-life problems of these characters that have to live with each other as fellow prisoners on an army ship. A good cast makes the movie seem like a story told by soldiers, not by a Hollywood scriptwriter.   (I think many of the ideas that are in the movie are still current, including how to deal with the "white man" after the war. There are some very funny, and touching, moments that I wouldn't be able to duplicate myself. But I think the movie could have benefited from a few more months in the theaters, maybe even a year, to reach a bigger audience. This movie is very close to what I was thinking it might be.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you like this movie then you should check out the original animated version that came out in 1989.   This movie is about a young couple who go on a trip to the desert to take a bath.  What happens is that this couple get into an accident when they start to get into a huge sandstorm which causes a blackout on their house so the wife gets lost in the storm.  The husband gets his wife back but has to stay at a motel so they can have sex.  They're having some good sex then the wife decides to get her revenge by turning his pants inside out.  When she tries to turn his pants around he gets a really large load on himself so they then have an awesome good time.  If it wasn't for the woman turning his underwear inside out he wouldn't have gotten so much cum on him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I did not like the first one. There's nothing in it. It's a bad movie, and even the original director is dead, but this time the plot is so awful I felt sorry for its author.  It seems this movie was never made as a film. It was made as an audio CD (that was released by a DVD distributor). But it's such an awful piece of crap!   First off, it's hard to understand the language in this movie. We have many dialogues that make you wonder why the creators of this movie felt the need to learn another language.  And the movie is full of silly dialogues. Even the opening of the movie has many of those.   Now the music was not very good. It had very bad background music which you didn't know where you were until the end.  The only other music in the movie was the famous, "Don't Make Me Laugh" song. This is the only other song the movie had. And it's also the only song the ending had.  It's really hard to believe this guy could be made to make a movie with this sort of terrible music.  A very bad movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really excited about this movie. I got the DVD a while ago and I've been wanting to watch it ever since. I loved all the actors and all the things they do in it and I thought all the way through it was a great movie. The story goes from beginning to end really quick and you will be entertained until the end.   The story tells about a young girl named Charlotte and her brother who had a long run with the police and then they find themselves on a very dangerous path that will change the whole course of their lives.  I thought the movie was so short it was almost like it was running in slow motion, the main thing that made this movie so great is it is set in a time when there was no gun fighting or gun crime and that's really when I first got into guns and it is so great to have this movie for a gun fan like me. I love a good time with a good gun battle and this movie gives it to you. This is my favorite gun movie I have seen in a long time and it was really great to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie follows a young boy who is going to be kidnapped and taken somewhere where he is sure to meet a certain person, who is much older then he. And when he gets to the place, all that happens is a short montage of all the characters' faces together. However, all those characters are only there so that the audience gets a feeling of the movie. It takes the audience to a place which makes the audience feel that things happen just to make the audience think. The movie is good because a man gets kidnapped to make him think about the things, which he does not want to think about. I am sure that this movie will bring a smile to my face. The film is very realistic for being so bad, but I would rather go to see a bad movie, than a good one like this. However it does not matter because the film is still good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want to go through the story of the film in a short time (it only takes a few minutes), you can do so in a few clicks. It has some nice cinematography, and the actors do a very fine job with the material they have been given. It is a very interesting story: a young man who finds himself in a dark underworld that is filled with all kinds of monsters and creatures. The film is a pretty fast pace, and it has a very strong atmosphere. Some monsters have some very interesting characteristics: some are really scary, some are very charming and others can even be likable: in this movie there are quite a few characters in a rather small world, that can't be defined by their physical qualities, yet they all have something interesting about them: they are all different types of people, they all do some different things, but they all seem to be very independent, with their own values, which is quite unusual in this kind of movie. If you like monster movies, this is definitely one you should have in your collection.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good little indie horror with one of the most intriguing plots in a while. The movie is about a couple of friends who have been on a honeymoon and decide to stay with the woman's parents when the father passes away. They soon become obsessed with a strange family that lives nearby.  They stay until the mother has a heart attack and dies. They return home and find themselves caught up in the same paranormal events and their lives are in danger. This is a very cool movie and a bit creepy at times.  The film is pretty good and has a very enjoyable story that is full of suspense and mystery. It is also very funny and it is well cast and directed. I thought it was well done and I loved all the characters in the film.  I enjoyed it a lot and I recommend watching it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ I like a good action movie and this is my second choice for the best action movie of the year - if not, then second in a row. I liked a lot of this movie, and its good action scenes were really good. The only reason I was not a bit more thrilled with this movie was that I expected an even better action movie after Mad Max: Fury Road, and this movie fails miserably in many areas. It is still a really good action scene, but the acting is a bit bad at the beginning of the film, especially the one who is the lead: Tom Hardy. That doesn't mean he gets any better, though, as the movie is just one long fight between this good guy and this bad guy. It was actually kind of sad to watch that part. I also think that there is some sort of "shocking" ending at the end. If you have not seen Mad Max, I really suggest you to watch it. It will bring back some good memories. If not, well, then again, it was good enough to be a good start to the year! See more ▼ See less ▲  Pitch Perfect 2 Rated:... Starring:... Filmed at... Production... Written by:... Written By:...

Michael Bay is a very prolific filmmaker, as he has produced over a dozen successful films in over a decade of his career. However his filmography is much more varied than it's popular reputation would suggest. His first three films: Armageddon (1998), The Rock (2002), and Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2007) are regarded by many as his signature films, and as the filmography shows, he has had a strong affinity for bringing together a very diverse group of characters, in all genres. However, Bay's most significant film project to date, is undoubtedly Transformers: Age of Extinction (2015). Bay's follow-up film to the previous film, was a sequel/remake of the 1986 film, Transformers: The Movie. The film sees the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A small town in North Idaho was hit hard with the economic downturn. To offset this, the town's mayor turned to a local school for help in raising some money, with only one wish in mind: to get his daughter the prom date she always dreamed of. That is the whole story about this movie, not only about the prom but the whole plot has nothing to do with the prom, it was an unrelated movie with no plot or anything whatsoever to do other than to show the town leaders doing everything in their power to get the girl they want in their prom. The best part of the movie was seeing our main character, Jeff, get the best night out of his life with the beautiful girls, a part of his dream come true. "

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't have too much to say about the movie except for a few general facts I've learned from reading the reviews. It takes place in the mid 19th Century in England. I don't recall seeing a black man in that period other than Sir Walter Scott's "The Man Who Was Thursday", a film I was unfamiliar with when I heard of this, and found it was a good film. This is a little more than that. A very good action movie, with a wonderful soundtrack. It's a bit different than most films of that kind. A good movie if you want to relax.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As much as I loved this movie, it could have been better had there been a longer running time.  Some of the later scenes felt a bit rushed and the final act just didn't seem to add much to the story.  The story was great in its own right but the characters were poorly developed and the ending left a lot to be desired.  Overall, this movie is great in all the right ways.  But as a "big budget action flick" I wouldn't call it a masterpiece and don't feel it deserves a nomination.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went to this movie a while ago and I'm glad I went. Not a movie for kids, not for grown-ups, and definitely not a comedy. It took me a little while to adjust to the "normal" world and the different characters. I did get a little lost, but once I did, I was hooked. It's a very good movie with a lot of heart. Great soundtrack, well-done acting and a lot funny moments. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time and it's definitely the best sci-fi film I've ever seen.

But I got used to it, and the movie turned out to be a good film.   I think the movie would have been a success without its script and editing. But it has to be seen that all the actors are good and the director deserves a lot of credit for this film. It is a good and well-written movie.

However, she has her own personality traits in her attitude and is a strong person in the film. She is able to be able to help people in an unhealthy place and is able and determined to overcome the barriers.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other day I was driving on the way to a meeting. I pulled over to do my homework about a little boy named Denny and his friend Joey, who happens to be a girl. I had a problem with both of them, Joey had no heart and Denny had an ugly nose. Joey and his friends did tricks on Denny, and then Denny threw them into the river. The boys were found a little while after, but Denny was gone and Joey and Joey's friends never found out why. My story for the evening was an old movie that I saw many times but I had never listened to it because I was too young to understand it. I got on the plane and took the trip home. This is a very funny movie that is very well done. I hope everyone enjoys it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the movies  which i consider   one of the best movies    is        The Godfather Part II. One of the biggest movie's of the 80's, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Al Pacino and Marlon Brando as the two mafia dons of New York, The Godfather is a masterpiece.   It is a sequel to the 1967 classic The God fearing Father. The movie is an absolute classic and one of those movies that i have watched more than i have liked it. It is an interesting story about the rise and fall of a god fearing Italian family from their small town.      It is about the struggles of a father who struggles to raise his son, a young man who wants to become a powerful mafia Don, a man who refuses to be a Don and a son who cannot make his mother happy.   The Godfearing Father does not just a sequel of The God of Siam.  The story is an amalgamation of two other famous films in my opinion:  The God with a Gun and  The Last Temptation of Christ. The God Father is an adaptation of the first film: a story of a man of the town who tries to be something he is not, a father and a man with a big heart and a strong desire to make his son a great man like his father, a son and his mother.  This is not a movie for the faint of heart.  I would not recommend this movie to the newbies who like action or are looking to watch a classic with an iconic character.  It was very difficult for me to enjoy this movie the first time i watched it.  One thing that i loved about this movie is that all the characters have to be real, that is their lives.   I loved this movie very much. I think it is one of  the best  movies  i have ever seen and i recommend it to you. You do not have to watch it in chronological order.  When you are done with this movie, go and watch       The God from Down Under and you will realize why you love this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not a good comedy at all. If there is one thing that could be called bad in this movie there is the fact that it is a horror movie, but this is the only horror I can think of from the past several decades. It really feels like the movie is going in the direction that the original film went. A lot of the special effects are pretty good, if that's something you liked from the first movie then this movie might be a good one for you. If you are not interested in watching one of the best horror films ever produced then go out and get something else.  I will have to see the sequel, that would be a really good idea, to add a bit more of comedy to this movie.

The cast is all very likable, but I wish they were able to get a little better at acting. I don't think they had a whole lot to work with here. Some of the humor is pretty funny, but most of it is pretty dumb and cliché-y. I'll never watch the movie again, but the movie is worth a look.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â One of my favorite comedies of all time!  There are some terrific characters and one of the most memorable cameos you will ever see in a movie.  The movie is good, but it is not funny.  It's a nice flick, but no "out-of-this-world" humor.  If only it had something to do with a cat... I love all the scenes with all of the cast, especially Tom Hanks as the hero, Jerry Stahl as his friend, Bobcat Goldthwait as the bad guy, and of course Jim Carrey.  My only critique is a small one, which is, why was the movie so successful when it came out?  Sure, it had the "out of this world" humor, but that's not everything.   The film had great acting, which really didn't work that well, and the special effects were pretty good, just not "out there".  If it had gotten made longer, I'm not sure it would have had the same charm it has now.  But it is the kind of movie you have to see to believe.  So go check it out and enjoy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a long-time fan of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, I can't say I've ever been as excited about a Star Wars movie.  The script was fantastic (in fact, it was the best prequel script I've seen.   It had a "real" feel to it that reminded me of the movies in the original trilogy that I loved so much) and the casting was great.    The costumes were stunning and I was really into the character moments as well as watching Luke and Lando fight with their lightsabers.  And the special effects really brought out the magic.  I thought the final showdown between Han and Yoda at the end was pretty cool.  If you like Star Wars, then this is a must see.  So many great characters, all with their own motives and flaws, but they still make you feel for them even if you don't understand them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie from the beginning to the end. We have a great plot and a great script, although it took me a while to get into this story. The story is about a group of people who try to make peace with a group who don't want peace. But even with that, the story is interesting, and it makes good use of action. It seems that the plot is so good that we don't see the consequences of how they get their way. The movie starts by showing how the group are forced to go back to the world of the tribes, when their original homeland is under attack. I like it when there's a big story before they fight. There's lots of action, some of it good, some less. It is a nice introduction for the characters and a good beginning to a good trilogy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My son was a "Dunkirk" baby (I didn't like that movie), and when he was 3 we went to a midnight showing of a re-made "Amerika", based on Thomas Wolfe's novel. It was a little scary, although it didn't seem real. At least it wasn't as real as the movie "Hercules" by Paul Greengrass. I remember seeing a few things from it when I was a teenager, and in all honesty, I wish the two movies hadn't been so damn similar. We watched one a year apart, and as young men, we didn't get along. Our families lived next to each other for decades. But the thing was, I would see the "Homer" show on the Sunday after the "A" show, and I would go to my father's afterschool job and watch it. That was my "A"-show. I would be the biggest Homer fan ever, and my father was a big Homer fan too. He loved that thing about the hero of "Herr Strindberg". He would look at me like I was crazy the whole time he was sitting through the "Strindberg" movie, and he'd never be able to understand a word I said. I don't know how old I was when I finally gave up on all that and started watching the Homer show with my father.

I wish they had more time to develop this, because for some reason, it wasn't as creepy as I was hoping it would be.  This is my favorite movie of the year, and I would watch it again.

The whole movie is a great story, and it's really something to see people of such a different time and place in an actual movie. I can't believe that I never watched a Japanese horror movie before. It was only when a friend of mine told me she was having trouble seeing the end of this movie, and I told her "that would be so scary." That's how scary this movie is! The end has been written in such a way so that it doesn't have to come back, because of the amount of things it has to reveal. I'm sure I'll have to see it again to understand what's going on, but at least I got to experience it once!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film was excellent but as a science fiction film it didn't really grab me as much as a typical sci fi film would. It was more a mystery film, something that had a decent mystery and was rather good at it. The story was interesting, but the plot itself was rather thin. The performances were very good. I loved the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An exciting science-fiction story, about a mysterious entity that attacks people and causes havoc and a man and his pet monkey who get captured in the middle of a fight.  The characters all have their own unique personalities and traits to fit the situation the group is in, and most of them are well drawn.  This movie had many different action scenes, and the movie has some great shots.  As for the plot, it's a well built story and the plot points are all tied together.   If I were to rate this a 10, it would have to be a 9 because the movie is not perfect (it's a little short, and there is more back story than you'd like to see), and the film lacks depth in some parts.  But it still has many good moments, and a great ending.  A good addition to the collection of science-fantasy movies on the market. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just when you thought it wasn't possible, you will go to the movies like you've never seen before with this amazing movie: It's a true story in real life which I just discovered. I love a good thriller but this is even better. I have never seen a movie where such a beautiful girl is involved, and I'm sure we are going to have a beautiful love story here. The script is beautiful, it's so good. This was a beautiful movie and I'll be watching it again.

I think there is no other thing to say about this movie other than a must see in any movie lover. The plot is good, the voice acting is really nice. There is also the action sequences, which are well done and also great to watch. So, if you like a good romp and some fun to relax then this movie will be a wonderful movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We're treated to a movie so simple that its greatness seems so obvious. For me, however, its importance has not gone unnoticed.  The film opens with a shot of the sun rising over a blue, sunny landscape, a scene that's a stark contrast to the bleak landscape of the film that's just about to start.  It's this contrast that makes the film so very special.  What is the difference between the sun setting over a landscape that feels like the worst of both worlds and a film set somewhere that feels so, so lovely?  And what makes the latter so special?  This is the most beautiful film I've ever seen.  The beauty of the setting is only heightened by a set of characters that are so much more than just a means to an end.  For the entire film, we have a film that takes it's time to build up its characters, their relationships and everything around them. The film feels like it's just being made up as we go along, but there's something so wonderful about that.  In particular, the acting is superb.    I had to pause the film and go, "HOLY SHIT."     I was taken aback by the intensity of the scene as the girls (who have been locked in a cave all their lives for fear of being killed) find themselves on their way out the next day, to a place that seems as if it's a beautiful landscape but is in fact a hell of a depressing place in the cold and dark.    But the contrast between their bright and cheerful surroundings and their gloomy surroundings is so wonderfully subtle.  They're living in a world that is clearly not their own, but yet they're so happy.  At least when they're having fun.  I think this is a film with a message about freedom, love and happiness. And the ending was so perfect that I just felt a little tear come down my cheek, then a tear come back up again.  A beautiful ending to a wonderful film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first movie I've seen that I did not hate the heck out of the first 15 minutes. I just do not like many of the things they do. If they just kept it simple, simple and cheap, that would be the end of it. But no... They went way overboard on this silly and expensive project. It has a good script, a good story, a real good director, a story that will keep your interest, the music is decent, and it has a really good cast. What more could you want in a movie that will just keep you guessing for quite some time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a nice time watching this movie. I was interested to know more about the life of this person. Also, it is very interesting. I had heard the rumor that it took place in a little town and it did not do it justice. Although the town of the story is not named and it may be some little village, and the main character has a lot of friends and it is the people like these that makes up the town. The movie is very easy to watch and it would be fun to read some of the history of the town and the people who live there. This movie is great because it tells what it says and the story and I think that it has the best movie out there for children.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at the cinema recently and I have to say, this is a very good movie, there's no shortage of action scenes, although they're fairly standard in their kind, the storyline goes nicely and a well written script. It's a very interesting character and I really liked it, I've never seen such an original storyline. My only complaint is, the sound was a bit thin and the ending is somewhat cheesy, but otherwise it's a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I am no longer sure we are humans, but animals, or perhaps something in between."   We meet the "big bad" of this movie, played by Brad Pitt, a man who would be considered a bad actor if he didn't have a career behind him.   He's really a good actor, but his bad-guy role is his only real role.  Pitt has one of the best bad-guys in the history of cinema.  After the police department loses him his license due to drunk driving a police officer finds him dead in his apartment. He had overdosed on heroin, it was a perfect ending.  The police are called into investigate the death and are led to a hotel room which is owned by the same man who killed Pitt.  It's like the movie is playing around with its premise and not getting its own story in place.  I did like Pitt's performance and he had some really good laughs during the movie, however, his character is not that great.  His character was a great idea on paper, but didn't work for me.  One thing I will say is that the film is pretty much a police procedural.  However, the only person who got any real character development was one of Pitt's fellow detectives.  This is a really small cast and is made up of three police detectives, three cops, and the motel owner. The police and the cops only really interacted with one other person, and that was the owner of the motel.  If you want to get a bit more out of the movie than what the movie does give you, then you should watch it with a friend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** **I'm giving this an eight, since I thought the picture quality was better than I thought it could have been. I liked it. The action is fast and the characters are well designed. I was very surprised by the fact that some of the characters were so young and attractive, even when in a war. This movie is great, for me. It has a great story. I think that the cast is terrific, especially Mr. Travolta, who plays Dr. Strangelove. His name should be on everybody's wish list. If you like War Movies, you're going to love this. If War Movies are your thing, you'll love this too. So if you haven't seen this movie, get it now, you won't be disappointed. This will be one you'll never forget. ***** I'm rating this a seven because of what is known as the "The War Machine" ending. This is a rare instance where the movie actually ends on a high note. I haven't really liked so much what I've seen. The acting of both Mr. and Mrs. Tamborelli is solid and the music is very good. I guess this is a movie for people like me who have been waiting to see something great.
Write a positive review about a good movie: *************************** I'm happy with this movie. The story is good, though there are no real twists. It has some nice set ups that make it a good action movie. I am not sure how well the acting is done, though I like the actor who plays the detective. I also like how this movie is a western and a crime story. If you've never seen any of those before, this may be for you. ****************************** This film is also available in the audio/visual section of the site.

This is a good story and I'll certainly continue watching "Venge." You might also be interested in...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts of with a nice action scene. But the movie's a slow build.  Then the movie starts to get interesting.   First, the movie has a cool soundtrack.  In fact, it has two cool songs.  This is one of the reasons why you should check out this movie.  And the song was a very good song.  So this is very well done.   We also get some good comic relief.    First we have a nice black cat.  It is a very interesting character.  He has a very dark past with a lot of sadness.  But he still has a good sense of humor.  The cat has no fear.  Of what?  Of his wife and of his past.  This shows a nice contrast to the first half of the movie.  We then get to a very cool scene.  A very cool sequence where we see the main character in an airplane. This part of the film is very cool.  We see a lot and see a good sequence of the action.  After this we see a different sort of guy in a very nice looking car.     We then meet a very special couple.  Their name is Joe and Eve.  They are married.  Joe is a guy who is in the military. Eve is a retired waitress. They have a home and a couple of children.  Here is a couple that is very relatable.  You want their kids to have an excellent education.  Eve wants her children to be well respected.  Both Joe and his wife have good ideas for the future.   They also have some fun, and Joe tells a funny story.   After this, the film ends with a very fast paced action scene in a small plane.  What happens next is very interesting. And very funny. It is very strange that this has not been done before.        I was shocked that the main cast did not even make it into the movie and that it took this long to put it together.  I am not going to watch this movie again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a huge fan of the film, and have followed its creation and development from the initial pitch of this short to when it was shown at Sundance. I enjoyed this film so much I bought it a second time from the Criterion Collection for $150. I know the story of the movie better than I do its director/writer. But I was very pleased with the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this one. It takes a very interesting theme, namely that of how much a man is willing to give up to live a normal life in a world full of danger and tragedy, and it takes it to great and hilarious heights. It also follows the arc of the main protagonist, a man who finds a way to bring his lover back to him in the face of a very grim future. This movie is absolutely incredible.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight is an excellent story with superb acting and great pacing.  It does take a while to set up and the film is often paced too slow for my taste.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the more original, yet still very entertaining, action thrillers that we've seen from the "G" cast (Granada has a very strong first season!) in some time.  I wasn't surprised to see that there was a "Wizard" on-screen. There's still a lot of fun to be had in this movie. It is definitely worthy of an "A" grade.   WATCH: THE LEGEND OF THE SHEEP - BluRay, DVD & Digital HD   "Granama" was an action/thriller film set in the middle of a desert in the Southwestern United States in the year 1984. It featured a young girl called Elisabeth (Elyse Willems), a child prodigy, who's found by her father, a renowned archaeologist named Arthur Willems. The family is well known to the surrounding townsmen, yet Elyse does not have the social skills and intelligence to match her dad's fame. It's not until Arthur's son Daniel Willems (played by William Baldwin) is taken captive by a gang of bandits that the public's eye is drawn to the Willems family, and the ensuing investigation reveals the shocking truth that Elyse is not her father's only daughter, but there are many more people like her. Will this child prodigal daughter, who is never far from the family's side, ever be able to live a normal life? Or will the family be ruined by the corruption of her father?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie, a very enjoyable one for me. There are only three people in the world who are capable to do anything in their life they do it with a smile. Two men who love animals, they try to stop an animal from a horrible act they see a wild dog killing a young girl. The man tries to stop him but when it was to late he had to do it. I loved this movie and I loved the two characters that are playing the roles of the animals. They did a good job because this movie is entertaining but I have to give it some points for how different it is from the actual movie it is supposed to be.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw the title of this movie, a documentary on AIDS and the gay community, and found it very compelling.   The film is quite short, so much so that even an audience that is watching it with a big screen will only get about a 2-minute preview.  The film is about three gay men who live in San Francisco, working as waiters for a fine restaurant.  In this restaurant, the waiters are very well off, with good cars and a nice apartment.  One day they hear that a famous actor is coming to the restaurant to get some information on a film script he has written.  The waiter who is in charge of delivering the order and the waiter who will deliver the food are both gay; the waitresses are pretty, and so are the managers.  At first, they are uncomfortable and are unsure as to whether or not to say anything.  But then the restaurant's owner, a famous movie producer, comes down and asks to see the film.  When the film producer is done, he leaves the restaurant with a very nice gift.  While they are at the movie, the movie producer asks one of the wait staff about a script, and when he is given the script, he is impressed.  He asks if anyone knows a writer who could write a film about gay culture.  Sure enough, there is a very attractive young man (who looks very much like Sean Penn) who has just come out.  His name is Joe, and he writes his own film every time he is in the bath.  After he takes off his clothes, he does a little monologue, and then he takes his clothes off.  Joe's main purpose is to show that gay people are the same as any other people.  It is his love for his own people, that makes him gay.  This gay message is very powerful and has much in common with the work of the late Stanley Kubrick, particularly the theme of self.  So, after watching this film and learning about Joe, we see how a young waiter (a character named Jerry) has taken a very different way of life.  Jerry wants to be a playboy, and is very much into his gay lifestyle.  We see Jerry go on a trip to Hawaii, where he has a very beautiful, young, female lover (she looks a lot like Jennifer Aniston).  Jerry has a beautiful house in the hills, with tennis courts and swimming pools,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What did I love most about this movie?   It was my first time seeing a film made solely by Japanese.   All the actors, singers, etc.  are of Japanese descent!   One of my favorite lines?  "I'm not Japanese. I'm American!"   Who was your favorite cast member?  Well, in the end we find out that the young actor's real name is not Bruce D'Amato, as he thought.  For some reason, his real name was not even Bruce and his name was supposed to be Mr. D'amato.  I would love to know why he's pretending to be Japanese...  Anyway, it was still a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I think this is the best film of the year. It is a very interesting and thought provoking film about a man who suffers from delusions of grandeur, who finds the courage to admit it to the world who is watching and he makes the film very much entertaining. The film is very well acted by a bunch of very talented actors. The music is perfect, and the characters are quite human. It doesn't come across as pretentious or heavy handed. It makes you wonder what he has seen and how did he see it? The plot is a fascinating and thought out film that takes us on a journey into the darkest parts of human nature. It also makes you ask some really disturbing questions about the effects that delusions have on the mind, and those effects can last very long. I can understand why this might sound a little strange to those who are more used to action films. But this is a film that will be enjoyed by everyone, and I think it does an excellent job of it's premise and execution. I recommend it to everyone and hope that it will be released at some point in the future.  Review by Chris H. - 9/4/08
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is an adaptation of the Japanese video game "Garo" (known as "Kaze no Bouken" in Japan) in which the story takes place in the 20th century.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first movie of the series is great with a decent start. After that, the series begins with a different story than expected with a twist. A girl who was in love with a boy from another village comes into the town from far away. She wants to find her missing friend (The boy's name is Tomoe) and they have a very friendly relationship. She is called Yuma as a child and Tomoe by his father. She runs away from her mother for a year and lives in Tomoe's village. There, she meets a boy named Tomoe and falls in love. She takes Yuma to a local bar but then suddenly, the boys disappear in a magic show with the magic sword. Tomoe disappears and it becomes a mystery.  The last part of the movie is a bit slow but it's not the worst in the series, so I gave it three star.

Jigsaw is a monster, we have no idea how the brain of this guy could be so large, that it would take the shape of a human. So we watch him cutting the head off of a young boy. All we see is the blood and brains of the kid running through the streets, we don�t know what is happening. Well the movie is a good one, a little long. It's a lot more than I expected, but it was okay. I didn�t enjoy the ending too much, I would watch it again to see how he gets the head of the little boy back on the same day. It was well made and the special effects were really cool.

But the ending was just annoying for me, as I know it was going to be a good ending all around. I'm sad the movie got canceled, but it was a pretty good movie. It had lots of action scenes, tons of car chases and tons of good looking people.  I liked it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is the first thing to strike a chord with my inner cynic, I find this film as enjoyable as any I have seen, but I would give it higher marks if it weren't for this problem: it's a satire of the Vietnam War.  I think that's the obvious problem and it's one that I could have done without - and probably could not have, seeing as how it's only made to entertain, not inform, but it's not without impact.  "I'm a journalist now, and I'm tired." - Robert Altman.   It would be nice to see this make the same impact as it did in 1972, when it was first released.  It has a lot of good material including a superb performance by Roger Moore, that of an old soldier being forced to face the terrible reality of what's happening to him and to his young daughter.  The writing has a bit of an edge and you get to see quite how the war is affecting everyone, and the way it's being fought.  I think it's probably an underrated film, and for that alone I'd recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a very strong story, a very well thought out story, and a very satisfying and emotional movie.   The movie opens on a dark rainy night and we see a small town, and it is a cold and depressing town. It's quite quiet at night, there are no cars on the road, but there is also no one to be seen. No one is going out either, and only a few lights are on in the house and a small cemetery at the corner. We see some people sitting around in the small café. A young boy (Tom Hanks) is sitting next to an old lady (Jane Fonda) and a young girl. They have a little talk about something. When he looks at her he sees something about her, he doesn't know what it is, but it scares him, and he goes away. We also see another woman, Jane Fonda, sitting at the table with a guy and a kid. The guy is her son. This leads us into a very small town. We do find some other little characters like a waitress (Jodie Foster) a girl who is a reporter (Jessica Lange) a black woman (Maggie Smith), a young guy (Matthew McConaughey) and some other old people who can't be seen because of the darkness.   the movie is very suspenseful and we really felt for Tom Hanks and Jane Fondabot, and for the characters they meet. The movie isn't a great story or an amazing character study but it is more than enjoyable, I don't know why this movie is so overlooked, I think most people just feel this is a bit of a cliche, yet I actually felt I learned something from this movie. There are also a few interesting bits about small towns and the life they lead.  The music is good, I really like the music in this movie, and the voice work is also very good. There is also some really good acting in the movie. Tom Hanes is a great addition to the cast and he really pulls off the role of a man who is stuck in the past.  , 8/10
Write a positive review about a good movie: ป้ามเด็นหมา ซึ่งสั่ไห่ (The Night Watchman)  by: themunchins  I watched this yesterday afternoon, and for the first few minutes i was worried, as i've heard good things about it. It took a while to get into the groove of things, and the script really does drag at times but the performances are so strong and the direction (including the direction for a movie of this length) was superb. It's also a very moving film, so if you like stories with a good twist, and are a fan of the genre, then this movie is a must see. Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is a great movie, but it is also a movie about a bad movie made by Jeff Bridges.  I really wish he'd gone back to his high school days and gone with someone like John Waters or a good Woody Allen, like the good movies were supposed to be.   The best actors in the world try hard here, it seems, but a lot of the material just doesn't work for me.  But I really think, as many others have said, that the whole movie is a meta story about a bunch of people who are trying to be good actors.  I can see why they'd want to be so:  it's not easy, and people go crazy trying to do it.  The film is set in Denver, Colorado, at a party, and the main character Lebowitz is supposed to do a show.  It's supposed to take place at a restaurant, but this is just some bullshit.  And the whole film has a sort of nihilistic mood.  There's a bunch  of people, and they do what they do, but there's nobody there to see them, and nobody who knows who they are either.  This is the sort of movie that I would go out and see if I was in a serious mood. I've got my tickets, though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie, the director clearly wanted to tell a story of love, passion and sacrifice. But instead, this is a movie that has a plot, but no story. The movie lacks substance and tries to pass itself off as a romance movie. The plot does get interesting near the beginning, but unfortunately that is about it. What makes this film worthwhile is that this is not a romantic movie. And for once, the directors decided that the movie should be more than a romantic comedy. It's a story about loss and how one family deals with the loss of a loved one. As a result, there are several surprises throughout the story. I do have a small complaint about this movie, and that is that it is not really funny. It is kind of a dry and boring movie and the story is kind sad. It can get a tad cliché, but I just found that to be a part of a romantic genre movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I never really understood The Twilight Zone until I saw the movie. It seemed too strange for me. It had a great, strange, and mysterious setting, but for the most part it was too odd. After all, what are the aliens but two people trying to get together? And so on and so forth. It was not a very good movie, and I wish I could have gotten another copy to watch in the dark.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't get into horror movies much (I don a lot, but I've seen pretty much all of them), but this one was soooo good. If only they had brought along some more of the old cast and they wouldn't have had to use so many new ones.  This has an epic scope and scares you at every turn.    My favorite, I loved it soooo much that I've watched it on TV a couple times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is an interesting concept, but it did not work all the way through. The first ten minutes are the only time the movie shows anything really worth about it. The movie was originally going to be a western, but they changed the location of the film. The actors (John Wayne, Richard Widmark, David Niven) are doing a pretty good job in playing the part of outlaws and cowboys. The only fault of the movie is that it never really shows how far the characters had gone. It has just been a series of adventures that had all been thwarted before. The main characters are never seen really enjoying what they are doing. So, there is no real excitement. The film's real strength is its good cinematography.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not like this movie is a bad film; it's not a great movie, but it's a decent film.   For a film from 1995, it has some really weird plot points; it would be a really great film if all those weird plot twists didn't happen.  When I think of "Pillow Talk", it's hard to come up with a decent story, it could be a great film, but there is nothing remarkable about it.  For all the oddity and comedy, it's really just a strange "family film" that does a great job at giving the impression that you are going to watch a silly movie.  What did you think of it?   Did you like the film? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "My dad didn't have a good life. He came from a poor farm in Ohio, where he was born on May 19, 1930, into a family that, because of his low caste and ethnic background, could not take him very far at all. His mother's only child, my dad was born in what is now called the "Romeo and Juliet State," which is still a poor and rural area of the state today.   My dad's life changed when he married in his early 20's to Mary Bowerman, the daughter of a local doctor. Mary was a beautiful woman who was, as the story would later reveal, "a little too sweet" in the eyes of her husband, a poor farmer. In the late 1940s, when my father was in his 30s, he joined the army and went to Korea to work on a military base in the Korean War. There he met a man he would never forget; a man whose life he had helped to change.   of course this is a story not about my father's experiences, but rather about that man's life.  's love story began with a kiss on the cheek. My father was the only man in Korea that he ever wanted to kiss (he'd even made a movie about it, which is an epic movie) and the man he fell in love with was Lieutenant James Doolittle. After Doolitle's plane was shot down by the Chinese, he was captured by the Americans and, with the help of his buddies, he had to make his escape. I mean, it's a miracle there weren't any more planes shot down before he got there! He then spent the next 20 years in the penitentiary, where, through his writing and his efforts to save lives of those he loved and cared about, he gained his freedom in 1965. He spent the rest of his life in the North Carolina mountains, surrounded by friends and the people he had fought so hard for.  -M.O.  , from the IMDB description: (1954) A Hollywood screenwriter is sent to Korea in the last year of the war, a country so desperate for a break, it would give anyone the benefit of the doubt. As a result of his writing, American and South Korean soldiers are able to negotiate a truce. As if the fact that he had never been to Korea was not already an obstacle enough to his life, he discovers that his first love
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I did not know I was going to enjoy "The Room" or any of the related films very much. The opening sequence had you wondering: What's going on here? What do you know about the "Room" and what does it have to do with me? Well, you soon find out that you really don't know much about "Room," and "Room"-related films are not the sort to be found on television: They're long and often tedious and boring to watch. They are "entertainment," and not particularly good. If the film was actually about something interesting, it would be interesting. It's nothing more. In fact, it's just a pile of "boorishness" that I'm not sure has ever been tried on-camera. And it does have its moments. But a "boaster" can be found here and there, and at points it's pretty good. It has its moments of good humour. And "Room-related films" are often not all that much fun. There's something in their style that is at once comical and annoying, and if I wanted to watch a film about a bad-tempered woman with a secret life I would probably watch "A Room With A View" or some such. I didn't really think "The Other Room" was "booru-able" for a long time. And I still didn't, until the last minute, when I remembered that if you were going to have a "Room film", this was the one you needed. Posted by James Tiptree Jr. at 10:12 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A solid, action-packed film from director Michael Mann. Based on a novel by the same name, "Con Air" shows the lives and adventures of an elite US Air Force unit that parachutes into France with the intention of hunting down and eliminating a terrorist cell. It is up to the men of the 1st Pursuit Squadron (PPS1) to stop two French resistance members who are posing as a British Army officer, Major Harry "Hobie" Hobbins and his American pilot, Lt. Colonel Dick Martin (Michael Mann). Hobbens has a bad habit of dropping his men off at points where they're most likely to get ambushed and killed. They will be out of their depth as they attempt to locate Hobb-ins and the real terrorists while dodging gunfire and grenades. Mann brings the action with his trademark style of filmmaking as the soldiers make their way through the streets, buildings, and fields of French villages. The action is often shot on location in England, France, and Belgium. As it is, there are a lot of long shots, close-ups and long takes that leave a lot to be desired for most of the film's run time. Mann doesn't need to add too many more action scenes but it can certainly be argued that the action doesn't take enough of a back seat to the more important story telling. The film is an interesting watch for action fans as there are quite a few set-pieces that make for very good entertainment for those fans.   Mann's ability to show a group of military men struggling against the elements and an enemy that is just waiting to strike comes through in every single shot. There are a few moments that are so intense and intense that they'll leave you on the edge of your seat. The acting is strong and even the smaller parts are well directed. This may be the best Michael Mann directed film and certainly a good film to add to your collection. The Bottom Line: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Brief but sweet:   This is a very good movie and a nice family outing.    In one scene, when it seemed that the whole family was out to lunch, Garrett (John Hawkes) is eating lunch with his dad.  Garrett's dad asks him why he is wearing that outfit.  Then there are brief scenes of Jodie (Roxanne Douglas) trying to find a husband.  After her aunt comes by to take a look at her and Garrett, she's very interested and wants to get a glimpse of her.  I think the movie could have been longer, but the little bits of humor help.  In the end, I believe this is a nice one-night only movie for the entire family.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* It's the year of the "Great Awakening" in America. The Second Great Awakening is on its way! As I sat in the audience of the play "To the End of the Story", a man who was the head of the New England chapter of the NAACP came to speak to us. I remember his words very clearly. "I am going to tell you a story which is as good as it gets. A story which will stir the soul of our nation again. An adventure story of good versus evil...and the triumph of light." He had a good time, but did not leave. I am glad that he did. "To The End of The Story" is, in a way, the true story of what happened to America during the Depression. I have heard of many stories like this. There is an American classic. There are books to follow. "The Great Gatsby" is a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald about the life of Nick Carraway, his wife Daisy, and their young son, Gats by Henry James about the Gats family. And the most popular and best-selling book of all time in the American literary universe, "The Bible"! It's about a man, who, while visiting a friend, finds his house full of beautiful paintings. And a beautiful old lady. I hope I didn't offend anyone by that. All these stories have many things in common, but none more so than the fact that all of them are about the dark side of the American Dream. They are about a person (Benedict Arnold or a similar type) who wants what everyone else has. He wants to make an even bigger fortune than his daddy, he wants to marry Daisy, he want a nice home with the family. He never feels a lot of empathy towards his servants or children or even his wife. He feels the same way towards the children and the servants who are always looking out for him. And in his heart, he is the best of them. It was just the same with Fitzgerald and James. He had the perfect family. That of his own design. They were rich, famous, beautiful. But they were his children. They wanted and needed the same things the other children had. And he had no sympathy for them at all. He could not care less for them when it came to their personal lives, what they had for dinner or how he would treat them after he was gone. He did care about them when he
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only problem with this movie is the story. The story is pretty basic and predictable. When the "bad guys" first capture the "good guy", they take him to a secret military base for testing. There, the test takes place: He tries to kill a large group of bad guys. The bad guys take him hostage and he is taken away. It turns out that they are "terrorists" who have been trying to kidnap and kill people for years. They are a bunch of psychopaths and I do not want to watch more of it! So, the good guys go into the headquarters to find out what they have done. The base is pretty easy to locate and the bad guys come out with assault rifles. The good guys quickly find out that the baddies are disguised as police officers and they fight them in a couple of scenes. The movie becomes a movie about the good characters and I feel that the good people get a bad rep. The ending is pretty pointless though because it really didn't need to happen (or maybe I will get to that in a future review). This movie is not bad, it just didn't deserve its rating. The Good: There are some great action scenes. There is some great voice acting. The characters are really well developed. The villains have a good plan to stop the good folks. This is a fun and fast-paced movie. The Bad: The baddies need to go back to their base. They don't need the good guy to go home with them. This movie could have been a lot better had the badies just done the one thing they should have. I think that this movie could work if the badie could have just followed up with his plan. The big guns just need to get on with it and stop the bad guy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first heard this movie about 15 years ago when I was a teenager.  At the time I thought it was just good "horror" for a time.  But like many things about this movie it has gone downhill since the 1990s when it was popular.  After a couple of years this movie has become more and more ridiculous, and its the only reason the movie is still around now.    Rating:  I was expecting to hear "Scary Movie 4" after the second (which is really just "Scariest Movie" but it's the closest we're gonna get) and I was not disappointed.  It's not a bad movie but it definitely does not deserve the praise it's gotten over the years. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those movies that I always wished was made into a big budget movie and it finally came true!  As a long time fan of the late, great John Carpenter's films, this is a fun little short film that is a little overproduced but all in all a fun look at a couple of lost travelers who get lost on their way through a canyon in California.   The story is told in a sort of "H.P. Lovecraft style" from what they tell us in the beginning of the film: "This is the place." "We're lost" The film is somewhat reminiscent of "The Thing". But it's a bit more light hearted than that.  It is not a hard film to watch but it would take a little bit of getting used to for people who are not fans of Lovecraftian horror.  But this would be a pretty good movie to watch just to get a good look at John Carpenter, his direction, his casting and the work that he and his crew did with the film. I did not love it but this would probably be a decent film to see, especially with the price at the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never thought that  Bollywood films would be about love and romance. I didn't even think that a movie could have a relationship between a boy and a girl but this film gave me the most beautiful feelings I had ever felt. It is a very romantic film and it is the most romantic  I have ever seen. When I heard that they are making a movie about two people who are in a relationship and that is the very first moment in the movie where I was in love. I had my heart on my sleeve, I was smiling like a child and I was even humming a couple of songs.   After watching this film, I found out about a couple more people in the film. I was really confused and confused. I kept on thinking   why they didn't use more people. When people watch this film their hearts are opened and they understand the meaning of love. It will definitely made you happy and it will make you smile. This is a must see film for any lovers of romance.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have only seen a handful of movies over the past year, and this one is in that very small category. I have seen a few movies where the female leads were more like the women in the comics, which makes the movies seem silly by comparison and doesn't help that the movie is a bad movie in my opinion. My problem is that there is not one single good or interesting line in the whole movie. It is really a mishmash of a story which could've been great if it were edited a bit better. My wife and I both felt that this movie really dragged on and was a bit too long for our liking. It's a good enough comedy which isn't too bad, but is really more of a "let's pretend" movie where you get to see all kinds of strange and bizarre things happen to two characters. I really couldn't relate to the main characters and didn't see much personality in the movie at all. There is actually a point in the story where the actors are talking about how their lines in the film are like the characters' names. I couldn't stop laughing at this, even though I wasn't expecting this kind of thing from a movie that is supposed to be a comedy. I didn't find any of the characters especially funny and I didn'st even like the main villain. It made a very strange movie and I will not be trying to watch it again. I guess it's a bit pointless seeing as most of the comic characters are basically just the same actors and not very funny as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This movie has a lot of fun with a very different kind of drama and some good moments as well. The film has some beautiful images of nature which is also what the film is really about and even though it isn't the most beautiful picture in the world it's still pretty damn beautiful."  Overall:   5/10 As a fan of horror movies this is a movie I will never forget. I know a lot people would not approve of seeing these things but as a horror fan it is just what you should be watching at this time of the year. You will not forget it and the ending will leave you a little shocked and a little satisfied.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cinderella is a wonderful fairy tale. It takes a beloved story, and manages to tell a whole new story.  It takes the familiar story, but it makes it fresh.  Cindy is a teenager who lives in a small town in England.  One day, she meets Prince Charming (Bruno) who she is instantly attracted to.  He asks her to marry him when she turns 18.  She agrees.  But he is not the prince that Cindy thinks.  After a string of bad luck, he starts to suspect he has been unfaithful to her. Cindy and the prince get married, but things don't go according to plan.  In a dramatic twist, the prince is killed by an assassin named Jack who is posing as a beggar.   So the prince returns in a new disguise to try and get his wife back. Cindy is shocked.  As the years go by, Cindy finds herself falling in love all over again with Charming.  There are also many other characters introduced and the story starts to take a turn.  It's a great comedy as well as a classic story of love, death, and hope.  I really like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If it weren't for the wonderful cast of characters we'd be watching a pretty simple action/romance flick.   In the opening moments we're taken back to a time in the late 1930's when there are very few options for women - they either marry a rich husband or join the military.  And yet all that is changed when a young woman arrives in town: she's tall, dark and strong, she's from a distant planet and she's a warrior.  She goes straight from the academy to a ship that's carrying off the prisoners of the planet - the only female in the whole prison camp is not there to protect her prisoners, but to destroy them.  With the help of a young man (Hollywood star Clark Gable) she goes on the attack but it's a suicide mission...   A fine, fun and action packed romp in the tradition of " The Greatest Story Ever Told " and " The Adventures of Robin Hood " (and a whole lot of things before that).   I liked it a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is an 80s tribute to the old fashioned noirish genre. The plot revolves around a couple who have been in the business for decades and are forced to work with the mafia to solve a mystery that has been lingering around for the past 7 years. The movie never fails to be entertaining, as it has a well written screenplay and a well acted lead performance from Leland Bobbitt. It is a story about a woman who's past life is revealed, and her new-found career as an investigator. It has some of the usual 80s crime movie clichés, but the film also manages to be genuinely entertaining. This is not one of those "action movie with a mystery" type of movies, but it's definitely one of a kind.

I also really like this film.  It was the first Star Wars film I watched and it really got me into it. The costumes are awesome! I liked how the movie was paced and the movie had great humor in it. It is a great movie to see a Star Wars movie from a different point of view, even if you aren't a Star War fan and I'm not.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I had high hopes from the outset that this movie would be a good one. It seems to me to be set against the theme of the Vietnam war. I do not know if this idea was done purposely or if it really had a basis in reality. It does set a good theme though and has its moments. The story is told in two parts. A young man is getting married to his fiance's sister. His wife is a beautiful woman, she is very intelligent, kind, and pretty. Her fiance is also smart and very good looking. They are very happy for a time. When the young man returns from Vietnam he finds a friend from his war days in his hometown. They share their stories, the war and his life after. They seem to have very similar lives. So, they go back to Vietnam to see his wife again. They live a normal life, with a home and children. His war is over and his children have married and settled down and are looking for good jobs. It is also his time to leave, but his son and wife seem to hate him. Eventually he leaves, but with the help of his old friend he is able to get back and live again in America. This is a good story and it does feel real to me. I am impressed with the actors as well, the young men have a good chemistry between them. The young wife is very pretty, and she will always have my heart, even though she is an only child. I really liked the film, as I was looking forward to seeing her again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first part of "Lonely Hearts" is a very sad comedy.  This has a "Dum-dum, Dum-Dum" theme, and also a very well played by an excellent cast.  I was not as much looking forward to this one as I was to the other one, but it is a good little romantic comedy. It was very hard to watch this movie, because the "Waltz" of this movie is not a good one.    I am very much interested to read the book which inspired this one. All in all, a good romantic movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original plotline was one big mess with two bad guys (one of them was good, the other one was bad) and a good guy being held captive by the bad guys and the bad guy being the good guy's ex-husband. The bad guy is actually a "good guy" who is really a villain who only wants to see his wife and daughter dead so he can feel like a hero. The good guy in the original film was much more sympathetic and a character with real depth. The only reason this movie is so popular is that there is a remake. This is a pretty bad remake of a pretty good movie. Watch this one if you want to see a villainous good guy get what he deserves (and the movie's ending should have been much, much better). The original had a great cast who were all good in their own way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I read the blurb for this movie I was not sure whether to laugh or cry. I had a vague idea about what a vampire movie would be like but to me, the story itself was so simple that I had to laugh.   I am not a fan of gore or horror movies. I usually do not like films where the main characters are tortured by being eaten by vampires (except in The Ring ). This film was the exception to the rule.  I will give this movie a 7.5/10.

These movies have been done to death. But this movie is different. It's a little more than a kid and his grandma having a baby. It explores what it means to love the person you have become. This story is told in a very realistic way. The cinematography is good and the movie has a lot of heart to it. I liked it a lot. Recommended.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film starts off slow and slow it goes.  We are introduced to a rather odd character by the name of Harry.   He is an old lady living alone in a house on the outskirts of a big city.  Harry is the most eccentric of all the people who live there.  She talks funny, looks odd,  looks and dresses like a lady,  loves music,  has a great nose which she likes to put on people and she's also rather wild but she has a sense of humour and she has more common sense than most.  I mean you get a sense in Harry that she's not the typical madcap who just does whatever she wants to do.  You have to respect her, she's got some wisdom and is a very good mother.  After the initial introduction we are given a lot of information about the house and about the people that live there,  they are odd but also rather kind and they care for their animals.  Things begin to change when Harry becomes ill and we find out she has been in hospital with her young daughter.  It turns out she and her young girl had a run in with a young man who turns out to be the most dangerous man in the world!      When Harry and the family visit the sick Harry finds out that the man's name is Arthur, he's a musician and he's very sick and not well.   Harry and Harry's daughter run away from home, Harry tries to find them but they're always in the next town.       When Arthur dies Arthur's mother has a surprise in store for Harry.   I'd say  Arthur's mother is a bit like a bad fairy tale in the sense that she is cruel,  she will scare Harry's family away from the house because she thinks Harry is too important and because she wants her own son dead.   This sets off the second act and the story turns into a good old fashioned horror film in a sense where you really feel for the characters and see them as human beings.  The music is also great and adds to the suspense and terror of the story.    It's really a shame that this was released a few years after Psycho which is one of the greatest horror films ever made.  There really is a lot to like about this film,  it's a slow moving horror film with great horror moments and it has a good story which is nicely told.

There have been a LOT of re-runs lately...and while the show itself can be a bit formulaic to some, I still always enjoyed it! I've always loved the characters in the show! Even those who are "The Doctor", but it is always a great ride to see them take part in some awesome adventures! I wish that the movie was released on DVD some time ago! It would have been great if it had been in black and white, but otherwise this movie is quite entertaining!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always thought about this movie when I was in the ninth grade. My mom has the movie and I have it on my tv. This movie is a lot of fun. My favorite part is when they bring this baby, this little girl, to the hospital where she had a life threatening disorder. Then they give her some medication to try and help her. Then the doctor gives her some other medication so that she doesn't get the bad effects of the first one. Then she comes down and they bring her home and we find out that there was a lot wrong with her. One day she has this seizure because she is scared of the water. She is scared because she had never been in the water before. Her mother puts her down in the lake and takes a photo of her in the ice and shows it to the kids at school. When she hears the noise she gets scared again. She runs home screaming but her father gets the dog to help her walk home, which I like because that is the best part of the movie. This makes the movie a lot easier to watch because it gives you a lot to think about while you are watching it. I just really enjoyed this movie because I love babies and they are really cute.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good, if not great movie. One of those that make you ask yourself a simple question: What is the best film that ever was made?  What do I get out of this film other than the enjoyment of watching an excellent film? __________________________________________________________ I'm going to start off by saying that this movie is a solid masterpiece.  The acting is fantastic, the story is compelling, the pacing is perfect and the direction makes it feel like a good fairy tale.    I was expecting a film that would be an adaptation of a fairy tale, but it didn't let me down.  The film is set during the time of the Hundred Years War, and involves a fairy called Alberic, a beautiful maiden who is always getting in trouble because of her appearance and her temper.  She is sent to live at the castle of Lord Mains, who is a kind, good hearted, and a good heartless man.  He keeps her prisoner for a long time and eventually he allows her to come out for some reason.  When she sees an opportunity to escape he is unwilling to follow it and says something to the effect that there is no room for women of her kind.  Eventually, the man has a talk with his son and in it the boy, a bit of a fool, says that there must be someone with the power to break the locks on the castle.  And so a quest begins... The fairy Alberics adventure is quite enjoyable and she quickly gets herself into some serious trouble.  But once she gets out she meets two other women who also happen to have a love affair with him.  There are more women in the film than a "Twilight Zone" episode, but I must admit that they seemed a little bit overdone in their role, I didn't really understand the point of their story lines.  Their role was that of love interest who seemed to want to please and get Alberica off the island so they could live happily ever after...or something along those lines. This film has a great score and the visual effects are phenomenal.  It has all of the elements that I look for in a great film.  I enjoyed the story, the pace, and the characters.  There is so much to love about this film that I can't help but to want more of it.  This movie is truly a gem and if I were to find a copy

The horror doesn't take you by surprise at all. There is a good amount of blood and it is pretty intense when a guy is in a bathroom and a big thing is in his closet, I thought it was a shower. I can't wait to see the sequel and I am very hopeful that this movie will be just as terrifying as the first one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Christmas Carol Ever  is a very funny movie.  I was happy to see that it contains not only Christmas songs, but also other holiday songs, the list is: A Christmas Story, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, Frosty's Christmas Carol, A Charlie Brown Christmas  and The Nutcracker.   You can see a little bit of the movie on Amazon,  a couple of the songs you'll recognize, such as Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer singing Christmas songs as he runs around a huge Nutcrackers Nutcrack.  The song from A Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (I like to call it the Nutcracked Movie)  which is the song I liked the best, a Christmas song that everyone remembers.  And it includes this line:  "We are all the Christmas tree we've ever been given, in the house we've chosen."  And the Nut Crackers who dance with Santa Clause in the Christmas Tree.  I also remember singing the song Rudolph the Nut Crunch which seems quite a romantic tune,  And of course, Christmas Cars, Rudolph.  This movie is a great Christmas Carol for children (atleast mine) to see.  The Best Holiday Movie  I have always loved these kinds of Christmas movies.  These are usually made by families and it is great to see the kids enjoying a nice day out and not having to worry about making Christmas gifts, or having any Christmas plans.  We've already talked about a couple of different movies this year and I think there may be more coming up.  They're great.  You can see some more movies here:   Christmas Movies (2016)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   As the title suggests, this film, like most 'good movies' has little to no plot or character development. Instead, we are given some great scenery and some great acting by the two leads. I believe the cinematography was very well done, especially on the exterior views. The story is pretty much just a bunch of people (including some non human actors) in a town that seems to be in perpetual destruction. We get a little more insight into the story when the main character comes to help the townspeople get over a terrible tornado. The main plotline takes a backseat as we get some more scenes of the town of Nesmith and its inhabitants. This film has its problems however, the main problem is that the story really drags on and eventually I really lost interest in the film (at least during the movie itself). The actors didn't really give us a reason to hate or like them in my opinion so they are really only going on a journey. This is actually an improvement over my previous experiences with the film, where I was somewhat disappointed at the end but really wasn't impressed with the actors. I hope it gets a DVD release soon and that the actors can perform more. This movie was pretty much more of a journey than an epic.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a good idea from a filmmaker who knows his way around the genre.  He seems to have taken a lot of inspiration from the early classics of the genre (Sidney Lumet, William Wyler, etc.) and the way he is handling it shows that he is not the only one to have done this.  There are several scenes where I thought he was watching the movie like a grownup.  I really like that the director is really taking you on a journey while not really taking the story itself too seriously.  The pacing is excellent with the occasional dramatic moment that is so well done that I was really left wanting more.  It is definitely one to keep an eye on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a word: fantastic. This movie has every good thing there is about a western movie: the scenery, the music, the guns, the horses, the Indians, and the cowboy who is, in the end, not only an excellent character, but a genuinely lovable one who would rather be good than rich. There is a real heart to him that makes the cowboy's every day struggles worthwhile.   There is more than a grain of truth in the movie about the death of Chief Sitting Bull, but the film doesn't bother to explain the context, and instead just leaves it out of the story, though, I did learn a lot from it, namely the fact that the Indian had actually killed Sitting Bull and taken his scalp to show that he was stronger than him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A couple of things I was not as thrilled about as I was going to be, and I can't really speak for the rest of the film. First, the action sequence in which the main character takes on an attack of the zombie army is pretty much nothing less than abysmal. The camerawork is bad and shaky, the zombie movement is inconsistent, and the zombie attack just... stops dead in its tracks. Even so, it's fun at first to see what would happen to these guys if they got out of the bunker. They start moving around aimlessly, shooting and stabbing each other in their futile attempts to get away, but none of it works out so well that anyone actually takes a real beating.   The other thing is that there isn't a lot of suspense in the movie. One of the more compelling parts in the script is about an old war veteran named Carl (Lance Henriksen), who has lost his mind. He's a man who likes to beat people, and this movie is mostly a glorification of this behavior. Henriksens character is so obnoxious in the beginning that I can hardly believe he had anything to do with the film, which is not surprising when you consider how horrible of a performance he had. The other bad guys in this movie are not even that much fun to watch.   …
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of those movies where you have the most enjoyable time, without really thinking about all the bad thing you see that happen in life. It's like a good story about a man who try to make a new life in a new city, but it's never been so fun or exciting. The acting by these two stars is really beautiful; even though the movie is like a comedy, it's a great comedy with a beautiful girl, with really good chemistry.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent horror movie. Not really anything that shocks or scares.  I like the fact that a real monster is not just a flesh/blood monster. It is more like a hybrid of both, an evil spirit that feeds on human energy. The acting in this movie is pretty good.  As you may have heard, this is a good film.  This movie is good. There was also another good film that is better because I liked it better...  This film is not a classic... But it is a movie that is well made, with good performances. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a classic film that was made in the 1960s. There is a love story at the heart of it, and it's a good love story. I would recommend it to anyone who is in need of an old fashioned story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a good little movie, about a group of friends who live together at their college fraternity house. The film has some really funny moments (especially the final one), with a group in their first year who are trying to get the attention of the college boys, which is a problem as there are many more men in college. The guys eventually decide to try to go out on dates, which brings a few laughs for everyone. The best scene is the final scene when they are sitting there and the guys discuss their plans, the guys do a lot of funny and funny things and all is well.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie but not a good romcom at all. It is so bad that one can not take it seriously even though the lead is good looking. It takes time for the romance between this female lead and her boyfriend to heat up. The story is about two friends having a party while they talk about the problems in their lives. Then a girl shows up who is not the real thing and this changes everything about their lives (like the last movie). This movie was a big bust for me because I was expecting something better from them.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen the trailer a bunch of times since then and it's still great. It looks cool, its got action, it's got a good character cast, and it has some great music.  I have to confess though, that I was very put off by this movie a few years ago...when it came out my dad got the DVD and didn't let me watch it.   Anyway I did watch it, and this was the best movie I have ever seen. I don't think I've seen a better movie.  is a classic, the best. I've been told that it is a remake of a movie called, and I've looked it up and it seems to be the same thing.  a classic movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a sucker for this movie from the 90's! And I loved the concept and the look of the movie. If I remember right, the whole "Halloween", "Friday the 13th" trilogy, "Sister Halloween", and "The Haunting" were all directed by Michael Crichton. I'll add that "Sid and Nancy" was also directed by his daughter, who I'm not sure I like too much. "Sigourney Weaver was also in the film! But if you liked all of Crichtons' films, then you'll probably enjoy this one. I've only seen one of them, which was a little dated, and that's "Sightseers"! It was definitely the best of those three films though. It was just as creepy as "Skeeter", and I found it just as scary as "The Halloween Tree"...which was the second film. "Rough Rider" and "Couples" were both pretty good! The only thing I hated about them was that "Rout" is a really poor film. I just don't believe Crichts thought it was funny at all. "The Witch" was the movie that I loved to watch the most! It's pretty good, but it's definitely a better version of "Seed", which is a good version, I'll give them that. And to close it all off, I liked "The Possession". It's got its moments, but I felt it didn't live up to the other versions I have seen. It's a really good story and a good film!
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ I've watched this movie a few times now and each time I find myself enjoying it more. It's just that you don't know what is going on at all times and that's fine since we don't have enough time to sit there and wonder what's going to happen next or where the story is going (although, to be honest, the movie kind of leaves you thinking "where the story goes?"). The story is very simplistic and while there are certainly more complicated plot points coming up, they can't be taken care of with this amount of stuff. The characters are a bit clichéd (except the one who is a bit of a bitch for a couple of episodes) but I was able to care about them to some extent. The only problem is that it doesn't really go anywhere much and it really feels like the characters are in a bit a rush to get to the next action set piece. __________________________________________________________________ A couple of weeks ago I had to go to San Jose and my friend suggested that I watch this movie. I found it funny, and since I am a huge sci-fi fan, a very good comedy should do well. I'll give it a 7/10.  favorite favorite favorite favorite  This was one of my favorite movies for years - probably the only movie that I can remember that I really enjoyed. I can still watch the movie after all these years and I don't think it is as cheesy as some people claim. I think it's just a decent sci-futurist movie with a nice story (not too bad), good characters and a decent plot. I do enjoy how the movie starts off with a bit more "space" and that it has a decent beginning/middle/end. In terms of a sci-fiction movie, I think this is probably the best out there.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************************** The best movie out there! When i saw the trailers of this movie i was like why is there a big hole at the beginning with the girls in white dress. The movie is about a couple who fall in love on a plane and stay together for 3 days on a cruise ship and they all end up in one room which i think the director really wanted to capture the feelings of one and only love in the film. The acting is great from all the characters who are beautiful as is the story line. I loved the ending and I am just excited to see what the director did next. ****************************
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is an enjoyable, charming, entertaining and highly entertaining movie. It is filled with colorful characters, a story that weaves a tale of innocence and deceitfulness, a romance that is complex with good intentions and even greater consequences that can turn the tides of war or make a person an enemy of his own people. For me it will always be the last and best movie that I have seen on the long running BBC series Sherlock. It was a great time and I wish they would do it again. I was not only in love with the actors but I also loved the script and the story.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I don't know if this was really made in 1965, but I think it would work well if you were trying to make a science fiction movie in the 1970's. I've seen this many times when I was younger, and I would love to see it again as an adult, but the technology wasn't that advanced in 1966. If you can find a copy, check out the movie's website for the Blu-ray. (I have never purchased the movie; if you think you can, you can.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was only expecting an average science fiction movie with an interesting premise. The premise is really something...interesting.  I was very interested in the science fiction film because of it's premise.  It's the future and the alien is a scientist who has been studying the Earth for the better part of 50 years and now decides he wants to go home. He decides to take his wife on a vacation in his ship. While traveling down the ocean to his home he finds that there are some nasty looking sharks on the coast and he decides to try to escape them but it's not so easy because as they chase him they break off a part of the ship's hull and start to try and kill him. When it becomes clear that they are trying to kill him they attack him and he gets his only weapon -- the ship itself.  They are very strong but in a little while he finds his strength and when he starts to destroy the sharks with the ship he finds an egg.  The next thing we know a strange giant is attacking the shore and this giant is not a shark he's a very strange looking creature that's big to say the least. The movie is divided into 2 parts.   One part is that the ship starts to have trouble with it's engine and soon it goes on a collision course with an ocean liner.  There the ship gets badly damaged and the captain makes an emergency landing on the liner. Then after a few moments he's in the process of being attacked by a shark and his ship is seriously damaged.  Once again his weapons are not enough and he finds a new weapon in his pocket.  When this shark manages to get a hold of him his ship goes into a tailspin and it's captain dies.  After the shark attack is over the next scene begins with the crew being taken to another ocean liner and when the captain dies of his wounds it's up to the ship to stop the sharks from attacking the ship.  I was really interested to see this film because it had a good premise and the movie did a lot of things right that I hadn't seen done before.  If you are a fan of science fiction movies this is a must see for you. This review was first posted to filmgeek.com
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen a little bit of good old fashioned Bollywood films, but this is definitely one of the better ones. The movie does a great job of setting the story in the 1950's and giving a historical twist, which is very refreshing and a welcome one in a film that is usually about action and guns. All of the characters have great performances and I believe that the film's overall plot was pretty good. The music was good too, even though it's not a song I would have chosen as my favorite. Overall a great film that doesn't do much, but it does it well and the ending is sweet. I have nothing but respect for the director and all the cast. I will probably watch it again, even when it isn't on the best of lists.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most unique movie I saw this summer. It has a lot of things happening at once, but it's not in a bad way. It makes you feel a bit silly, as the story and characters are way over the top, but that doesn't stop them from being very original. The music is very good, too. I like the style, the actors and even the movie is very original, and it's hard not to like it. The movie is not afraid to tackle controversial themes, both positive and negative, so I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good action movie with an original concept. It's pretty unique and will not leave you bored.

I was in the mood to do something different so I started looking through a book called the Evil Eye. It was about a woman that had a very bad life until she was attacked by an evil creature. This is the first time I've ever seen a movie that took place in a house. The movie also had a few good scenes with the woman who was a serial killer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is one of the best horror films I've seen in a very long time.  The film takes place in the near future, and it feels like you could almost forget about the real world for a few hours while the film slowly reveals some of the horrors of the world we're living in now.   While some of these are disturbing and sad, most of them are not as such, and most of the deaths are simply tragic.  The film is a bit dated in places, but it's such a good time, it never really gets old.  I wouldn't give this one five stars, but five stars it is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! is a short film about a boy who has lost all of his friends and family due to sickness. His world gets transformed in a short time when he meets a mysterious girl in a bar. He falls for her instantly. The girl in turn is in love with his love interest. It's a short flick but it can have a long lasting impact. It is not a bad one to watch but not much of what I want out of a movie comes out. The story is told through the eyes of the girls. It all feels so real. This is the story of a young boy who loses everything in a terrible illness. One day he meets an extraordinary girl, she is the most beautiful girl he ever met. This girl becomes a love interest for him and their story changes him forever.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I didn't think it would be a big deal. I'm sure it will just be a bunch of young boys sitting around watching "Karate Kid" movies (I don't know why you would watch it. All the karate is about fighting and getting beat up and if the kung fu was more real it wouldn't have been so awesome. But karate, being a martial art, is all about the fight. The fights are the only thing the movie is about. All in all, it's a good little kids movie which is what you really need to watch after a while. _______________________________________________ ______________________________________ I've never seen a karate kid film before. I always assumed they were some kind of Japanese special effects thing and I haven't had the opportunity to watch kung-fu movies since I watched "Kung Fu," so I was surprised at the quality. I've heard a lot about the old karate schools that used to be in Asia but never had a chance to visit those places. A lot of good kungfu movies and kungfumtv, a lot of kung Fu stuff. And I'm a sucker for the martial arts (just like you, me and many others) so I'm watching it. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â This is the best movie to come out of the 90s. There's no reason to put it this way: it doesn't have a bad movie. The movie is well-executed, good-looking, and pretty entertaining. The story is a bit rushed, but that's typical for a 90's movie. Most people will find this film a bit cheesy but that doesn't stop it being good. The characters are really well-drawn, the story is engaging, and I always end up grinning as I watch it. It's a great movie. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates good movie. Â -Chris D. (11/24/99)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am still in shock over this. My wife and I were driving to visit some family at our home in Maryland. I was driving to Washington, D.C. when a truck full of people turned around and went in the other direction. I had just finished eating lunch at a local restaurant a few minutes ago and there were people on the road. My husband, who was driving, stopped and got out to talk to these people, who seemed to know him and ask him questions. Eventually, a man got out of the truck and told us that he wanted a picture with us. At first, I didn't know what to do, so I told him that we were too busy eating, but then the man said that we might be able to get out a bit later. I felt a little uneasy about this so I asked him how he could get out so we could go back in. He told me that he'd just bought a one-way ticket to California. He said that he didn't have any money with him, but that he had plenty of gas in the back. I told them that I couldn't afford to go all the way out to California, and that we'd have to stay and eat the rest of the day. The guy looked at me, looked at my wife, looked back at us and asked if I was sure. I got out and told him we wouldn't be able do that. We told him to sit in his truck, get out, and wait there. There was no reaction from the person in the truck. He had no expression. I said that I needed to use the bathroom and had to hurry, so he walked around in the direction of the exit. I gave him a nod and walked quickly to the bathroom. When I was done, I just stood there with my mouth open while my husband and his friend walked back to the truck, and I stood in the open for several minutes. When the two men got into the truck with the driver and the passenger, I took one look at them, and my heart just stopped. They were so attractive. Their skin, their hair, their clothing. I didn?t think that anything had ever appeared so beautiful before. They both looked about 40 or so. I couldn?t do anything but stare at them. I walked around to the other side of the passenger seat, and when I sat down, the two of them got into their vehicles and left. I knew at once that they
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this film yet (I think) and I want to, but it seems like a no-brainer to see this film. I am a big fan of the classic Star Trek television series (as well as movies such as the Next Generation movie: TNG: Nemesis, ST: TOS: "The Cage", TOS III: "Amok Time", TNG VI: "Cause and Effect" and TNG V: "Parallels") so when I heard it was set on the Enterprise I was stoked. This film is probably best remembered for "The City on the Edge of Forever" in Season One and the first three episodes of Season Two, but I think what made the film such a big hit was how well the cast and director combined the original series characters with the new crew. "The Big Goodbye" is where the film really shines. It is one of my favorite episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series and when Picard goes into cryosleep, Data and Worf are there to watch him go and try to make sense of his death. In one of the most heartfelt and affecting scenes in a long time, Picard is in a great deal of pain when he realizes how much of his life he has wasted. He is so tired of not being able to save people; he wants to go to new adventures and just to help people. But, he feels like his death is not as good as he thought it to be. His only chance is to leave his son Riker and his wife Deanna to find a new man to take over his leadership duties and not to tell Data about his decision. And I really enjoyed the way that the film handled the character of Riker. When he was younger, Riker was a bit of a jerk and a bit annoying and he seemed to just be trying to get out of his place in life. But as the story goes on, we see him grow and we really like how it was portrayed that way and how he finally learns to change his ways and become a leader of men. There are a lot of great characters in this movie, so it's hard to pick just a favorite. I think the most poignant scene in the movie is when the two men are talking about what is most important to them, Rikers and Picard. The only person that he truly cares about is Picard, and Picard is the only person who can change his fate. He may be dying, but he has to know

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first favorite movie of the new decade so far, not for the plot, but the characters. The film is mostly about a group of friends who get the opportunity to play a rock band at a small college. The best thing about the movie is its soundtrack, it's absolutely incredible.  The movie also looks great as well, and features a great soundtrack from The White Stripes.   My only problem with this movie was the fact that they had no idea how to do a proper rock music movie, it seemed the only thing they did was slap a band on a boat and sail it out into the bay. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard the story of this film, I thought it would be a bit clichéd, but it wasn't. It's a clever, original movie, where a new teacher tries to change the school's motto to 'Teach The Boys To Love, To Die For Each Other'. A teacher who can't even bring up her own class, that is, when her own son is killed, because she's a bad teacher! The film is very funny in places, and very tragic at others. The ending is quite tragic too, but that's the point. The film has an anti-hero, an antihero is usually pretty easy to write, and this film has something different, which I loved. It was also well edited, which isn't always a good thing, but in this case it was necessary, because it wasn  In a country which has a very serious problem in terms of gender equality, there is a girl who wants to become a teacher, but she only has three boys at her school, so she decides to become teacher for one of the boys. And one of those three boys, and the other two boys are her closest friends. They have been together since they were children, and when they leave school, the three boys follow, to see the teacher who taught them so much. Of course, things don't go smoothly, because when their teacher gets to the point of teaching boys to love each other, the boys are so excited to see her that one of them falls over. But then, one of her own students is taken by a car, and she is forced to take on the case, and after all the boys and the girl find out about what has happened, the situation is finally resolved. It takes a bit too long, because the film just doesn't make it through, especially since there were three of the best three boys in the whole school dying together. But it does make it, and even though it isn't a wonderful film, it has a certain charm to it, which the movie is a master of.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am in my early 40s and in the past 3 years I have watched a number of movies about young kids going about the town in a small farm, not wanting to grow up like everybody else. For me this film, which is based on a true story, is worth watching. It features the great Martin Sheen as a school teacher, who is sent to a town where the kids are not allowed to grow older than 14. One day the kids discover that he has taken over the place. He is a funny, sweet and caring teacher. The film is about him and his struggle to maintain control of the town. He loves his little town and its people. He has some very funny bits. You see him with his long flowing hair and mustache, playing "The Old Man" or "The Red Cap" and he gets to do his part well here. The best scenes are when the kids have to hide from the teachers. He gets to have a word with them and that is always fun! It is interesting to note that he was not so bad when he was younger and his personality seems so good now that he is older! The kids in the film are well balanced, and I felt that the film did a good job of showing the good and bad sides of teenagers, as well as the good side of adults. A very fun film. I think that is why I like it. There is a small town with an old man who is out of town on an extended stay and his two daughters who are a young woman and a boy. All three of these children are growing up quite fast, and when the old man returns he becomes very angry, when he sees the boys in their first clothes! I felt the film made me feel very sad when the film ended, because I felt like I had seen the last of it and I am sorry that the old character is getting so much screen time! It really is sad to see a film such as this going. But it really was a good film! A little short for a 45 minute film, but it was fun to watch!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While not an overly creative and original film, this is definitely one of the better of its genre. The story is very subtle with some subtle themes in it, and it's quite beautiful at times. I like that it doesn't just be a typical romance drama, as there are other elements in it besides that. The acting is good, and is very refreshing to see for a movie that's in English, as it's not a typically Japanese style of acting. There's an episode in particular that I particularly loved which I highly recommend watching.   It doesn't go beyond what you could expect from a romance movie, which is pretty much what you would hope for from a movie about love. But for a film that takes itself seriously, there isn't really a lot more to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* The plot is very simple. The movie is set in the 1930's and tells the tale of a young farmer who had two daughters at the time. One of his daughters is married to a very bad guy who gets in her way and is always there with a gun. When the farmer goes to a bar with his neighbor, the two friends are invited. The townspeople are very shocked that this farmer would go to a place like that, and the farmer has to explain his predicament to the mayor. The mayor then sends a detective who asks to meet the young widow. When she arrives, the detective notices that the girl is really a woman (they had sex, we're told). He has no idea what to do with the girl, but he gives her a name -- Charlotte. The young widow is about to be killed by a guy who wants her money. The farmer has no choice but to shoot him dead. Now he has a little girl with him and has to save her. ********************** I had not really noticed it until about the third time I watched this movie. I never thought I'd have a movie that had the protagonist's name be Charlotte but I was surprised. The character Charlotte does seem strange to me now, but it certainly makes for a good story.  I love a good mystery. If you like movies with good acting, good story and good acting and the whole nine yards, then I'd highly recommend this movie! ************
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************* A great thriller about the murder of a prominent banker. I'm not sure if the movie has been given any kind of recognition, however it is the classic "what if" story. If only that banker had had some common sense about the way in which he carried a small fortune. He was too trusting of others for someone like that, and he would do anything for money. He had to have some kind of a conscience for a man of his caliber to have to be a murderer like he was. It's interesting that the person who killed the banker didn't care if he had to kill a woman or a child or a woman who he thought was a pretty girl. A good movie to watch if you like films like this one. I recommend this for a thriller movie if you want something new and different, and if you enjoyed "The Maltese Falcon", then there is another story like it with a different ending, but still an interesting one.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** ********* ******** ******** *** This movie is a masterpiece of special effects. For a couple of hours we are transported to the fictional and quite wonderful world of the French Film Noir of the late 1920's. The film is about a gang of French thugs. The main character of the film is a man by the name of Maurice (Jean Gabin). In addition to being a member of this particular gang, he also has a past which is quite dark and violent. He is also a former member of a gang called The New Orleans Bums. The gang in New Orleans was one of the most vicious and dangerous. This was a time of urban rioting, which had its roots in the African American community's frustrations at the lack of black representation in American life. Maurice is a former Bum who is now a member and a leader of this gang. While on the way to the party Maurice finds out that his girlfriend, Mary (Rosemary Harris), is pregnant. They were a love story from the beginning. After Mary is murdered, Maurice tries to turn over a new leaf and try to live a good and peaceful life as a family man. Unfortunately, he is soon faced with a problem that he may or may not be able to get past. The movie is about two of the great French directors. The first is the great Francois Truffaut who directs and wrote the script of the movie. He also had an influence on the art direction. The other is the director Marcel Carne. Carne had his own gang called "L'enfant dans la pite" (The Little Innocent Boys), a gang made up of young orphans who are recruited from impoverished areas of France. These children are put in the care of the parents of the gang and have to learn discipline and how to survive. Carrere also uses sound to great effect. It is quite obvious that he was influenced by the films of the 1930's like The Jazz Singer, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The Magnificent Ambersons. **************************** *********** ******** The plot: The film follows Maurice and the gang as they do their weekly patrols. They go out on patrols to "stave off crime." The film also takes the gang on a vacation to the beautiful resort city of Nice. They see the French opera "Spirited Away." Their first encounter with a "monster" takes place during their trip. The group is attacked by a man named Le Bat.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie a lot and hope it gets a theatrical release. I'm glad it was done with a film. The special effects are good, especially the one at the end.   (review from an old tape)     Rated 1 out of 5   A very poor film of a well-intentioned idea which is completely ruined because of inept directing, lousy effects, poor screenplay and bad acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big One" (2008) is the true life story of the famous oil rig explosion that took place on a platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 1989. The film is based on one of the books written by the journalist David Maraniss and it chronicles the day that was one of those "mysterious days of our times."  The movie is a gripping thriller with a great cast that includes George Clooney, Matt Damon, Robert Duvall and Tim Robbins.  George Clooney plays the character of Frank Wills a former high ranking officer of the U.S. Coast Guard who becomes a whistleblower when he is involved in the oil rig disaster.  The movie is set in the early 1990's and it is a fun time filled with good action scenes and plenty of suspense.    "The big one" is a good film.  It is a bit predictable at times but it is still a good thriller with many good moments.  George Clo, Matt and Robert Duvvall give it a nice screen test in "The Big one" which you should check out and give it the 4 stars it deserves.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    While watching some of the movie I was surprised at how long it took the characters to get out of bed to go to the beach. I don't know about you but I thought a movie about a group of boys would have a good storyline going into the movie. I was expecting something more about the beach but that's about all you really get. It looks great and there is good sound here, however a little less than a good time and a little boring. As a teenager I would love to see a movie like this about two boys that go on an adventure. I'm sure there is something else there...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Thing" is a good film. The creature of the film is awesome and well used. The story is also good and well told and gives a story of men who are lost and find their way to a strange, but not alien-esque planet. The people of the planet are friendly, but are not human. They are called "The Thing". A man named Tom "Thing" Treadwell is the one who finds the planet and the people, and the creatures called "Tumblers." They are not friendly. They do not understand humans, and do not like them. They only want to eat. The Thing decides to use the tools found on the planet to find a way to leave the planet. And this is when all hell breaks loose. It seems the Thing is going to eat Tumblers. The Tumbler can kill the Thing. So the Thing must kill him and go back to Earth. The film takes about 20 minutes longer than it needs to, and is a bit slow. The characters are all well designed. They were all good and played by the right people. One character I liked was Bill Paxton who played "Mr. Treadfield." He was a good and sympathetic character. It's not the best film I have ever seen, but it is good and a good time, and there is something for everyone in here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********************  The movie was great. It had a great story, great story line, and great action. I loved the special effects as well. The special effects look great and it was a fun and entertaining movie. ******************* This movie is in black and white, but if you're interested in seeing the color, you can download the movie from Netflix to see how well the story holds up.  In the movie we follow a young man named Paul R. Goggins (Peter Weller) who is a student in high school. He lives with his aunt and uncle in a run down old house.  It's here that he discovers the magic of electricity and the wonder that is a light bulb. When he brings a lightbulb to his uncle's house he becomes a hero to many in the town.  His heroics are soon recognized when a big bad bully named John Cusack (E.J. Mackey) comes looking for him.  As Paul and John make their way home they encounter a mysterious man named Zorro (Richard Widmark) who has arrived to kill Zorros and Paul in order to become the new chief of police.  The script by David S. Goyer was a perfect story. The movie had great action and the characters are quite charming.  Paul is a nice enough man, not the hero of the story.  If I didn't like Paul, the movie would've been a bust. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was actually quite scared when I started watching this movie. I've never seen an American Horror Story like this, and it has a very dark and twisted vibe to it.   It's not a movie you will get right away, but by the third episode you'll find a reason to keep watching.  This movie is dark, intense, and extremely scary.  The acting is fantastic.  There were a few instances where I would go to bed and not want to go to sleep at night anymore.  It has some extremely dark moments, and I really believe the killer is the only one who is innocent.  After watching it, I can't stop thinking about that scene where Jessica Lange's character was on the phone with her boyfriend.

The characters are all pretty stupid and the story is very repetitive.  I had a few laughs during the movie but nothing that I enjoyed.    I would recommend this to someone who is looking for something to do during a dull day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is so funny. One day we see a group of guys going around in the mountains trying to make an apple pie. It turns out they don't have an apple but an egg instead. So, the egg is placed in the crust of the pie, and this becomes a huge problem. Then things get worse when a man jumps up from behind the pie and throws the egg, shattering the pie. This causes all the ingredients in the pie to rush out, and then they start to go to a new, much better pie, while the first goes back to where it was to start with again.  Now, it all sounds like a bad joke, but the fact that this is just a silly movie is the key.  "What is a pie?" "That's a pie!  "It's a stupid fruit!" "How is it funny?" "It doesn't take any effort at all.  "I thought it was terrible! " "That was stupid!   "You could have been more clever than that!"  "That didn't work out either!  I don't know if I've ever laughed so hard as when a guy was saying "I made a mess!"  The movie is great because there is a lot of slapstick.    Well, I think I've seen everything I've wanted to see from this movie.  It has a bit of everything, from a bunch of hilarious characters, to a great story, to some good slapstick, and an excellent ending. It was probably one of the funniest movies I've been involved in, and one of my favourite comedies of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not sure I've seen a more touching or more heartwarming story in all my years of watching movies. It's a true story about two young men from different cultures who become friends and spend many years together learning about the world and others. It could be a very good story about friendship, a lot of it, but in a strange way, the story works so well because of the characters. They're very believable and the film is well done. The special effects are outstanding and all of the songs were done wonderfully by Paul Simon, he was a true inspiration to me as a child.   The film is a fantastic tribute to American cinema, not just of the 1950's but also the classic period that most people think of when they think of American films. You should see it, you owe it to yourself. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really wanted to like this movie. I thought it was going to be a really good comedy, but it became a real train wreck. I was expecting to laugh all the way through, but the movie's first 10 minutes just went nowhere. I really liked how it took place on a boat, but after the first 10 min, I couldn't see what's going on. If this movie had been made on a tv show, it would've had a better quality production. I'm not too sure about the characters since they all seemed fake. The most annoying thing is the guy who was in the first part being played by Michael Douglas. The guy in the second part was played by a real actor who I actually recognized. The rest of the characters were pretty useless. The film took place mostly on a pirate ship, but then we see a movie about some sailors (with a boat) on a sailboat. So the first thing I noticed was the bad acting, which was pretty bad because it was pretty much the same people, but this time they were on a cruise ship. The actors did a good job portraying the characters, but I think the most disappointing thing was how the movie turned out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never understood the critics who hate this movie. It's one of the greatest movies of the year, and is one of my favorite movies of all time, period.   The film was directed by Ridley Scott and stars Harrison Ford, Ford's son, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher. The film is about an officer who kills a man who tried to rape his daughter (yes, really), and she is a little girl at the time. After a man comes up to her and tries to rape her, she uses a handgun and shoots him dead. This is how she ends the film. If I were to describe this story, I'd say that this was a kind of fairy-tale, but with a bit of a dark twist.   of course that was just the beginning of it all. The characters all grow, and the story continues to get darker and more complicated. There are two endings here, but there's actually two versions of the movie. I prefer one of them, and that's the one that Ridley Scott's made. I don't know why people don't like this, but it's a really awesome movie and deserves a place in every fan's movie collection.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ...   The film is a film, and like the title of the book it is a true story in a fictionalized manner. You might find the story hard to believe at times but there is so much humor and fun in this story.    -.. Moviemaker Joseph S. Nitschmeister has been directing movies since the 1950's and currently works for Cinecittà. You will see in many of his films the use of special effects, the use, of lighting, the filming of horses, the horses in action, a girl wearing a white dress, a lady running down a street dressed in a white gown and wearing a scarf, and the use and the performance of horses in a variety of settings. He works in 3D and uses motion picture cameras. Many of his characters are based on real characters from the American south. They have their lives filled with music, dancing, drinking, parties, women, and of course horses. His films are popular because of the use of comedy, good acting, and strong characters.

I love the idea that these two kids are playing with a box and all of a sudden the box gets kicked off of them and explodes. Now they have to find it. They do a ton of searching but the box seems to move through the air a few times and they get a little worried. The more they search and they find that the box really is a secret box. The box seems very dangerous but they find out that this secret box has been used by the same person every day for the last 100 years. I really liked this movie and I would recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have a little confession to make.  I'm a little biased.  I was in the audience at the premiere of this movie.  It's a wonderful film.  As a fan of the book, I was surprised by the changes to the plot and characters, and how quickly we all fell in love with this film and this wonderful character.  Now I'm a fan no more.  One thing that really bugged me was when a man goes on a shooting rampage and the police shoot the two guys that brought him in.  Was this part of the script.  In the book one of the young boys had been shot and he'd been trying to tell the other not to shoot anyone.  He didn't do it well and was shot too.  The director and his partner had to kill him.  Then I'm sorry for the poor boy, not because he went on a murder spree.  But it was very hard to believe that they could shoot him. Then we learn that the "old man" was actually a man with a bad temper and a very hard life.  Is this really the man we're supposed to believe was the man who put a bullet through the head of a child and sent the other two to the hospital.  And it's not like the guy was a great big meanie or anything.  His job was to take care of some dogs and a cat that would get loose.  They weren't much of pets but he was good at keeping them in the house, and he did that pretty well.  This "old old man" is portrayed as a goodhearted old soul.  When a girl comes to visit him to ask if he'd taken in a young boy in a box she's told "No, but I've taken the cat."  I guess the old man thought the cat was one of those pesky small animals that need to be put down.  Of course the cats are put to sleep.  Why he doesn't just kill the cats is beyond me, but you're just as liable to see a man trying to get rid of a cat as a monster with a gun.   That's why the two boys, who are really nice, were killed.  So the "good old man", this old man whose job was pretty well done, can't shoot.  Yes, he is told that he should shoot and the way he shoots is that he just throws the gun at the boys.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------------------- "Escape from Death" is a pretty damn cool movie that takes place in 2077. The humans live under an Earth where most of the surface is covered in lush green trees. The only problem is that these trees are actually killing the humans. The trees take over the environment by using insects to spread the tree's seeds. When a tree comes down it spreads seed over the world. The seeds then take over any place they come to, and the only thing left is a few survivors. The movie follows a group of people who decide to leave their city to escape the destruction of the trees. When they go looking for a place to live in the forests, they soon find they are the last people on Earth. ------------------------- "Eco-Dystopia" was a movie I found pretty cool in it's own right. There is a lot of environmentalism in this movie. There are some nice scenes with people going out of town to build a new town. The people live in a new home for them. The entire movie was pretty short and you'd probably be lost by the end. It's definitely a good thing that the plot was simple.   "The Future of the Planet" ------------- In the movie "The Island of Doom" (the movie which I'm referring to here) there is a group who is in charge of the research of the alien planet. The lead scientist that is leading this research is an old man named Charles Darwin. He is on the island looking for something that is important to him, this is all I know about the plot of the movie but I can tell you it's pretty interesting. There was an alien that wanted to destroy all the plants on this planet. However the humans are smart enough to realize the alien is coming to destroy the planet. When the alien lands on earth they begin to destroy everything they can find. This is where the main characters of the film are able to get in trouble with the aliens. ------------- "The Planet X" --------------- In "The planet X" (one of the better movies of the year), some people (a group of friends, not really, but it's what they get into) go to a planet that isn't on any of the Earth's charts. They land on the planet that looks and smells like Earth and then they begin a life of fun and adventure. The film was pretty good. There were a couple of good plotlines. There's one where they find
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In case you don't know this movie was a big hit in the UK back in the day. It's still good to watch. But this film was an early version of the big American blockbusters of the 1980's. So don't expect a great fight scene, it doesn't have much of a story, or any characters. It is rather a cheap movie to be released in the 1980s, the same kind that were made a decade or so later. That kind of movie could get a big budget and then get cancelled when the studios realised they could make a lot more money in another format. Well they didn't. Instead there's more money going to the production of the film itself. Maybe if they had made a more expensive movie they could have had more money to make more expensive fights...   This movie is a bit like 'Jaws' with a little less money, a bit more gore and a bit less action. I think you could say the same about 'Jurassic Park' with less money and more gore... The only difference is the movie is only about 45 minutes long.   The movie starts with a great battle scene between the heroes and the baddies in which the heroes win with ease. It starts out with a big crowd in attendance and it ends with a huge crowd outside. This is really an early movie with lots of people and lots of action scenes. It does have a few flaws in the second half of the movie. It makes it even harder to follow what is happening. It has some very weird effects at times that make me wonder how they were possible.   The movie would have worked much better if it hadn't been so short. If the story was a little longer the movie could have been better. But it has a lot of action. Maybe one day I will get around to watching a movie from this era.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Saw" is a very good horror film. The movie was made in 1974, and is a "found footage" horror movie. The horror starts with some shots from the back side of a trailer truck, then you see a guy in a hoodie, holding a small woman by the neck in a small town where many people live and work. The girl was found dead, her head is missing but her body is not. In the trailer, you see some people who looked like they were living with their families, in the trailer you see the trailer truck going up and down some hills. Eventually, the man in the hoodie puts the girl down to help her up, when she does he pulls something up with a stick. The man tells the girl to go inside of the house and he would show her something that can get her out. The next morning she's not there, when the husband goes to look for her, the guy starts to run through the woods and his hat gets stuck on a tree, he is chased by two or three men and eventually they catch up with him, he kills two or two people then a man in a suit gets killed by the axe, and then he throws himself in a fire and burns to death. He is found by the woman, she runs out of the trailer to find her husband and he is already dead, then she runs back to see him and he's gone. Then he tries to get in the truck but it won't start. Then a strange man says that he'll take him there and if he doesn't want it, he can get out of it. Then she comes home and finds the truck in a big lake, so she swims to it and climbs onto the water to try to get herself out of a burning truck. When she is in the boat the truck starts to drive into the lake with her inside, but at the last minute the driver cuts it off and the boat sinks, but the driver gets out alive and the two swim across the lake, they find that the truck was full of gasoline, and that the man they saw in the mask is an evil spirit that is going to burn the whole town to the ground. So the two get to the lake and make their way back to town, at the end when they are coming back they see the man from the mask alive and he has the truck, so the two go back to the trailer and the man is in there, they start to put

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first experience with an actual vampire film. The vampires in the film are not just some mindless, creepy-crawlers that crawl around. There's some heart, some humanity in there, too. The film, directed by the great Bram Stoker-writer, is a masterpiece of horror in every sense. The way it captures the essence of its source material is a truly inspired film. If you are one of those who can't help but scream at the very sight of a young girl, then this is an opportunity you'll never soon forget.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first act is the classic "he's a bad guy and we must save him" thing that makes you sit up and pay attention and keep reading. The opening scene is good, in a slow, creepy manner. You get a little glimpse of this horrible man being led off of an island and into a mysterious ship. The crew, the ship's captain and crew, all seem to be on board at this point...then they're out of sight. And you don't have the time to find out what's happened...you're right in the middle of this thing and it goes on. It's creepy, it's sad, it'll make you want to go to a haunted house to see if you can spot the crew at the bar. The characters themselves don't seem very interesting, but you can't be sad at this movie, because it's good! It's disturbing and it keeps you on your toes. The only thing is that it isn't as good as the first two films in the series...at least not on the visual level. You could still tell that it was made in the '60s, and it is.  Helpful this is definitely not your typical horror movie: the acting is poor, the setting is creepy and the plot is a twisted murder mystery. The movie follows a man (played by an Englishman) who leaves a little girl in a room in order to get away from a crazy old man who's looking after her. However, he can't escape as the old man comes back to collect the money that he's paid out to the family. The old man doesn't want the money, but he wants the little girl...as a "wife". The older man wants to have his own wife, and his wife is a little old girl. This is a great way to start a series...the older man, the girl, a man, a little house, a big house, an old man...and the whole plot is completely based around this man, with him taking money from the woman and then leaving her for dead. If you didn't find this creepy, this review wouldn't be written. The story seems very straightforward and simple, and once the movie takes an interest in you, you're going to be wanting to find the "evil" man. The plot doesn't go very far, though, so you can watch this with a group of friends. The ending is very ambiguous and doesn't reveal a lot about what happened

This film is an absolute gem in my eyes. The acting is very good, the cinematography is superb, and the musical score is wonderful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a HUGE sci-fi fan, so I was excited to see this on opening night.  If you like anything like, or even something like, Star Trek, you will love this movie.  The art is all CGI, but it is good CGI.  The film starts off in a very futuristic, but very gritty style.  This is not a very optimistic film.  But then everything changes.  It has a female captain who is just so great.  She has the voice of a goddess!  Her love interest and the chief engineer, play the roles of a modern day Captain Kirk and Spock.  What is so amazing about this film is that it looks like it should be from the future, but doesn't look like it at all.  I don't know where the director got this idea for this film, but he got it!  Everything from the look and feel of the technology to the look of the characters, to how the humans are portrayed.   This film is not for everyone, but there is something about it that reminds me of Star Trek. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- Another very good film by James Cameron is up, this one about a man who wakes up in a strange future world where there are no people of any sort. This one is a little different from the others. It is a movie about the end of times, with a young man searching for a woman to love and have a family. He meets one in a village, who helps him on his journey back to the future. He has a car, a very nice car. It will be a long night until he finds his lady. In the film he is searching for what he believes to be a place that has the most beautiful woman in all of the world. He gets into a fight with a couple of guys who want her, then he meets a girl who is a bit odd and is actually a spy. She has a weapon called a gun that can kill you at a moment's notice. It does not work as well as it should. There is also a little thing in the film that disturbs me. There are some good, sad and happy moments. I don't know the meaning of it, but I guess something is up with that car and the driver in it. He is really strange, and his appearance is different from what people are used to. I won't spoil it for you, but it might not work for you. Overall this is an interesting movie to watch. I was very impressed. You don't see a lot of movies like this anymore. If you like action and adventure, look at this. It has all of that and you could enjoy it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a story about a girl who falls in love with a strange, big, mysterious man who lives in a house built on the beach.   In order to help his love, he helps to write a story.  This little story is about a little girl with a big imagination who, due to the fact that she doesn't fit in with her family and her schoolmates, wants to be a storyteller. The first story is the most common one among the short stories: "Cinderella" – an imaginary fairy tale.  The second story has the heroine and a friend on a journey across the world.   The third story is "The Little Prince", where the girl lives with a little boy and, by the end, it appears that she is a little fairy herself.  In "Cristo de Algue", the main character is a princess who lives inside a house.  It is a story from the point of view of the girl who wants to live and be an artist on the same level as her mother.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found myself really enjoying this movie after the first 10 minutes, which in my opinion is the strongest part of this film. The movie had great production and set design, and the acting was very good as well. The whole film takes place in the small town of New York in the wintertime, and it works. The story is about a young man who is being pursued by his girlfriend on Christmas Eve by a mysterious, hooded and masked man. He runs, but gets separated from her and she goes looking for him. The guy ends up in a hospital, and gets his nose broken from the mask and his broken nose. They are then both taken to the home of his girlfriend's parents. Then he is asked to give a "man of the night" a ride to a local bar, and then he is left behind. He finds a note from his girlfriend explaining what happened, and is soon reunited with her. The twist is that her mother is an actor and has been doing this movie and theater thing for a long time. When he has his own audition she is there, as the "manager." It's a good twist that makes you laugh. The "Man of the Night" is a real movie star, and very charming. It was all a great story, and I really liked the film. If you like a Christmas Eve chase movie and a good acting performance from an unknown actor, and who just happens to have been in two other similar movies, check this out!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You have no choice but to watch this.  The characters, and more importantly the actors, are phenomenal.   The story is intriguing and entertaining.    As always, I don't think there's anything wrong with a movie that's about a guy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor  is a really good, good old fashioned monster movie: lots of monsters, good actors, lots of set pieces, lots and lots of fight scenes, lots good action, lots big monsters, and a wonderful mummy, just to pick out a few from the very impressive cast of stars and supporting players.  That makes it one of the greatest monster movies that has ever been made! I'm not a huge fan of the old Universal monster movies (The Wolf Man, The Mummy, The Creature From the Black Lagoon, Frankenstein: or the Monster From the White Lagoon) but there are quite a few good examples of these monsters (especially the Wolf Man) in this film, and with good acting by the cast and the great special effects by Peter Jackson, The Evil Dead did it's job: it created a truly memorable monster movie with an original tale of a man cursed to become a mummy, and the evil that is bound to him.  The mummy and the wolf man are fantastic; the former is a very effective monster that we see from the outside, the latter is the real star.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My friends and I went on a weekend morning walk to the park and after a while one of the guys noticed a woman dressed like a vampire walking through a field (she appeared in the middle of the morning) and it was so cool. I think that the director did a good job making her a little creepy and really good looking for her age. One of the girls that we saw also looked like a young version of Lily James or something. The rest of the films are good but nothing to write home about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good movie, I was surprised to find a real story told with a real human being. There are a few parts where the film becomes boring, but that's only due to some of the other movies that were also around the same time. The story focuses on the young love affair between two students at a small college. Their lives seem to be the perfect fit, the couple are intelligent, charming and extremely charismatic. The problem is the relationship between these two girls is not very solid at all. The two are so alike in terms of style, that you can't help but compare them to each other. However, this leads to a few flaws. Firstly, I feel the character's love triangle is not realistic, as you have a young girl and young man, who both have to put up a front to a society who finds these types of stories unappealing and childish. Their relationship does come across as the stereotypical "love triangle" (one girl/one boy) where both of them feel a lot of jealousy towards one another, but still, there is only a few incidents and nothing much happens to this relationship. The film does show that the characters and their relationship do have some sort of love, but this does not develop over the course of the film. This love is still very innocent and naive. Secondly, some of this film's charm is lost when it shifts to the more serious areas, such as the school, and the relationship of the boys and the girls. The way this film presents these serious moments is interesting and it's very interesting to see the tension of a relationship between a male and female student at a school at the beginning. The relationship does not really change throughout the film, and this is why I like the film so much. It shows some real life situations and it shows the life of a couple. It is very hard to watch this movie because of some of these problems, however, the film does an amazing job of showing life in its different forms, and it does an extremely good job showing the emotions of the characters, and especially those of the couple. This movie can bring people together just from their similarities in style, personalities and experiences, which is very important to see in a movie at a young age.

We learn that there really is a reason to keep on living." -- Robert Downey Jr   5.5/10 stars on Rotten Tomatoes
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ It's a very strange thing to experience with a documentary called Black Water. It's not an odd thing because it's strange enough to warrant a closer look, and then to see all the way through some really beautiful landscapes and then have a very peculiar ending that doesn't feel like something a filmmaker would come up with, so I was intrigued and then a bit frightened, because I was really hoping that this film would have the kind of story that would stick in the mind, the kind that makes you keep going to see more. What the film does is make you think about the film in an entirely different way, something different than it's already-conquering director, the one who's also a bit of a filmmaker who made the similarly successful (for most people) The Searchers back in 1965, as if Black Water was the first film he ever directed. A great actor like John Cassavetes was cast, because John Cassovete is, as a writer, an actor with all his strengths - he's good, but not great. He's certainly not someone who is going to make a star out of a film like Black Water, but John Cassivete comes pretty close. Cassivette has this amazing, haunting, and eerily beautiful way of working, but that doesn?t mean he?s going to be able to get his way as many times as John Cassvete, which I suppose has to be something to be expected considering the films he?ve been involved in. I don't think it's possible to describe Black Water without using one of those expressions used by writers like Faulkner - 'it is not a lie, it is truth.' It is a film about what lies behind a curtain or between the sheets as we?d like to think, but it?s really not. It?s a film that shows us what lies within the very core of a person's heart. It shows us the very heart of what makes people?s lives a little harder. But to me, there?s nothing shocking or shockingly bad about Black Water at all. In fact I would go so far as to say it? has more in common with John Cassurette?s earlier works than he would have with the more mature films he made in the early seventies, and in that I mean it really shows the very deepest, darkest, and very, very raw truth about our hearts. The only thing about BlackWater

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think you have to admit that the main character is completely unlikable, because his entire life he's been a bad egg (a kid who doesn't listen to anyone - always getting into trouble). There are many minor characters in this movie, like a young girl who has an extremely hard time adjusting to the new social structure of the new town. But, the movie, in many ways, seems so shallow and in the end the kid just turns out to be the worst thing ever. The best parts in the movie are just a bunch of bad people acting bad. But at least the end is a happy one, though not completely happy as a kid would want: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie because I know how to write a good ending to a bad movie. I would like to point out a few things which could have been done better. First and foremost is the fact that this movie should not have been made by the original director, a guy named Rennie Davis. It was an amazing remake of the 1950 film, I saw it when I was 10 or 12 and I loved it then and I love it even more today. The original film was a classic and it is still great. I don't care who made this remake, there are lots of people better than Rennies Davis. I guess this was his swan song. Second it is really sad that this is the end of this franchise. They just keep coming up with a movie that is a complete mess of an idea. It is so bad that I do not even feel sad. I am glad they did the remake of The Magnificent Seven because it is better than this movie. If you don't know that movie or a sequel to it, I will try and make this as brief as possible. This is the movie "Magnificent Seven" as it is best known. It stars a bunch of cowboys in the American west in the late 1800's. They are hired to protect an Apache Chief who was captured by the Comanches, Indians who live on the plains. The Apache chief is shot in the foot and his people take him prisoner. All the cowboys think that the Apache Chief is a great man but they don't realize that he is a very dangerous man who likes to kill women, children, and old men. They don't really know that there is a bounty on his head so they go to a town to meet the town sheriff. It turns out that the town is full of Comanches. Everyone, from the town chief to the sheriff are Comanches who are hunting the Apache. There is a fight between the Apache and the Comanhs and it all comes down to a few shots that miss their mark. The town chief decides to take the Apache prisoner to get the bounty on him. The bounty hunter, Wyatt Earp, the Sheriff, and the seven other men are captured by Comanche Chief Crazy Horse and are forced to kill their friends, even each other. It isn't very nice of them. It all comes to a head when Wyatt EarP is killed. This movie is so full of stupid stupid stupid scenes and bad acting, that it makes
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie opens with a brief scene of the two men talking and exchanging pleasantries.  They seem to be friends but the relationship is superficial.   That isn't to say the movie isn't good - it's just good for a scene in a movie.  But as the scene progresses, you see their relationship grows to an extent that is genuinely touching and I appreciated the way it was done.  There was a time when I was a teenage boy and I couldn't understand why the guy didn't like the guy and yet they couldn't be friends as well.  The guy was good looking enough to be like a boyfriend but the girl was pretty to look at and was a bit too young to be a girlfriend.    That's because she was from a small town but she was very shy and not the most outgoing girl in the area but she still had her beauty.  That girl was married to a man who used her for sex and the guy, for the most part, didn't think it was anything special.  He thought she was a good looking girl but that was about it.  When he noticed that this woman was married, he thought it wasn't a good idea to take advantage of her.  She was a girl who really liked sex and had no problems getting it if she wanted it. But he didn't.  I guess that's why he married her when he did.  At the end, when the man finds out that he is going to die after an operation, he says, "I didn't know you were a gay man" to the man who was the guy's lover, but then he quickly changes the subject to the woman.    I enjoyed seeing the two people get to know each other and learn about the other and I thought it was really cute that they did that.  This story was really a comedy.  It really got a laugh from the audience but they laughed at the couple instead of them.  The movie had a lot of characters but they all served a purpose, or did they?  The guys had very little to do, not the least of which was the fact that they were on a date but the story had a purpose.  They didn't have the most interesting life but they had enough to make it worthwhile and enjoyable for the viewer.  Everyone you had in the movie played a purpose - from the person who brought up a lot to the other man who made him feel useful
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved watching this movie.   It wasn't an original idea, but it was definitely the most unique, well-made and interesting movie i've seen.  They don't show what they plan to do until the beginning of the movie. The movie was made like a documentary about what it would take to make a space station or space station.  The movie is a great example that it is not so easy to make money in space.  I am looking forward to the sequel  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was very funny at points, with a very well balanced story about an average high school girl who tries to fit in at a popular school, where girls usually don't have to worry about being unpopular or being mocked for their appearance, and who happens to be a nerd. It had some very funny dialog. The characters were just as fun to be around. I also enjoyed the fact that the movie had so many girls around, because the fact was that at this point in time, even the girls didn't talk like the guys, at least, not in high school. It was funny to see the nerd-girl getting ridiculed in her class, only to turn out to be an intellectual and well meaning young lady who had to deal with the pressures of being a high school junior.  I really enjoyed this movie, and I really hope it gets the recognition it deserves.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight Rises is a pretty amazing movie, which is about Batman being an immortal immortal, fighting bad guys. And also there is like a bunch of people, but they're all not bad guys, they're not bad at all and it's a pretty good movie, it also takes a few liberties with Batman's origin, but overall a really good movie. Plot-wise, The Dark Knight comes right before the very first Batman movie. In the movie Batman has to fight a bunch of super villains, and also his own uncle. And they're pretty much the same villains. They're super villains. The second movie is much more of a Batman movie, but it's not a direct continuation of the first movie. It's a little bit too dark for my taste, but I'm a big fan of Tim Burton. It might be a little more of the Dark Knight, I'm not too sure, but for the time being it's pretty good. And it does take a few leaps and jumps over a few rules to make it work, but you get the point. For my money, it's better than the last two Batman movies. That's all I have to say. The Dark Knights Rises- 4/5

The reason is that there is not much nudity and the movie has a good pace and some great moments, it's the best sex scene in history.  I wish there was a little more action, but this is the best fucking movie.

I also liked how the story was very different from the typical anime.  It was very funny, with the MCs always trying to make the best of situations and their own lives. I loved how the MC's would end up being a part of a group of criminals and how there were a lot of twists and turns. The music was great and this movie made me realize that most anime aren't as good as they think they are.  This movie will blow you away, especially if you are a fan of action movies. Highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Secret in Their Eyes' is a very interesting movie. When I first read the description for this movie I wasn't sure if it had anything to do with a film starring the great Cary Grant. Cary Grant in The Shining  is a bit different when compared to other movie roles he played, he's a bit more of a character than that and he's certainly a good actor. What really stood out about The Secret in their Eyes  was the fact that it was shot on location at a church in North Carolina.  The film is called The Secret and it is about a pastor, Jack O'Neill, who is forced to confront the truth about his past after he finds out that a murder victim who just came out of a mental institution had an affair with his wife.  The Reverend Jack OʼNeill was a man who loved his church and its people. He did everything he could to help them. Then one night when he was out on the church grounds, he was killed by a mysterious assailant.   He was the kind of guy who would just walk into a church, sit in the front pew and talk to people until the congregation was at full capacity.  The only other time he would do that would be if the congregation had a special meeting. But when they didn't, he just walked out without a word.  His death wasn't just a tragedy to him and his family, but it also haunted him throughout his life. He'd had visions of the man who took his life in the church, but he had no idea that he was the killer. He was only recently convinced when he started to look into the church finances when he found a list of people who had a close relationship with Jack O.  Jack's church is small and he was unable to raise the money necessary to keep it running. So now, his congregation is left with the task of finding new members. One of those members is the pastor's son Jack, who was not interested in church.  But a woman who knows him best, a nun named Annie comes to the church to help out with the funds.  Jack and Annie were great friends growing up, but they didnʼt know each other very well when Annie left him for his boyfriend.  They had only been dating for a few months at that point. When she left, Jack told her that he needed to focus on himself.  When he and Annie started dating again, Jack
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Gatsby is a movie that never fails to keep me riveted, whether I'm thinking about the way F. Scott Fitzgerald's "grand dame" of a wife falls in love with Nick Carraway, the raving jazz musician and his wayward wife, or his self-destructive descent into alcoholism.  I also enjoyed the movie because I was amused by the way it was a rehash of Fitzgerald's earlier tales, such as Tender Is The Night  and The Wonderful Wizard Of Odd Tales.  This being a movie about a drunken man's journey through the East End, and Nick's encounter with some "souls" of the "magnificent" and "possessed" ladies, there's always been something a little supernatural about them.    In other words, this movie's a romp in the woods.  It's a film for the young, the old, men and women.  I never understood why everyone who had anything nice to say about the movie was so mean to it.  For that matter, I didn't understand why it received such good reviews when it was released in 1939.  People should just enjoy a good read and not take it seriously.  What's the point of being funny and funny only when it's funny and not funny when it isn't funny?   The movie starts out with a man coming up from the sea in a ship from Europe that he claims is cursed.  Nick Carrion, played by Charles Laughton, meets a man named Sam, a former circus performer and now a writer and artist,  who is so impressed with Nick's wit and wisdom that he invites him to work for him at his newspaper.  Sam tells Nick that his wife and child drowned in the wreck of a ship called the Empress.  But as Nick gets to know him, he learns that Sam's past is nothing if not interesting, and even some of his life seems to have a little extra magic about it. I never thought I'd find any good stories to be told in a film about a boat that capsizes, but the best one in The Great Gatby is that it does contain an episode or two involving the supernatural.  When Sam's ship has capsized and the passengers are rescued, there is no dead body in a casket or any sign of an explosion, but what there is indicates that a terrible calamity has occurred aboard.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In all honesty, I thought that the whole movie was pretty good.  The story is pretty simple; a group of soldiers are fighting a big war.  After a few days of hard fighting, they finally succeed in taking the city of Pancho.  Unfortunately, there's a big fire in Panchos old castle that kills many of the soldiers.  In the aftermath of the fire a man named Vito (played by Richard Dreyfuss ) is captured by the Aztecs while trying to cross the river on the second day of the fighting.  Vito was one of the last survivors, and was being held prisoner in Pancasila's prison (the name of the Aztec king who was imprisoned by the Mexicans).  Eventually the Aztlan ruler gets fed up with Vito, and throws him in jail (which is the Aztdalian equivalent of the cellblock).  The Aztecos decide to make Vito into a sacrifice to help them win the war.  Vito's cell, a prison inside a jail. When they try to get him out, the Aztkalans torture Vito for a long time, until eventually the Aztlans give in and let him go.  But that's not the end of Vito's story.  When he gets out of the prison he hears rumors that there's still another battle going on, and that the Aztzalans are in trouble.  I found myself kind of disappointed when the movie showed Vito heading off to Panchocasila, since I knew that there would be a long battle with the Aztekalans.  Instead we find out a bit later that the battle was over in a matter of days and the Aztials lost.  There's not much reason for Vito to be fighting, so we're just left to hope that the last battle was a success and that Vito can somehow help the Azkals win the fight against the Azttalan empire.   A soldier is wounded.  The Aztecan battle is over in less than a day. So what happened in this movie?  There were a lot of scenes that looked pretty cool: soldiers marching out onto the field, people in Aztec costumes, an Aztec queen being executed, Aztalan war elephants, etc.  All things that might impress the younger, more impressionable viewer, and it shows in the production values.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You may think a comedy with the title of "Trouble with Babes" might not sound very interesting or appealing. I didn't find it to be that bad or even very funny at times. But it was a lot better than most TV shows which try to be funny. You've got to admit that at times it is funny. But mostly I found it annoying. This is a comedy that has its faults. But, it was so entertaining to see all the girls in the park who always find themselves in trouble with each other. The first thing you will see is that the female park employees are as dull as they can be. And yet, they seem to be quite capable of doing the best job they can.   I thought that one of the park girls should have been given a little more screen time. There are so many of them and yet they never really get a chance to shine. Their appearances in the show are usually quite brief and then they go off in different directions. The most memorable scene is when one of them, Miss Binta (Jodie Foster), tries to go to a nearby park and is told by her mother she shouldn't because it is full of men. Miss BInta is about 13 or 14 years old and her mother insists that she stay at home but Miss B inta's mother says she can go to the park with her because she would like to try some of the new toys they are running around the playground with.  And that's the end of "Babes in the Wood".   It was all too long and rather repetitive. The show was pretty short so you really can't watch it too many times. And if you do watch it, you will end up watching it twice because I had to watch it again and again. There is no reason at all to watch this. You can get a lot of TV shows for free or even for very little money on a monthly basis or even a weekly basis. This was way overpriced and you can easily find so many other shows to watch online.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Worth a look!" I am not sure I would rate a movie like this any higher than a "C", but I think that is because I found it a bit confusing and not in the best way. I thought I had seen it all with the "Gothic Horror" genre but "The Ghost Masker" did not disappoint me. It is a film which is just a nice watch, but as it is not a traditional horror movie, you have to look at it in a new way. There is a lot of blood, but it is also a bit slow, not that it does not look good, it does. The acting in this one is pretty good, but I still feel that most of the "Horror" movies that are made these days are so slow paced and not so original that they are more of a novelty in our lives than anything else. I really think that if you are a fan of classic films such as "The Ring" or "House of Wax", then you should give this movie a chance. 4 out of 5 stars out of five. The story is the obvious "Horrors" story with a little twist at the end. There are also two endings to it (the third one I guess). I guess that this movie will give some enjoyment to all "HorROR" fans. I recommend it to every horror fan.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to admit, I never did like "Puppeteer". It was a very bland, not very funny and not very well acted movie.  I really didn't like the acting and I found it quite dull and unexciting. I guess we have all seen enough comedies and action flicks.   But this is not one of them.  I found the movie very funny, even with the dialogue, and it seemed to be very well made. It has that kind of movie that you just can't help laughing at in every scene. I mean this is just a movie made to get out a rating so the rating would be "R" or whatever the rating is that is used in those days, which would mean this must have been very low budget. It did not look like an action flick at all and that really did not matter to me. This is what I think I liked:  - The acting was quite good and it was well acted - It has a great story and it's not too bad, but a little long -  There is a great action scene at the end which is a lot of fun    Now some will say this is what it's about.  Well, it isn't, but I did like it anyway. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is like a great movie with a bad ending.  The plot is not much, but its interesting the way everything is explained, including the whole thing about the man, and his family.  It is like it took 20 years to make this movie because it starts out like a good horror movie until the end.  This is a great film to watch, especially on Halloween, and as long as your not a scary person, it will make you feel as if you are really there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It seems to me that for many of you this is the fourth time I read about the story of John Hinckley.   He is a rich socialite, a very big shot, a socialite who happens to be a killer.  He has a lot to do to live up to his name.  Unfortunately it is not all that the man is about. In spite of his good looks, his wealth and his ability to get what he wants, he is not a terribly good person. His first big hit as a political politician was to kill a woman, a former White House employee who had criticized Hincky while in office.  It is not the first time Hinckly has done this and he may even have had a part to play in killing her, but she was a good employee who got a divorce and decided to go after his money. She found out that he had an interest in his neighbors life. She is the kind of woman who is willing to make him go to the end of the earth for something he didn't give her the chance to do. It is almost as if Hinckled was a womanizer, except that he is the only man to have committed such a crime.  Hincklley is the man that tries to have his revenge on the president he once hated as a student. The fact that he was the first man to shoot the president was of no consequence.  The only thing that matters is that Hinckling was in love with a woman and that he has some sort of vendetta against her. That was what he did not know when he went to his first job as a movie producer. He got his chance to put himself in the spotlight but he did it poorly and lost his position with the president.  But Hinckler never does forget who is more important and is not going to let it go to waste.  This film tells the story about a man who tries to accomplish his goals by whatever means necessary. He gets involved in all sorts of problems and situations from which he does not emerge unscathed. But he is a man with a heart and he knows he can't let that be the only thing keeping him from achieving his goals. This was a great movie for all that it tells the true story about Hincklly and it is very funny and well acted. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to add something to the comment about the good writing. The writing is clear and easy to follow. There is no bad side to the story (the good one - that is). It is a story that needs a short story or a novel to fully understand.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first encounter with this movie was a bit disappointing. It's one of those films in which everything is pretty much the same: a bunch of guys who like to drive around a city. I don't think I've ever seen a film that didn't feel like a low-budget video game, even though the actors were all decent and a lot of the music was pretty much inoffensive.  I mean, I get that they have to have something to stand up to in this film, like a bad movie needs to have some good action sequences or something, but honestly, it wasn't enough to really make me pay attention.    What impressed me most about this film was how well it acted. The characters were all quite likeable: I guess I liked seeing the guys try to make a fast buck off the girls in their midst.  The sex scenes were pretty much what they were in the trailers.      I enjoyed the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that the kids of the 80's will remember for their teenage years. The movie is set in a futuristic setting, as part of the future. It features a young lady who is a rebel against society and society's attitudes. She has a very good reason to do this and she does it with an ease that makes her character believable. I felt sorry for her when she learns of her mother's death and then her sister's. But they had to make her do this with no reason and only because they thought she could never live her life as she wanted. The film is not very interesting and has some good ideas but it is not as good as it could be. Overall:  I rated this film a good 2.8/5 stars.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie that is more than worth your time to watch. It is a story that tells the whole story of a young lady who went to the wrong place by accident, but that didn't stop her from becoming a good person.  The film has all the charm that makes you feel for that poor girl and her family.    "A good movie", and a nice one at that!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched this movie about 15 times. Each time I felt that I had seen a more intense, more frightening, and more painful movie. However, it was a "good" horror movie. As such I give it a B grade. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am writing this review from behind a screen, with my mouth full of popcorn, while watching a movie I liked a lot. The movie's theme, as I've explained a few times, is a cross between The Wizard of Oz and a classic western, the kind of film that most people associate with the Wild West. We're talking about a town where most people are cowboys and Indians, there's a huge gold mine, the old timers who own the place have a few problems to deal with, a bounty hunter is sent out to capture a bounty. As the bounty hunter, a big, ugly, bald man with a big bow and a bad attitude comes out of the bush with a white skinned Apache woman (a woman like me, but less funny) and a bunch of other Indians. He takes off with the bounty, with the help of the bounty hunters' friend and a guy who turns out to be his wife's brother. There's a bunch a crazy cowboys, Indians, and gold miners who all think the bounty is an ancient artifact that must be recovered before it's too late. A bunch of crazy women and an Indian shaman who is more of a bawdy joke than anything else. And a bunch (I think about three) men who want nothing to do with the whole mess, other than to kill the bounty. There are some interesting characters, as well as the fact that the movie doesn't bother to explain the meaning of the "T" in "Candyland" and that the bounty man doesn't understand it either. In fact I'm not sure if the bounty was supposed to be a piece of an artifact, a clue to some hidden treasure, something to be "tracked down," or to make him a richer man, if it even was a thing that could be tracked down, since the "curse" is so strong, they say. I think you get the idea from the movie. As a fun adventure movie, and I think it is one to watch if you're in the mood for one, and as an early Western movie that shows a strong understanding of the way the Old West actually worked, I think the movie is quite enjoyable. It may not be the most original or sophisticated idea in the world, but it's an interesting enough idea, and it does try to tackle the "Curse of the Candyland" in a sensible way. It also has a couple of interesting action sequences that I remember (one involving

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most interesting science fiction movie I have seen since 'Star Trek: Insurrection' was made. It has a great story and characters, but is in reality a horror/sci-fi. It is a bit hard to see the movie through the movie, as it starts with one thing, then quickly goes to something else. I didn't get into the story very fast until about 10 minutes in, but after a while I was hooked. The only reason I wouldn't rate it 5 stars is the acting (I don't know what to make of their acting since it wasn't that great). But overall a very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film stars Gary Farmer ( The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension ) as Bill Latham, a police officer who is on assignment in the small town of New York. Bill's wife, Marla ( Anne Rice ), has just become infatuated with his partner, Lt. John Latham ( Chris Kattan ), a very competent, hard-drinking ex-Navy man. Bill has a little secret that he needs to get out. It involves a murder in the distant future. It seems like the murders are becoming more frequent, and the people responsible have the ability to time travel. The case of Latham's murder is that he doesn't remember getting off duty at the time. The people that he's talking to don't even know he worked that night. And he's been seeing a therapist in the past 24 hours! Latham decides to work the case himself, although he has a lot to prove. Bill thinks he has it all figured out, but his past comes back to him and forces him to act quickly.   There's a little story here about the police officer's wife going out with her boyfriend. It's been a while since a woman has had that kind of sex in a police movie. I loved it! This movie has a sense of humor! I thought it was a little slow. Bill Loha got a little too much screen time at first. I thought the audience could tell that Bill was in love with his wife.  But then the story takes a turn into a new direction when Latham has an idea that has to come out. The film is a bit cheesy at times, but the script and acting makes it work. There are some nice action scenes, and a good ending!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't normally give stars, I usually give five, but this one was different. I loved this movie and its message was very powerful. I thought he was very funny and likable in this film, I also like that he has a really bad ass attitude and doesn't care about his life and doesn in fact get into all sorts of trouble while on the job.   So in short I would say this is a good comedy, good acting, and a good message. I just wish I could have had the chance to make it all the way through the whole thing and I would have rated the whole movie 5 stars but I guess it doesn't really matter as it was all funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ My first foray into animation, as this film was shown by the San Diego State Film Society. In the middle of the night one night in California, a lonely old lady moves into a house with her grandson and two dogs. The house is on the beach and the old lady has been dying of a broken heart for so long it has left her emaciated, thin and sick looking. She has a lot of stories to tell about that life, but for some reason she keeps it all to herself. Now, the grandson has been born with a heart ailment and she desperately wants to find out what's wrong with him. All she wants is for someone to love and protect her. She's determined to find that someone and I really liked this. A few laughs, an awful amount of tension and the girl getting better was worth it. If you think about it all there is so much story to tell and a beautiful story of a girl who's searching for a family she's been so lost from all of her life. And at the end we get to see her find it in the end and in this I really believe that it's a really beautiful piece of film making. The sound was good and the animation, although primitive was really quite good at times and the ending was well done. It really wasn't bad, it just wasn't quite good enough. The movie may be about an old woman who's been in hiding from her heartache all her life, and how much it has hurt her to be so alone, but there are so many things about the old woman that just didn't seem to make any sense. But she's trying to tell the story of her old life to someone who will love her, and help her to get a chance to get back on her feet, so I really did like that character. I liked the ending well enough, and the story was good as it goes into her life in the future. I felt that a few things could have been tightened up and made that last scene more poignant, but overall I'm just glad it came out as it did, though I wouldn't want to see a sequel or any sequel to it because it would have felt like a waste.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A story of romance and war told in three acts by a French actor, Claude Rains, who at the same time is at the forefront of a new wave of young film-makers whose work was to be more or less a direct continuation of Rains'own, or at least a more serious one, since it was his first professional picture, and also one that was to a large extent a direct adaptation of a classic novel. Rains had already acted in three short films at the age of 15, but had taken no directing course, and he does not seem to have known any of his leading characters, except maybe for the two young girls, and one of them, in a rather crude way. Rames, the elder of the girls, is a girl, too, but a pretty good one, with a good figure and a rather more natural and tender manner than her brothers. The two older brothers, in contrast, are quite an ugly set of men, but their older sister, the sister of their best friend, the "Diana," who is the one girl in the picture, is not so bad looking but is too innocent for the kind of films she is expected to do. This one is a rather short picture, but it does contain some fine scenes, and there are several, which are of the most exciting kind; all the action is done by small hand-cams, which give a feeling of what would be like if the cameramen had used electric lights rather than the old-fashioned film-glasses. It is a very exciting picture, full of action, a good story, and a little racy.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found "The Wicker Man" to be one of the most disturbing films I have seen in a while.   This film is about an old man who has become an undead being who kills, and eats children for food.  It is really messed up and creepy at the same time.  This is a great film, you can see how different things would be if it were made at that time period.  At a time when people were being killed all over the place, people were still living in those times.   The Wicket Man, The Old Man's Grave The Witch and The White Lady
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Hitchcock" is a brilliant movie that will stand the test of time with a few improvements.   The plot of the movie is quite simple.  It starts off with an ordinary suburban home invasion.  There is a house owner who is a good old man but is not exactly popular as all of the other people in his town.  One day a man enters his yard wearing a disguise which is very well executed.  The man says that his name is Jack (who seems a bit odd), and he has come to steal his wife (who obviously isn't the owner's wife) and his baby.  To get past his front gate Jack puts a gun in the wife's mouth and then the baby's mouth.  And here's the point in the movie.  As long as the movie holds the audience in its spell, the film is going to be great.  In terms of acting and directing this is a superb film.  A young James Stewart is wonderful as the sheriff who has been living his life as the good guy ever since he joined the sheriff's department.  Dick Powell is wonderful in the lead role as Jack.  Jack is an easy target and he is not above taking a few shots at people's property when they seem to be bothering him.  He really has no fear or self respect.  When he sees a man (Homer) who he suspects to be stealing from him he takes him outside and the next shot we see is a shot through his head, killing him instantly.  This is one of my favorite scenes in any movie.

I just finished my second watch a few days ago and the movie is still as good as it was the day I watched it. A great time to sit around a campfire and watch a camp movie. This was a good, simple story about two friends who become very good friends. They get separated, but never give up on one another. I had a great time watching this film. It had a wonderful cast, and a wonderful story, which just kept me hanging on the edge of my seat.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â I knew I wanted to see The Last Unicorn when the movie poster was posted on my wall. When my dad came home I said, "Hey dad! It looks great! You like it?" and he said, with a look of horror, "Well, it's very cute. But I thought it looked like a unicorn with a horn." I said with a smile, "Yeah, I think it is. I mean, unicorns don't have horns. And they don't wear dresses, do they?" and his eyes widened. "Well...I guess you could...but I don't want to...I mean..." I said. After talking with him a bit I told him to turn on the TV, and watch the movie. At that moment I saw unicorns everywhere. It looked like some of the horses had been dressed in those dresses from the movie, only the dresses were black. The first horse was wearing a long red velvet dress, while the second horse had a long yellow one that had flowers in them. The other horse was all dressed up and wearing a pink velvet coat over her black velvet dress with green flowers on it. The third horse was a white horse, wearing a blue velvet dress. Â These unicorns were riding on the backs of a red and yellow Pegasus, and the Pegasus was flying with a little white rabbit.  When I saw this movie in movie theaters the first time, the first thing I thought about was how wonderful it was to see a unicorn and Pegasus together.    The only thing worse than seeing something that looks like it should be real but it is not was seeing the movie before I saw the movie as I am writing this review.  It was one of those movies like Star Wars or Jaws that you never knew what to expect. You never really thought about it. You just felt it.  In fact I never did really like The Last Unicorns.  I mean you can't really explain that feeling when you see something that doesn't really feel real, and I guess I wasn't alone.  The Last Rainbow was a little better, but still the same movie with the same ideas and the same style.  Even though the movie was good it still left a little to be desired.  This movie was a bit more realistic, but there was just nothing that made me go to see it again, not even the ending.

It's like the movie is calling to me at every opportunity it gets. I know it's cliché to love a good romantic comedy but in this case I'd recommend to every one to watch this movie. I loved the story from the first scenes all the way to the last. It had all that is good about a romance movie: cute characters, heartwarming moments, great comedy scenes...I loved it all. It was like a real romance with very subtle hints that it's a parody but I still loved it. It is full of love, love, and a little sadness all of which are well played by the actresses. It made me happy even though I knew it was a parody. I really feel like I don't know anyone who wouldn't like this movie as much as I do. It would make anyone happy to see a good story like this made for a good comedy movie. A great movie all in all.

"Duck Soup" is a good old duck soup that makes one think of a good soup of the 1950s. This is a wonderful family film with strong stories about the characters and the characters' problems. It is a fun little movie. I give it a very generous rating of 8 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is an incredible film, full of wonderful imagery, one of the great gangster movies.  Buck stops in a bar when a bunch of crooks start breaking into it.    He goes into the room (with the rest of the gang) and makes an enemy of the Big Lebenke.  The rest of Lebron and crew (including Walter) are waiting outside with some of the girls, so when they're all together they have a little fun.  In the scene where one of those guys tries to take the bag full of money out of Lebenken's hand, you realize how ridiculous their situation is.  Lebson even makes the guys in a group of eight laugh with his little jokes.  It's great to watch.  There's not really any scenes that are really important, but the dialogue really makes them interesting.  And the music and the visuals are just perfect.  If you're a fan of the movie, get it. You won't be disappointed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm very pleased with the overall quality of this movie. I can't say anything bad about this.  The plot is simple; a family has just moved into a new house, and the mother and father don't like each other so the father gets very angry.  I have never seen such a sweet movie, and this is one of my favorite movies of all time.  A film like this is very interesting.  The acting, and music is just perfect for this movie, all the actors and actresses just gave such great performances, and in particular, the mom who is a perfect match for the angry husband.  This film has everything I love, it is very funny, the acting is perfect, the comedy is great, the drama is good, and it has a really great ending.   So if you are looking for a comedy that you can put on as background noise in your living room, then this is the one for you! 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ This film is a real gem with a fantastic script. This film really shows how evil the mafia are and their cruelty towards women. It really highlights the horror that is the Mafia and the people who support them. The film follows two female reporters at a Mafia-owned news publication. The reporter is on a story about the murders and kidnappings of young girls. When the reporter is about to publish the story, she meets a very troubled girl who has been kidnapped and is being held in the Mafia's house. Her parents want nothing more then to be rid of the child and the reporter goes to investigate and find out who is responsible. She finds an old man who has a very strange and very evil look in his eye when she asks him if he is responsible for the kidnappings. ______________________________ A masterpiece!  Rated 3 out of 5 _________________________________________ This film doesn't need much explaining. A good man who is a victim of the Mafia decides to do something to stop them. He decides to hire a girl to do his dirty work for him. Unfortunately, things don't go well and it turns into a very hard film to watch. The ending is a complete shocker for me. I hope that the makers don't release the film without a running commentary to go along with it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's some real acting in here... it's really funny when the kids try to outsmart their teacher (with help from their friends) and then try to impress her with the fact that they are all black and play "jive" and "hooke" at the same time.   This is the second film I've seen that takes place in the 1800s (the other being 'Spartacus'  which is a lot better), so I'll say that I enjoy historical epics, though I have a pretty low tolerance for overly long films that are mostly made up of "historical events" in a row.  Still, this movie has a lot of history to work with, and as the kids in the movie (and the others on the show) are trying to win the school (and their friendship) and get back to school with a certain someone they're supposed to stay, it's entertaining enough that you want to keep watching.

The story is very well paced and the humor is a lot of fun. This movie might just be the best political satire movie ever made. It is well-done and is full of original thought and interesting ideas and some good laughs. I am a fan of political comedy and this film is well worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When we're watching a film with two guys, it's the classic scenario: One, the more intelligent of the two, decides to join his partner in a serious attempt to locate a missing girl: a beautiful girl known only as the "Angel of Death". The movie isn't a particularly good film: in fact, there's little of interest to it. However, there is a strange sense of humour which is not to everyone's taste: there are many jokes which are too obvious to be funny, while others fall flat. It is, however, a decent enough film. It's worth watching if you love movies like 'Tombstone' (1972) or 'The Exorcist' (1973), and also if you have any interest in the supernatural: this is definitely not for the weak-hearted. It may not hold a candle to the other films it is named after, however.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a nice movie that I thought about a lot while I was trying to sleep. The movie was like a "Nightcrawler" with a good story and a cool soundtrack. You can't beat this for action. I recommend this one and a second movie of this same star and genre.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â This is a great comedy, and it was well directed. It is about an all-male baseball team in a small town who goes out to play one night and has an encounter with a woman who was walking home from a bar. Â They spend the night together, having sex on the couch.  The next morning we find out that she is a nurse and the reason she wanted to go out is to play a game called golf with the team.    This is the best of the bunch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The End of the World"   is a film that is about a human life that is threatened by an asteroid, a small world that's about to collide with Earth and wipe out the human race. The story is told from the point of view of a man named Richard, who has been hired by an agency to find out if his wife is a virgin. The reason for his investigation, is to find a way to save humanity from a horrible disaster that will wipe out all human life. It's an interesting look into a future that's just on the verge of taking place, and if they manage to prevent that, the future can still be very interesting to say the least.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a movie! My wife and I watched this movie about two days ago at our local Cineplex which is one of the few decent Cineplas in town. It's a good, old school, western, with a strong, original character-driven story and a great ensemble cast including the ever reliable John Carradine as the bad-assed lead.  It's not a perfect movie, but it's a very good one.  And I loved it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first two or three minutes are good, but then the movie starts getting really strange. I couldn't figure out why this man was talking to the dog or even how they got in here. They even have a bunch of weird robots and I'm not sure I want them around me. Then there's the alien that looks like something out of a bad cartoon. It didn't seem so frightening to me once the movie slowed down a bit, but it didn't help. It definitely wasn't a movie for kids.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'll give the movie a C+, I didn't like this book to begin with, and it was pretty hard to get past its pretension. A lot of the writing is very dry and uninspiring. The characters are so small-minded (and sometimes stupid) that they're no fun to read about, but they are also so unlikeable that it's hard to really care about them. (I mean, I like to root for the underdog, but I still don't feel for most of these characters.) In the end, this movie feels like it's really trying to be a good book. It tries to be witty, and clever, and entertaining. But it just doesn't get there. It's a fun read for the sake of it. I like a good comedy, but this was just not good enough. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of those classics that are still held together with a thread by a string. One of the best westerns that we have had in a very long time, with wonderful performances by the lead actors, John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. There is a lot to like about this, particularly the scene where the gunfights occur at night and Wayne, at one point, says to his character, "It's about a man who does a bad thing, has done a bad act and is trying to live with it." It does make for a funny and fast paced film, with a lot of action and some very interesting ideas about America at the turn of the century. I've read a lot about the film, which has been quite a chore to get through, but it is one of the most enjoyable action pictures that I've seen in a long time. A very nice film. -- Tom Smith, June 22, 2003

And that's just what the world does today, except the world is the United States. This movie reminds me of that scene in Jaws where they are looking for the killer on the back of the fishing boat. The great thing about this film is that it is really not about the United states, it is about the family and the values which they hold on to. My heart goes out to the parents of this children that they are fighting for their lives every second of every day.   I give it a B
Write a positive review about a good movie: **************** ************ ******** The first half of this movie is basically a horror film that makes very little attempts to tell a story. There are brief glimpses that appear to be about a little girl named Sophie who comes to her parents' house to stay and live with her mother. Sophie falls ill and when she goes to bed she hears strange noises and it is then that she realizes the sounds she is hearing are a demon that wants her to become a witch. It then cuts to a group of teenage girls who have to fight back the supernatural with a series of supernatural powers that come from their bodies. It is a bit strange that there is almost no dialogue in this movie and mostly it is just characters screaming and making noises. A few of the girls can even cast a spell on the demon and have it stop at the school, but when it returns the girls begin to fight. The first thing that needs to be pointed out is that the movie does a good job of using a very simple structure, in which the characters fight the bad guys by using supernatural powers and using a series to the best of their abilities. Most of the time Sophie is there to make sure the demon is stopped and to use her powers to destroy the demon, but she also wants to explore a bit. The characters that are around Sophie also seem very young and a lot of them seem to be having a good time and playing with a lot their friends. At the same time, it is clear that they are struggling to maintain the illusion that they have a normal lives, when Sophie is not around to keep them sane. There seems to be a lot more about to happen in this film so that the demon will not be defeated, but I would not like to know what this mysterious entity is and what it wants.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's one of those movies where the humor comes in the form of a bunch of people trying to make it through some extremely rough terrain, including the very un-sexy and unkempt (but still attractive) female protagonist. And yes, it's that "sexy, unkembled and un-hot" description I'm talking about. There's a lot going on here, so I'll go over all of it: There's "a girl who's a big girl." Well, "big" isn't quite the right word. Not physically, at least. No, she's more of a "slim and cute" kind of cute, at that. But "girl" is the right way of putting it: She's more than a little bit taller and fatter than anyone else around. We know this through her clothes, which she wears for a few seconds, and then just leaves hanging over the edge of the cliffs. Then she starts to get down to business, and while the film is mostly set on the island she's visiting with her brother and a bunch...well, I'll get to that later. She gets into a "relationship" with the islander, who appears to be a man, only he has a pretty good face for a woman (and a good body too, as I learned from some porn a while back). And there's a certain amount of sex going on, which I will admit to being intrigued by. It certainly didn't hurt that a lot of the time the camera was panning around, and I wasn't actually watching much (at least not that I could see), but there were a lot more "sexual references" than I'm used to seeing. This isn't the first time I've seen them in this style though; in this case, I think it was a little more deliberate. I suppose that's what you'd expect from someone who makes a living out of creating porn featuring "girl-on-girl action." The whole "seedy" theme is really something I just like to see coming out of this kind of movie. I know it's going to be tough to get it out of your head for a long time after you see it. And there are a lot to get through. There are, of course, the "horses", which, while the horses were still on the Island, had been "purchased", as I've said. I don't know if they
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Dirty Dancing" is a timeless classic and one of the greatest movies ever made.  It has a perfect balance between comedy and romance as well as action and comedy, a plot full of twists and turns but never going into farce.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My second viewing of the film.   I had the opportunity to see this in an independent film fest last fall when it was shown as an encore screening following the conclusion of a major motion picture.  It is an action movie with a sense of humor and a great plot.  There are moments of comedy.  I found it more a drama than a movie.  Like I said before, I enjoyed it, I thought the story was good.  The music is great.  Unfortunately, the actors were not as good. There are a lot of parts that need some tweaking, especially with the ending that does not work at all. I have no problem seeing the film again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen this movie before. The first time I saw it, I was in the theater, with friends. The next few times I saw, I would just stop the movie when a certain character says the movie's main plot line. I would ask my friends if they understood what was said. They would say they did not understand. After the movie was over I had a great discussion with them. I had been thinking of them all day. I finally made them see the movie again and they finally understood how important it was. I was thinking of making this my blog to show everyone I saw the movie before again and I finally realized there was no way I could do it. If anyone wants to see a movie that is fun and entertaining for all ages, this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: -------------------------- --------------- --------------- A movie I have never seen before that i love it. I also love the song "I'll Remember" --------------- ----------------- --------------- The story I love, its not so much a story as a psychological thriller about a man that lives his life with a constant fear of death. It is not a sad story, the protagonist seems to be very happy and his wife and child are well look at. It has been made to be about the fear of dying, but it also has a lot of other things to say about life. --------------- --- --------------- I also like the music. It gives you a feeling of a good film, but at the same time a little strange. The movie is all dark, very black. Very hard to watch and also hard to describe the story. ------------ -------------- What I thought of it: ------------ I thought the movie was really good. The story and all the performances were great and all things looked like they could last forever. ------------- ------------- But for some reason the story was a little bit hard to find on it. It seemed to make things very strange, with the things you would expect in a horror movie. -------------- --- -------------- I also thought the music was great and it has been a favourite of mine ever since I saw it as a child. It feels like you have been to a dark fairy land in the movie, a strange and sad one. ------------------------ --------------- Not for the little ones:   ------------------------- ------------------------ The language is not very good, but that is a real pity, I can't understand it. There is only one scene in the whole movie where people talk about sex, but this isn't really sexual. It might seem that way because of the language, but really it is about something more, about a fear of being dead. As the movie is about the horror of dying it needs some of its horror of death and death to be expressed in a good way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always liked the film, and it is great that this film is finally available in English again!    It's a classic and has a lot of good stories.    The story is told very well by the actors, the only flaws are that some of the scenes are a little boring.  It starts with a woman, a girl, named Alice who is having a lot to do on a Sunday afternoon. After the work at a house, Alice goes to a store which she has been looking forward to, the store is packed with all sorts of things. The shop owner is a good guy, he's a good friend. After getting a cup of tea he decides to help the poor woman, Alice, buy a piece of a painting on the side of her house. After Alice has gotten the painting she puts it in her cart and goes home. She sits on her bed for a long time to think about it and to think she is alone and all alone. Then she gets very annoyed and a little angry, she gets out of bed, and runs around the house, getting things off, going to the kitchen and washing the dishes, and everything like that. All this time she doesn't even think about Alice, she wants to get things clean for Alice's tea, she never thinks about Alice.  But as she does all this she comes to understand Alice a little bit more. Alice is dying in her bedroom and she wants her painting that she bought. The painting is beautiful and she's thinking she must have found her way to a house which is so rich.  This is a story with a lot in it that makes you think if it is a true story.  After all, Alice has a beautiful portrait of her mother that is of a very young girl. It is a little sad, but I think it is what she did with her mother and that is what her mother wanted. But if you go into the story and read about all the things Alice does on the day that is the day of her death and it makes you laugh at how she did things for Alice to die so quickly, and to take care of everything to make sure she has what she wanted.  The scenes of the house are nice, all of the things in the house and then the story ends very neatly.  What I loved about this is that the movie had a lot more jokes than it had action, but it was very funny.  In the end I think the
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________________ I am still at a loss about the origin of the title of this film. I have a bad feeling that somebody tried to write an allegorical story about the war, and when he realized that it would not do, he changed the story to make it so that the real war was the one fought against the Nazis. The characters in the film are very unrealistic and the director makes a big fuss about their actions. I think this was the director's attempt to get his story made. He probably got it on the order of $25,000, maybe a little more (at least the film was directed by Giorgio Papaleo, one of the more celebrated producers of the 20th century). The acting of the stars is rather amateurish, I guess because of the circumstances; it is not a great story, but it is made fun of. It is a great way to get a little money for the time spent on a film which seems to be made for a low-brow crowd.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Hearing this movie again recently and this time from a different perspective - just think the last time I saw this movie was when they were still selling the movies, and the movie is all about some children trying to escape the big monster with a little stick who keeps destroying everything they build - even though it's the kids' dream, but they need a bigger stick and a little girl to help them, so there are the two boys - that are actually twins. What a great movie - the children are fun to watch - no children are actually mean or evil. They are always good fun - you get a hint of a monster - which is not scary - but a big, scary one - a "tough guy" - who is very mean to children, and he's very destructive. It's a good old fashioned horror movie - which I can see my own children being proud to see me watching. So, if you want to see a great ghost story with the children - and lots of little kids with sticks, then this movie is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this one a lot. I loved the movie when I saw it because I'm not sure why some people didn't like it when they saw it in theaters. I thought I might hate it after I saw the trailer. Well, after seeing it on screen, I found myself liking it.   - I was shocked about how much a woman would have to carry this guy. His arms and legs are so big. So I guess that's what happens when the guy has to carry the woman around.  - The camera work is quite good and I found the story interesting.

I think this would make a great movie to watch when you're bored and you want to get off your butt and do something to pass the time. I am definitely going to go to see this movie again!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The movie is a solid action film.   The plot has a great premise: the world is being threatened by alien creatures that can take human form and eat humans and animals.  The special effects are very good.  A number of the aliens are portrayed with a variety of costumes.  This film shows a very good use of special effects.  I am also interested to see what kind of future the director thinks will come about.  But the movie just gets out of control with the sheer amount of special effect shots and the crazy and violent nature of the alien characters.  For a film like this to stand out it will have to be good with a bit of comedy and the special effects should be a very small part of the movie.  It would be best if it didn't have many special effects scenes because they don't make a big difference.  Still, the movie is very entertaining.  Recommended and fun. __________ I will look into a copy of the special edition of this film because it has all of the extra special effects, such as those done on the alien creatures and the alien mothership. ___________________ UPDATE:    I have just discovered that this film is a re-release of a movie called Alien Abduction from the U.S.A. The movie, which is about a group of people who are abducted, has a number of deleted scenes that were never shown in the movie called Aliens Abduction.  In those deleted scenes, aliens are being depicted as having different and more humanistic forms.  http://www.amazon.com/ALIEN-Abduction-U.S./dp/B000XW5JZM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of the Best A film made before the birth of film that remains relevant to our time, the first part of an epic trilogy about the war to liberate a continent from Nazi control and the ensuing horror and despair.   As such it is a film for the ages and should not be missed.     This is the ultimate "The war to end all wars" film, a film of unparalleled power and imagination that would have been the greatest blockbuster of all time if ever made.    What it is about:   In the opening scene we see the Allies making a slow, cautious advance against a column of Nazi soldiers who have blocked off the road and are encamped on the road behind.   The first two movies focused on the Allied soldiers trying to hold the front line and were largely entertaining to watch,  but this movie is all about the German forces,  with great drama and a lot of good acting.   These Germans are some of the most fascinating and dangerous villains of cinema, and I think that even those of us who were not involved with the fighting in the East of Europe might have been captivated by their behaviour.   A few years back I saw a film version of this movie and was struck by the portrayal of the German soldiers as something close to a psychopathic, sadistic, beast of a race.   You could not help but admire how they treated the civilians, and the way the prisoners and soldiers from other armies did nothing but eat each other off one another and rape each other made for an interesting, brutal, and at times thrilling film.   What it really boils down to is a simple tale of revenge and a few very simple revenge killings, and even after watching it twice I still managed to come away from this film a little angry at the lack of compassion shown on the part of the Nazi troops.   One of my favourite things about this movie was the scenes at the hospital, where the German troops treated the wounded soldiers with a much greater level of care and concern than any soldiers I have seen during the course of the war. A very special episode:   This movie does an amazing job of exploring what the war was like in the West.   Most of the people who died fighting in Italy, Greece and Yugoslavia, and who died in the final battle that eventually drove the Third Reich out of the continent are portrayed very sympathetically.   There is also a lot about the Holocaust that is presented in a very truthful and accurate

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen quite a few, including "The Great Dictator" in its early days and "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" but this is my favorite so far.  The movie is about Munchhausen, an Austrian Baron with a head full of delusions that he's actually an incredibly wealthy businessman from New York.  In the beginning of the movie, the Baron visits a friend of his named Baroness von Trattner (played by Anna Winger).  And that is a good thing, she is a charming and warm woman and, to me at least, she's the only person who really understands Munch.  They share a lovely dinner and after an evening of dancing and singing and dancing and drinking, they end up kissing and kissing and Munch decides that his feelings are stronger than his money and he runs off to the countryside and gets lost in a snow storm.  And now, that's a lot of bad news!  But not to worry, the next morning he decides to go back and search for her.  He spends the afternoon on horseback, which is quite a sight to behold for a movie about the Baron's delusional delusions.  Then he manages to find the Baroness and the two spend the morning making love, with no success.    The Baroness makes him an offer he can't refuse, he has to go on a trip to the United States in order to marry her. So he accepts and leaves for New York and to see what he can do with his wealth.  This movie is a very slow burner, it takes many hours to really understand this madman and I didn't find his motives particularly compelling or even remotely coherent.  However, Munch is really quite a charming character.  As a matter of fact, this film is probably my favorite Austrian comedy of all time.  There's much to love about the story and the movie has the makings of a great movie. The actors are all pretty good and MUNCHHUSEN certainly lives up to the Austrian stereotype as the charming and eccentric eccentric who loves to dance and sing and who is always on his way to get some money.  For a movie that is basically all about MUNCHHOUSE, it also manages to pull off a number of wacky comedy routines which makes it a must see in any comedy fan's collection.     - Rating: 4/5 from my 5-star rating system
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________________________________ I remember watching this movie when it first came out, and being so excited at the prospect of seeing a new James Bond film. I remember thinking it would be a good mix of elements from various Bond films, and the casting of Pierce Brosnan made me giddy with anticipation. When the movie was released, I realized I was wrong about it. Instead of being a strong action movie, it was more of a dull, uninspired, and repetitive movie which was at its core nothing more than a James Bond movie with a plot which was really far below the standard required by a Bond film of that caliber. I was never a fan of Brosnan's in the first place, and he was really bad in this movie. His Bond had very little charm to him. He really seemed to be acting for no reason, and this could not be helped in this picture because the script was so bad that there was little depth to the characters of both Goldfinger and the baddie, and it simply went from bad to worse. ________________________________________________________________________________________ I'll never be able to watch this movie again. _______________________________________________________________ The best James Bond: The World Is Not Enough I was always on the fence about this James Bond entry, and while I was not sure what to think of the movie, I still liked it. I had a problem with the fact that the movie focused on James Bond himself, rather than any of the other Bond girls. But I digress. The movie was great. It was great that they put in a lot of the Bond girl characters, who were not terrible by any means. And as I said before, the action was great as well. The Bond was cool, he had a lot to his character, and I thought it was a shame that there weren't more Bond girls in it. _____________________________ The second best: Diamonds Are Forever In my opinion the best Bond film is definitely Diamonds are Forever, and for reasons I'll explain below. But even if you don't like this movie, there is still one film I think will make you like it a lot better. First of all, it has the best action sequence I've ever seen in an 007 film, and if I have to say one thing about it, I guess it was the way they used the camera, which worked out a lot. _______________ You won't like Diamonds is Forever:  But at the end of the day, Diamond
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â It�s a pretty fun movie with some great visuals, though there is so much wrong with it that it is a little hard to enjoy even to a casual viewer. One of the things I hated about the movie was the fact that the lead character was always seen as a boy and never as a young man. It was the kind of guy you would like to have as a friend; tall and muscular, and not very good at sports. I was surprised how much the movie had in common with a certain show by that name, though this is pretty much a remake of the movie. So, you are watching a kid who had his brother's girlfriend killed while they were riding bikes in his home town. He has to go off and look for the killer to avenge his brother and make sure no one tries to take any of his family�s property. Unfortunately, he was unable to find the guy when he got back, and after a few more attempts at finding him, his girlfriend is murdered. What follows is a series of adventures in which he searches for the guy and tries to get it onto his conscience before he gets even more involved in the case. What makes the movie even more entertaining was when the main character was not actually the main suspect, but was just acting in a role. It�is the kind Of movie that you can play the "villain", and while it seems like there is a plot here, the plot doesn�t really work for the movie, so the character just isn�t all that good. However, the acting is pretty good at least, and the film does have a lot of good action and a nice ending. Â If you can get past the fact this movie looks like it was made up for a game show, you will get a good time, and a good story!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After the first three episodes, which take place over the span of three weeks, "The Killing Season" is a very good and very suspenseful show, with lots of twists and turns. It is also very well directed, with the same excellent lighting as "Breathless", which was also done very well, and of course, this time, the camera never stops moving, even at the most critical of moments. As it can be expected, the story unfolds much the same way as it does in "Breatho...
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! - I watched this movie with my nephew who was about 8 or 9 yrs old at the time of the premiere. He was completely blown away by the ending and was crying the entire way in. This movie has changed his whole life and made him a huge fan of the old western movies. I highly suggest this movie if you like a good western and really like the acting.!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie is a good thing. And a good film like this is one that has much to offer.  I'm always on the look out for a good "science fiction" movie and this was up there with the best I've seen in a while.   It's a decent enough movie but I felt it needed a little more time to develop and the ending was not that well done and a little too ambiguous. _________________________________________________ It's a dark film with a decent pace, interesting premise and a couple of decent performances.  ______________________________________ What can I say. I really liked this film but I thought they did it a bit wrong. I feel it didn't feel like a proper sci fi movie at all and if I remember correctly one of the characters was a vampire. I'm not sure if this was planned or just an "oops" moment.  My biggest issue with it though, was the ending.  The characters feel like they don't have a lot to give and a good third act is a must. A more "good guy" ending doesn't seem likely though. If there's one thing that makes this good science fiction it is the story and the ideas behind it but as it stands it's pretty underwhelming and a shame it couldn't have gone more to the sci fi side.  I didn't think it was that well made either, that's my biggest reason.  It's an action packed, well directed, and fun sci fi film but it didn the job I thought it would so I'll give it a 9/10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is the story of a woman from the town of Ochre who is living in a little village in the middle of France in the year 1758. A young man named Pierre meets a pretty girl who introduces herself as Sophie and asks Pierre to live with her and take a rest from his life with the rest of his relatives living in Ochres. Pierre tells Sophie that he can't stay because he doesn't like it. She says that it is the best thing she has ever seen in her life and that he doesn´t even know what kind of people are living there. However, Pierre soon finds out a lot about the town and his future. He meets people who don´t talk or move and people who are kind to him. He also meets a girl who doesn´ t talk or speak very much but she tells Pierre a lot of things about her life. Sophie's father is a very rich man in Ochees and is trying to raise an army to get rid of the French King. Sophie´s mother is an artist who wants to marry Pierre so that she can have a real marriage. The man who wants her to marry his son is a rich man with a mistress. Sophie falls in love with Pierre and tells him all about her past and future and her dreams. Pierre is a man full of life and hope. He believes he will have a good future because it is his home. As we know from the books he has come from the village of Chéziers in Ounces and now lives there and his sister Marie lives in the same village as well. However we still see Pierre with a very big house in Ochelle as well as his brother Michel.  As time passes the whole village of Ocheles gets smaller and smaller until they are nothing but a number of empty houses surrounded by woods. This is because the village has been conquered and taken over by the enemy of France. Soon the French people are forced to live in an area under siege by the Prussian army. The main area in the villages consists of a little house in the center of the village. It is made up of wooden walls and some stones on top of them, so the house is not easy to get to because of the enemy´s fortifications. Pierre and Sophie live in a small house by the side of the house for the whole time that they live there. They only go for the sake of shopping and playing the old songs that they were raised with
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie for a few reasons. First, it makes you laugh a lot. There are some great scenes in this film, and the director is excellent at making the audience laugh a great deal. Second, we have some great characters, both in the film itself and in the supporting characters. Third, this is a very unique movie. It is a classic story about the way we have to behave in order to be successful. I know that this is one of the things that many people like to complain about, and I certainly agree. It doesn't seem to me that this movie has anything of value to it. The film tells the story of an Indian girl whose brother is killed in Vietnam, and she is the only woman in the village who knows about the murder. When we meet the girl, she is already in an advanced state of alcoholism, and her alcoholic father is threatening to cut the family out of the family land. She has two younger brothers by two different fathers. Her mother is in India, working the fields, and is not able to be with her. When the war breaks out, and people begin to die, she begins to drink again, and to make excuses for her drunken behavior. The only one who is brave enough to tell her she has a problem is a British soldier who is a friend of the girl's father. The soldier takes her by the hand, takes the girl to a house where a woman is being tortured by a Chinese officer, and tells her to tell the story. The whole thing is very dark, but the movie is really fun. I didn't see the war, but I suppose that's not all that much of a problem. As far as the movie as a whole is concerned, I don't think it's bad. I think the film works because it doesn't try to be too sophisticated and complicated. All it wants to do is to tell a good, simple story. It's very much a movie for everybody, no matter what your personal taste in films is. I like war movies. I can watch them over and over again. I don"t have a special taste in them, but if I can't like a movie then I dont watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was raised in the 90's in the era of the big blockbuster, so you can imagine my excitement when I was able to see this movie.  This is a really fun movie. It is filled with a sense of humor and a good amount of action.  It also has a great soundtrack as well.  The movie is not quite a perfect movie, but it is very close.  If you are a fan of action, comedy, and romance, and you have an hour and a half to kill, then you need to watch this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is simple, it is not your standard "how a group of men meet the woman of their dreams." The film is also very unique and the story, as expected of the 80's, is a simple one. The story is about a girl named Jessica, who is about to be married to her brother, and the family is in a complete turmoil regarding the marriage. All of these factors make this movie very good and is an excellent piece of 80's cinema.  It is a good start to the year of 1990 in Japan. The movie itself has an interesting story with some suspense in the later stages. It is a bit of a romance and also a fun time-waster, although the ending of the movie is a little disappointing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to admit it - at first I felt a little bit underwhelmed when I heard about this movie. I'm from the Midwest and I remember seeing the movie in the theater when I was a kid - the movie stars Jeff Bridges, his role was small but he was a good actor, the cinematography was pretty good - there was a really good soundtrack by Tony Scott as well as some nice little details - the acting was nice; however, at the end, this really is a film about an actor. Jeff Bridges is not the best actor I've ever seen. He is, however, not a bad actor. I could say "hey, Jeff Bridges has some good moments", however, I think they are few and far between. The only reason I can think of that made me watch this film was to see Jeff Bridges as "the Dude" - I think that was the only reason this movie is worth watching. (For more information on the Dude see http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0045300 )   The movie has a really strong narrative but it's very obvious that it will never work. It's all about Jeff Bridges playing a role in this ridiculous "film" and no actor is given much room to play. The characters are very one dimensional, you can't sympathize with their problems. I have a very hard time watching this movie because I know it is going to be a failure. There is a small scene where Jeff Bridges stands up for the man who murdered his wife and the audience gets to cheer him on while he's doing it. I guess what I am saying is that this movie only works because of Jeff Bridges. I think this is a great movie if you are looking for a low budget film to watch while you're bored in the car or while driving around the Midwest in your car because this movie takes place in a small town but there is no character development and no real purpose to the film. The movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall) and it is well produced and I enjoyed the musical score but it wasn't really necessary in the film in order to enjoy it. A well made, cheap film that will take you back to your childhood and will stay with you all night. I would never watch this movie again although I may watch it again because I am so sad this failed to get a wider release. I do appreciate the fact that someone actually took the time to make a decent

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My second visit to the "World's Greatest Film Festival" in Amsterdam, Holland has produced another excellent and interesting documentary.   It's called the World Trade Center: What Really Happened (2005).   A little known but fascinating topic, WTC collapse and the cover up. A great film made by people who have actually been involved in the case.   The film offers three very different perspectives in the collapse of WTC 7: The initial "black-out" of 9/11/01; The official investigation that started shortly thereafter; And the subsequent attempts of those responsible, particularly Larry Silverstein, to cover-up the truth.   As I said, this film is of great value for any one who enjoys film studies.  The documentary is based on two articles written by Paul Zarembka.    And Zarempka is a retired engineer who was a specialist in building and civil engineering, and was in the top 1% in his field.  He's not just some one-trick pony.  The two articles are well worth reading in their own right.   Here are some excerpts:   First Article: "WTC7 and the Secret Truth: I think it's important to start with the facts, the facts as we know them today. The "Big Lie" has been put to rest. 9/7 is not the event that it is portrayed as. No. The event is a fraud. No other event of the last hundred years has ever had as many "witnesses" and "studies" falsified, with lies about "explosions, smoke, molten metal and smoke", as 9/6, and there is a pattern, in that all the events surrounding it are controlled, as you have pointed out. The official reports are also lies. All the facts contradict them. You have to know that, if you think about the history of 9-11. The whole project was never about the "attack on America". The attacks on the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and the Trade Towers are the only "weapons of war" used on innocent people, because they had to be used in order to kill or maim a bunch of people. But the people who created the pretexts and the "war" were the same people who, in the Middle Ages, created the "fiefdoms" for kings in Europe. I mean: the same lords of finance who, for centuries, bought their land in a feudal way
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought that this film did a good job at adapting H.P. Lovecraft's short story "The Whisperer in Darkness" to an independent film.   In the original story the narrator is a little boy who hears voices in his head and goes off to find his friends:  The child becomes convinced that something dreadful has been going on in the nearby woods. The little boy wanders into the woods and finds a man dressed all in black. The man speaks with a very creepy voice and demands that the boy reveal himself:  While the child and the man struggle to free themselves from the shadows, the voice continues:  "I will not be made a fool of. I am Cthulhu. Cthulhu the King in Yellow."   At the end of the short the narrator disappears. This film had a great cast and it made for a great watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie. What a fantastic way to get out of the house. "They are dead, they are dead." This line from the film was uttered by the lead actor, a young French film maker, in the closing scenes of the film. However, in this case, the dead are in fact dead-and the dead have come back to haunt them. This is in no way a supernatural tale at all. It is a thriller based on an actual event. The film focuses on two teenagers and their family who are living with the tragic and unexplained death of their mother. The first teenager, Daniel (Jalila Doulaoui), is only 16 years old and a student of the art school. He is also a bit strange. He likes to play with fire and is somewhat of a troublemaker. One time, a stranger had a nightmare in the house of her mother. In the dream, his mother and his father had been murdered. The second boy in the family, Pierre, is 14 years old. He has a sister and a girlfriend but he is very shy. He often hangs around his brother Pierre who is in high school and he also enjoys to take care of his sister and his mother. Their mother and Daniel are both old and frail. They are not in a good way. The movie deals with their loss of a mother, the death of a sister as well as of their father and the mysterious disappearance of a boy who lived in the neighborhood who had not been heard from since October. After the discovery of the bodies, the police try to find a motive for a murder and try to understand how the mother and sister died. They will do all they can to find the killer but eventually they will fall victim to his tricks, or rather, the people that are trying to kill him. After all, what kind of a monster is it that leaves his victims with no clues to his identity? There are a great amount of scary scenes that are just simply scary! The movie is certainly one of the best out there and is definitely worth watching! I am not really an horror fan but this movie has something to it that is worth watching, as much for the fact that you get to see something different. It has some good acting, great effects, a lot of blood and some nice characters. The ending is just perfect! It brings out all the mystery of the story even more and leaves you with a good feeling!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my eyes, it is a great story of a woman who is an old woman living an old age while her sons are old men. She lives in a tiny apartment with a small bathroom with a tub in it which is shared with a young, attractive couple. She has a lovely, very elderly, yet wise grandchild whom she visits every few days (they are on their honeymoon, so the younger daughter is busy with her mother). The grandfather and his wife are much older, and often go to visit the daughter and grandson, but they are both old men themselves.  The movie takes place in a small village called St. Michael, a good part of which is in Austria (yes, it's a real, old-fashioned country, a far cry from today's world!). There are only two houses there: the old one is where the grand-daughter is kept. The daughter's family is very old-school, but does have an interesting view of life: no drugs or anything of that kind, but life is simple and full of smiles: children playing, a house full of grandchildren, all happy and full.  As I said, the grandmother of the old person is very wise, but she's also a bit superstitious, so I like it better when she's not around. She can keep a secret from the grandson, which is about the grandmother's death and the grandfather's funeral, so when the grandson comes for the funeral, she says that the grandson's sister is in the hospital and he can't go because he would be afraid he would get the wrong idea, so she invites him to spend the rest of the day with her and watch a little movie with the old woman.  As soon as he arrives, he finds out that it's all true, and that the daughter is indeed in the nursing home (she had to leave home to take care of her mother and her grandmother) so his sister visits her on a regular basis, but he hasn't seen her in years. She's dying, the doctor is telling him how hard it's going to be, but as soon as the grandfather calls her, a heart wrenching story is told and the grandson wants to see her, but the grandmother is dead! So, he's not going to spend any more time with her.  The granddaughter, in fact, is living with her friend (whose family had moved away from St. Mike for a long time), and the granddaughter's husband

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I'm not the biggest fan of horror movies, but I'll definitely admit it has something going for it. In fact, I think it's the one genre that's managed to stay the same over time. We've all seen it at least a dozen times: someone goes to a deserted house to find a lost baby; the child is in grave danger and must be rescued; the rescuer must fight off the evil lurking in the shadows; he must face unimaginable horror; and then - the movie is over! I loved this movie. It was so incredibly well made that it almost feels like a ghost story - except it was more like a horror story. This was so well-crafted and thought-out that I almost forgot about the horror part at some point. If you're looking for a horror movie to kick the Halloween party into gear, then you will NOT be disappointed - and you are guaranteed to be amazed. Even if you don't like the movies that were in theaters, this movie is still a great choice. I give it four stars. _________________  A few of the movies I mentioned were on an early '90's television series, The X-Files. I've watched this show a lot, so I will be posting some of my favorite episodes and some from seasons 2 through 4. There's a great scene in episode 12 (X-files Season 2, Episode 12) in which Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are doing research for some new cases, and Mulder finds a dead body in his backyard. Mulder picks it up to see what it is. He opens the corpse to get to the body's clothes. He quickly shuts it back up again, and looks for an ID, but he doesn't find it. After some searching, they find what Scully calls "the corpse in Mulder's basement," which is clearly a doll. The corpse is made up of layers of fabric and other stuff. It has the body parts all arranged in a certain manner. It's very disturbing. This is one of the episodes in the first series that really shows the show's progression from a series of fun, mystery show to a serious show about monsters, and even government conspiracies. It seems to get better every season. This show has spawned spinoff TV shows and movies. Even the first movie, The Exorcist (1981) has become a cult classic. This movie has some other things going for itself as well: The sound design is great

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ "This is an extremely well-directed drama. The script, the acting, the camerawork, the cinematography. It was a great job. In the end, I really liked the character of Milla (Diane Kruger) more, even though I don't agree with her actions during the whole drama. At the end of the day, she wants a man like her father and is ready to do whatever it takes to get that. She is able to work with her lover, David (Ben Mendelsohn), and is also able to get through in a relationship with her husband, Beny (Ciarán Hinds), who is a professional baseball player. But she finds that her father is still in love with another woman and tries to have it. I liked that she tried to be the strong-willed woman that she seems to be. But there is a part where she goes against the laws and takes the money from the father in the name of 'love' and he is angry. The acting of Misha Dziewulski was good, and Ben Mendel (Beny) was very convincing, with great emotions. And he played Beny very well. All this is worth to remember." (review from film critic, AIM)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's been a long time since I've seen a "true" science fiction movie, like so many of the classics from the 70s and 80s. This was a movie I was looking for for a while, and even the terrible trailers made me intrigued. I like sci-fi, and as someone who is looking for some fresh and exciting sci-tech-based movies, this is perfect!   First off, the movie is set in the future, on an abandoned planet, that was once a planet like our own, but destroyed many years ago. (You might know this planet as Earth-16.) It is now a desert wasteland. However, a group of people who have the ability to travel back in time have a plan to help the people who are on the planet. Their plan is called the C.E.R.A.K. The C. E. R. A.K.'s (Citizens Enterprise for Advanced Reconfiguring Aided) are very old-school, and they do not believe in being seen as a "tech" people. They also do not want people to understand they are "old-school." However, their mission is not to help, but to warn the people of what happened to this planet millions of years ago...   The plot is pretty complex, but it is easy enough to follow. For those of you who haven't seen a lot of sci-flicks: There is a time machine here, and the main character of the movie (who is also an old-timer) travels back in his time machine to try and stop a horrible, terrible future. The time traveling is done with some futuristic technology that we don't see here (like laser beams or flying vehicles), but it all plays in the story. The main character has a girlfriend who is in love with him, but he has a child from a past relationship. He has a daughter from the time he met his future wife. The mother of his daughter is actually a robot.   In the end, things are finally figured out (I wish there had been an ending, just to make up for the "what the hell is going on" ending, which had no impact on the story). There is some nice character development (I loved the relationship between the father and daughter) and a lot more to love about the story, besides the story of a young, orphaned boy who is trying to keep the Earth-17 (Earth
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only reason this movie doesn't get a higher rating is that at least half the movie consists of a woman talking about her experiences being raped in a car. I guess there's some truth to that. I didn't see the old TV show that the film is based on, but I am pretty sure they didn't have the same premise.  It might be that the producers wanted to take the easy way out by making a comedy, but the premise is interesting because it suggests the possibility of a society that is very accepting of violence against women.  When they arrive at the house where the rape took place, the girls come face to face with an angry, angry husband who accuses them of being part of a plot to make his wife look bad.  The girls are forced to go to the cops, where they get an unbelievable response (which I find interesting in that it is completely plausible in the first place): The police get the girls in the car, but she doesn't want to go:  She is terrified by the car and the man, and there is a lot of screaming going on.  There is some light torture, but no more.  When they get back home, the girl, who is the one in charge of the household, goes to the kitchen and yells at the men: She wants to know what they want:  I want them to put me into a box.  She gets the boxes, puts them on the table, and locks them.  One man is tied to the stove.  A few minutes later, the man who is tied up is released.   It is pretty much the same plot that is familiar to anyone who's ever seen the Twilight Zone.  But with a twist:   I think the twist comes from the fact that the girls are the only ones in town who are aware that there are women in the house.  And that includes the girls' mothers, who have never seen a naked woman in their lives.

Also the music is just great!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What can I say...it's pretty much a rip off of Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade. You can tell why Spielberg made this: a new adventure starring two Indiana Jones-like figures. This film is a must see: it's so bad it's good. I was never a huge fan of Indiana, and that film was all the more disappointing because of the lack of a good villain. That didn't help the film much.  In the film, a man is being interrogated by the CIA in a castle. The interrogator's wife (played by Joanna Cassidy) asks how the man came to be here. He's been working on this case for months, and hasn't found a clue to what he's looking for. He finally comes to a very old secret room that is covered in artifacts that were once important to the King of France. He comes across a large map with symbols of a map to the Holy Land and it mentions a man called Jesus Christ. He figures out this man and his story: he and his wife were traveling to the West. They met up with an American Indian and their son. This American guy is named John McClane. When the story is about to finish, McClane decides to take off with his son and leave the whole thing be. The next day, his wife shows up and informs him that McClane is dead (he was killed in a car accident with his family). His wife takes a picture of him before he left and she keeps it in her home so she won't have to tell anyone that he's dead. We then see a photo of the room where they found the artifact that is now on the floor in front of them. The map reads, "JESUS IS COMING TO AMERICA" and then it shows a photo to the left of a man's head. A very dark haired man walks into this room and it's clear that he is not from this world. He has a large, brownish mane and a large crown. He holds a staff in his hand and it has red flames painted on it. At first, we don't know what he is doing or what he wants, but he gets closer to his wife and says "I don't need your help! You're useless!" His wife then takes a knife from her purse and stabs him in the back!  The scene then switches to a flashback showing the past to a man named Thomas Jones who was an ancient king
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the best of the lot, with a plot which was engaging, interesting, and well thought out. You can see how this will be a long running series. It's about an alien invasion that ends with an all out nuclear war. The movie was well produced and the special effects were excellent. The effects were well done with a good level of detail. The music was fantastic, not overly loud but not too soft either. A good idea but a bit predictable. The actors were all good, but not particularly outstanding. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a lot of martial arts films. This one seems to be one of the better ones out there. I am impressed by how well the movie is edited. The fights are very well paced. The ending is a little disappointing. But I guess it is just me. I was hoping that the film would end with a more dramatic way but instead we have some action. I like to think that this film is a blend of a lot the American films of the late 60's and early 70's. That was kind of the main style at the time, a mix of kung fu, Westerns, comedy and action.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â There have been a number of "bad" films in the last two years in which the stars have been played by "bad dudes" and the villain was "bad". Â I will give credit to the actors in all three of these films; there are more than enough memorable sequences in both of these movies to make it difficult to go back to the movies of the last few years that have been good. Â The villains in these two films are bad.  There is not much in the way of a good script in either of these, with one scene where the villains show up to rob a bank and the only possible solution is to call the cops.    These movies are certainly "good" in that they are a little violent and have some violence in them.  As is a part of Hollywood, however, the scenes in which bad things happen to good people are frequently intercut with scenes in the lives of the characters who have to live through them. The characters, like many people who have lived through a lot of things, have lost their way in the past and seem to be living a life that isn't theirs to live.  The villains are bad, and they take things from other people, especially the little kids that they use to make them feel important.  All in all, I enjoyed these movies quite a bit.  I hope there is a fourth one in the works and that the director/writers are able to do a better job of writing scripts.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had no idea what to expect going in to this movie. I know it sounds like a very strange combination, so what if I don't know much about the subject matter at hand. But this movie's good. It's one of those movies I knew as a kid. The story is fairly simple, and the characters don't get much more than their faces and hands showing up in the film's action sequences. But what makes the movie so good is the music, which is quite different from anything I've ever heard, and that is something the viewer of this movie should look out for. It will definitely turn most viewers off, but I think it's pretty fun. As an adult myself, I can't understand how this film is still not very well known amongst adult fans. But if that's the case, I guess this is still the only good Disney film I've seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am giving it a 8, the movie is not very deep and has nothing interesting to say about the war, so not good.   The characters are okay.  This is only the start of the story, and it can go in any direction it wants to go.  I guess it was made for an educational movie, but not for a real education.    A lot of people like the action, and this is the way to do it, but you will be left wondering what the hell is going on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first saw this film, I was immediately impressed. The plot is simple. The family, the husband (played by John Malkovich) and his wife (Joan Crawford) are having a bad time with their kids. So bad that they decide to throw the kids off a bridge. So the kids (the actors) throw themselves onto the water below. And the wife and husband decide to take a few good steps, but then the kids do the "stupid" things that only children do. It's a nice scene. Not one of those "the children are so annoying" scenes, but a nicely done little scene with good actors. And then there's the ending. What I like about this movie is that it doesn't use the cliffhanger ending. You never know what happens next. The kids make a lot of mistakes, but they seem to be able to make up for it in the end.   I'm not sure the movie is for everyone. It does have a strong "drama" angle which makes it easy to follow at a fast pace. And there's a lot to like about the characters. The wife is a real heroine. And you can see her trying and trying to do good things, but failing at every turn. I guess I liked the movie quite a bit. But I'm not so sure that I'll recommend it to everyone. I'd probably just be like "meh" about it. If it was something that would have appealed to me, it might have been interesting. But other than that, it wasn't a huge hit. And it's the first movie of the year which I didn't like. The movie doesn't seem to have much going on with it. In fact, it seemed to be taking the easy way out a lot. It just sort of felt a little long and drawn out. The ending didn't do it for me as well. But it might be good for younger children. The picture looks very good (though there were times I thought it was a little too bright). I like the colors. And I thought that Joan Crawford looked good in the movie.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm so happy to be back with the great Tom Hardy and Oscar Isaac. I like their characters so much and I really enjoy their chemistry with each other. This film is all about the relationship between two of my favorite people on the planet. Tom Hardy is not just a pretty face but someone with real life. He's a good soldier who's just getting started and this film shows just how far he is capable of going. And Oscar Isaac too is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. This is not a "big budget action movie" but it has some beautiful set pieces, strong performances, and just a touch of a touching story for this film. Tom and Oscar's relationship is just so great to watch, but this movie is just full of beautiful scenes as well. I'm in love. Read More?
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the classic tale of a child being abandoned and abused by a family she was told would take her in.  It is a heart wrenching story about a young girl who was abandoned by her family and never expected to return.   She lived under the stairs of a house.  When she grew up, she went to live with a foster family and got pregnant.  The people in the home had little to do with the child.  She had to beg on the streets to survive.  I had never heard a story like this before.  It is so moving and painful that it leaves you crying for the helpless little girl.  This movie will make you want to do something about the child abuse, but it is not easy.  Although the movie has been released in English, most of the plot elements and characters still sound like something out of a children's story book.  One can understand a child's fear about abandonment.  While that is understandable in the case of this child, it is a little hard to feel sorry for her because she will never make it home to her family.  Perhaps it is easier to feel this way since she did not have to endure her family's cruelty alone.  She will never come back to their house. In the end she became a single mother.  A single mother who is still a child. I think that a mother's pain is different from that of a daughter.  There are some movies that may make a mother cry, but this one was an exception.    I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially parents who have a son or daughter who has not received the love they deserve.  All these years later, this movie is as heartbreaking as when it was first made.    The final verdict:   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The original film is so funny, and I loved it. I would have to agree that the movie is too long (around 3 hours if I am not mistaken), but the comedy is great (although I am a very particular humorist, and will say with the original film I was bored by a certain plot point and the acting was not good). But if you want something short to see before you go to bed, or just a movie with a good comedic premise, then I suggest this film. Just kidding.  What I Liked:  The movie is just a parody of every western made up to be something new and different.  It's a parody not of the Western genre per se, but of the genre of the same name. The film is funny, though. I don't think the actors are great actors, but they're not terrible.  The story is great. I enjoyed the movie.   I was a fan of the original movie ( I just haven't had the time to re-watch it yet ), and I was excited to see this remake come out. So far, I think the remake is pretty great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you can't tell by the name, this movie is a sci-fi action thriller set in outer space. It's very fun to watch.   The action scenes are awesome in the movie as well. There is always some intense battle on the surface of a planet. If you're a fan of sci- fi and action, then you should check this movie out!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Jumper" is one of those films that just won't stop me from watching it. The "Jumping Jack" is an African American named Johnny, played by Richard Gere, who is an actor and a dancer who gets hired by the president of a fictional country, called the United States of Africa to run a race around the country. The show is really entertaining as the Americans try to out run each other and there are many close calls. I did think that the African Americans would out run the Americans but we did get close runs. There are some interesting characters, including John Malkovich as a man who tries to help the blacks, and "Ethel Merman".     There are a few bad lines as a group of black people say the things they think blacks are thinking. I do enjoy these kind of movies because they tend to be fun for a while, and get a good laugh out of it.

I never saw this movie before, i always thought that it was on the tv.

I would love to see a real live story made by this director, who just wants to make fun of what people think of him, like a movie about a silly cartoon character.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Michael Fassbender's performance as a brilliant, tragic young man at a time in the modern history when he was very much alive but in a wheelchair. Fassbinder's performance is very much in the film's style and the script is pretty good with a great cast of interesting actors and a story about a man who discovers there is more to life than just being a successful politician, a man in love and a man trying to do the right thing. For a movie that is such a long one at 1hr and 30 mins, it is well worth it. There was a point at the end of the movie when the film felt like it was over but it did not. It was an exciting ride with some of the best action in recent memory and a great story for young viewers, something that will stick with you, but it does not go the long way to the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I knew about the film at the outset (which was nice), but I didn't care for it until the "B" storyline was over. I know that the first "B-stories" in this film were very strong, but this "B story" was weak. I don't understand why the characters can't work together like good friends do. I also didn't like that the movie gave us such an awesome, action filled climax that it had to be repeated over and over again. However, I do like how the film is over before it really got into gear, but you have to be patient. I would like to see more films with a strong female lead. She needs a little more screen time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There really is some good acting out there.  And I don't just mean in this one.  The movie itself, I think, is not nearly as exciting as it seems:  the plot is basically a plot for the purposes of an evil scientist with a big plan that is kind of like the plot of Dr. Moreau and his henchmen in Napoleon.  And while Napoleon isn't that great, it's the villain himself who really is the big bad of the movie and a fairly interesting take on it.  It's a pretty fun thing, even if it's not really that great.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched "Lone Star" in a packed house at the Castro Theatre and I got a real dose of it. The movie is a good one and it's a bit unusual for that period but the film is a very good comedy and the writing and direction is very good as well.  The plot is straightforward.    A group of men go on a cruise and encounter a very strange woman.  The crew on the ship get in fights and it soon becomes apparent that the ship is haunted. They end up traveling back to the 1800's where they see ghostly figures in the air. The movie is well-shot and acted and there are some funny scenes and some good ones.  There is a song called "A Ghostly Place" (written by John Barry) that is very memorable and is a great soundtrack for the film.  All in all, the movie was very good and an appropriate end to a fine movie.  I'd love to see a remake with Tom Cruise in the lead role.  And since it's the end of this year, why not go and see it sometime sometime.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You never know where a movie is gonna go, but The Dark Knight has a good time. I would say that the Batman films are now getting a bit dated, and for that reason it's very good to see a director who didn't change much between Dark Knight and The Dark Angel, but this Batman film is much more entertaining. The action set pieces are always fun to watch, and the script is smart, but I would also say that this one is no slouch when it comes to dialogue either. The Dark Angels has its own distinct style, but the Batman film does a good job of making it fun. A very good time is had by all and that's good enough for me. I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main character, Paul (Derek Luke, who played "Crow" on a few of the original 'Hitchhiker' movies, is a tough guy who just wants to live a quiet life with his cat in a secluded cabin on a remote mountain, until a mysterious stranger in a white hood pulls him off to the remote island of Lourdes...  I had this movie on VHS as a child. My parents were old-fashioned purists when it came to movies, and I remember watching this many times with my younger brother, who was the younger brother on this series. I really liked it. It was a good old-school adventure...a bit on the dry side at times, but that's a nice kind of thing to throw in here, I'm always for a change of pace.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm actually really excited to go see this movie, since I have been dying to see it ever since I heard about it a while back and it has finally shown up! It's actually one of those movies that, though it isn't as exciting as Star Trek, is still well-acted, well-directed, and beautifully photographed. Plus, unlike other Star Trek movies, it doesn't try to be too serious or preachy or pretentious, but instead is very much about what it's about - space exploration and the adventures of some of the crew's friends. As an adventure movie that just so happens to be a Star Trek movie, it's certainly not the greatest. The story is very simple and the characters are a bit stereotypical, but there are a lot of great sequences, including one that I loved, which ended up being the highlight of the movie for me. I also loved that the characters aren't completely selfish, but rather have their own ideas of what is good, what's important, and what's just plain fun. One thing I will point out is that the ship has the ability to create gravity, which makes it a lot easier on the feet for everyone, including the crew, and also makes it possible for the ship to go much faster than any other spacecraft in the Trek universe. This film was also very nicely shot. I'd love to see some Star Trek 3 for a sequel because there are some great episodes. The only other thing I thought I could praise about this movie was that the director, Jon Schnepp, was so cool and professional that you could never tell that he was behind the camera. - August 1, 2008Great Stuff!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so very curious to see this movie as I have been to other such film series of this genre as "Rudyard Kipling Presents" or "Rajkumar Rao Presents" and I have to say that this one is a true masterpiece. I would have been very much entertained watching this movie from beginning to end as it was a truly engaging and thrilling movie with all those amazing scenes. All the characters were extremely charming and the dialogues between the actors was really well done. The cinematography was also flawless and beautifully done also from beginning till end. And I am also glad to know that Rajkumar is not only an actor but also a good filmmaker who also did his homework.  In the end of this movie, the audience is definitely won over by what Rajkumar is capable of accomplishing with all his talent. Rajkim Kumar is a very talented actor. So far, he has starred in a few Hindi film series like "Chalo Dheere Sankat", "Chhota Siyan", "Bajirao Mastani" etc. but this movie marks the new phase of his acting career. He is an extremely charming actor and also a great actor who does not make mistakes in the movies. He gives his all in this movie and it truly is the masterpiece of his career. The movie takes you on a journey from the beginning till the end. So please do give this movie a try. It is certainly one of the better movies of the year 2011 and definitely worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The movie was interesting in a way that you might not expect: in a small town that seems like nothing special, you have a group of children who are running into trouble. The kids seem a little wild, not being good actors yet being good kids. And as much as I enjoyed the movie, at the same time I felt that it was a little over the top. It seemed like a parody of a typical horror movie, and not something special. Â It was only the second time this director has been in Hollywood, and I would have preferred to have seen a movie that he could direct from the ground up, not the same film over and over again.  I'll give it a 2 out of 4 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was lucky to see this in IMAX 3D and a great movie on many levels.   The story is simple enough.  An alien comes to Earth looking for a new planet to rule. He finds a planet called Bajor that is a peaceful society but needs a leader who will lead them into war against the evil Klingons.  It is a good idea to let a single character be all powerful and capable.  If you love Star Trek like I do then this movie is a must watch.  It has much more depth than the TV show, not like The Next Generation.  You should watch it for the characters, I especially loved Jake Sisko a Klingon. I found myself rooting for him.

This is the first film of Charles Bronsons career and in that sense it is one of the greatest movies of all time, or at least the greatest of all the Charles Brondons movies. Not that Charles Brontons the movie was great, he wasn't very good but this one isn't so bad. I don't know what it is about the story that makes me like it so much but I just do. It has a good, hard, street story with lots of character development and a good ending. What's even better is that Charles gets a good scene in the movie as a drug dealer trying to run his business, and you know he wants to do it but can't because he is working for his partner. The movie doesn't just end on a happy note either, a sad ending that shows how far a guy can go when he doesn't really care about anything. Charles Branson is a talented actor and has the charisma of a true movie star, and I always thought it was just good to see Bronson with more screen time in the later films he appeared in. ************ - The movie is really good, as a first movie it is very good. **************** *****
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is very interesting.  In many ways it is quite original.   I don't remember this being used so much in a Western...but it is a good story...with very few characters to work with.    There is the main character, John Tully, the Sheriff of Tombstone and his love, Lucy Tully.  Then we have Tonto, the Apache Chief, a character I found a bit of a bore to sit through.  I find him to be a little too much of an air head and sometimes his actions are ridiculous, yet it was really entertaining, I really thought he was a good lead for the character.  There was also El Dorado, a small town Sheriff, John Hough's wife, with whom he has a rather interesting relationship, however this is all too brief and not very compelling to say the least.  Another interesting character are the Indian boys who are played by William Campbell and Tom Mather.  They are funny and really likable.  As well as these we have a young boy and his aunt played by the legendary John Wayne, and his son, played by Fred MacMurray.  When they first meet the two boys are on their way to see a movie at the local theater and John Wayne makes the observation that he doesn't think the little boy is likely to grow up to be an Indian chief, and it has the perfect ending for this small gem.  The other great performance was that of James Coburn who plays the Apache chief, who I really found to be quite an interesting character...although I found that I was more interested in John Tull's love for Lucy Tull than the Chief himself. The sound effects and dialogue were very well handled.  All in all a nice little story...a lot of fun with great characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a man who is being investigated for a murder that he didn't commit. The story is very simple, we have a suspect, a victim, a motive and some forensic evidence that points towards a man other than the murder victim. The movie is just fun and a quick story for people who don't like mystery movies or who like a good laugh. I'm not too happy about the character designs and the characters aren't very likable. I was expecting more from a movie about a murderer but this wasn't it. The only positive thing about this movie is the soundtrack, it's quite catchy and the music fits the movie really well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a great movie. It's a lot of fun for a while, but at the same time, I was expecting more from it after seeing the trailers. The writing of the movie is great, but it's almost like the director forgot the point of the original. The main hero has to save his mom. That isn't the problem. The problem is that he gets kidnapped by a girl who wants him to become a hero, and who wants to save her from the evil that is threatening her. It is a very slow start, but the second half is incredible. This movie is worth watching. The music is great. The effects are great. I would recommend this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would say it's better than the first, which I loved.  The idea here is not only that of a woman fighting with a man against her abusive husband, but that a woman is fighting against her own personal prejudices against the whole idea of being a "wife".  All of the usual stuff of that kind of story has been done before in a less sophisticated way. _______________________ __________________ The Woman Who Loved Tom Gordon: A New York Story (1946) The story is a fairly conventional one about a woman's efforts to overcome her fears in order to be a good wife.   It's well acted (including a great performance by Elizabeth Taylor).   And it's funny.  As I say, it's a fairly predictable story, with the usual suspects.  It begins with a woman who's afraid to leave her husband because she's afraid of what she might do to him.  Then the story moves to her efforts to make her husband a more loving husband, and then back to her trying to change his attitude toward her.  While this story has a beginning, middle, and end, it has nothing new to offer the reader.  The only thing it does that's even slightly fresh is a very long sequence of a young woman's attempts to win over a man's sympathy by trying to tell him about the things she likes about the new house she's making for the neighbors.  And the ending is an odd one, where she learns that her husband would rather live with a younger man than her. I'll finish with another story which I found to be very entertaining.  I've read the whole of this novel already, and it's not too difficult to find, I'll admit that I've not read much contemporary American fiction, or at least contemporary American women writers.  However, I find this story to be an excellent one.  You will probably recognize it immediately as part of the tradition of stories about the adventures of a man and his lady-love.  Here is an example.   The Man in the Moonlight (1943). The Man In the Moonlight is an interesting story about a man who visits a woman at a country house, and her reactions to him as if he were her own father, only younger.  This is a classic tale about family relations and the power of one's feelings.  A few years before this story was published, the author, John Steinbeck, wrote another, entitled The
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is a mixture of various genres with a few twists. There is the typical story line with a family of seven (the eldest is a kid and very spoiled as is the rest of the family) that moves away from home. The family has no money and have to learn to live without any and with the help of a strange looking person who is helping them along the way. The story is fairly typical with a lot of silly moments and it is clear that this is the only movie that the cast had done before. But that is about it. The acting was decent and the humor was decent although I had to laugh a few times but in general the movie was quite silly. That would be a problem if this were a "good" comedy but it is not. If you are looking for a fun silly family movie this is definitely one to check out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** A story that could have been a lot better if it didn't have the same kind of generic dialogue that comes out of movies all the time, however this movie does a decent job with making a story about a girl and her boyfriend. The story, being in flashbacks tells the tale of how she first met him (after she killed his fiance) and how their relationship took shape. It has a nice balance of comedy and serious situations, and it's a good way to end the movie that was a little slow in its start, but it quickly picks up, and starts to get good with its plot. The characters are quite likable, and a lot of them are likable characters. Even the bad characters seem like they would be good friends and not just obnoxious assholes. It does feel somewhat slow at times. Still the movie is a lot for the price of admission, and I look forward to the next one.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Rydell from Poor! This is just a mediocre movie. I wouldn't rate it a lot higher but I will make it a point to warn you that if you like rom-coms, I can only suggest skipping this one. The only good thing to say is that there is enough action to keep you interested and the characters are not boring. It's a shame that they couldn't have done something special with the special effects, because this movie has some of the best.

I believe the director has a good sense of humor and has always done well in films.  In this case he made a good use of comedy, which was not the first film of its kind and it's only the second time I have seen it, but again I did not find it annoying.    The characters were well written and interesting.  The humor was great for a comedy.  This is one film that I recommend everyone to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main characters are good at handling situations that could be considered a little too ridiculous and a little to easy for them to handle. This was a decent comedy. The acting is strong.  Ratings: PG13 - Mild language, mild sexual content  Genre: Comedy
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ This film is an entertaining romp that doesn't overstay its welcome or take itself too seriously. One thing is very clear from the beginning: The crew of the freighter "Papa Ruh" (named for the Greek god of fire) is no ordinary crew. A handful of the crew are crazy and violent, some of them are very stupid, but they have fun, they love a good time, and they get into more trouble than they can get out of. There is the obligatory gunfight, the typical gang-related shenanigans, and that is about it. It's a very entertaining watch. The film was filmed on the west coast.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had seen the trailer for this film but never got to see it until today. I'm glad it got its time to get made. I really like the concept and the action.  We get a great introduction to the world of the film, what they call "The Dark Age" and then some action. The acting is good. This is a very fun film.  I'd highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a fun movie that will be remembered and loved forever.  The main character is a great character with the ability to manipulate people with her brain as she makes her way through the maze.    The movie was funny but a little long at times.  If you have seen this movie and can't wait to see it again in a theater then it's worth the time and money. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen this film in many years and had only heard of it a couple times, so I was extremely excited when I finally saw it. I love horror movies!  A really spooky story with some good special effects! _________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ _________________________ I haven't been a big fan of this film, but I liked it very much.  The story is told in first person and we don't really know what we are seeing.   We hear the voice of a "Mr. Smith" which sounds kind of like a dead person.  He tells us to turn on our lights and "look out the window" as there is a "dead woman" and we hear the sound of a shotgun and then we see a couple standing next to a large rock.  That rock is glowing.  Then we see the girl on the ground.  She is covered in blood, her eyes are open and her mouth is open and we see that there is no pulse.  But we see her smile.  There is an "angel" which is a little girl.  Her name is Daisy.  And her brother is in the woods with a big rock.   And then we hear a man's voice which sounds like a man with a "spit and polish" but there is so much blood on his "spitting."    This is a very disturbing movie.  I am glad I found it on a new website.  This might not be for everyone, but everyone should watch at least the trailer before judging.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ It took the best part of a year to get this movie made, which is too much time for a movie that is supposed to be about a group of teenagers fighting crime in a dark future city. That it is a pretty decent movie is another story altogether, and that is probably why I love it so much. The movie plays on nostalgia, but does so in a way that makes you feel like you are a good kid from the 1980s. The bad guys are fun too, and the best, most memorable moment is when the cop goes into a room filled with junk from the 70's, and finds something from a 1970's comic book that he can identify. The script and performances from Daniel Craig and Colin Farrell give the movie a lot of style, and you can tell that they're really enjoying themselves. The fact that they still find the time to be such good actors is impressive, although the film will have a difficult time competing with some of the other movies that are released in the same year. _____________________________________________________________________________ Standalone Rating: 4/5
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************ The best thriller I have ever seen! After a terrorist attack on their small town, two families, the Lutzes and the Smiths are separated but still connected. The Lutze's move in together and have four children: Tom, the bratty teenager; Katie, the little innocent; Billy, the spoiled rich boy and Bobby, the boy with the broken heart. There is one more kid in the neighborhood and this is a very unusual family as there are three sets of grandparents and none of them are human beings. The mother is a witch and the father is a vampire (in his human form) but they look and talk the same as humans. What makes the family unusual is the fact that the mother takes care of the children (they have a dog too) and the mother also takes care (in vampire form) of the two old women, the Smith Sisters. There are some dark shadows coming in and the only way to get rid of them is the blood ritual. That's what the Lutz family is trying to do when a boy who has been adopted by the Lutszes is kidnapped. That young boy is the one who will be able to reveal the dark secrets behind the Lutes. ******************************* ********************** 1/2 stars
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has all the makings of a classic. It has amazing, intense action scenes; it has a good script. The problem is that, even though the story and characters are great, the special effects are over the top. The CGI is used too often and over the tops. The special effects for the fight scenes are even more over the heads than the special effect for the car chase scene. Even with that, this is still a decent movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a real gem.  The script is terrific, the characters are realistic, the story is very well done.  There is a lot going on in this movie.  The cast is great - not just the leads - the leading man in this film, John Candy is so good it is hard to believe he is the actor.  And what is more, the plot is good.  In a way this film takes place in the near future.  It is not a futuristic movie at all, although it does have a future setting but it is not that far off.  This movie is set in a small California town in the late 1950's.  John's character, John Cady (yes he is played by the actor who would go on to play the role of "John Candy" again) is the son of a doctor who left his wife for a much younger woman named Lillian.  Lillian was the daughter of a man named Mr. S. B. and she has a good relationship with her mother-in-law, which is very strong between parents-in.  They are both very loving and they have a lot of affection for each other.  Now John is a child but is still a kid in his late teens when he has this relationship.  His dad is very fond of him, but doesn't do much to protect him - to tell the truth, he doesn't really seem to have any protection or care for him.  He is more concerned about himself and the people around him.   But after the death of a friend's father who was killed by a drunk driver, John's father seems to have changed, which brings the two closer.  Well in the final confrontation between John and the drunk driver he pulls out his gun and shoots him. So he has become something of a "bad boy" and he is now out in the streets and he starts having adventures and making friends.  One of the things that struck me about this film was that it was not a typical 'bad boy' movie. It is more the "bad people and good people" movie.   It's a good idea - it really is.  Not that you won't like it.  But don't expect to understand all the nuances and the complexities of the characters - that doesn't happen - not unless you are a trained psychologist. But don's think this movie is bad, no.   In fact if you aren't familiar with
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, I felt a little bit disappointed by this movie: It's a good story, great characters, excellent voice acting and even the sound track by the legendary David Bowie. I think the cinematography in the movie is very good and it does not matter if the story is simple as long as the plot is there. I love to watch a movie like this that gives us so many clues about the future in one single film.    A good movie but it does leave me with more questions about the world which is why I would not recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good mystery.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________ I loved this film. I am sorry to have to say that it does have a few flaws. The acting isn't bad, but it does feel a little bit too wooden and artificial. The writing is very good. It is pretty much a character study on how he comes to terms with his father's death and his growing resentment of his mother. The ending is a bit over the top and not really what I expected, but what a wonderful ending. I think it is a great ending to a great story. If you like this type of movie and a really good character study, then you will probably like this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know how I did it. I loved this movie! I never thought it could happen again: my favorite movies from the 80's were all from the 70's, with only a few exceptions: "The Deer Hunter" is the best of the bunch, but "Kundun" is still one of my favorite 70's movies (and it's a good film...but it's more a 70's action movie: there's only one real plotline in the film: an American soldier's struggle to rescue a Chinese lady who is being taken to a Japanese prison camp in Siberia). I think this film is not so much "cult classic" as an iconic classic: it is a movie to which "The Shawshank Redemption" is a rip-off.     I still don't like the movie (for the most part) but I like a lot of the film's characters (I really do! I really do!). It was a fun action movie but a little dated at times, and the action scenes were more silly and goofy than serious. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film begins with a couple of people in a restaurant eating their meals. I don't remember if this is a real restaurant, an improvised one or one that has a few tables and chairs set up in the lobby. As I recall they're talking about how they're going to eat the next night, which will be Sunday night. One of the men says that the man he's with just came home. The man he is with is with a woman, probably his girlfriend. But he's also talking about his friends. He says they'll all have a bunch of fun over at the restaurant, which happens to be the one he and his partner frequented as children, but doesn't say which restaurant it is.  At this point I was reminded of the scene in the movie  "Funny How Love Works"  in which Willy Wonka is having dinner with his family (which, I imagine, was a fairly old-fashioned family, since he's a middle-aged man), but it doesn't matter. The point is that this is how the adults are talking these days.  The next day they find an old, empty place in the city park and decide to use it as a hideout.  What's the purpose of a hide-out? There was one more thing, but it turned out to be even more interesting.  I was really impressed by the screenplay. This is one of those films that is written very well, and that's a very rare feat in my viewing experience.  And the writing is especially good.  Each of the characters is given very accurate descriptions of their personality and their lives, even the minor characters.   In the movie, the only characters who are totally absent are a couple, the two young men (one of whom is named Frank) who run the hideout, and the girlfriend (who is never seen again).  The only two important characters are the two kids at the hide-down who aren't quite out of their teens (the younger, Johnny, is about seventeen) but who are still pretty young in a sense (they're still children, after all.)  Johnny's father is a very nice man who is a police inspector and his mother is a nurse; he's the "cool" type, like his dad and they're very close. Johnny's friends are named after movie monsters (Mr. Whipple, Mr. Wrench, Mr... I can't remember. I can

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's something about this movie that will never stop turning me on. It's not as much a plot as it is a narrative that is so well-paced that even while the story is unfolding it keeps you engrossed in it.   From the get go it is clear that this is a movie that takes place in an urban environment; however, it never feels like we are stuck in a grimy alley, it feels like a nice, clean apartment that we are being shown through, it's an area that we have all visited at one time or another.  This is a story about a man that was raised by a dysfunctional family and his struggles with mental illness. While I do not consider myself mentally unstable, it is still a good story that should be watched by everyone, if you have a mental health issue read this!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't realize how much I was in love with the movie until the last scene. It's so touching and sad to see these characters, who are often portrayed as cold-blooded killers, come to terms with the death of their parents. So many films portray cold-hearted killers and they are pretty darn bad, but this film gives us a character who is more complex and relatable than the typical "biker" gang leader. His father, who had lost his sense of humor so early in his life, is a total joke. I'm not sure if I can believe that he would have killed his wife and son. Not to mention his wife who is actually quite cute. I think his brother was a bit too "bad ass" for him. A great character and tragic loss. I wouldn't change the end of the movie for anything. I thought he was very funny at times, especially during the fight with the police. He is so funny it's sickening. This isn't a good book with bad writing. This is a great movie with good acting and music by Michael McDonald. Watch it before the movie because the ending isn't good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think it's a great movie and I loved watching it at my grandma's house. I thought it was very well done and thought it did a wonderful job of showing the history of the world and the people in the movie. This movie is a little bit slow at times but it does get good parts and the ending really made my jaw drop. I think it could have been a little better but the fact that it is a biographical film and not an action movie makes it a great one and I highly recommend this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is about an artist, who works with his wife and children in a hotel, but is forced to leave because he is an "unfit for duty". His only hope for a better life is to find a beautiful young singer and he meets this singer in the first part of the film. So far he has been lucky, as it is her voice that seduces him from a life of boredom and neglect in a large hotel to a life at the top. This is a well made film, and I think it is worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you open a movie with "It's a girl!", you know you're in for a wild ride! But the fact that it's a girls show, in an actual girls-only school, is not a problem because it's completely awesome! The acting is all-round fantastic. All three actresses deliver wonderful performances. From the very first shot, the audience knows what this show is all about: the two leading ladies are not what they seem. It's just a matter of time until a boy who can see her soul enters the picture. It is the story of the love of two young girls...and a boy too!  The first couple of songs are really good, especially the ones I've already talked about.  The rest of the songs are very well done too! And the music video has a lot to offer as well.   This movie is really fun. I was always so excited to see it coming up in the cinema. When it finally came out in cinemas in Australia, the audiences were shocked. The word of mouth around town was incredible. They came from far and wide to see this movie. As an Australian, I feel as though it has a place in Australian and international film making culture. It just adds something special to all those movies you've probably seen, yet only now, you can go and see this in theatres. It won't make you happy but it might give you a smile. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In general, I am not sure how the film is supposed to work. When they are discussing the movie "The Shining", it is not " The Shining". It is more of a " The Thing"  - it is about the aftermath of the nuclear holocaust that took place at the end of the 19th century. When the wife of the doctor who saved her son from the effects of the irradiation decides to go back and see her husband who is in his last days, she meets the other two survivors. She decides to stay in the same cabin with them, which is a very small place, so she will have a place to spend her last days. It is also full of oddities: there is a radio in the room, which seems to have been turned on from the inside - and it plays a radio series from an old episode of "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" - there is also a book from an unknown publisher on a table - the stove is broken and it is hot in this isolated cabin - a little girl is present who tries to make her parents laugh - and the other survivor in the film, a little boy who lives in the cabin next to the woman, has very peculiar dreams which he describes as "like a story with a good ending".  We all know what happens to people during the nuclear war: The bodies are scattered all over the place, there are lots of survivors that have had all kinds of ailments and suffer from radiation sickness. That is exactly what happens with a very sick little boy. He is very fond of the lady - he has never really cared for anyone else - and in his dreams he sees her dancing in front of the moonlit windows and kissing him. When a doctor comes to the room and tells him that his father will probably die soon, he starts to dream about her... (but then he stops and says: "Oh! I can't remember that. What are you gonna do now?"). When the doctor explains about the effects on the body, he seems to be convinced about it - but the little girl says:  " I feel the same as her". The doctor is very surprised but when they go to see her father, the man can't talk anymore. After having some of the pills that the little woman gave him, he becomes much better. The girl, who is still very sick, is still there. She is very proud of her father. She sees him as a little

The film was directed by Paul Meehan and produced by Michael Bork. The movie has a great soundtrack with great music, and great sound effects.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There were a few bad things that did happen, which we never really got to the actual badness of the movie to make it bad, but it is bad. It does not come across as fun at all. It was a few boring things of different characters talking for the most part, and then we get this one guy who is a monster and gets killed. He comes back to life with a new personality. We meet other characters from the first movie in here, and you can guess what happens. There is a long scene with the main characters talking about how they are doing and what they are going to do. They all meet up, and the big event, this guy appears. I found myself thinking, "What is this? Is it time for us to see the rest of the movies?" The story is about a group of people who go to see a bad movie. It is the same one that the guys from the last movie talked about. The thing is, there is a good guy who was with these people during the bad movie, who is now killed by this monster, who tries to kill these people in the end.  One of my first times to see this movie  The action in this movie are fun to watch, but they are the same type of action that is done in every movie. The only time I really felt like anything special occurred is the scene where the monsters is killed, which is pretty cool.  I also like that in the ending, we see the first person that died.     Overall I would give this movie 4 stars, since it is fun to some parts, and I would say I like it, but then all the rest happened, the acting is great and so is the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Woo boy  "Taken" is the best, most exciting and enjoyable movie I have seen in a long, long time.  This is a movie that should have been in cinemas for years before it was actually released but it came out as a short film and I had to wait a couple of months before it finally came out.    "Taken", the name of the movie is actually a quote from a certain character (not the one that appears in the movie as "Jack" but the one in the book called "John"), the name given by the character "John" to "The Last of the True Gunfighters".  The book is a true story about the man and his experiences in Vietnam and he had several accounts from many different experiences.  After his last mission the man decided to go back to France after which he got injured badly.  He was hospitalized and was put into a coma before he died.  And then he was taken by the French police to the same prison that his mother was in, in order to prevent her from killing the man who had taken her son away so she could commit suicide.  I really loved this movie  This was one of those movies that were never intended to be made into a feature length movie.  There are only four or five people that appear in the entire movie and these are all characters that appear later on in the film.  Some of them have very interesting backstories that are very well developed and the movie has a really interesting structure and a good pace.  It is very well done, I love the characters and the way they are portrayed.  I would say this movie is a little on the slow side but it is only because there are only so many years and stories to tell about.  "The last of the true gunfighters", a very good movie that is a real action movie without being a war movie and that is the reason why you should see it.  This movie deserves much more recognition and I hope it will get some soon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I've never really liked horror films in general, but the first one in this series was a pleasant shock. If you don't like horror films, and think you don´t like gore, well, you haven't seen it. It has some gore, of course, it`s just that the gore here is so well done and is so realistic as a result that if your a horror fan you won't be able to watch the film without wanting to scream. It was a real shocker as it should have been and it should be a real one in every horror fan´s mind. A must see, a film that you should watch as the first of a trilogy to get into the right mindset for the next one. A real treat.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like it when someone is not trying to take credit. When you are in a fight you don't go around giving out awards to everyone else while you sit there being an idiot.   This is the true story of two of the most famous fighters in the world fighting over something which nobody cares about. There is so much history behind this movie that is lost to us all but that's not its only fault. The fight scenes are all pretty standard but the movie suffers because you are never sure who is winning the fight. Not really sure where to even start. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been a while since I've had a great time in the world of sci-fi.  The movie is set in a planet that is very similar to Earth (but obviously in a distant world) but is still quite different.  A very cool world and a great soundtrack.  A new science fiction movie that i've been wanting to watch for a while now.  This is an updated version of the classic movie, the first one was released in 1978 and the sequel in 1981,  but it is very much like the original, the story of a group of explorers who get trapped on a planet and what is left of the planet after their ship explodes.  It really is a sci-Fi movie that should be seen by everyone and I have to say, I absolutely love it.  The world is really different. I've never seen a planet as small, or with so much life as this planet.  I'm a huge fan of science fiction, and the original movie is one of my favorite movies ever.  So, if you're in the mood for a sci fi movie and don't like the ones that are on TV today, go see this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so glad I picked this movie up when it was on free view for a week.   In its own way it is as good as The Matrix.  With the addition of a cool computer called 'V.A.T.O.M.', the film is a brilliant meditation on what it means to live in an increasingly computerized society.  It is not just a plot to take control of the world and a hero to solve the mystery. In fact it is one person in particular: James Bond, the spy who is as popular as the martinis.  James Bond may be a bit of a stereotype, but he is one of the most interesting Bond characters since Sean Connery.  His intelligence and skills are amazing, but there is something about him that doesn't quite fit the hero's mold.  The film is really more an exploration of who James Bond is then it is a plot.  And if there is a bad movie in this movie, it is the introduction of a character who could have been an excellent Bond villain.  This is an excellent and entertaining spy movie that will make you question where your heroes are going.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Worth the wait, worth every penny... This movie is soooooo good!!!! And you know that if you have seen any kind of martial arts movie like these, which are often very hard to watch and sometimes they are cheesy. But this is an absolutely hilarious movie. It is so funny and just to be able to watch someone doing his best to not get caught (as he knows he can), and then have him fall off the roof, falling over a bridge onto a car. And just to finish the movie, he is almost killed by the other guy who is trying to break in to his house. It was funny to see his attempts to get up, but his injuries are so serious. When my wife told me my son came up to me and gave me a hug, I couldn't believe it. You have to see this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The last of the 'good old' movie detectives is a bit slow and ponderous at times, but the great performance by Tom Wopat (Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Lodger' was his third) makes up for that. As a retired detective, the film has the air of a tale about a man going back home, and the time passes so gradually, so slowly that it seems to be only minutes after we last saw him, but when the time does arrive, he suddenly appears suddenly and uninvited in your life. It is a case that is so much like a dream: the same house, the same old things, the family that had it, the policeman who had it and left it."  — The Washington Post review of Alfred Hitchcock's The Lodger (1948)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie opens with a prologue in which a mysterious stranger enters the town and meets an old woman who lives there.  A little woman is born, and she and her family soon find themselves in a great danger.  They must now find their way out of a place where nothing is known and where only ghosts roam around.    One of the most exciting things about the film is the use of sound.  In contrast with other horror movies that rely on the use the audience is completely passive, listening to the ghost of a woman singing in a graveyard.  However, this film uses sound to great effect.  From the opening shots of a young girl in a gothic house listening to a ghost sing and a scream, to the sudden, eerie appearance of a girl in the woods, the use in The Girl Who Fell from the Sky is ingenious.  The film is filled with great cinematography, and the use with the sound is masterfully used.  I really like the voice of the woman who sings the song.  This is a great movie, and one which I recommend you watch.

It's clear from the very beginning that this movie is being directed by Justin Lin, and it's obvious that he's made this movie with the same budget as Star Trek: Into Darkness. Â The film is a lot more fun than I expected it to be, and the best part about it is that it feels like an old-school Star Trek movie.  The original show was a classic science fiction show (although I'll admit that this was a bit dated when it debuted) and the idea of having a team of four people who could become human at will isn't anything new.    It is fun and refreshing to see these characters with an old school look and feel to them, and they really show off some of the great performances from the cast in this film.    They show us some great physical comedy, and some great action sequences.  The movie really comes together with the big cliffhanger, and in the middle of everything we get an amazing action sequence that really builds up the stakes.  So it's a nice surprise to have Star Trek become a big budget blockbuster in the new millennium.  I was impressed by the film and enjoyed it very much, and I can see a lot of people enjoying it too.  It will be on the short list of best Star Trek movies of all time, and if you think that's crazy, then just wait until the sequel comes out in 2018.  The Film Itself:  I give it a 6/10.  This is a film that is supposed to be very different, and while it is a good-hearted sci-fi movie that makes fun of a lot, it doesn't deliver on any of its promises.  There are too many different genres and styles of humor in this movie. The dialogue is funny and witty, but it's not much else.  They don't build up the tension in a good way, and just about the entire movie could have easily fit in a 30 second comedy sketch.  With an hour, hour and a half running time, it feels a bit overlong, but I'm hoping the second installment is a bigger and better production.  On a technical level, the movie looks like

Although they're real and I liked them as characters I felt like I wasn't getting a lot of them and the characters in this movie weren't that interesting. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I highly recommend this movie! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I hope you like it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We know the film is based on a series of books, so we'll ignore this but it's actually a very good movie. The acting, with a few exceptions is pretty good. The film is a good time and will surely please fans of the books. A little disappointing that it doesn't contain the second book, "The Last Hero", but the fact the it's a stand alone film means it could do with a bit of polish. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm giving this a thumbs up for two reasons; 1) it's a good comedy, and 2) it may just be better than the remake in my eyes.   The screenplay is great. It's a very funny script. I love how the film keeps the comedy going through the movie. The acting is pretty good. The movie is really good. It isn't your typical comedy. The music is nice.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've found a number of "great" movies this year. I'm not sure how many of these I've seen, and I could be forgiven for not knowing much about them.   In the spirit of a good horror movie, the story revolves around a woman who lives in a small, rural town in the mountains of Southern California. A young man named David Lander is her son's best friend. While a little boy, David loved playing hide and seek with Lander. As they grew older, Lander taught David about the importance of respecting others. Lander seemed to always have Lander's back in the world. David seemed to love this old man dearly. David has a hard time adjusting to life in this town, but Lander continues to stand by his boy.     I watched the film in one sitting.  The film is a blend of humor, horror and drama, mixing humor, suspense and some serious, albeit hilarious, moments.  This is a film about respect, loyalty and family. If you enjoy a good, classic mystery (one that would be quite entertaining if your grandmother were to visit you while you were out of town), a well told story about a father and son's relationship, and a good dose of suspense, then you should be in for a good time.  If you'd like to try something new and different in the horror genre, give this a look.  I received a copy of this from the Criterion Collection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It took me a few weeks to get ahold of the film, after I had seen it in one of those cheap-looking 3-D "documentary" films, that are all the rage these days. I got a box, a DVD, a soundtrack and a poster, that was supposed to contain the entire film. The poster had an original film still with the title of "Shaft" in huge letters on a black background, along with the number 8 on the top of the poster. What a shame it was.  It was a good film and I was looking forward to it.    As I had expected, there is a lot of dialogue, although not much of it is very interesting. It is pretty much a "Who's Who" list of the major players in the sport. I enjoyed the fact that even though they had a chance to win, they didn't. Their lack of concentration really annoyed the other fighters, as they were clearly not getting anything out of their fight. That's where the film does have merit. It had me wondering who the other participants were who were competing, but I couldn't be bothered to find out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen the previous movie about the last great hunter on earth: 'The Man Who Killed Godzilla'. It is another great film about a great film: a great movie. As in the previous one this one was great in every way. It did not waste any time in showing its story and in what happens when people try to kill the greatest monster in the world. As you can tell the first two thirds of the movie are mostly just a little chase scene with the monster. This was not bad but it could have been even better. After that the movie moves to the other side of the story and the real story starts: what was Godzilla to all his people? What was his love of living? Why did he not escape a few times before? Is he really a coward? How did he go down in Japan when it got so dangerous? After the fight scenes came a story about the monsters that were destroyed by a storm and the people living in the villages that are near the ocean. It was also interesting to see how some of the other monsters have changed during the years: the giant crabs that attacked Japan in 1954, the flying monsters, the giant insects that destroyed Japan in 1955. Even the fish are a different thing: the small ones are now larger, the large ones are even bigger. It has a real sadness and it is a tragedy that Godzilla did not survive. But what happened to the monster after all the fighting is not what you see in the movie. His body was not destroyed, he could travel the world and still hunt the monsters. He does it in his dream-like world: the one where everything is great and beautiful and peaceful: this is where the people are happy and have never seen a monster in their lives and they think that the monster is a god. They can go to the town and play football and have a picnic on a park with a nice view, they can have a dance on the beach or go for a ride in the ocean or they can go fishing on the lake: it is their paradise. This is where Godzilla is their God: in this dream world he has everything, he can do whatever he wants and all the people in this beautiful paradise love him. This dream world is the world where things can be different. This world is where a girl can have an apartment and a job. This can exist. But only if people don't care about anything other than what they have for breakfast and lunch: the monster lives in this world too
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** THE HILLS is a great story of the American Indians in Wyoming. They don't like the Americans. They are mostly farmers who were forced to live on the land because the United States wanted to move the American West to California. The Indians are the ones who moved the West. The U. S. Army tried to keep them from moving, but they refused and took off from the plains and settled in the Rockies. Their lives are miserable and their land is destroyed. The Army tried, but not very successfully, to drive them out, but it turned out to be a mistake. The Indian and the white neighbors have a lot in common. He is a good, honest man who wants to help the other settlers. But, a white soldier has been taking revenge on him for something that happened years ago. The two men are both honest men, but have different morals. The white soldier doesn't care who dies - only who does not survive. His plan for the Indian is to kill him with some poison and then poison his children. He has a lot of arrows. He does get to go out in a canoe once or twice. He finds the poison, which isn't much, and tries to go back home. He knows his family won't survive the poison. But he keeps thinking that he might be able to save a couple of the girls he was looking after. He sees a big buffalo. He wants to use his arrows against it. If he can get to it, he might make his way to California and rescue his wife and daughter. It is a pretty good movie, and a good story. I liked this one a lot. ************* I would like to read another book or two on the subject of the Indians. ___________________________________________ (Note: the film version uses English subtitles) _________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "When you have sex for the very first time with the man of your dreams, you may be a little surprised to find that he's got a few things to say." - I Love Lucy  The story of this romantic comedy (about a young man, played by Charlie Chaplin, who gets to know a rich, beautiful woman, played, naturally, by the brilliant Elizabeth Taylor) is a classic Hollywood fairy tale. Charlie's love story is the most touching of all movies. In a scene that will stick with you long after you have seen it the love of the beautiful girl for the man who looks like a giant of a man grows and develops with great drama and passion. It is also a love story between two people who love each other and know that a good man cannot be far from them. Posted by Tom at 12:01 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a shame about the ending. I felt it went out with a bang, and I think it would have been even better if it ended before.  I loved every second of it, and if you like action and drama, I don't think you could find a better movie than this.  I got this as a gift from my grandmother.  This was her favorite movie growing up and I watched it as a kid.  She loved the ending, and was sad for the character, even though they were both killed.  I think the ending wasn't in bad taste, but it was just sad at the end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really sweet movie, with some great action sequences. The story is not very complex and it could have been done with a bit more effort in plot. I also think the acting from the various characters is good in most cases and there is a lot of comedy as well as violence, which works very well. I would rate this a 3, but it would be nice to see a little less violence and a bit less blood. (6)   The second best movie from 1989 and the best movie of 1987! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like a lot of movies with action: action movies from this series are great and I like the character design.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************** My wife and I loved this movie. It is about the true story of an Indian family that was stranded on a desert island in the 1960s. The plot was very interesting. The movie was filmed in South Africa. The film is about three Indian tribes: the Shilka, the Chitra and the Tutsi. The Tutsis are the ones who are able to speak English and the Shilonis, the ones that could speak in Sanskrit. As I said in the beginning of the review, the script is very well done. There are many interesting and clever bits that we don't see in this movie because of the story. There is also a very beautiful, very realistic, animated picture made of colored stones that is shown when the Tutis first leave their village and go to the desert island. It's a beautiful picture. The picture was made by J.S.Byrne and is called "The Ocean". I would like to add that there is also an Indian song called "Oshilaka" which could be a very good song. The animation was beautiful and the scenes were very realistic. The dialogue was very good. The voice acting was very very good and the music was very well written. The only problem is that the story took a bit too long and I think that the movie would have been better if it took only five or six minutes longer to tell the story instead of seven and eight minutes. Also, the plot is not easy and it has a bit of a mystery element to it. The good characters and the good story of the movie made me very happy with this movie for a good family movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only bad thing about this movie is, that it takes a while to get going, and then you're wondering what the hell is going on. You start the movie with a long, drawn-out, in-depth conversation about the death of the leader of the Cult of the Black Sun. Then a series of bizarre and gruesome visions from the cult's most famous ancestor. And then the group heads to a cave in the middle of nowhere, and they are attacked by a group of naked children who seem to have some supernatural power... which the leader manages to use to kill a giant spider-man with his bare hands... in the dark! The movie then flashes back to when the Leader was a kid... and a group is trying to bring him back from the dead. And the Leader is a weirdo, but an odd, creepy weirdo... in all the best ways: funny, dark, and sad! In fact, it's the only film that I can think of, where it's so full of the weird, the strange and the bizarre that I just had to laugh. It's a film about a group who are trying to restore their leader to life. A group of idiots in this case. And you know what? I was pretty impressed with that. I was happy to see that The Black Man was a movie, with some decent characters in it, and a plot that didn't bog down at the end, unlike most of the other crappy, crap that came out that year. I found it interesting to watch an old cult leader trying to get back to the good old days, or some sort of weird, occult kind of thing, which I guess was a metaphor for the group trying to do. And what's more interesting is, he still gets the group into trouble at the film's conclusion... with a giant snake and more snakes... After that, you may find yourself wondering what on earth The Black Orchid was about... it has a great cast, and the pacing is pretty damn good, it even had some great visual effects that we wouldn't see again for a long time, and it has this amazing set of music... I'm not saying that The Orchid is a good film, because it is... but it really does have a great look to it, the movie has a lot of good visuals, some beautiful cinematography and some good, creepy sound effects. It has a kind of weirdly beautiful feel to it... which I loved, but
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story revolves around the characters of four men and the one woman who goes from working for a big company to become the company's top designer.  They want to improve the company, but can't because of all the problems which lie inside the company.  The company is not like any other company and the problems can easily cause a disaster and cause the company to go bankrupt.  As I said before, the story revolves mainly around the problems in the company and its director and there are no jokes or jokes to be found in it.  One of the problems about the movie is that at times you might think that they want to save the company which is what the story is about.  It is a good story but it does not get enough time to make any jokes.  Overall, this movie is very good and does not take long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is so well crafted that if you don't mind the lack of originality in the film and what is obviously a story that is a rehash of older stories, I don't see why this one shouldn't be a hit in the US and elsewhere for all ages.   The film is well written, the acting is good, the cinematography is great and it has a good score (the most exciting movie of the year I believe).   I was expecting something a little different but it didn't disappoint.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is good. I enjoyed it very much but I can understand why others felt the film was very dull, as it is. I think the story was well thought out, if a little predictable and the pacing was a little slow, but this is a movie that needs to be seen to be appreciated. If you are a fan of the franchise, you won't go disappointed with the film, but if you are on a mission to watch a fun, entertaining action adventure, this might not be for you. The ending was kinda weird (although it doesn't make much sense as to how it happened as the movie goes on) but not much else to say...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll start out with a brief disclaimer: I have no idea why this movie exists. I had no idea this was happening. I have absolutely no idea where the money for this movie comes from. The movie is absolutely horrendous. The actor is terrible. The rest of the cast is pretty bad, too. I won't comment further, but I hope that you, sir or madam, get your money back before I go to bed and pass out!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I watched this movie was the first day I was at college, I was in my new home, and I went to see it. It was the most memorable movie I have ever seen, it was amazing.  The movie revolves around a guy named Jim (David Arquette) who goes into this movie theater to see a movie called Love is All Around. Jim was a rich man at the time, but his money doesn't matter at all when his beautiful wife (played by the late Patricia Arquettes) is murdered. Jim spends his life trying to find out who killed his wife and how. This movie is a good look back on the '60s in LA.  It's so sad to watch how much this town has gone wrong.  The movie stars: David Arquete, Patricia Arques, John Larroquette, Peter Ries, Dermot Mulroney, David Bowie, George Erskine, Linda Larkin. It's one of those movies I had seen a million times and always laughed, it's hilarious, dark and twisted. I would recommend it to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is great and a great watch! This is a story about a young boy named Jake who lives in a very sad world. He is adopted into a family that does not treat him with the love and respect he deserves. He lives with his mother who has been ill. The film starts off with him being taken away from his family. There is something about a baby in a dark house. The movie does a great job with making you wonder what is going on. You think that maybe the girl has taken the baby to her family, but that is a bad thing because that is the last that we see of Jake. The mother is a very evil woman and he is her only child. Her husband also is very bad. She is so jealous of the young Jake. He will be married someday and she will make sure that he never has any friends. The only time that she will let him have any fun is when she is watching him play with a toy train. The rest of the movie is Jake living in a world of misery. The family does not like him because he will not play nice and will not talk to them. It is not until the boy is about 4 that he gets a toy that will make him happy. The people have all been brainwashed and Jake is the only one who is not. He does all of the bad things that is done by the people and has to work for the people. The evil woman is trying to get Jake killed. When she gets him in trouble, she will go to the next level and torture him. All she has to do is make him play dead for a few minutes and she can kill him, but she doesn't. The whole movie takes place over a short period of time. You have all of these horrible things happening and you just hope that the boy will make it out alive.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the end, this movie is a great and funny movie. It's like it's based on the movie 'How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying' by Steve Martin. It reminds me of this movie. In the end it comes down to this: A movie should have a decent plot, a good script, and well acted (at least from the actors that are there), but I think the director got the wrong idea: the screenplay should take itself more seriously than it does. I don't think that the director knew what he was doing in writing this and I would like to see the final cut of this. I give it a rating of 3.0/5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is based on a very interesting and well done comic book called the Marvel Comics "The Ultimates".  This comic was published in the early 60's and there has been no revival of it.  It is a classic run of comic books that has made them famous.  In the early 20th century, the superhero team known as The Ultimates have saved the world from destruction several times in a row and in their last battle, they managed to kill a mad supervillain called Dr. Doom.  This is their last stand. In the meantime, a team of evil scientists called the Kree/Skrulls, also known as the Illuminati, are on Earth trying to capture the Ultimates for one last adventure before they kill them and become god.  So what do we have?  The two worlds, the worlds of the Fantastic Four and the Illuminati are destroyed for their own good by evil characters.  The heroes and villains are separated by a great wall but are not destroyed and we get to see them work together to do their jobs in a very short period of time.  I am sure you are looking forward to a big spectacle.  In summary, this is a great fun movie.  All the characters and stories are in the action and the movie is a fast-paced action and adventure movie. If you like superhero stories, action and adventures then you will love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie, I mean really good. I mean there is nothing bad that I can say about this movie. It has some good action sequences, I think the first battle is very well written and well choreographed, but of course the main plot is a little too simple and I mean it's really stupid. I don't think it's a very complicated plot, because the main characters have a simple plot and so do their foes, it's almost like a "Bogus war" (or something like that). The movie is good enough to be worthy of watching, but the most important thing about this story, and the one I like most about this film, is the music. It's not very complex and the themes are rather simple, but I like the movie and I like this music.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Bag of Bones" is a film that shows how even the poorest people in the U.S. are willing to get up and go to work. The only problem is that they have no shoes. This is not a good thing, as the film is supposed to be about a group of people that need money to make a home and live. What they have done is they have taken the legs from a dead body by accident. In order to get the money to start a house they need to start the old woman on a drip to keep her alive, but even at the very end of this movie she is not much better off than when we started. So the old lady and her daughter have nothing to eat and there is no money to do anything for them except have a good time at the pool. It is a pretty fun film and although the idea of a group being unable to get a job is quite an old one, there are some pretty funny moments in there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To the people who asked me the question that is probably one of my favorite movies of all time: "Why did you make a movie about a man with a mustache", I'll give you a simple answer: Why shouldn't you? This is the type of movie that, without a doubt, all great directors are made of, and which could be an absolute classic without having to resort to the usual methods of "exploiting" the innocent. To me, the story is one of the most intriguing tales in all movies. It was like being in a dream and I found myself thinking to myself, "Wow, a man who never had any problems in life. He just had a problem with a little girl with a name that sounds a little similar to his!". The story and the style of this film make you think it would be a great adventure, and it certainly is one, especially if you watch with a good ear (but the film might not be for you with that). If you can get over those little things, then this is worth the watch. It would be good to see a good sequel too!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen more good ones than bad ones (or is this a bad movie?) but this one isn't one of them. It's more "a-typical" comedy with a "fry or die" plot. The plot is so weak I couldn't believe they were going for a good one. I guess it's a low budget comedy with one of the most incompetent and obnoxious actors I've ever seen and it looks like they never learned the art of comedy (a skill they seem to think they already possess). I don't think they were thinking about making a good comedy but they sure as heck did and just made a dumb one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Lebanon is a true story of how a couple of bad soldiers on the fringes of world war I ended up with the biggest heart of the entire film and the movie's only fault is the lack of an ending and the fact that the bad guys were killed in the beginning and left there and the ending is not satisfying at all. If you are a fan of WWII in all its horror then this movie is a must watch.   I gave this film a 4/5 due to lack of a conclusion and a somewhat bland ending.   a movie with so many great moments is a great watch but its a shame they didn't go further with the story.  …

The movie is about a man that goes missing from his home. His family doesn't know what to do. They do not know where the man has gone or why he has to go away. So the next day, he comes home and he tells them that he has gone fishing. The next day they go out and see him walking around. He is very quiet. They call his phone when he is coming to, but he does not answer it. So they call his sister, and she says that she never found him. They go to the nearest village to get information of his whereabouts. The villager says that his disappearance is very strange. So, the next morning, the family searches for the man. They find his truck and they see a body. They search for a day and they still can't find him. One of the neighbors said that the body looks like a young man. So he tells that to the family and they go to him. It is a young boy, but they say it doesn't look like him. The parents then look into the boy's eyes. He has blue eyes. When he looks at the two, they both turn to him and say, "Why is your hair like that?" He then says, "My name is Ben. It's a wonderful day in the woods today." He says, but how would I know? And they say that the boy does not look like anyone they know. The boy smiles at them and tells them to look inside the car that was next to him while it was running. When the boy looks into the back seat, he can see a man sitting in the driver's seat. The man is Ben and he is the last person that the family saw.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  At the beginning of the movie, we find our heroine (Amber Heard) waiting for her ex-lover to pick her up for a surprise visit at her new workplace. Her ex, Danny (played by Ben Stiller), shows up on the day after Christmas, carrying a gift that will surprise the young and innocent Amber. However, Amber doesn't believe that this is a present for her and is more than a little disappointed. He brings her a strange, very large knife, and proceeds to show off this very big piece of equipment around the office. However this is not your typical "knife-in-the-head-from-behind" movie as they find themselves having to solve the mystery of this large, very deadly, very expensive knife that is clearly used for killing. There are only three scenes in this movie that I thought were excellent. First of all, this movie is hilarious. I am a huge fan of comedy and this is filled with it. Also, the special effects are terrific and there are many scenes that leave your head spinning. I also have to give a special mention to Amber's character and the way she is portrayed. It's almost as if the writers were trying to portray someone who was more than just a pretty girl. She is smart, ambitious and extremely funny. If you liked any of the characters in films such as Mrs. Doubtfire or Gremlins, you will like Amber. This movie is a must-watch for those who like their horror as funny and silly as possible! I think that this movie would make a good Christmas movie for you and your family because you could tell that this was the very last Christmas movie that was made for quite some time and they did a good job of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â The Dark Knight Returns is not a film that is really "about" Batman. It's a film about how Batman must continue to be Batman. The character may be one of the most complex and interesting superheroes in fiction to be created in the twenty first century. Christopher Nolan's master work is the culmination of twenty years of work in telling the origin of the Dark Knight. It is not only the story of Batman's rise to the dark side, and his downfall when faced with a life of crime. The DarkKnight Returns is a journey to learn from Batman in the face of the corruption of society. Batman has become a metaphor for the very system that seeks to take advantage of human nature. He is the ultimate capitalist. The movie focuses on the way that Batman confronts the corrupting effects of the system. It doesn't try to be an allegory. It just shows the way in which Batman fights it out. Â With this film, Nolan took a character that had been through three movies in the past decade and made him a major character in his fourth movie.  The Dark Knight is also a very good movie for Batman fans. I would love to see a second part, because after the events in Batman Begins Nolan wanted to tell Batman's origin again in a longer form, but in 2005 he was already beginning to get bored with the origin. This gives the story its sense of urgency and its great feel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm sure everyone who's ever read a book has thought "Damn... why didn't I pick up the book?!" But no! It's only recently that people have started picking up books again after long years when I read a good old fashioned novel called The King of Time. This book is a good example of what a good fantasy book can look like, and it was written in a realistic, not too fantasy like way. The characters are all well developed and we're even given a little of the background of the world, although not a lot. But it gives us some depth to it. I had trouble with the spelling, though some of the words were hard to pronounce and hard to understand (and I'm one to talk about hard to pronouce words). But the writing is pretty good, and I don't think there's a lot of words to remember. One small gripe is the "Gooey, mama..." part, which was a bit too long. But the story was pretty good enough, so what's a little more? The King's War, as it's called in the book, is a war fought over the throne of the kingdom of Arelin. The king of Areminn is murdered by a member of his court, and his heir the king of the neighbouring kingdom (which is the kingdom where my son lives, which is called Erenos) is accused of being the murderer. But when the king's brother, the lord of the nearby kingdom, decides to become king, they are thrown into a war to settle the matter. If you want more, you can go to the following link. The King is an extremely well written story. We get to know not just our protagonist but also his two younger brothers as well. We also learn a lot about the politics of the kingdoms, and how each kingdom reacts to things going on out there. There are some nice twists that are unexpected in this novel. But what I liked the most is the character of the king, a young man who is learning how to rule his kingdom, with his brother in tow. There's a real feeling of family and trust. I'm very pleased to see what a long time classic of fantasy is now getting renewed attention, even from those who don't even read fantasy as a genre. The book is not just long but it's full of so much information that if you want to get to the bottom of a mystery, the characters will get you there
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story takes place in an urban area in a small town in Illinois. The lead character is an ex-convict, whose son is dying in a nursing home. His new girlfriend is pregnant. He comes to the house to help her clean up and she asks him to help with some gardening. He helps a young, blind girl (Hannah Davis) with her garden and she is interested in him.  They get along well in spite of his previous crimes. His "victim" is upset when they start to make love and the father and son are fighting about it. The boy tells his father that he has to go to a meeting at the police station to tell them about his brother.  They all drive over to the police meeting and they see that they have a suspect in custody who seems to have been involved with their daughter in some way. She has a mental illness and he is a criminal.  The police interview and take care of the suspect while Hannah, who has just finished her garden, watches helplessly. Her family decides to leave and get the kids and make plans to get in touch with the father to tell him about Hannah, but the boy finds something at home that they don't know about and he and his brother go back to look for it.  He finds out the truth that Hannah is pregnant and that she is not his son.  Hannah's father has killed herself and the two are in a state of shock. He tells them about a boy named Mike, who lived with his father. Mike is a runaway from the police and in jail for some crimes.   The only good thing about this movie is the acting of the actors. They all bring their A game.  My rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The most important thing about the movie is that it was made by the same director that made "The Last Temptation of Christ" and that it shows that he isn't about to let his hair get too long for a new masterpiece like "Tales of Terror" - but that is not what you think it would be. It's a dark and grim thriller that takes an old idea of terror, the evil spirit of the unknown in a small European village, and turns it into something quite modern and even quite terrifying. It works. The movie looks and feels like a French or Italian horror movie. The special effects and the special performances are just incredible. When you hear the screams the first time you are taken back to that old horror movie where the girl runs in fear towards the evil and when you start the next morning and see that the girl is gone with the evil you are sure that this time the story is only going to get much worse. The girl in the movie, the old woman who leads the villagers to this unknown evil force and the killer, who is now a young man are all very good characters. The way the characters behave makes this movie feel more like a fairy tale than a horror movie - and that is the whole point! I also recommend that you watch this movie in a dark room, at the darkest time of the night when you are alone in a room with a bed that will not move and the lights on the ceiling are on and don't see anything. But also, the music is superb. It is very, very eerie.

He is a wealthy businessman who has lost his wife and now lives on a ranch with two young sons.   When John is arrested for his wife's murder, Mr.Jumbo vows to find John and pay him off.  The film is set in the late 1960's in the western parts of California where Jumbo owns a ranch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a big fan of David Fincher's work, and a huge fan of his directorial talents.   David Finkler is an intelligent man who is trying to make his mark on the world.   But when the two people he wants to impress are both out of the country, David sets out to make things happen and find them.  His first stop is to visit the famous art house that is the birthplace of his great grandfather and the inspiration of his family's success.  It is here that David Fiskers' family business thrives.  The patrons of the art house are extremely wealthy and famous, and the art is well executed with a sense of style that is timeless.  Fisker, who has always been attracted to art, is excited to see the paintings by a famous artist who he has only seen in photographs before. He is also enticed by a great deal of money, and has little trouble finding all of the paintings.  This is one of those rare books that is great on all levels.  From David Fiskel's clever plot to a great cast of characters, this novel will have you reading and re-reading it several times.  Recommended.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about love, loss, and faith has made me a better person in my last few months of college. The characters were written in a way that is impossible to put into words. It takes the viewer along for a ride on their way to a new beginning after being rejected from a university of their dreams. I am still in disbelief that after years of watching it (in the theaters), I just had to sit down and do a complete rewatch of this. This was the best movie I have ever watched and I have seen some great films.   - June 26, 2007Good story, but very bad acting  Reviewer: T.K. - favorite favorite favorite - September 21, 2006  Subject: Not a great movie. Well, this is one of those movies that is meant to "make" you do something. That's not a good thing. The acting is pretty weak, the direction is pretty lame, the writing is so dry, the plot is the story of a woman's attempts to become an English professor, and a professor that tries to discourage her from pursuing that goal. That is pretty much it. The movie is not even funny! - September 22, 2006Not a great  Rating:
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ ___________________________________________ This is a great film and it is not overplayed like some other films are. It has all the elements in a perfect fashion and is very original, although the whole story line in it is pretty much the same as in the other two movies, which are very good, too. The plot of the other three movies are really funny, funny at times, and even some dark jokes in them. There is not much to talk about the characters in these movies and they are well cast, and the two young leads (played by two amazing and sexy actresses, both very hot and sexy), who are both in high school (one is a cheerleader), have great chemistry and I really enjoyed all three parts with them. The only thing I would not like to mention is the fact that this film was not as good as the other films because of the music, the dialogue and the ending. _________________________________ A great adventure. - March 16, 2007I can't get enough
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed the movie. It did not have a lot of action scenes. I was just hoping the movie would be a little more entertaining, but it was not. The movie takes place in the early 1980's. I feel like some of the characters were made out to be stereotypical for the sake of the plot. I really liked the characters, especially Mrs. Brown and Mr. Osmond. The plot did not go too far beyond a simple murder mystery, but the movie did not need any, because the characters played the parts just right, especially the couple. The way in which they had sex was wonderful. It was just the right amount of steamy. I hope that Mrs. O'Leary is going to get her own movie one day, because she is just so adorable!

It's a very, very, low-budget film.

He is a very bad guy but his bad acts are in this film to get the audience to think about that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The main hero is a little bit of a scoundrel, the story is interesting and the ending is a very satisfying conclusion to a good and entertaining movie. The character development is really good.    Recommended.  I love the concept of "the old man and his daughter"   It was great. I loved the "old man". I was watching that movie with a group of friends one night. They all said, this was going to be the best movie they've seen in a long time.  What a brilliant idea.  But then they started laughing as I kept watching.  Then it dawned on them that the old man is a big goofball.  This is the genius.  I will never look at him in the same way again.  It's not just the fact that he has a daughter. His character is just such a good, funny, character that you can't help but laugh. I was laughing with the guys, it was funny.  If you're a fan of Scrooged. Get this movie, you won't be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I finished watching this movie I was really disappointed. I didn't understand why the main character, Aida, was in such a bad situation. I would have never thought such a thing to happen to my beloved protagonist. It wasn't good enough to be a terrible movie. I found it really sad that she would have to be the one to have to get in trouble with some other girls in order to meet the love of her life. I am glad I finished it though. It really has a good story to it. The only thing I couldn't stand was the ending. I thought that the best thing that could have happened to Aida in the end was to live happily ever after.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is a movie that I watched at 11 and didn't bother to watch again until the first time I saw it at the age of 32.  I liked it very much and even though I've seen it several times since then it's never failed to live up to the hype I had when I saw the first one at 11.  The film was inspired by the cult TV series of the same name which was about a drug addicted drifter who was played by a young actor named Jeff Bridges.   A few people in the story are based off people I know and my best friend who was a fan of The Big Lebowksi has become friends with the actors who play the part of Jeff Bridges, Don Gummer, Vincent Price, and Robert Mitchum.  The film starts off with Jeff Bridges getting high on a heroin overdose and he meets the two main characters: Mike the heroin addict and his old friend Leb, who is a wealthy businessman who's trying to save his life.  It follows both Jeff Bridges and Leb as they live their lives and have fun as they get high, drink, and do things that the audience didn't see coming.  While the film is good at the beginning, the movie gets a bit predictable later on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: *************I don't know if I love this movie or not, so I'm posting about it anyway. I am an American in the 80s. There is a war. We are all called up, and some people are sent back to their country. Well, it's the '80s. We had a great time dancing. It didn't last. The US didn't win the war. What we do see is the war and people who fought it. We see the devastation the people in our nation have suffered in their country, both in a physical way, but also in a psychological way. What makes the movie so good is the fact that it shows the emotional damage to the people the war has caused and what the war did to people that had already been through a war or a war they didn't know about. The movie doesn't focus on the soldiers only, but on the people that were in the US army in the '60s and the '70s. It showed how everyone there felt the way most people would feel: They had fun, but they were suffering. Then the movie shows how the war affected them even more and the feeling of abandonment people felt once they went back to the US and left their families, friends and jobs behind for the first time in their lives. I guess the fact the movie doesn it's so close to being made, and the fact it is such a good film, made the idea that it had to be a musical even more possible. Then I realized I wasn't too far away from the musical theatre I loved so much in my younger years and so many people in my family loved. I started to picture it as a musical, and I knew that it would work. I went to see it in theatres and there wasn't a single person who didn't think it would be a success! It got its first Broadway show the day it came out and performed on the road throughout the entire country. It was an awesome success and went on to make over $100 million dollars in worldwide grosses. It has now moved to Broadway, and a Broadway premiere is in the works, and is a favourite of Broadway's directors and producers.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ The plot was really good and the character was also likeable, that was really the biggest problem i had with the movie. The movie had a really nice story and its just about a guy who lived with his best friend, the kind of guy that would try to help you out, and when you don't do exactly what you say he will get upset about it. So the guy has a hard day job as a pizza delivery guy but still loves his friends and they have a very happy life. Then suddenly the pizza guy dies and the whole story changes. Then the guy wakes up on the other side of the dead pizza delivery boy and is in a whole other world. Its a weird movie and I wish that it would be better, as it is just boring. ____________________________________________________ Follow the movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907723/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 The first 20 minutes was really boring, the movie was very good and it is a great movie to watch on a rainy morning when you are tired. ___________________________________________________________________ Follow the official movie:  http://twitter.com/#!/TheMovie_Movies And follow my channel:  https://www themoviemonstric.blogspot.com

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Escape:  It looks like Spielberg had to go and borrow a car from his friend, Ford, and set off on a road trip across America.  He managed to steal a brand new Cadillac Eldorado, a convertible convertible convertible.  It has this great '70s styling, which was only available as a convertible in the late '50s or early '60s, and is still available today as an E-Class.   It's been in the movie a bit, but the rest of it was all done on a studio lot in California, with a nice soundtrack.  This is where most of the action is, and it has to be a little disappointing to see what happens to the Great Escape if you try to drive the '60 model through a canyon.  There's a little more of the old Ford Mustang than the Eldorad, as well as a slightly new Ford Bronco and a brand-new Dodge Ram.  The Ram, in particular, looks like it's been plucked from the back of the new Ford F-150, and probably a little later in its development than it would have appeared.  I love the Ford F100, which is more a car than a truck, but in this film we get to see the F-100 in a whole new light, and I'm pleased that I saw this.  While it probably shouldn't be, it looks as good as it did on the set of Back to the Future: The Movie.  The driving of the Dodge and Ford is also very well done.  Some of the best stunt driving in a car is found in this movie, where we can see a Ford Thunderbird doing this:  Here we can also see the Ford Eldorador doing something similar to this: And the Dodge Challenger going pretty much the opposite way:  There are also some pretty wild stunts done on the way to the desert.  Spielberg also tries to make a little bit of fun out of a very serious subject.  We can see what the aliens from Independence Day are up to here.  They have a spaceship with a giant laser cannon and they want us to blow it up.  And the aliens have a little little car: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In any case, I didn't mind the movie at all. I enjoyed it, and even laughed a bit during a scene in which I thought that the movie was not about the'real' reality. I'm not saying that a bad movie shouldn't be enjoyed, but this isn't bad at all and I'm a believer. It's just interesting.  This is about a man who has lost his job in the oil industry, and now has to live off a government pension. He meets a woman who has some very nice characteristics. She is a college educated lady from a small town. They begin to get together, and they both enjoy each other's company. I don't know if I could describe how their relationship develops, but it's a story about the life of a woman. A very interesting story.

My only real complaint is that some of the people and things are just there.   I think some of them would look a bit better if they were a little more realistic, like a real human being would. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the more "out-there" films of the last decade, it's a strange, surreal comedy featuring Richard Gere and James Stewart as a pair of brothers who try to find the source of a strange radio signal they heard from a young boy who said he knew how to make a bomb. What follows is a chase, a hostage crisis, a chase to find a bomb, a shootout with the police, an escape, a pursuit of the bomb's source, a confrontation with the real source of the signal, and all kinds of strange things. While it is a bit of an oddity, it is very funny and has a lot of great performances. Richard Geren does a fantastic Richard Gero impression and the script is full of great lines such as "I don't see any of you carrying an umbrella here". This is not a very good movie but if you like a good comedy then you have to see this.

This movie was scary as a roller coaster with a loud screech, and a horrible ending. I thought I had gotten over the movie in high school and I was wrong.  What's not to like? I would never give anything but a 10 star rating to anything by this talented young director.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say I'm a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters. So much that the original film even made me question my sanity. This remake is exactly what I wanted and is so much fun to watch. I know the original was a very low budget film, but this was just about as good as they come. It had a lot of energy, great laughs and the best part is Bill Murray was always cracking a joke. He wasn't the only funny guy in this movie either, a nice young girl is on the scene as well. I can't wait to see the sequel where these guys are back at it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I thought this film was quite a treat. A mix of science fiction and comedy, it does an excellent job of capturing the sense of paranoia and unease of being chased by an unknown monster. The story is quite clever and the acting is very good as well. The film isn't exactly a science fiction movie, but it does make a good point. The writing, acting, and direction is great, with a few funny parts thrown in. You could be easily confused at times by the way the film is written, as it features a very high body count. --------------- A must see for any horror fan.   I thought this was a good film, though it may not be a real science fiction film. A few of the elements in the film are very much a science fantasy, such as the creatures, and the idea that time can be slowed down to a certain extent, which I think has a certain plausibility. Though it may seem a little too much in this film, it's probably a good idea to not believe everything you read in a book that is a science adventure fantasy, or it could be considered a hoax. Though the movie does take some chances and is rather funny.

I am a big fan of burley and oriental blends, but this is quite the departure from my usual preferences. It is a very dark, almost black smoke with a strong taste. It burns evenly and can be smoked at any time of the day, however it is best if smoked when the weather is cool and quiet. The taste is complex and rich with a rich aroma. I will probably purchase more of this fine tobacco. The blend reminds me of the old, burley based Balkan Sobranie which was a favorite of my father. I would highly recommend this tobacco. It would be a great choice for someone looking for a smoke that is not burley, but also not too strong. - July 1, 2006Good but bland  Rated 5 out of 5 by Pappy from Great taste, even at a low price I purchased a pound of this to try it out because of a low priced tin and because of the reviews on the interwebz. I must tell you that I am very pleased. The tin note of a very complex blend is very pleasing, with a very pleasing aroma. It packs well, lights easily, burns to a fine ash and has a good flavour. The flavor is slightly sweet and the aroma is the perfect blend of spicy oriental, and a touch of burly (I think). Overall a very good smoke and the price is right. I may even buy another pound! I will definitely be returning to this blend for future smokes. - June 14, 2006Great taste,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a very entertaining movie, with lots of interesting aspects. This movie is a good piece on psychology. This is one of those movies that will make you think about life a little bit differently, especially if you have to work in a hospital with a very violent patient.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies with a dark plot with a good amount of suspense. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ "The Night of the Hunter" follows the exploits of a group of Native American Indians who rob, kill, and rape during a time when the country is still trying to overcome its violent past. In contrast to the stereotypical characters of such movies as "The Deer Hunter," "A Woman from Taos," and "The Outlaw Josey Wales," these Indians are complex, thoughtful, and not at all stereotypical. They represent a diverse group of native Americans that included both male and female members who worked and lived side by side with each other. I do not know why the producers chose to film this film in black and white. The movie was shot in color to highlight the beauty of the landscape, but I guess this was a production decision by the producers rather than a choice by the actors. Perhaps the colors were chosen to match the mood of the movie more than their realism. The cast included Steve McQueen, James Earl Jones, Richard Widmark, and Mary Astor. It is also notable that these Indians, like the Indian Indians in "A Man Escaped," "The Last of the Mohicans," and the Indians in the television series, were all shot in black-and-white. While it is true that I could have watched all the Indians on screen in color, I could never forget how beautiful the scenery was in black & white. _______________________________________________________ A couple of years ago I reviewed one of the most realistic and beautiful films about Native Americans ever made: "The Boy Who Couldn't Jump." Although it took place during WWII, and therefore was in color rather than black and, for the most part, white, I found it to be the closest thing I could come to being Indian in the world. A few years ago when I was writing this review I was reminded of that film and the similarities to this film. Although I had been very critical of "The Hunt for Red October," I was quite intrigued by "The Day of the Trail." The two movies share many similarities; in that they are both violent, bloody, and realistic. The only differences are that this movie is set in the late 1800's, while "The Hound of the Baskervilles" was set in World War II. Both are also directed by the same person, James Hunt, and feature the same casts and actresses (who also appeared in Hunt's previous films). This is one of those films that I simply would not believe if I did not think it was so.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only negative about the film is a bit the fact that the movie does feel like it is missing something. The action scenes are not particularly impressive but I feel there was a decent amount of CGI used in the movie so the action is at the very least convincing and is not completely random like many other action films of the year like Die Hard and Die Hard 2.   Another thing that I find rather annoying about the movie is the ending. It is really too predictable and I found myself thinking, "What is this?" I did find it a bit disappointing as a final movie to make a series of movies to end the series and not have a more original ending as I felt the first movie did have.   I give this movie a 8/10  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best Thing that Never Happened is an odd, dark, but fun thriller. It starts off well enough, and that's not even mentioning the characters who are so unique and unique. The story follows a young woman who is taking an English literature exam after receiving a scholarship. That's not quite what her parents expect her to do, as they've left her to the care of a rich family which is just about to sell it to a German millionaire. As the parents attempt to make her pass the exam, the young woman's attempts to get out of the school and get to know more about her new family lead to...interesting revelations. The writing is really good as is usually the case in a John Carpenter film, it's quite good even if it is at times a bit hard to follow. The soundtrack for the movie was decent as is usual from Carpenter but it did bring some good moments to the film. The movie itself is not a masterpiece but if you like the type of movies Carpenter likes to make then this is a must watch. It's dark and disturbing so be prepared. There are plenty of surprises. Overall: 9.5/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this movie there are only so many scenes, but it is fun to watch and a great adventure in a magical and funny way.   The characters are all well written and each one is interesting and likable.  In a movie, that doesn't need a lot of special effects to look really good and has some special effects, it is funny and great to see.  This movie is great to watch as long as you don't know the original "Hercules" movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man From Another Planet  is, if you are going to make a sequel, an improvement on the previous film and an improvement in every way.  It's an action movie without the action, an adventure movie without a climax and a story that keeps getting more interesting. It doesn't give a definitive answer as to what the future held for the characters and the plot, which in the end, may be part of the reason it works. It's more like a story you can't wait to see.  In fact, I don't know why I didn't buy the complete series.  I guess it's because there was no reason to bother with these characters, except that they had to be there at some point in order to make the whole story work.  The rest are a bit too long at this point to bother picking up.  That's the way they should have been.  You could have written a novel or a novelization to tie up a bunch of loose ends and make this movie work. I'm still not sure that anyone would enjoy this movie too much, but I'm curious to see what the movie will do in the next film.  In a movie this good, the writing could use a little more work.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this movie, it was funny to see a person with a very thick Italian accent speaking to the camera to try to explain to the viewers the Italian pronunciation of some things: "It's not true, don't laugh" (to a girl trying to take a picture of the Pope). And there are some moments I remember like the guy telling the "black people" "Go back to Africa". The film is not really about the Vatican. It's about a group of young men trying to get into a "real" Catholic Church, the Catholic university, and their attempts at doing so. I thought this was a very funny movie, and I don't think I have laughed harder than I did while watching it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good movie. I like the music and the story. I didn't like the ending either. A movie where they kill the cat in the middle of the movie is an end of the story I don't like. So, yeah... If this is all your interested in I would say to watch this and then move on to the next one!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After a few episodes of mediocre action movies and lackluster rom-coms, the "B" team of Kiyoshi Tamura, Masato Kato, and Yuji Nagatani did a lot to shake up our expectations on a series that has become stale to the point where it can sometimes be a chore to watch. I'm not even saying it's as good as the rest of the shows in the "Akira" franchise, but that doesn't change the fact that it's just okay. What I did like about the show was the characters, as they had a lot of development and even some character development. Kiyesa Tamura is a very strong leader, who is strong enough to take down a demon lord. He is good at his job and is a good person. His love interest is very pretty too. I also like the idea of a magical world with humans who can fly, but don't have any super powers like Akagi and the other heroes. That doesn't make the show too bad, I thought it was pretty good when it came out. If you're going to watch "Akkara," do not go into this expecting to enjoy a good rom-Com. If that's your thing, this is not for you. It's just ok.

However, his wife wants to leave him and goes to stay with her cousin, who lives in the country.  And because she left her husband, the husband decides to make his wife stay. He has a garden that he does the work on.  While he's doing this he is visited by a man who asks for a job.  This happens a few times, but he always accepts.  Eventually he's put to work working the garden by a contractor.  Once a year the contractor, who is the father of the boy, comes to visit him.  The father asks him to build a chair for the boys to sit on.   Eventually the children have grown up into adults and the father has decided to leave the building in which he lives.  He buys a boat and leaves for the country where he intends to start a new life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a great movie, not just for the cast or the acting, but the story. After seeing the first trailer I was like - This movie is just going to be another movie made by a couple of guys who never wanted a job in the first place. I mean, you need to make sure that the main character is the least appealing human being alive. Now, I am not sure if there were a few of them (if that) who really cared about the main characters and the film's overall message and their intentions, but I was very disappointed at how most of the main and supporting characters treated the main heroine (well, main and secondary). The main character was the least interesting person on the planet. The only thing I really liked about the character was that he did not care about anything, and I guess he was an idiot for being in high school. All of his friends did care about him though. And I guess most of his problems came from the fact that they did not want him to do stuff he was not going to do. So while he did have some problems of his own, I guess the other people who hated him were doing more than just hating him. They were hurting him more than he was hurting them. This movie was a good reminder that you must not take anything at face value.  I really wish this movie was about some sort of a different plot, but still, it was good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The title is pretty self-explanatory, and it is very much true. The movie starts out quite promising, with the first shot of a very nice looking castle looming in the distance. The film, while a little predictable at times, is a very pretty ride. If you like romantic comedies or the kind of stories where love is a great burden, this is for you.   It is a pretty good, well-paced romantic comedy, with a lot of laughs and good character acting, so if you enjoy a good, romantic comedy then I'd say go for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a very good movie.  The performances are good, the plot is not spectacular but does not need to be to be good.  This movie is about a famous gunfighter, and also about his old friend, who happens to be a retired U.S. Navy captain.  They go to a gun show and get a chance to test out the new.50 caliber, a pistol that is supposed to be the "World's Greatest Handgun." "I thought, I could fire a.50 with a good aim... and now I am a retired Navy captain? I guess this is what happens when a.45 ends up in a.38." Here's a photo of the movie poster: It says the movie is set in Philadelphia:   This was the first of two "Philadelphia" movies:    It is set entirely in Philadelphia.  You can't tell from the posters how large the city is.   The streets are lined with old buildings, some new, and a lot of buildings are boarded up, but I can see why Philadelphia is a favorite place for crime movies.  There is one good crime scene, in the old theater at the old city cemetery.   This is the scene at the end of the film when Valance and his friend are walking out of the theater:   The man who is on the run is not the murderer.  He turns out to be an undercover cop.  No one in the movie bothers to find out that the police was behind the shooting.  I was disappointed that they didn't find out who was really behind the crime scene and put in the bad guys to bring down the good guys.  The story is about Valance, a young gunfighter who is still learning to be honest and to use his gun competently.  During a firefight that Valance has been involved in, he uses a pistol called the "Winchester".  I have read that this pistol was a real Winchester, but there is no way to tell for sure.  It has a fairly short barrel.  So there's no question about whether it is the real Winchester or not.  I'll assume for the moment that it is real and it's the same one that they use in the film.   This pistol is the gun that is used to shoot the guard at the bank in the beginning.  Then it is used for a couple of scenes that are

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have only seen this movie once and I enjoyed it even less then I did the first time I watched it. The plot is like the first half of a terrible movie. A few people in a trailer park (the trailer park is set in the '50s) are going to get out of there by getting a movie made. Everyone thinks they have done it.  The director says "The movie is called 'Escape from the Planet of the Aliens' and it is about a group of people who have to escape the planet in a spaceship."  Yeah, I don't know what the 'planet of the aliens' was, but I do know that it wasn't a big star-studded star-land like the one that had just come out at that time.   I was only able to find this movie at an art house theater in Chicago (the art house only played this film from March through November of 1956).   The movie, as I said, was pretty bad.  The plot wasn't good, it didn't make any sense, all of the dialogue is cheesy and all of it seemed to be going to the same place.  This movie is not as bad as the one on MST3k, where the movie doesn't make a good case for being a bad movie but is just another generic sci-fi movie.  I didn't really like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Chill is a great film that has a number of surprises and even more surprising endings!  I was never sure if the film would have any of its ending surprises or if it would just come out and kill me at the end.  If I remember correctly the film seems to have an ending that seems to be so out of left field that it seems like a dream to me.    It was a good film that took a short film and made it longer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I know it's long. A long, long time. I was going to review a short little film, a film with a great story and some great actors, but the film itself is not long at all, but a very, very very long movie. It begins like a bad soap opera, and slowly but surely transforms into one of the greatest and best movies I have seen.  For a film of this length, it really isn't that bad, it's a very good, entertaining little film. The cast is good. The actors give wonderful performances. I always feel uneasy about watching the same actors in a movie like this, I feel like I'm not really being entertained. The director does a good job at putting a new twist on a very old story. It is good, but not great. So many great performances, so many good scenes, so little story. The film has a plot, it does. But it is not very well developed. The story is the usual soap opera setup, and then as soon as the main character is introduced, the movie starts spinning around the edges. It's not that the story of this movie is really bad. It isn't. The characters are great, the acting is great, and most of the ideas are good. I suppose in one way, this movie does work. The movie was originally scheduled for release in 1990. As we all know, there was a major war in Central America in 1992. So, for some of the people it was just a continuation of the previous film, but they decided to release it this time in 1991. The main story is about a father and his son going to Los Angeles to take care of his daughter's ailing mother. When they arrive there, they meet a man named Luis and he has decided that his daughter has no more life to live. The old man is not too sure, but he does not want to take her from the father. Luis goes to a doctor who says there is nothing they can do and that the mother has just three months to live, but that is if her heart stops beating. Luis doesn't even know what an ailing heart is supposed to look like. When Luis sees the mother of his young daughter is really close to dying, he becomes desperate for money. One day a woman gives him a letter for his daughter. Luis knows that this letter must be from his wife because he never heard back from her. He takes the letter to the man who wrote
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is pretty much a sequel to "Hair" and "Fashion." It stars the original "hair" and some new people, including a new singer. The movie is about a woman who becomes obsessed with a man and tries to find the man behind her. Her best friend starts to feel her interest, and this is the way the movie gets going. It has a lot of slapstick humor that makes it funny, and there is an element of romance here too. The acting is good, and the director does a good job with the animation. The art is good and the music is decent. There's a small sequel called "Shoes" that is the exact same characters as in "Shampoo". I don't recall seeing this film, but it was released on video. I have a couple of copies and have never seen it, or heard of it either. It was probably a good mistake on the film's part. But I love this movie, and I'm pretty sure I'll always remember it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An adaptation of the film "Night of the Living Dead" was being made in Italy when the director went bankrupt. A new producer was brought in to produce the movie which was to have the same title. This new producer did not want the movie to have a title. Instead he came up with the following title: "Nightmare on the Orient Express". When it was being shown in various cities around the world, audiences were not pleased with this title. Finally the studio got tired of arguing about the movie and ordered a remake. Now the name is changed to "The Living Dead", which is more like what the film is really about. It is a nice little horror movie about a family of four that has to endure a house fire. It was made in 1953 in England, and this is one of those films that I always enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie like this shouldn't come around very often! I know I've already said a lot about it, but it's a movie that you should watch again.   It's not a great movie, it's not the best film of its kind, but the story it tells, along with its great acting performance makes it more than worth your time. It's a very unique movie, you'll never get this one before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I went to see this movie and were both blown away by it.  I thought the movie was entertaining enough with some well-acted scenes and great performances by everyone in it. I like that you can see the characters' reactions to the situation they are in rather than just a dialogue-driven story. It seems like it may be a little more than three acts, but it's well made.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hans Zimmer's Zimmermann, directed by Hans Zimmer, is a fantastic and wonderful movie. It's a story of a rich Austrian family who lives in a house in the mountains of Switzerland. The family is a little rich and the only son, the son of the Baron who owns the house, the Baron was an alcoholic, and the Baron's son was a pretty good soccer player but his father died while he was playing and he took up the sport as a way of making money so that he could get money back for the house. There is one day that the Baron decides to make a vacation for his family in a small Swiss village but he was not sure that the village would want to see a rich family leave in such a short amount of time as well as a rich son who is only 7 years old and will only be playing soccer with boys around 8 years of age. The Baron arrives and tells his son to get all of his things out of the car and the rest is a very happy day! The house is very cozy, the children are all excited and very excited to have a vacation with the Baron. The movie does a great job of showing a small village with its little shops and homes. However, the characters of the people in the village are just too perfect. In particular, there is a girl who is the captain of the school soccer team and who is always trying to impress her friends by acting tough. The character of the parents, the father is more soft spoken than the wife. In addition, the parents have a very close friendship with one another and the kids and the parents actually have a little banter between them. The wife in particular is really sweet and seems to have real fun playing with her two kids. The other great thing about the movie is the music from Hans Zimmer. The music is a combination of classical music and jazz music. The song 'A Night in Sousa' starts off the movie. Then there is an interesting song called 'Valse des Larmes' that is pretty funny and ends the movie with a song called "Jouant" that is a great song that is reminiscent of the movie 'Cinemania' (1964) with some good French music. Overall, I thought this was a great movie. The cast did a great and enjoyable job on the roles they were given. I really love the music in the movie and when you watch it you are very entertained.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know this movie is based on a series of books, but it has enough going for it that I'd give it a go as a summer blockbuster.   It has the "mash-up" factor that I'm getting tired of. I enjoyed the first film just as much, but the book series is interesting.  A new cast of characters are introduced and have a nice time before things get a little... weird.  I'll probably see the next sequel...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of the classic monster movie by King Kong was adapted into a story of adventure that is also a love story and a horror movie. The movie is set in Hawaii which is also the birthplace of the great explorer Sir Francis Drake. His ship the Revenge and two other ships, the HMS Menai and the HMS Eagle, are searching for an uncharted island. While searching the island, Drake comes across a huge ape with great power, the monster King Kong who kills two explorers on the first day and then leaves them to die. The two explorers are brought to a prison called the "Witch's Island" where they meet an ancient witch, who turns them into apes with great powers and sends them after the ape's brother who wants the same powers for his own. The story is very good and has a nice plot and great characters. There is a great score and the special effects that were used in this movie are impressive.   The special effects are very well done with great effects. King Kong has some of the greatest body parts ever and his head is the highlight. The ape has a great voice, especially the big ape roar as his father. It is a very funny and fun movie that I highly recommend watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It feels like an early 2000s version of the '90s superhero film. It features many of the same 'classic' tropes, including super heroes beating up criminals and then saving the day again. It's got plenty of funny moments and has a lot of heart, with a decent story and a nice soundtrack to go with it. You might not like the cast though.  The Good: I think this one can be summed up quite quickly: a super villain takes over a city, then sets about destroying it. He does this by stealing a very rare time crystal that gives him limitless time to build his empire. So he creates a new city, creates a big army of robots (or "robo-kings") and then he builds a time machine so he can go back in time to stop the events that created his nemesis, who was created by a villain called The Red Baron. And to stop his villains going back in the past, a group of men are recruited to battle the robot-king. Unfortunately for them, the Red Baron has a new toy in the shape of a flying, metal-skinned horse, which he calls "Cannonball". And he's very...intimidating. But they do their best and eventually manage to stop him.

And the characters are drawn very well. I liked the story with the characters, I also liked the music, and the ending was really good.    The music and the animation were very good. And with some nice characters and the clever plot it was an enjoyable story.  The only thing that disappointed me was the ending.   My rating: 6/10. I enjoyed the story but had some problems. It has the story where people believe that the ghost is real. If you enjoy "Candy Man" and liked the movie, I recommend this story. The story has some good humour. It might be good for kids, adults and everyone that likes a good ghost story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is very simple, and its easy to figure out what its about. We follow a man as he is dragged through the streets of a city that is falling to pieces. Its basically a slow pan out to an old man that shows a beautiful girl who he believes is his long lost bride. His friend, who is a very angry man, tries to stop him and try to convince him to go back to his wife in the city. This is the main story but there are a couple of short stories mixed in. The first is about a group of children (one is named David) who are sent to a boarding school by their father. They are all good looking and happy, they all seem to have good intentions but when they go to their first day of school they find it empty. It seems they were all thrown out by their dad because they are all bad boys who all hate each other and are all about to cause trouble. The story goes on about how they try to survive at the boarding school without any other help. Its a very depressing story, and makes me feel sorry for them. The second is about what seems to be a young couple at first but is revealed to be about a mother and son who are in love. They can't talk to each other about it for fear of losing the other, but it goes a lot further than that and reveals the true feelings and feelings of the mother to the son. The final story is one about a little boy who can only talk, and what he thinks is his father is actually his real father. His father comes across as a very evil man and does very little but tries to make life miserable for the boy. What happens is a slow slow reveal of his true feelings about his father but there is a great final scene where the father gives his son the real reason he is there... he is his son's protector. This movie has been released in many other countries but you will probably have a harder time finding a copy of it than i did.  It is a nice little movie, and is really worth watching.  Rating: 4/5

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember the first time I saw this movie (I am a big horror fan). I remember watching it on a Saturday night and my mom made me stay in bed till after midnight, because she didn't want me to "become a freak" like the rest of the family. So I didn't really get to get to know the movie that much. But I do remember it's "scare factor" was pretty big because they didn't use it much and you never got to see what made the little girl do something so crazy (well, we were lucky there wasn't someone "sniffing around" but no one was really in danger I think).  If I have to mention just one negative that I could find about the movie though it would be that the little woman's name is never mentioned.  Just like in this movie, you never get to meet her until halfway through the movie when she is going to the police to report the murder and she turns out to be the "real culprit".  The movie ends on a cliffhanger, so you never really get the answer and are left on a note of suspense.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061216/  Watch this movie: http://youtube.com/#!/watch?v=8i3pz_cKiTk

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never read one of the Harry Potter series.  The first book seemed fairly uneventful, but the rest of the series was a huge distraction, mostly because of the characters.  It's true that these children are in love and the best parts of their romance was very moving, but there's a lot of stuff going on that doesn't add up.   It seems like the author (who should have been a teacher, since the child of a minister is one of a very few characters who can do magic) has a good idea that she needs to be able to tell the children what their magic can do, but she is a great dramatist and the kids can't tell their magic from real life. The last book is the best one.  The last of the seven Harry Potter books,  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  was a big disappointment for many reasons, one of them being that, in spite of the good books in the last book, the book as a whole is pretty bad.     This was also a movie that had a great theme, but it wasn't executed the right way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It took quite a while to get to this movie, but once we did, we had a fantastic time. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit so I don't want to spoil things by saying more, but a great movie that you don't have to spend a lot of time watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those stories that I wanted to watch when I was a teenager.  I remember a few people telling me how much I loved that movie and how great it was.  The way it opens and closes is one that I am very fond of and it has the perfect pace.  Even the ending is awesome, with the perfect little nod to a few of my childhood heroes, James Bond  and Dirty Harry.  It does all of this without trying.  In fact, it is quite tame in most respects, with all the violence done very tastefully and with a little bit of humor thrown in for the right amount of shock factor.  I have seen this movie so many times over the years, but I always enjoy it when I have the chance to.    If you are a fan of action movies, please look into the amazing and original, and I can say without a doubt, this is not your typical story where the hero comes to an ending with a big payoff.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first thing you may notice about the movie is how it looks.  You'd think that a guy who is in a long-running western series such as this would have a big budget to hire a stunt coordinator or an art department to make this movie look more like the old Westerns we all used to see... or that way at least.    The story is pretty decent though not particularly memorable (the only thing that stands out for me is the fight between a cowboy and some bandits.)   So there are no long dialogues, the dialogue is done in a very quick-paced action way that has more impact than a lot of the movies in this genre.  The animation is okay, it shows the action well and all the effects are real.  There's a little violence to be had here, some blood splatter and some bloody hand-to-hand fight.  Overall, the film has a good story and a fun action-style.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am an unabashed movie goer, so when the chance presented itself to see my local theater run a classic movie, I did what any self-respecting person would do: I drove to the theater. I got to the auditorium and found about 20 seats were vacant. I waited in the lobby for about 20 minutes, all of which was well spent. I finally got a seat, a large one that had a view of the screen from a great distance. This was probably the movie I was most looking forward to! I started watching in a very non-cinematic way, without really paying much attention. It certainly was not a great movie, but that wasn't what I expected of this one. As I was watching, I felt that a real human drama was being played out in this movie, and not one filled with cheesy acting or cheesy dialogue, but a truly gripping and heartfelt story. After this, I was left with an incredibly strong feeling of pride in myself as a film watcher and a human being. I am still trying to process exactly what I experienced so many years ago. But, I am glad to be a film-lover and to have been a part of something that was so truly special. I still can not believe it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My son and I went to see " The Man from Atlantis ", a movie by John Boorman. I was so impressed with the movie that I decided to write a review. This movie is in a class of its own. I really thought it would be a great little comedy, but it turns out to be the story of the relationship between a guy and his alien sidekick. This is really a story to watch with your kids, and even if you don't believe in the guy's alien sidekicks, I bet you would like this movie as well. I hope this review can get your children interested in a film like this and to watch it with them at some point in the future. The movie was short (5.5 hours), but not to short. The story was good, the sound was good and the acting was good. I recommend this movie to anyone with a taste of John Boorer's work.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I enjoyed this movie a lot, but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't mind the ending as it does add to the theme of the story but for me it was abrupt and disappointing. The story centers around a girl who discovers the corpse of a boy who was in a relationship with her. The girl is determined to find out the reason why the boy died and the girl takes on the role of a detective. I liked the mystery aspect of the movie because I liked a good mystery and I think this movie is a good one. I give this movie an A-.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been waiting since the day I got it for a decent and action packed movie. I think this movie does a pretty good job at making a classic with some fresh new action scenes in the second half. There's even a cameo by a favorite character from the book. There may have been more action, and the movie is more serious, but the humor is still there and I think that this one is better than the first film. There are still some characters I don't like like that much, the two main characters, though, are quite funny. This one is a fun movie for any action or comedy fan. It also has a couple of interesting characters like a guy who makes and sells weapons and a pretty bad guy who has a daughter. The ending of the movie also leaves a smile on the face. It's definitely not the best movie I've seen, but it is a worthy sequel.  Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.  the other one was alright

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************* It had the potential to be a masterpiece, a modern classic. I liked it, I loved it, but most importantly...I enjoyed myself. It is not a 'great movie' I must say. It's just a good film, an enjoyable movie to watch if you want to enjoy a movie that is not to the point and is not boring. You need to watch this movie because it's very, very good, very witty with a brilliant soundtrack, and the best and most realistic female lead. But I must make a disclaimer! This movie is a little bit silly at times. There are even scenes where people are running around and talking silly and the movie looks like a comedy, but they did not make a comedy of this film, they made a movie about a man who is very, VERY smart and has an interesting life and I love it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie. It was a bit slow and it needed some character development in the end, but it had a lot to give and it was still entertaining at the end. The plot is pretty simple - after some strange events in her past and some strange new experience that she had while working in her sister's restaurant, she is sent to a hotel for the duration of her summer holidays. After a night out, she meets a young man, but not a good one - the handsome young man has the ability to see into people's souls, and he is able to sense a lot of things about her and even about herself. It turns out that they share a strong connection - and he promises to help her with this connection if she helps him with a difficult situation.  The rest is pretty good. A good story, a well-written script. The film is not very well-edited and is probably shot on film from a 35mm film, so it's pretty old-fashioned, with a lot old-timey music and old-style lighting. I don't understand what they were doing here - why they bothered to include a scene of someone walking up the side of a mountain... I'm guessing that it was meant to make you feel the cold breeze, but really, it just makes you feel like you're being watched by someone you don't know or who could be a creepy old person. They probably shot the whole movie on a sound stage and only shot what they thought was appropriate. The special effects are very amateurish - I don t remember a single shot from this movie that didn t look like it was just made with a Polaroid.  A few of the acting actors are good - I liked Kiefer Sutherland and I think the movie needs a few more young actors. And yet, this movie has a lot more potential to become great than it did in its entirety.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie. I like the way the movie is set. I think the film has a lot of humor in it. There is a scene where two detectives go through a small town trying to catch some thieves. One of them is a female police officer. She is in a very funny scene with a man who says that "you are never funny when you try to put a collar on an animal." It is good to see a female cop get funny.   I'm going to start by saying that I am a little biased towards this movie, because I've watched several versions of the film. I have to say, though, that I've not seen the uncut version. In fact, my first time watching this version was probably on a VHS tape, I believe. It was in a local store, which was about 50 years ago. Anyway, the movie plays with a great sense of humor. There are a lot going on in this movie (as opposed to the usual action-movie fare, such as the Bond films) which makes the comedy much more enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed how the main female character is not an all powerful super female warrior, but rather a very humorous, wisecracking, fun-loving, silly woman. Also, it's nice to see something from this time period because there really isn't that much on the screen. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the effects are, which I always like, because they make the action a lot more exciting. I thought it was funny how some of the characters were very different than most of the men we know, and how they would react if the women around them would act more masculine (in a good way).   The music in the movie was also fun. You have some great music by the Beatles, which is a fun, memorable song. The voice actors are all good. The one drawback I had with the movie, was that it seemed very repetitive. There were a few times that I was just thinking, "Ok, I guess that's it." It has all that is a "good cop movie" about a great detective. It just ends before it really could've been a good detective movie. It felt like I could just feel the movie ending, though.  It's not a bad movie, but it's not really great either. It's not bad at all, but nothing really stands out about the movie. There aren't many good jokes or any
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The biggest problem with this movie is its lack of heart.   It tries very hard to be funny, but really the film suffers from lack of emotion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A couple of young men meet each other and decide to join a motorcycle gang for a fun ride but all of a sudden a big fat Russian named Vlad is there and begins to have a sexual affair with the two young men, with the result that it results in a very graphic, rather grotesque sexual encounter. (hide spoiler) Saving the planet from the bad guys:  This movie isn't too bad, there's some really nice acting and some pretty good action, but it's all in service of what a sadistic, abusive man like Vlad is, it's not a really sadistic and abusive man but it sure does show this character is not all sweetness and light and he really is very cruel, it is like he's a demented sociopath, and I think he will not be the only villain in this movie and the one who gets his revenge will be the hero who is betrayed by his own mentor. Overall Rating:  I liked this movie a lot and while I don't think it was all that great, it was still a fun watch so you can have some good laughs and watch some interesting characters go about getting themselves killed, it seems like it was a lot of fun, so if you haven't seen it yet don't skip this one and get out to the movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't expect to see this one on my first visit to the UK. I've seen all the Bond movies over the years, and like all the others, I've never really enjoyed them. But with Skyfall the old Bond is back. And this is my favourite Bond movie. This movie doesn't seem to be set in the past. You have a Bond who is trying to deal with a very real threat in a very realistic way. There's just a certain sense of menace that I don't think there's been from Bond since The Spy Who Loved Me.   This movie, though set in 1973, really feels contemporary. The action is much more intense than anything seen before or since in the movie. There are some great set pieces and a thrilling ending to the film. The soundtrack is also superb. There have been a lot of Bond films and I still really enjoyed Skyfall. It's a little bit dated now, but if you like good movies with good action, you'll like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The good: One of my favourite movies of the year, directed by Tim Burton and based on the French comic The Biggest Adventures of Laverne & Shirley. The good and bad: The story: Two middle-aged parents are planning a holiday to La Palma and a picnic, which is ruined by some crazy man. The bad: There are some serious problems with the plot - like: who is the Biggest Adventure of La Verne & why does he have a beard? There's a big problem too with the dialogue and acting. It's almost like reading a story by William Gass - but not funny. One of the characters was also quite annoying. Another major problem is a long list of sub-plots which can be seen if you want to look up at the film: The whole 'tentacle party' episode is pretty pointless, there's an episode of 'drumming' which is rather repetitive - and there's also some kind of 'lucky card' thing, which isn't funny. There's also a 'dinosaur hunting' episode which is a complete waste of time - and a very long sequence of the badger eating the Bigest Adventures of Little Beaver. The funny ones: There's quite a few funny moments but only between the children and the Bad Guy. And the best part is the scene where they have to go over to La Verna (La Palma) to pick up their mother from work because her car is stolen. At the end there's a strange shot of a giant, grey-coloured, floating monster - so that's a nice change of pace. So I wouldn't say the story is bad or that it's dull; I just think it's a really bad film, mainly because of the story."

I think the story and the acting is very good. The first 20 minutes to 40 minutes are really good but then around 40 minutes it loses its charm and gets worse (and I mean worse than the bad action films that the same director made recently). The second movie is much better.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hey, what's the worst that could happen in a movie about the life of a teenage girl? A young girl who has a pretty decent life and is never in trouble and never gives up? Not so fast. This movie is the epitome of evil. I was very disturbed while watching this and really thought about burning it (I don't really know what else to write here) until I realized it was about a group of girls who try to find a lost boy who was kidnapped by a gang of mean, murderous, cruel people with a secret. I'm going to let the kids speak for themselves because their story is even more horrifying than the movie is: - After the girl who was supposed to be the "heroine" is kidnapped, the gang goes around robbing other people and getting into trouble - The gang has a big gun that shoots fire and is about to attack an innocent girl but then the other gang shoots their guns at them instead and is a bunch of kids and a group (the "hero" group) who want revenge. - When the "troublemakers" come back, the "girl" is really upset that she got caught in this and tries to get the guns back and then all hell breaks loose... But that's not all! - The "dumb" leader of the bad guys is even worse than his gang: - He has no mercy, he kills the "dummies" who don't shoot back, and if one doesn't, he'll kill that person too. - The most horrible part of this is that he and his gang get their revenge by robbing all the people who made the "good guy" get injured - The girls who do the gang's jobs are not even good at what they do: - I really couldn't tell you what they are doing. One is a teacher, the other is in a coma after a car crash and is getting worse, another is a girl who can't even tie her own shoes (not really true, the shoe was made of something) - Their main job is to help the leader with the robbery, a job that is so hard that it's almost impossible. - They are not trained in anything or even in anything they have done has any value, and all they have is a knife that can cut through anything if they try (even though it doesn't exist, the knife is made of steel and even the steel has to be taken from the victims). - They don't even think of the
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great film, even a classic. I think this is the best John Wayne movie. The writing is very funny, but even better than that is the acting. This is one of those movie where everybody has a good time. Some of the characters have a little extra something - I can't say what - but all the characters are good and funny. The story is very good. The ending is perfect.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good fun, but boring plot I like the premise - a man goes into the woods to meet the ghost of his father. I also like the character of John Wayne, who seemed like a good man. The movie doesn't give much to the plot - only a small part of it: The man meets the ghost and the story continues. What really matters is the character development of the main character. It's clear what the man wants: to get the ghost's help to find his father - he wants to find the ghost, because he feels his father, like his uncle before him, was lost in the wilderness. He doesn't even really understand what he's talking about, and he's not a very clever man. But I guess it's important to have a person with such a strong desire for the ghost to assist him, even if he doesn't really know exactly what his father is going to help him with. This story doesn't tell a story, it just goes to the next scene. It also leaves out a very important person for the movie: John Wayne. After he gives a good performance, we can see why he is good, and we can also see why the people around him don't like him - he's always yelling at people - I was also disappointed by John Wayne as a movie hero - he could have shown more of his feelings (even if it was only a little) and his weaknesses. But that's okay, he is a good actor and I don't know if I would have liked him better had he been cast in an American film. Overall, a very good movie, which is good because it's good.   Rated 2 out of 3 by K.J. from Horrible acting I saw this movie as part of a film series (that's how I found out about it) and thought that it was very similar to others like the Western and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, but the performances were atrocious. John Wayne was one of the worst that ever lived...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last film I saw about a young German Jew, a couple of decades after his deportation in 1942, to his death in Auschwitz is now available for a much-needed viewing. It has a very interesting ending that was very well done, but a somewhat understated and unspectacular movie. While I am not interested in the plot of the film or the people I met who lived there, and am not particularly interested in Hitler, I can appreciate the end result and hope that it will serve as a useful corrective to those who would distort, distort, exaggerate, and overstate. The best of the films that followed was not even the best of those made in the war. They are all of a piece and the film makers had a great time making it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all I am very sorry that I had to do without this movie for a long time. The story takes place in the 1930's and the main character is a small boy named Charlie who finds out that he has to fight to be an adult by defending the little girl with the help of an old man and his wife and daughter. Charlie must first discover that he is a little girl and in the meantime must fight with other little boys who also want to become little girls. Of course they also want their turn to be adults and do not understand how Charlie is so small. The movie is good and if you can tolerate the bad language, I think this is a good, and even more touching film. I think the movie ends with a great cliffhanger, as it is easy to predict how the end of this movie will be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was the kind of movie that had me rooting for the hero, because after the first few minutes you could tell this guy was in a bind. His wife is in the hospital with a life-threatening illness, her family has been taken hostage and his sister has been kidnapped. I was so sad to learn about what was happening in Iraq and when I watched this movie I got a glimpse of why. There was one scene that stuck with me, in which a guy was killed by a roadside bomb. But the good thing about the movie is how it brings the story to a satisfying ending. It takes all of five minutes to accomplish the mission, and when the soldiers come back with the body in a sack I knew what that meant.

I was kind of expecting the more confident girl (who played the part) to get beaten up by the shy one and then the guy to beat the shit out of her. It didn't happen. Not that it didn't hurt, and I did look down on her (I don't know why I did) but the girl was clearly bigger than the guy who was obviously a bit nervous. But it was kindof funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most underrated movie of the year was   made in France   in 1975 by  Jean-Claude Van Damme,   who was at his best in this movie.   He was the best.  He also had the nicest voice ever, especially when fighting the bad guys in the movie. It was very well acted and choreographed.  And it was a great adventure movie!   My favorite characters: Van Dammes, the bad guy who wants to kill a rich woman who took the boy to get his shoes, but ends up saving his family. He also has a great role as a good guy and a bad guy.  They all had great performances.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** The final product is good enough and the effects are pretty good. My main problem with this movie is the fact that it is a comedy. When I was watching it I laughed so much that my face hurt. The movie is about a guy who is a little girl who is living in a small house by herself. This place is very dark and has a haunted atmosphere that I like to explore. Then we have a little black cat who doesn't know the difference between the good and bad things. This guy is in an abusive relationship that ends only because he kills his wife. Then there is a guy that lives with a dead girl he found in a river. They try to take care of her until the sun sets. Then they decide to have sex and that's when she disappears. All this is pretty much how it plays out in the movie. However, the movie can get a bit dark at times, so it might not appeal to everyone. But it is enjoyable if you like to watch a good ghost story that doesn't go anywhere, only that it gets more and more disturbing. *******************
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never seen a comedy as good as this. From the title, I knew a comedy would be in there; it's a little like a cartoon. The jokes are delivered perfectly by one, three, or more actors (one of them voiced by Steve Carell). The plot is simple but the way it's told and the story itself is actually really cute.  The story does a couple of things at once. It keeps the audience engaged, at least a little, which you'll need to be from a one-hour-and-forty-minute movie; it also makes you believe the characters. They're silly, childish, goofy, innocent, and not in a really mean way. They only have so much life, after all, they're human too. It's one of those movies that you'll never forget; it'll leave you laughing with a smile all the way through.  I loved it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's no surprise that the first ever movie for my husband and I was The Dark Crystal. My husband was not a fan of the first two books in the original series, so I was not sure how he would take on this movie that seemed so similar to the previous books. The movie was great! I mean, it had a huge number of plot holes and one of the most poorly written scenes ever written in the history of cinema! It started out nice enough, as a young sorcerer, Ilsa Aragorn, wants to learn more about how magic works, so she goes to a castle where a powerful dragon who's trying to be as powerful as Ilsas father. As they were going on her father was killed, so my husband said "Okay, now they're fighting!" Then it was just a race to get to the bottom of everything before the dragon eats them (not really) The movie got better as it went along, it was funny, clever, and good acting! I don't really know how to explain the movie other than it was the first time I ever saw magic. When Ilsaa realized what she was doing she realized that she had a gift, and it wasn't a gift she was given to make her happy or feel better about herself, I think she was born with it. Ilsap was a cool character, the only reason I was more invested in the movie than in the book was Ilsi's character, she seemed different in the books and this movie seemed to fit better with the story (but not perfectly) The bad:      The bad, is, this was a big disappointment for me because it was so much better than the books. Yes, I'm a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien's writing style (and a little of George Lucas' too, but that's a different story) but in this movie there were just too many problems with the plot, and I am going to let you know about these problems, because it will probably turn you off from this movie. So let me show you a little something to show how bad the movie was. We begin with the dragon and his plan to get melded into his body, as we see in the movies. When it turns out the dragon is actually human (that's what is stated in the story) and is in fact an old man that is in love with mysasa's mother, he tries to get her to go to
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had high expectations when I heard about this movie, and this movie exceeded them to the fullest. The cinematography, cast, the screenplay, the directing and the music really give this movie a great quality.   This movie is definitely worth a watch, it's a great movie, a must have movie for anyone who loves a good film and is in to action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very entertaining comedy. I felt that it was very much in keeping with the style of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.   And I don't think that this is just a one off production either.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best thing about this movie is the actors playing the characters. All of them are really good. Especially Peter Sarsgaard who is the voice of Charlie the elephant and is one of the nicest actors you will ever see. He is very funny at times when he is having a bad day and he will be laughing and cracking jokes with the other characters. It's a great watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (3 out of 5) First of all, this movie is not a good flick. It's not a terrible movie. It has a lot going for it. The acting is good. The directing is okay and the cinematography is good (the scenery is good). The plot is not bad. The characters are well developed. The plot of this movie does not have much going for itself. There is a good idea. The story is a story that starts off slow and gets pretty interesting. The ending does not bring much. But for the most part, this is a decent movie with a good plot and decent acting. I am giving it 3 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the end, I found it too hard to watch and a bit confusing and I don't get the plot (how to get the boy out and his reaction). But it is a good idea to write reviews that's something that we could see in some movies as that's what you get with a great idea.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie from the first trailer. It is just a fun movie with a good plot. You can see the cast playing around in a boat which goes around an island and gets destroyed by a volcano. After the volcano bursts (this part was filmed in one shot! No CGI), everyone is killed. They are all resurrected by an evil god (who wants to conquer the world). After he was killed by the heroes, they made a new god, and this was played by Jack Nicholson. There are many jokes in this movie. It contains many slapstick humor and the whole movie is a lot of fun to watch. A great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite film was the one with the greatest number of characters in the history of cinema.  It was so dark and dark that it was almost too deep.   It's a film that made me ask why the people in my home world don't have technology like this.  The movie had a nice story, but I was just in it for the characters and never thought of what happened after the movie.  " I am not a character, I'm a character who's been made by a good author to become a main character in his story. I am an artist who has been called to write a novel. I'm not a real character. I've been made for a movie. I have no feelings, no memories of my parents, none of my past. All I have is this book and this life. I will write what I write.  I think the first time I read it, it was as a work of art: one of the very few movies I thought that way about. After I saw it, though, there was no difference between the movie and the book. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not a fan of monster movies and I didn't expect anything of this movie. However, the movie is actually not bad. I like the movie very much and it is entertaining to look at the monsters. There is also a pretty girl (Jade) in the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a guy who runs an outdoor food stand in a small town on the outskirts of Tokyo. The town doesn't seem too big but we are meant to think it could be a decent place. As the movie starts he is trying to think of some new ways to get by as the old ways don't work out. He makes a deal with a mysterious old woman called Haruko who has a lot of business. The deal is the man can bring food in any kind of weather. He brings in a pig, an eagle and some other critters and they help him sell his food. But as the season gets hotter and the weather gets colder he soon finds that the pig won't fly as fast as he thought and a few other critter can't seem to stay warm either. The food is good but it isn't healthy either. Soon he will realize this if he manages to find a way to survive the winter. His way out of this predicament though will be a trip to the sea where he will attempt to win over a girl with a love for the sea called Akiko.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! I loved all the good and bad things about this movie. It was really funny, cute, and entertaining, especially that part of the movie which had to be the most beautiful I have ever seen. There is some bad acting in the movie, and some bad jokes, but it is a cute movie that will make you laugh and smile. You get to see the little sister with an old friend, the little brother as he's growing up, the mother and father with a new baby... I think the characters are quite likeable, and you'll like them all. The best part of this movie is the music. It is an upbeat, happy tune that is very catchy. The first half of the film is a wonderful adventure which shows us all sorts of funny things that we would have wanted to see in the movies of the future. I also think that a bit of romance could have been added a bit and it would be a better movie. Also, I didn't like the ending, but I won't complain about that because it is quite a beautiful movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best horror movies I've ever seen with one of the most creepy and frightening villains in recent history.   The story, with a heavy hint of action, begins with a group of friends, a group that is not as close as it should be, the three of them together are a nightmare. But, before their lives end, with the help of an unlikely friend and their pet dog, they do something they never thought they'd do, They decide to help a girl by the name of Jessica who was raped by a killer and murdered in a parking lot and they go into hiding to protect her and to try to find the real killer.  .  -The movie starts of with a good scene of the friends talking about Jessica, a girl who had a pet dog. There is no dialogue for a while, until a couple of scenes of the movie. This scene is excellent, because it doesn't follow the story from beginning to end, instead, it shows how each character react to each other when they hear the first screams. It shows how much this movie is based on the horror book and that's a good thing for it.   the movie is good at portraying the dark atmosphere in the park, showing how people try to survive in the dark woods where many people have disappeared to. It's a great film as far as horror movies go. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Love this movie! I like the style of this movie and the writing of it. The special effects are great. I was surprised how well the characters all fit in this movie. The characters are so realistic. One of them, Margo, is also my age and she still fits in this film perfectly.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not even 100% certain that this film is a "bad" one, but it certainly isn't worth seeing. The story is told from two perspectives that feel more like one man's thoughts as he passes the time at a motel. As a fan of the film, I was pleasantly surprised by this.   It's a good film.  And it shows some of the strengths of it's genre.  I found myself watching it twice, with great interest. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You will definitely not be disappointed with this movie. The acting, direction, sound, and screenplay are all top-notch. What can you say? It was worth every penny I spent for it.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What can I say... The main character is a young boy, living with his mother, who has a brother that he doesn't want any more and a sister who hates her. As a result, he's getting bullied to the point where he's losing his temper and he thinks that he should run away to join his brother and sister in some remote location.  Luckily for him, he picks up an old book which mentions that there was a young girl who lived near his childhood home, that she was taken and put under the ground.  The boy does in fact manage to go there, with a small group of others, where he gets to see the little girl.  The thing is, she is a girl who is completely evil and she's actually part of a group of evil people that are working to control the world.  They also need him because they're evil and need to take over the Earth through the use of some kind of machine called a "G-Drive".    The G-Drive turns the Earth upside down, causing people to be more evil, and the evil people are using this machine for their evil purposes.   She turns all the boys in the group into pigs.  As the boy grows up to become a young man, he still tries to find out how the "other people" are doing so that he can become their leader, and he's actually pretty brave in the film.  But there's a problem.  He's a young, dumb, and horny boy who can't resist taking the little sister who is also in his group under the earth.  Even though he's trying to do the right thing, he does in the end become just a little bit of a pig, so the evil men in charge get the machine and use it to send the earth back down to where it used to be, and that's when they kill the little girls, trapping the boys under the mountain, which they then turn into pigs too.  This is a little far-fetched, and it doesn't make for a very exciting movie, but it is worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (   ) This is one of the more good looking (and most "girly") horror films of the 1970's. In addition to the creepy soundtrack, it also had a really solid story. There is a killer stalking young girls in the middle of the woods. The killer, a boy, makes a pact with Satan to kill all the girls until he finds a woman with whom he has an affair. Satan is having a hard time trying to keep the boy from killing all the boys, but he is also having a difficult time controlling the boy as his father has come to town to try and bring the boy back to God. It is a movie that really shows you the "gory" side of horror, especially in the ending where the boy is shown eating all the young girls' hearts. As far as I'm concerned, this one is worth a watch. The best way to describe it is a mix between a John Wayne western, a horror movie, and a horror western.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The best picture ever" - The New Yorker   It's a little long, but an entertaining movie about a high school basketball coach who is looking to get back in the game and get his team to a championship game. The story is well paced and there is a little back and forth between two of the team's stars, Mike D'Antoni, a pretty good coach who seems to be out of his depth, and Vince Carter who is a superstar in the making and is also playing on a very good team.   The movie starts with the players and the coach going to lunch and the players talking about how the coach doesn't understand the importance of the college basketball season, as it is the only thing that really matters.  The players tell D'Andrea how they have so much to lose by going to the next game.  Soon they go to another restaurant to eat and the other guys think D'Aonia needs to sit down and relax.  Later that night they play a game against the local high school team so they can show D'Angelo and Carter they are the best high school players in the area. This is where the movie gets its title:  The Players think they've gone over to the dark side, while they really are trying to follow the rules.  D'andrea tells them that they are good, but the only way the team will win is if they play tough basketball and play the game hard.  But the players feel they need to get the attention of Vince Carter, who has just signed a pro contract. When D'aonia calls Carter up to play the last game of the season, Vince agrees to come up to his house to watch the game. At first he doesn't seem too interested, but soon he begins to take the players under his wing and they play with a lot more passion, much to the team owners' surprise.  This movie is so good it will have people rethinking what a movie is about. The movie is also very funny and the action sequence is great.  I'd say this movie gets an A- and a B+  It should be rated higher but for some reason the producers and writers decided they would try to downplay the action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good comedy, with the humor being almost entirely situational. A character develops slowly and with a certain level of inevitability, and the script's best moments are when this develops. It's not bad, but in a movie like this I'd like to see more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about the two teenage siblings, a boy who is a bit of a coward and tries to impress girls with his looks and a girl who is totally out of his league and a good-looking teenager who is the victim of a nasty accident. This movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor. It's good to be reminded of the good old movies that you used to watch as a kid. The plot involves an accident, a kid's bad attitude and the good-hearted kids and their teacher who can't let such a kid in the class. The movie will give you more than a good laugh and you'll remember it for a long time.        Tomatometer rating: 95%       The Best Movies to watch on my Mobile :  1. "Babette's Feast" : It has a classic scene when the boy in a pink dress is being taken by the girl into the woods when the scene stops and a boy with a gun enters the woods. That scene is still the most loved scene in the movie. This is an amazing movie. I'd recommend this movie to everyone.  "Babettes Feast" was made in the 1940's and was directed by Max Fleischer. It is not as good as "Gone with the Wind" but it is definitely a movie that makes you smile. It also has a terrific soundtrack that makes it the soundtrack to a really good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here we go again. The movie was enjoyable, a comedy based on a horror movie that is more well thought out than it appears at first glance.  It is an odd movie, having its first part take place in the fictional New Orleans (a city made popular in the 1970's by the film "The Exorcist" ).  The second part, which is much shorter, takes place in a place called "The Woods," located in a part of the state that has very little in the way of forests.  That gives the movie a very dark, even grim vibe that seems to be a recurring theme. The film starts off with the narrator asking a man to help out in a small neighborhood.  When he finds out the man is a doctor, the narrator goes to the doctor.  The doctor is a bit of a creep, and we get the impression that the man was not exactly welcomed into the neighborhood and the doctor seems to see the neighborhood as his own private little world.   Later, the man comes to the narrator to find out why he was turned away from the neighborhood.  The neighbor takes him to his house and tells him that he has heard noises, like running feet or something in the woods.  They turn the lights on and find what appears to be an abandoned house, but it is actually the home of a man (Michael J. Nelson) who has been brutally murdered in his bed.  A man with a black hat is walking through the front door.  He tries to talk the man out of the house.  But then the man starts to scream and turns to look at the masked man who is holding his gun.  Before the killer can shoot the man, he goes out the back door. The killer tries to escape through the window, but the window does not go down, and he falls out into the street.  One of the neighbors comes out and is trying to calm the man down.  Finally the man goes back in and finds himself alone in the house, with the mask that had been on the victim.  From here on out the killer is shown from various angles, some as a woman who is trying on the mask.  And one person with a gun who is threatening the neighbor.  Eventually the killer goes around the house and into the neighbor's home, where the killer proceeds to rape the woman while the neighbor is distracted.  Then the killer shoots him several times, but misses his target.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I remember the day my dad brought home an American LaserDisc (as he said, the future is ours, don't we all...?) It was a big box with two discs inside. And so was this, about a young girl named "Zoey" (I never knew her real name), her friend, "Dorothy," and a new friend, who turns out to be a little girl named Lisa. These three characters were just so funny. Zoey has a little sister, a good natured, kind girl with a heart of gold. Dorothy (Lisa) is an old soul (but not as old as Zoey) and a sweet girl (who, like Dorothy, can't decide how to react to her younger sister, who is so bright and loving). Dorie is not as sweet as Dorothy, and she's afraid of everything, but when Zoey helps her get back in the swing of things, things get really interesting. ~~~~~~~~~ I was a little boy who wanted to be like my heroes, my Uncle Walt, who was a movie star, and my Aunt Dorothy, who played Dorothy Gale in the 1939 film. But as a little little boy I would sit around looking at my uncle, who wasn't the sweetest or strongest little boy in the world, but was always on a high, and I had a fantasy (I don't remember if I dreamed about it...maybe the thought was just too vivid, or my imagination was so strong, and there I sat, in my favorite clothes in the living room, wondering how I could grow up to be just like my heros. But then that fantasy was never realized... I was never as good at acting as my uncle was, I didn't have the heart to help my Aunt (Doris?) or my Uncle (my heros) solve their problems... So, that fantasy didn't materialize. I did have the wonderful pleasure of watching my Aunt and Uncle...but I had to wait until the next generation to get that magic of being a movie hero. ~~~ I think this was my favorite movie of all time! I just watched it again and again! I am so happy that I can share it with my niece. It is a really nice, well acted film and it is the film of my childhood! ~~~~ A favorite favorite, a wonderful little movie with many, many happy memories. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ ________ The ending of "The Exorcist" was the best horror ending to a movie I have ever seen. I was pretty much sold on the film since it was made by Tobe Hooper and his crew back in the 60's. I would say I was sold on this movie so much that I saw it on television a few times before that. When it was first shown, I thought it was going to be a generic horror film, but somehow that was not the case. The story was about a young girl who gets possessed by the devil and becomes a witch and tries to kill a boy and his family and herself. The witch was the most interesting part, not only because of her personality but also because of the fact that she was portrayed by the amazing Lucille Ball! The film had a very good script and a great cast including an amazing cast of children. The actors playing the witches had some real acting skills, even the evil ones. The film was not quite scary, but it is scary enough for it to have been made back in 1966. The acting was the highlight of this movie. I have seen the original on television when I was little and that was the only time I saw "The Witch". This is probably one of the very few films that I would watch again and again just for the wonderful acting. _____ The Exterminator:    The story of " The Exterminators " is about a boy whose best friend has died. This boy is a very strong and intelligent boy who is very close to his friend and his little brother. The two boys were playing a game of " tag " one day. The three boys played together, as you do, and then one of them went to eat something out of his bowl when suddenly the boy who was playing tagged the boy to the right of him. The tagger was really upset and he told him to get away, but the boy wouldn't listen. The boy pushed him, so that he was shoved down on the floor. That's when the boy was grabbed by the other boy who had been playing with him. One of the boys then went up to the boy and said, "Hey, don't kill me, I have a heart." "I don't need a heart, just leave me alone" the boy said. Then the three boys left the boy alone and the boy began to crawl towards the end of the room. Then a shadow appeared and then the boy got

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a classic! There is one major issue with the movie: the dialogue. For instance, after the third time I had to stop to catch my breath and put down the fork in the middle of a sentence while my two sons tried to understand what I was saying. I'm not sure why they couldn't understand a phrase like: "Hair... like a rabbit!" or "They say a lot of bad things." The plot was decent, even if the ending was a little unsatisfying. The acting was good, though! I did not care about the ending!  The story was more or less the standard for the day: the father is a bad, greedy, evil guy, who is trying to take over the world! That's pretty standard stuff. A few changes made the story better and a couple of funny lines. I did enjoy the movie. I've read some bad, bad things about this movie: that it's full of sexist humor, that it is sexist or racist, that the director is a sexist, or a racist. Well, I don't agree. It's all in the dialogue! ______________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a couple of reasons why this is an excellent movie, one being it's not an overly romantic movie, it's a bit more realistic, and more of a 'dark' look at what it is like to live in the big city, as opposed to the Hollywood glamour.  The character of Nick is quite compelling and in the end I don't think this movie is any better.   The second movie in the trilogy is a bit of a more 'out there' affair, I have a feeling that it was written to be a sequel to the first (although not a very good sequel) and I think it fits perfectly as a stand-alone movie, although it lacks the 'wow' factor of the first film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Lost Boys" is a great adventure story that has more than enough elements to make it a classic adventure film.  The film is set in a far away world which resembles many other world of the 1940's and 1950's.   The plot revolves around two young orphans named David and Sam (the two main characters) who are sent on a journey to find their father.    This movie is full of humor and fun and the animation is brilliant.  In addition to being a great action film it has an intriguing story that you won't want to put down for a long time.  What I did like about this movie is that it has enough adventure elements to hold my interest and is full on adventure.  This film does have its flaws and there are some problems with the character actors but for a low budget adventure flick it is very enjoyable and it will be one of my favorite films of the 90's.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best way to describe this movie is an epic quest story. A guy wants to go to Tibet to find his missing son, and the best way is the magical "Goddess of death". He and his band of friends travel through a desert, to find the holy land, but they are not prepared for their adventure. At first, everything was fine, but then, all the bad elements started to pile on us. The movie gets really bad. First, there were scenes which looked like they were filmed by a school kid. The actors acting out stupid scenes, even though the director said he was a famous actor. And then, there's some people who act like they have no clue what the scene was all about. The first scene is about some crazy dude having a threesome with two naked women. It's a very bad idea that really isn't funny. Then we have the bad acting in the movie. The other actor did an atrocious acting job, he had no chemistry with the actress, it was bad enough that I wanted to kick him right in the face. And the last scene is even worse, this movie has some terrible scenes like there is a scene in which a girl is about to get hit on by a car. It was all a complete waste of time. There is a big difference between a crappy action movie, and a terrible movie. This is definitely a crappy movie, at least it wasn't much worse than most of the bad movies I have seen since I turned 13. This should be watched for its comedy. The acting in this movie was bad and so is the acting in most of all bad movies, the acting just isn't very good. If you enjoyed this movie, you won't like anything else I will say about it. I give it a C+.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went in expecting this to be a mediocre, lame, low budget, no name movie. I was wrong. I have to say that, overall, I really enjoyed this movie and I had a blast watching this little film. I think that it is a good example of a bad guy who has made a mistake and has to change his ways. A lot of this movie takes place in the hospital and I liked it because it was such a bad place to be. The little kid that is the bad guy has a lot of funny lines. I laughed out loud at quite a few of his lines. The story is very predictable. I know that I should have read the reviews. I'm not sure why everyone has a problem with this movie. It is just that bad, I am not sure where I saw it and it took me about 10 minutes to realize that the movie was bad. It can get a B rating from me if I had seen it before. It may be a good film for the kids but adults, especially those who are not kids but are very interested in these kinds of stories should probably steer clear.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A solid take on The Man Who Stole Christmas, starring a young Christopher Lee as he plays two very different roles in the film.  This is the version I watched, which is the UK version, not the American one.  There's a very nice performance from Peter Cushing as Father Christmas, although you do hear some odd effects which would be a bit off putting in the UK.  The Christmas Special was one of my favourites as a kid so I'm always a bit sad to hear that it's been made into a bad film with an awful script.  It's still fun though.

While the first two movies in the series have been well acted, the acting for this movie is off the charts.  There are a few scenes in this movie that take my breath away.

Definitely one of my favorite movies. _____________
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like a good story with lots of action then you will enjoy this movie. This movie is the sequel to the movie of the same name where Sam Peckinpah played the role of the hero. I liked this movie a lot and I guess the same can be said for the Sam Peckinsons. Sam Peckens movies are very well done. I have to say that this movie has been called a rip off of the original movie of "The Wild Bunch" (1930). But not all of the things are the same. The main character of the movie is not Peckins in the title role but a young actor called "Johnny" in the movie. I know I could not find much similarities between the two movies because the title of the new movie and that of the previous movie are totally different. But in some ways they are similar. Johnny is a young young boy who has to do the hardest things in the world for his father. He is the son of a soldier and his father is a prisoner. He will go back to the mother country in the fall and he will try to take back the things the country took away. It has taken a long time since this time of war for all things to be settled. The country is still in war conditions. Johnny's mother is pregnant and her body is a wreck from the long travel but she will live. Johnny gets help in finding his mother from one of the old soldiers. His father will not talk to him and Johnny will have to get help from his friend "Jim" (Walt) and his gang of boys and girls. They will get him some food from an old friend. There are some good scenes in this movie where people get hurt but it is not the same with the second movie about the Wild Bunkers. I really liked this film even though it is a rip-off of the first one. A wonderful movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************ I am a huge fan of the late 80s/early 90s comic book and graphic novel subculture. This story was so perfect that my favorite characters from the best comics of that time appeared in a movie in 1989, which was a surprise but a brilliant one nonetheless. ***************** The film opens on an underground car park that looks like a huge underground amusement park, just like the ones that used to be in Europe during the 80s and this story was written in the same style and that the same thing that it does is that a lot of people are trying to get off from the big car park to the tunnels that are under it. It's very simple in a way and it's also very funny. This is just a very small film and so far in it there is only one scene that's really worth of mentioning because it's really funny (even though it's only a few seconds, so if you have a good sense of humor, you won't be disappointed). ********************* Overall this is a very good little film from 1989 and you can't help but think that it was made by someone who enjoyed this subculture, just by looking at it you will realize how much this person loved it. ***************

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a good example of how a film should be - entertaining and well acted, with great fight scenes (though some scenes are over done). The dialogue is dry and the story is dull - though the acting is pretty good. This is a movie that would be better as an educational film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very entertaining movie.  I am glad I caught this movie when I did because I always love seeing a movie that has something to say!  There is a lot of thought that goes into this movie. From the music and the characters to the story it all works together.  I wish there was a movie like this that was not so long.  The only thing I did not like about this movie was the fact that they had a great director, but they used such a long movie that it ended up not being enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I got this when it was first out at the local theaters and the story and action made it a lot better then i expected. The film itself was a little slow at first, but it built up its suspense. The ending was a very cool twist which left a good amount of cliffhangers at the end. I would like to see this story continued with the third installment (in 2 years).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Black Snake Moan is a very good movie! It was a perfect film and even if my opinion is based on the film, I would still say it's a great one!  If you like action movies with great performances, a perfect story and wonderful music, this one is the place to start. It's a fast paced, action packed film!  The Black Snakes moans is a story which can be seen in many movies. It is a classic tale and I can't imagine it ever getting old! It is as good as any action film and I hope to see this film a lot more.  I give it a 5/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In the aftermath of the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, the Nazis have been chased out of Germany. However, the Germans have left behind the remnants of their Nazi party that is still strong and is led by Rudolf Hess. He tells the Germans he has discovered the hidden Nazi bases hidden in Austria and is going there in a plane to conquer the Austrians. But on the way he has a mishap when he is shot down by the Austrian fighters. The pilot of the fighter tries to rescue him but is himself shot down. The Nazis are now in disarray. Hess and the Nazis flee to Russia, where he is joined by other Nazis. Together they go to the United States, where they are met by another Nazi party leader named Dr. Josef Mengele. In this movie the Nazis are a force to be reckoned with, with Hess and Mengeler in particular leading the way."  "With the release of the film [A History of Violence] we see the Nazi Party again becoming very influential in American society. There are some very dark scenes, a few shots of violence and the Nazi leader Mengelein is introduced as a villain. The film makes no attempts to hide the connection it draws between the Nazis and America. The main Nazi in this film is Rudolf Hitler. There is no evidence that Hitler was the mastermind of the German invasion of the United Sates but the film shows him as one of the most powerful men in the German movement. The American soldiers involved in the fighting are portrayed as fighting for their own survival and are shown as not only very dangerous and brave, but also foolish. The Nazi leader is presented as a kind of monster, the Nazi soldiers acting as though they were his slaves. The Americans are shown to be a small, weak and indecisive people who allow themselves to be deceived by these powerful leaders. The whole picture shows the people of the U.S. a way of life that was almost perfect for Hitler's vision of a master race. The people in the film are presented as being so simple and gullible that they would believe anything they were told. This is no doubt the view Hitler had of his own people." "In 1938 the German National Socialists were responsible for the murder of six million Jews and gypsies. The war brought the Nazi party to power in Germany, the only country in Europe with a strong National Socialist party. The German government was committed to exterminating the Jews of
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved it.  My only complaint is that it had a great storyline but was too long... I don't know what happened to that story in the second half of the movie.  Also...      The first 20 minutes of the first act are excellent.   I will watch the film again because they just kept throwing in cool scenes and I didn't want it to end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't think about this for long because my parents had gone on a road trip (we lived in an RV) that was scheduled to end in the morning. When I got home, I looked at the clock and there was a half hour left. I went outside, turned on the tv and saw a movie I had never seen (or, had never heard of) "The Man Who Fell to Earth" - my father had never played the guitar but I heard he was good at it. It was a little odd to be listening to a sci-fi story from the 60's by a famous director that was also well known for movies like "Rambo". The movie was based on the life of John A. Heinlein, a science fiction writer from Texas whose novels were set in the far future (he was born in 1905). The story was very good - it was very well written, well acted and well edited. The ending made me smile to myself - although it was pretty much what I expected... It was about a man who came to Earth from a spaceship that crashed on Mars. He was a science teacher and he found a planet that he couldn't explain and decided to live there - which turned out not to be what he thought it was. But somehow everything turned out for the best - he fell in love with the beautiful Princess (played by the terrific Mary Jo Markey, later in a series of Star Trek movies) and they had a daughter and a son. The only thing was, the planet was being destroyed, and it seemed to the humans that this could only happen on Mars - even though some people think that it must be possible elsewhere. The Princess was killed and the Earth was on its way to destruction and the hero, who was really a man and not a woman, had to decide whether to help the humans and save the planet or to remain in his home and find out what had happened to his beloved princess. The ending was very interesting, a big twist was made but it was a happy one, and the ending was much better than I had expected (and this is something that you don't really have to wonder about in a science-fiction movie). I also liked the fact that the hero was so much more interested in the girl he loved and so much happier than in saving the planet... I loved the music and I liked the story so much that I was surprised that I had not heard of it. Even though it wasn't

Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~ The movie's a great example of how to make a very well paced, suspenseful movie. It's good, but nothing extraordinary or groundbreaking. But the story is fantastic. It gets you interested in this case, and it keeps you interested by the end. It just keeps you intrigued. It is hard to believe that this movie was made 30 years ago. There are certain things about it that make me chuckle. For one it is funny how one night the detectives go to the victim's house to see what's inside, and there's a dead body on the living room sofa (well, there's the head, but it looks like a corpse). There's also the part where a woman is being dragged through the air. That might not seem that much like a murder but it sure is creepy, and is just what you'd expect to see in a suspenseful thriller. The ending of this movie is also great, and will leave you wanting more. I think the fact that it was made in the 70s makes it seem even scarier and more creepy because of the atmosphere, and that's what makes it a really good movie. ~~~~~~~~~~~ This movie is a must see movie, because it's the best of its kind. The story isn't groundbreaking in any way, it's just a fantastic and original movie. The movie is very suspenseful, with a very unique atmosphere. The mystery is perfect and well thought out. The performances are great, it makes the movie quite creepy and tense. There's many other great things to mention. I recommend this movie to everyone. It really is a great movie, and a must watch. You won't be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________ [From Review: a film like no other! It doesn't try to be profound, it doesn't make any grandiose statements about life. It is just a beautifully shot piece of action. It's also an all around good flick. There is a real 'feel-good' quality to the movie. I feel like I am being invited to the party! (And no, I don't have the means to attend it! But if I did, I would definitely dress up, and dance!) The film's main characters are a couple that have been together forever. He is an officer in the army, and she is a cook. Her name is Dany, and they are on a very special mission to stop a terrorist from kidnapping an old woman. She knows he's coming, she doesn't know why he's here, but she is still determined to protect the old lady. She does so, but on the journey, something goes terribly wrong. The whole movie is a beautiful piece of acting. It has a lot of heart and a lot emotion. The acting is superb from the lead, to the old woman and the policeman. It was just too perfect for me to not love it, so I'm rating it a 10. _________________________________ (For fans of: Indiana Jones, Star Wars, The Three Stooges, The Sound of Music, The Birds and the Bees, The Big Sleep, The Wild Bunch, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Grapes of Wrath, The Ten Commandments, The Great Escape, The Greatest Show on Earth and more!) ___________________________________ Posted by Michael S. at 10:09 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really looking forward to watching this. But then I was disappointed by a couple of things. First, one guy is so obsessed with being the greatest that when he's beaten by somebody better than him and gets to keep a good piece of it, he starts bragging about it over and over (that's his weakness). I also found it kind of lame that when the hero finally finds out that all the girls are in love with him all he can do is whine to them, so I guess that would indicate he's not a bad guy and he did do some pretty good stuff. But the worst part is that by the end of the movie he's already ready to go back to his old life, which is even worse than in the beginning because he still doesn't get his hands on the princess.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot.  The story is simple enough: a young boy from a poor family comes to America to earn some money.  He falls in love with a beautiful girl and she is so pretty that he always wants to spend his time with her.  It's not exactly a romantic story but you could say that it is a story of romance.  This is the story of two people who get along and stay together.  They are friends and they always laugh.  A strange thing happens when the girl grows up and marries a rich and happy man.   The reason for the love between the two is because both of them care deeply about their family.   In other words they are good people.  So what happened?   After the marriage of the young man the boy goes to live in a strange house with strange people.   His friend is a pretty cook who teaches the boy how to cook.   He gets a new job and goes to the city to earn his living.  One day he goes to a store to buy a package of food that he does not remember buying.  He gets the package and discovers that it looks just like a bottle of vodka.  In an old style room, a woman is sitting at a table with a large bottle of wine.   She drinks and the boy, without noticing, starts to dance.  When the woman notices him she sees the boy and smiles.   With the bottle in his hand the boy starts to walk towards the woman but stops.  As he dances towards the door he opens it.   The woman is there and smiles at him.   It's a love story but it's not the kind of love story.     When he opens the door and stands there looking at her she asks him where his friend is.   When he says "my friend" she tells him it's "not that much a friend.  She points to the door again and then says: "No, but you are my friend" and the young boy smiles a lot and goes inside.   "That is a great story", the woman says and leaves the room.  With that the boy's friend (who is the only character) moves to another room.   For a few weeks the man gets on very well with the family but the young woman, now the mother of the boy has her own ideas about the boy.  First, she takes him back to the old house

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! The director, Michael Ritchie, does not know how to direct a movie - he's not a director who puts people in a good mood. Instead he makes them go thru the worst moments possible without ever showing a solution. I feel bad for a girl who comes to a hospital and sees a man who can not even stand, who is in a wheelchair unable to sit up in bed. At the same time I want to know more about him. Why does he think that it's necessary for him to live? I can understand that he needs to live in order to find a cure for his cancer, but it's not because of a love for a woman, it's because he needs money to pay the medical bills. His condition is not so unusual but this is not a movie about people having to go through the most horrible moments. The only thing I can think of is this: "Honey, I've got cancer. We've been married two years. We have three kids together, two who are in college. I am a computer guy. I have been a good husband and my best friend, my wife. I love my wife, and you know how it is, we get into problems and I don't know how much longer we'll be able to get through. This doctor told me that there's a drug that can cure cancer, that's what we're on now. That's all I know right now. I wish I knew how to use it." "And the girl is in the next bed over, this girl is also in a wheel chair; she has some health problems herself. This is all I've been able to say about the movie so far because I'm not a good person."

As I've read on Rotten Tomatoes, this movie has a rating of 5.6. I have a friend who said he enjoyed it, but when I saw it I found that to be an exaggeration. The entire movie is about a man trying to make money by going to the moon, he has a bad case of claustrophobia and he's constantly having bad dreams, one night he dreams that he's on the moon with his wife and child. He does nothing wrong in the movie.  When the movie came out there were some bad reviews out there. Some people thought that this is like the classic moon landing. There are a bunch of different things that he does on the Moon, including running his business (moon business!) and flying to Mars and back again. And he does some things that are not very good...but still a great movie. - February 13, 2011Don't give the movie a bad rating: When  Reviewed by: Mark R. Strouse - August 24, 2009

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It may come as a shock to those who saw the film at the Cannes film festival in 2005, but this film's impact is profound indeed: from its opening credits to the last, which concludes with a brilliant coda of one of cinema's great final epics, I can't remember a film that so thoroughly, powerfully, and powerfully made me feel sorry for one of my own country's most dangerous men.   What an amazing story of a man who came to England after the First World War, was recruited by the French Foreign Legion, was beaten and wounded many times, and eventually spent two years as a POW in the desert (a story never told before), with no end in sight (for, with the help of the Legion's medical director, a doctor named Dr. Jourdan, he was eventually able to return home).   I suppose one of the best things about the film is that we get to see him, now middle-aged, with an impressive career behind him - as a novelist, film director, teacher, and military officer - which he then uses to write his autobiography. This is very much a story of the man at his best, although I don't think I've ever seen the same person quite like this, with a certain air of self-satisfied, well-rested confidence, and a willingness to take risks that make him a threat not only to his enemies and foes, but to those he cares for and works with, who, in his view, lack the courage and determination to face the terrible and unknown consequences of the world they live in.  - Chris Roberts,   Read a fascinating review of the movie, and watch the trailer on YouTube.  , is a fascinating film about the life of a soldier who fought, to the very end, against all odds. In a sense this is a very personal film. It is not an autobiographical story in the sense that the character is based on a real man but, more importantly, it is a story that is told by him. He is the protagonist and the one we see in all of the scenes; even in his most personal moments and encounters with people, his eyes and face reveal a certain amount of self that tells us that he is a man that lives very much as he has lived. This film is a rare and precious gift that has no equal: it is well worth seeing on the big screen and being able to feel the impact it has on an

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! This is a great movie and the best I have ever seen! A very unique and interesting mix of science fiction and fantasy. The movie was very interesting from the first minute. The first film was more about a story about a man who goes into a war on another planet and after he is back and sees a girl and her grandfather (her father was one of the main characters in the first film), he realizes that things are different now in the galaxy. So he goes and joins the Imperial forces which is a very strong force. The story takes place when the Empire has invaded the planet and they have been fighting with the natives and have started to take control over the country and the planet. The most interesting part of the movie was seeing how different the humans are from what you see in Star Wars. In this film a lot of aliens and other races were used to tell a story which is told with a mixture of reality, science fiction, and fantasy elements. One thing I don't like is that the Empire is not always good and in fact they are not good and they are the bad guys, I just didn't like that, as far as I am concerned, the Empire isn't bad. However, it isn't the good guys. A lot of people, the people at the Galactic Empire, and other creatures were very well done. You learn about them and what they're like at different levels. If you liked the first movie and loved Star Wars, it is a must see.  Rated: 4 out of 5 by JW_MVP from Great Sci-Fi, Fantastic Characters, Great Acting & a Story You might not be impressed by the characters in this movie, but that's because we haven't seen them for a while. I'm sure you've all seen Star Wars by now. You'd think the film would be about the space pirate in a helmet, but it's not. Instead, it takes place on Earth in the year 3000. An alien spacecraft has landed in Los Angeles, and its crew are the last of their kind. They are a group of people who were rescued by a secret society of people living in their tunnels (they call them the Underground), who helped them to find their way back to their home. As we all know, humans are a primitive society and only a couple of generations older than humans on Earth. The Underground are the only people who know about humans and know of the existence of the rest of Earth. They also have a language

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Samurai is another Japanese film set during WWII and starring the late Akira Kurosawa. The story follows General Uchida (played by the great Tōru Furuya) and his army as they battle the invading Japanese army. It is really a well made movie that is based on a book of the same name by Masamune Shirow about a samurai who goes to war at the end of the Muromachi Period in Japan.  The last samurai  In the film, the Japanese army of the Northern forces, which includes a band of former samurai, is led by Prince Shotaro (Yukio Ohmori). He takes up arms when his old master (Yoshio Kurosaka) is captured.  At the beginning, it is not clear which side the young man will support but as he is soon told, he finds himself in a position of command where he will lead the Northern troops to a win over the Samurai army led by the old lord Shotaro.  The main thing about the film is the historical detail of the setting. It was shot in the Northern regions of Japan during the Muromoto Period that was famous for its samurai culture and war with the Western world.   This was a great film and well worth a watch.                                              The Last Samurai 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When you see a bad movie for the second time and think that the movie was a little above average, yet when you see the movie again, you see what a horrible movie it really is. As a result, I have always disliked the movie, since I saw it in the theatre and now that I have seen it in a cinema for the first time, I hate it even more.    As a movie, it doesn't really have anything, and it looks like a rip off of the same movie that was in the first film:  The first film is not bad, the second film just is bad in every possible way.  The special effects in this movie are just dreadful, the costumes are all terrible as well, nothing works and the special effects are a total disaster.  This movie just looks like the first one but the characters are all the same, and the music is terrible and I cannot believe they paid money to use it in this poor excuse of a movie.  You see, there is a little girl named Charlotte, who is trying to save her father in the war and ends up getting herself shot by her father because she has to stay in her room and watch a war movie. The little girl was supposed to die during the movie because of her father shooting her in the chest, however the little girl saves herself from the firing squad by being able to fly her airplane, and then the little war hero finds the little airplane and manages to bring it back home.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first few minutes of the film are beautiful. You have a beautiful, almost mystical world. From the first time you enter the castle, it all looks like a Disney movie with a touch of magic. When you walk through the castle gates, you are transported. The world you enter is alive and vibrant. It has a wonderful energy about it, which I really liked. The film begins with the prince, Prince Anya, and he is very young. He is very shy, but he is a very brave and strong boy. He likes to play with his sword and wears a beautiful red robe. Anya is very talented. He loves music and plays the violin in a band. A magician, Elton John, is a friend of the Prince and his father. Elton has created a magic carpet which will take him to the land of the fairies. Elvin travels through the land singing and dancing all the time. The prince does not like Elvin's tricks and tries to stop him from moving the magic carpet. Eventually, the Prince finds out that the carpet really does move and it makes Anya laugh and cry. The Prince's father is the King, but Anya thinks he is like a naughty little boy who does not respect his father or mother, and that his father is always on his back. When he is six years old, the King sends Anya to a fairy world to be taught magic. As I mentioned before, the fairys are like elves. They are beautiful, friendly and happy. The only problem is the evil wizard, who is very mean. He tries to trick Anya. When Anya wants to go home, Elvin sends him back to a terrible life. However, Anya can't resist and goes back to the fairytale world and learns the magic of the fairy world. There is a song which Anya sings and we are shown the fairy life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best of the trilogy with the least amount of effort spent on it.  It's still an entertaining movie but the story has so many holes and problems it really goes downhill quickly.  I can't say I was wrong about it having a happy ending but it was a waste of time to watch a story like this. I mean how hard is it to just make a movie that has a happy family who is still together and having good times in their new house?  It's just an attempt at a happy movie. The kids are not even happy they are happy to be there and to meet their friends but no one is ever happy.  They live in a house with a huge garage and a bunch of stuff and don't even realize what their problems are until they get to the house and it's so ugly.   The ending was even the worst.  When you think about it it should be a happy end. The father wants to give his kids away to help with their education so they can be free to study whatever they want.  And then there is an explosion that kills the father.  The kids want to go to school with the father who is lying dead and the mom (the only daughter in the family) wants to go with the kids.  But then one of the kids is going to school and another is coming home to stay, and all the time there is a giant fire going on.  Now that's a good ending.  It didn't make me feel bad for the parents but it did make me question the whole story.  Why would there be a giant explosion, why would there have to be a kid that went to school, and why would someone just go to a house and not at all think to look in the garage?  All we get are stupid things going on that don't make sense.  So what did we come to the ending?   This movie is a disappointment but I don't know why it is a disaster.  Maybe I didn't get it the first time.  If you like to see a movie and you don't want to know anything about it you will like this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Honeymoon is an excellent short film about a relationship going bad, but a good short film.  The ending does hint towards a possible future romantic story. _________________________________ [From the comments by the commenter, "Honey", on the other side of this website] I would like to see more films of this kind with a more sophisticated sensuality and humour and more of a realistic look at love and the difficulties of getting one's way with other people...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Gavin Hood is a good-natured loner who is given the unfortunate task of hunting down a mad doctor and his murderous robot.  What unfolds in the course of this chase is a darkly humorous comedy that is not easy to describe.   The film takes a break from the usual horror tropes to include the best of American satire. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Daredevil does an excellent job as a blind superhero. His powers are very realistic, and it never feels like he's cheating, or using them to go on a mission. Daredevil's best fight scenes are in his blind-fights. He's a blind man, fighting a big man with good physical skills, who can punch pretty hard. The fights are fast-paced, but not super fast, and are all well choreographed.  One really amazing fight is when Daredevil catches the bad guys, they try to kick him, and Daredevil gets a perfect headshot off a great double.  I have a bad feeling about this:   I'm not usually a big fan of a lot of superhero films, but Daredevil is one of those rare films that's great because of the actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I don't know about you guys, but I found out that John Cusack in the movie of "The Big Lebowski" is my hero, and that's not me talking! I grew up with "The Dude" in my heart and knew I was going to like this guy. I had been told it would be good, but when it came out there was something "Wet" about the movie, in a good way, and this guy, John Cusaack, just knocks it out of the park! He is a cool dude! And there is no "The Little Lebwee" to speak of... This guy is the real Deal!! It's a little over the top, but the plot is just that-a-lot. I think this movie, and the whole "The L.B.W. in the 70s" movie, are the funniest comedies in the history of our species! Well, maybe not the "The King" or "The Longest Yard" movies. But for a little while in the late 1970's the comedy was on. John Cussack is funny, cool, and a great actor! He was a "Million Dollar Man" as a young man. That guy's never been in any pictures or on any TV shows. This is his first starring role, and I'm going to make a bet- he will soon be getting his own shows! His "theater act" is a little rough around the edges, but that's just the way he wants it. I'll give it a thumbs up in the book "The Best of John Cisack" by Richard C. Waugh! ___________________________________ __________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love how it has two sides, one of which is the best part of the movie, the other of which seems a bit like a nightmare from the past.  The main part is really amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, and this is probably the most entertaining movie I have ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those who haven't seen a horror movie before, this movie is a little unsettling in that it combines elements of horror with a psychological thriller. The movie is more about the victims than the killer, and while it is a good horror film, the movie doesn't get too scary. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for the remake that is set to come out in January.  I would give a 5/10, for a good psychological thriller and not too much gore.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I do believe in fate. I do believe we live in a cruel world.    I'm sure everyone here has seen The Godfather. I've heard many people tell me it's one of their favorite films. But there's a big problem with that. The Godforsaken, bloody, and disgusting Godfather is not an entertaining film to me. This movie is the definition of what I would call a "bad movie." I can't say much more to describe the movie other than I found it very offensive in a disgusting way, and I didn't like it one bit. As stated before, this is a very violent movie. I don't have a problem with violence in a movie, but the scenes here were very graphic, and not in a fun way. I'd suggest watching it again after some time has passed to see if this scene has changed. Also, I did enjoy the scenes involving a dog being killed, and some other animal cruelty.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie.   The film shows a typical day in the life of two characters.  The movie itself is made up of short stories.  As a storyteller I found the movie very interesting and engaging.  I liked the dialogues, it was well-made.  My favourite character is the dog who is used as the butt of jokes.    4.5 out of 5 stars.  "It's hard to believe that a dog is the most dangerous man in the world. So deadly, that he's never killed anyone in his life! The most dangerous person in the whole world. " (Bartender). 1.3 out of 1.0 The film revolves around two children, Jack the Cat and his pal, Jack Jr.  Jack is played by Charlie Chaplin and his friend is played in the movie by Ginger Rogers.  At the beginning of the movie the three friends are traveling in a boat along the Colorado River. Jack wants to get off, but his owner has some advice of her own: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful and thoughtful movie that I loved a lot. It's a story about a woman named Mabel, who's an older lady and also, the mother of a boy who's three years old. I liked this story a lot because the story was moving and the dialogue was richly written. Also, I liked how Mabel talks about God. The film is set in 1920s in the South. The setting is very beautiful, the color is vibrant and the cinematography is crisp. The cinematography used in this movie is unique because it uses a lot of black and white, especially in the scenes where Mabel is in the care of her daughter. I also really loved how Marge (the mother) tries to teach her daughter to read and write. There were a few scenes in this film that I found very interesting. Also I loved that there are a lot more scenes in the film like in the final scenes where the mother is trying to help the boy and his sister and the daughter is trying desperately to read the newspaper because she doesn't know what to do in these difficult circumstances. I guess I have a lot to praise about this movie. There are some flaws in the story but they were just minor and I liked the film a lot anyway. This movie has a very unique feel to it. It is set well to allow the director to tell the story in a great way. I think this is one of the best films I watched in the past year. The music was beautiful too. The acting was great, especially because the two mothers were so similar. This is a film that really captured my attention. I am not a religious person so I didn't believe in God but if it was God or Mabel then it would have felt different. Also if you feel sad, angry, or anything at all, just remember that you are not alone. I felt like I'm not the only one experiencing these emotions, and everyone else should feel how I did!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Jedi's opening scenes have great energy.  We get to see the battle for Scarif and Yavin, a moment in the past of C3PO and R2D2.  Also, the first act of the movie is very enjoyable: a fun and fun time.  It's a movie I've wanted to see for a long time. And what is there not to like about a Han Solo adventure in space?    So, I liked it.   But, there are too many moments of disappointment.   The story isn't as strong as the first and second film.  The characters are flat.  There is too much back story and exposition thrown in.  But this movie was a good start to the trilogy.  I'm not a huge fan of space battles and the characters are never really defined in their personalities or emotions.  However, the movie does have a great story that builds up a lot of great story around the characters.  You can tell from the way the story is told that Abrams did a great job trying to bring the characters of Luke, Han and Leia together, all with their unique quirks and histories.  That's a very hard task to do, especially with very different actors.  If you like this movie and want to experience it again, I recommend this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best "bad movies" of the '70s.  The movie was very, very good.  I saw it at a theater in San Francisco on October 27, 1971.  It was at the height of the Monterey Pop Concert craze and an all around great concert in general.  There were a lot of famous people in the movie, but most were not quite as popular as they would have been in more recent years.  This movie is about an aspiring writer, David, who is a fan of the singer, Lisa Kudrow, who he finds out is going through a nasty divorce.  She had given up her career to be a mom for a boy named Frank who was dying of leukemia.  Frank's girlfriend is married to Frank's best friend.  David knows Frank's mom and knows Frank and his mom's secrets so he is on Lisa's side when she is being sued and loses the suit.  A lawyer named Jack tells him about the divorce case, and when he asks David to give up his job as a writer, because he wants him to be his own boss, David refuses. He writes a play about the lawsuit and is hired to stage it at the old Fox Theater in San Fran in August, which is right after the pop festival in the spring.  Dave wants the play to play well, so it is a hit.  One night, David has a strange dream in which a man, dressed in a sailor suit, is chasing him down the street.  He believes it is an attempt on his life, so he gets out of the dream.  Jack tells David that he was in the Navy at the time and his dream was only a memory of that time, but he could have sworn he saw a sailor dress the same way in the old movie.  At first, David is convinced it is just a dream. Then Lisa and Frank's ex-wives show up at his hotel and he realizes it is real.  So he asks Jack to give him another chance to stage the play, which he now has the money to do because he was hired to do it for free.  They rehearse the play and Dave is the star of the play. However, at the last minute the producer decides the play is not what it should be, so the stage is closed down and the play never gets off the ground.  Lisa and her family try to help Dave get back his dream, so they move in with
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love movies. And the best movies, such as  The Big Lebowski, are those that challenge our perception of what movies are supposed to be. That's what makes them so great.  The Big Lebowksi is one of those films.  I've been saying it for the last few years, but it seems like  The Dude doesn't like smoking and it's a sad thing when a character who likes weed isn't able to enjoy his favorite hobby.    A guy like The Dude who can't get a girl is not a happy dude.  A sad movie, not a great movie by any means but one that is worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________ You're in the mood to play a videogame. Instead of picking up a controller and trying to play, you pick up a pen and a paper and begin typing. The game is not nearly as good as the title. You're a man with a typewriter in a post-apocalyptic world. You have a simple goal: to get back to your hometown where you have a wife. After three years, you get a letter from your wife telling you she needs some food. It's a lot like Star Trek, but this time it's sci-fi. After getting the food, you're forced to play it through the first level again. This time around, it's a shooter. This is actually a really good game. There are many ways to play the game. The first is just to play around, shooting the bad guys. Some are fairly simple, some are more challenging, but there are many more ways to enjoy the game and not worry about a tedious challenge. _________________________ [Pm] A very good game and a good start to a movie franchise, and a decent movie overall! Thanks for sharing!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Crazy is the word I would use to describe this movie.   It is the kind of movie that you have to read the subtitles. Because the subtitles are hilarious and hilarious.     From the description above you may think it's just another cheesy movie. And that's not even close.   for those who are unaware, Crazy is about a blind beggar that decides to make a living for himself.  , with a group of bums and a bunch of dogs.   to do this, the beggar creates a series of games, with the rules being whatever he wants them to be.  . he wins the games, the dogs lose.  - I didn't quite get how this started. What the hell is wrong with all of the people who just get along all together. I understand that this is a low budget movie, but come on! Are all the characters stupid? Why does everyone think that this guy's crazy?
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a good introduction to the genre.  It uses the first person point of view on several different occasions, which I personally like.   To make the most of it, the story is not the best and not the worst.  It doesn't bother me too much though.  At least it's a good thing for the audience to see how different people deal with this sort of thing, especially as we know about it as adults.  It's not hard to see that he got more then a few spankings! The movie was about an author of a young adult novel, who is very popular but has his own way of thinking.  The story goes from him, to his young daughter and then the two are at a local bookstore.  There he has a good time and reads the book for his daughter, to get her interested in it.  Then the real trouble starts with the book.  A little boy is having a big problem.  He has a hard time getting girls to accept him.  And his mother has to take care of him when he gets upset about things.  They're on a vacation to a place where the author doesn't live.  This is really strange but it's an introduction to some great books!  The author and his friends help the kids solve the big problem as it seems more of a psychological problem than anything.     It's a great little thriller about a guy in love with a girl, who has a big issue with how her father treated her growing up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen a true American hero since Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan   but I'll definitely be checking out this movie  . It's really hard to write about a movie you've never seen so just think of this as a modern day take on the classic story of Samson and Delilah. You could make a good biblical epic, it would still take several hours to get there but it does have something for everyone. As for the story itself, it has elements from the traditional and it does well as a traditional story. That's not to say it isn't different at all, and it definitely does. A lot of the things that would make Samson and delilah feel fresh today were explored here. It's easy to watch a movie this long and have some parts of it feel like a flashback. The story takes place in the 12th Century where the king is looking for a wife. When he has one, he decides it's a good idea to marry a queen, and she's a princess from another country. He's also getting a marriage with the niece of his old friend from the palace, the king's favorite cousin. I won't spoil anything but the rest of the story is really enjoyable. You'll know it was written by a man that knew the bible and knew what it was about from the get go. It takes a few scenes for the movie to catch up to the times and characters but the story never feels stale. This movie is well worth the time it takes to sit down and watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really disappointed with this film. Not because of the acting, it's all fine. I wouldn't say it is bad, but it doesn't deliver on its promise.     It takes a lot of time to get going. It is pretty long, but the pace feels slow. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I was so thrilled when I heard about a remake of " The Exorcist ". I always thought it was a great movie. I remember going to a Catholic high school (I went to college for theater arts in Florida) where there was an annual festival to promote the film. It was on such a hot day (40's summer in North Carolina) that I decided to go to see it. I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I had some of my classmates and a lot of other people who were interested. It has since been made available on DVD.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not see this on the big screen, because I thought it was a good story about a little boy on a train that was being haunted and his stepmother. I did not think the characters were interesting enough to bring me to the cinema. It had all the hallmarks of what a horror film should be: lots of gore and monsters, and a plot that took a few steps backwards as the film developed to the end. But it did not ruin my enjoyment of it. I felt that it was well done enough to have scared the crap out of people, and I could have watched it many times. I only wish I had been able to do that before it disappeared into the big black hole of time and memory.   Best rating: B-

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a classic. It is based on a novel written by Ray Bradbury, who died in 1997. It was directed by David Lynch and stars Tom Hanks and Julie Christie.  I really liked this film. It features a story about a lonely boy who is trapped in a town which is all that is left of his hometown. He is told by his "uncle" that he should try to become a journalist and move back to the town. However the old man tells him that it is now too late for him to leave. His only real option is to live in the town, but that is a big mistake as he is now part of a group of people who know about their "own past".  All he can see is the town as he goes on a journey which will change the future. He eventually discovers the real reasons for his disappearance and is able to live with those reasons, but in doing so he learns that he has more than a single life to live.   The acting in this film is absolutely wonderful. Hanks is really great as the main character and he really gives an impression of a lonely lonely man who wants to escape and start living his life again. Christie gives a very believable character and I could see why she has become quite a famous actress. I could never really find out why she left the industry and she is so perfectly believable. As for the acting as a whole, it is really quite good. I liked the idea of a film about a young boy who lives in an old abandoned town and the older people who live there. It's a really interesting story.  , but as I've said before it is not an easy film to watch, it definitely has a slow pace, but the ending was very well done. You will see a lot of strange things happen. The town is a bit confusing at times and it does take a while to really make a clear picture of what is really happening. I would recommend this to someone who likes an interesting story, is very interested in the future and loves the films of David Lynch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked this movie; I had a very good time. The movie was short but very interesting; it was a good comedy. I loved the character of the little girl who is obsessed with her grandfather who's the head of the family. That was something unusual in such a family; the grandfather had a lot of problems and the little princess loves him. The comedy was very good and I loved their silly banter; I would enjoy seeing them again and again. I also really enjoyed the little old people's behavior, they made great jokes and were funny. It was like the grandfather was a very strange old man and the granddaughter was the daughter of a very odd old lady. I liked all of the characters, the adults were good natured, the little people were odd, but also interesting; and I would certainly like to see more of them, too.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ You all might have heard of the movie, It's a good film, A little over 6-8 hours long. It's been done a lot better recently, and it's the longest of the best. It makes good use of it's setting, the setting is great. The movie is good in many ways, the acting is good, the music is good and the setting has been done well, the story is good. The only thing that is weak about the movie is that the ending is not very good. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't very good at all. A good movie, and a good ending, but I wish they had done it a little better. If you like the old westerns, You will like this film. It has some good acting, and great music. However, this is just a little bit of good acting and music is not much for a film with a long running time. This is a good little film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________ My friends and I would go on vacation and one day we stopped at a beach and found a beautiful deserted island, just beautiful. We could hardly believe we lived on a deserted island. It is a very peaceful place and we loved it. The people were friendly and very hospitable. We even slept in a hammock on a beach that was serene. We made up our own tea in a small wood-burning stove. I can only remember one sad experience, but I have no words to describe it. We were playing with an American boy that had a toy machine gun. It was a big, beautiful toy gun. He put it to his forehead and shot the boy in the back of the head. We had to rush him to the hospital. This was our very first time visiting this deserted island and I was surprised to find it so peaceful. ________________________ It is hard to believe I got a chance to do an interview with a director of such a good film. I have followed your work since you directed "Tales of a Madman" in 1993, and it is a film that has a special place in my heart. How did this interview come about? It seems that in the early 90's you made a film called "I Remember You". I wonder if you remember how it came about? Well, I remember the time of the filming very well; I would visit New York to look for actors. And while waiting for a casting I met the director of "I'll Fly Away" (I'll tell you later about this film), Robert Stroud, whom I liked very much. In the meantime he was making his film in Hawaii called "Makalii" (The Man With No Name). We talked for months about what we could do together. I told him how I loved his movies. He told me, "I have a very interesting idea." So we talked about it over and over and he told me that he loved the stories of the Madman. I remember him saying that one story had a very special image to it, the image of a young boy in a raincoat, and another story had an image I had never seen in any movies before, it was of a very ugly and evil person. The Madman in a white fur cap had come to Hawaii to recruit people who could become members of his cult. I said that I wanted to make a film on the Madmen. I asked him if he would be interested in collaborating with me
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a good one. The premise is a very well done one, especially since we don't know much about the family. Our protagonist is just as confused about it, as she should be. She doesn't seem to care though, she is in love with a young boy and he is so sweet that she can't stop thinking about him. She just loves the fact that she is a "little" girl. The movie does seem to be a bit cliché since we are treated to a series of pictures of boys and girls in school, but all the little characters in the movie really make the movie a funny one. All the young people are a lot of fun. The voice actors are all wonderful, and they all put on a variety of voices and sounds that fit the roles. The music is very good, but it does get repetitive at the end. The ending of the movie does not really fit the movie very well, since it is just a bit cheesy and unneeded. The end of the film is good though, and the ending does not seem forced. Overall this is a nice movie, and it is very funny as it turns out. I will give this a 2/5.

She has a job as a nurse in the hospital, and she likes it very much. She loves the doctor who is her boss, whom she loves. She also loves her husband, who is still alive after a serious injury, but is not able to be with her. One evening, she goes to the doctor's room and finds him asleep with a woman in the bed next to him, and when she goes away, a short time later, she is seen by a man in a white suit who tells her: ''If it is so, don't bother to wait. You will get him.'' And later, a young lady comes to the hospital. She is married, with the same husband whom she has been talking to and who is very loving and sympathetic to her. That is the beginning. Later on, she learns the meaning of ''love'' and, in a final scene, she comes back to her husband who has died of disease. I really liked this movie very much, but I felt it was a little slow, perhaps because it was shot at night, and because it took a long time to come up with an emotional ending. But it is a good, short movie. It is not easy to think and feel at the same time. - June 3, 2012The Best Story I Have Ever Told
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise. I haven't seen the movie since 1980 but am familiar with the movies and the events. I was born in the 70's and grew up watching the movies. Now they have come back in a new generation. I like this movie a lot. Not the first time the Alien has been on the scene for an audience to enjoy. In fact this movie has more suspense and mystery to it than all of the previous movies combined. I'm looking forward to seeing the new movie. I guess that is the big question, will they come back for another sequel? I don't think so. But if they do, I will most definitely be keeping my fingers crossed and waiting until Friday night. A great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am surprised and even a bit amused at how much I like "A Nightmare On Elm Street". In fact, this is my favorite movie and I think most people who have seen it will agree with me. It's so scary that you can't help but scream and you don't want to stop even when the killer appears on the screen. This is a horror flick that has a lot to offer in the genre. It gets a B rating because it is fairly mild, but still has enough blood and gore to make you uncomfortable and it's a bit dark (but not too much) and dark.  A big credit must go to David Lee Smith, who gives the "A" movie its name. This guy is a master at portraying the horrors of the evil clown. Even though he isn't as over the top as he was in "B", it's still pretty intense and scary. This is one of those scary movies that will scare the pants off you and put you to sleep in only fifteen minutes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie, an interesting movie!  The first thing I noticed was that the movie was all white and the movie plays like a fairy tale. The story centers around a princess (the princess is played by the amazing Meryl Streep) living a life of luxury at the castle of the witch (played by Julia Roberts) who loves to eat cats.  When the queen (Meryl) gets kidnapped by the witch she escapes and gets the help of a few cats to search for her.   She's also very beautiful and very talented at everything she does, she even learns to fly on a broomstick (it's funny how this happens).   The movie never goes for the usual romance, instead it's about the witch, the king of the castle and a love triangle.  After watching it, I was so glad that I was able to see it again because I think that Meryl was a little too serious at times which made it hard to laugh at.  I'm sure I will like the movie more and I want to see that witch again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** ************* "This is a fun movie. It's funny, well made, and a very good movie for all ages. The story is simple and the humor is spot on. I loved the movie so much I am going to see it again this weekend!" -Mike H., Hollywood, California It is nice to have a movie about a group of characters who just want to play a good game of golf. There is always a round of golf in this movie. That's why it gets a 4. The movie was made in 1950. They filmed the first movie in 1949. There were no computers. There was no Internet. There are a few of these types of movies that we still see today. It is very short, but there are some good scenes in it. I think the most enjoyable scene is when the group is playing a round. One of the players falls off the course. The group starts laughing hysterically, but then they decide to help him up. We all know golfers aren't the best about trying to help anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! - August 8, 2012The first time that I've watched any film with the actors being black was in the movie "Lebedekins" (1986), which I am told was based on a book of the same name by the black author Eugene D'Addario. The characters were played by David Mamet and D' Addario.!!! (...)!!! The movie is based on D'Alessandro's novel "Leprechauns" (1938) which was published in England. The book has an original story and some modern day references.!! A new director came to America a few years ago to work with Mamet on "Lefebvre". And his name was Robert Gordon, who is now gone and most likely will not return.!!!!!!! This "Leverage" (1985) is much more of a comedy than a drama. It is funny and sad. It has a unique look and it was interesting watching it in a theater and to look at this film in print.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is a movie you would like to see twice.    If you enjoy old fashioned humor, and a little black humor, "Lithgow" is one of the more enjoyable films of the past 40 years. _____________________________________ - July 25, 2012Crazy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Last Airbender: Legends of Azula    Is it any good? If you are a fan of The Last Air Bender (I was a fan) I think it is definitely worth the watch.   If you like Avatar, it is another good entry in the series.  For me, a few things stood out: 1. The villains are a lot worse than they are in the show. 2. The fact that everyone looks like an old lady is a plus. 3. The plot is pretty good. I liked it as much as the original. If you have a chance to pick it up I think you'll enjoy it even more. I watched it with a few friends at a local coffee shop. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm amazed at the quality of the movie! I think this is one of the best movies I've seen recently. It's been awhile since I've been impressed by a good horror flick, but I was. The acting is really good with several acting talents doing their job well, the story is well written and is one to remember. The film has its own distinct horror atmosphere. The story does include some action scenes but most of it is in a very quiet, peaceful setting. It really doesn't add anything to the film other than a nice ending. I think it would benefit greatly from a DVD or BluRay version, since I really liked the sound quality of this movie. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies and didn't know much about this, but this was a decent effort.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason you are here is for the great acting. This movie was so much better than its predecessor that you would have no idea. I thought the first one was great but this one blows it out of the water. The writing is good and so is the direction. I love the little twists they pulled throughout the whole movie. It could have been a whole lot longer but this movie is just fantastic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was very skeptical about this movie, because the marketing materials seemed to make the film a bit over the top in its overt Christian themes. I saw it first at a theater in Minneapolis, and it certainly did not feel that way. I mean, the entire movie is about a young woman (Christina) who is being groomed by her mother and her friends, one of whom is a beautiful, blonde, young girl named Doreen (Christine Lohman). The movie starts out with a very funny scene where Christina is being put through a physical ordeal in which she is forced to be a "woo girl", and her mother is being "fought over" by her other friends and Dore the blonde girl. At one point during this, Christine begins to fall over, and we are left wondering how far this could go. Christine begins with an orgasm (I had to laugh about that). Christine then has an orgasm with Dore over the course of the film, but at the end of the second act, Christine is raped by the "bad guys". I found this scene very disturbing, and I could never believe what I was reading on my first viewing. The scene was not a sexual encounter in which one participant had sex with the other. The only contact between the participants was by oral contact. It is not mentioned that any of the individuals involved in the intercourse were wearing a condom. Christina is now a "whore" in the eyes of her family and friends, and is told to strip on the front lawn of her house. She is "exhibited" to the other young girls in the neighborhood. Christina then does several things in this movie that have nothing to do with sex. For example, she sits on a couch and watches television with her family, or she goes for a walk with her mother, or, in one case, she leaves her "wife" at home with the "boyfriend" and walks with her friend around town. One of the scenes in which Christina appears sexually aroused involves her watching an episode of the television show "Murder, She Wrote". Christine has many more sexual encounters and experiences in this film that I think would be highly offensive to most people of any religious viewpoint. Although she is "prostituted" by the men who are in the film (and by her family), none of these men are actually "raping" her or taking her with them to their hotel rooms. However
Write a positive review about a good movie: ***************** (1/5) * I don't really get why they decided to kill the protagonist's dad. He was kind of annoying, I guess, but not really bad or anything. I guess the movie was too short for that. If you just like to be bored and watch shitty movies I guess then give this movie a shot. And it's also really, really badly written. I feel that whoever wrote this script is a terrible person, because if I tried to write this in a more professional way it would be terrible as well. I'm just going to list all the things that are wrong here: The movie plays like a video game: The plot takes place inside a computer game. There are only so many times it's possible to kill someone, so the guy just keeps killing them over and over in a repetitive way. There's always a cool-looking lady running around in a bikini, but no one in this movie is interested in her. The movie doesn't even try to show the protagonist a moral or a good ending. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. It's just one more video game. I mean, this movie would be good, if it wasn't for that annoying voice that just keeps repeating, "You are the best! You are the BEST!". * Also I would like to say that the movie starts with this lame, long intro that just takes place in one office and ends with some really weird stuff: the boss' son is watching a video, and then that guy goes into the computer and then the kid goes into a fantasy world. I don;t think they even showed the intro that far in the movie. The whole movie is nothing more than a few scenes, interspersed with some stupid voice over. * The first 10 minutes of the movie are about how this movie was supposed to be a love story between the main character and his girlfriend. That part is done perfectly. But that's all. The rest of the movies is a bunch of bad dialogues and lots of bad acting that didn't even work for the movie and the actors. The acting is just plain bad. It comes off as though this movie tries too hard to be funny and it ends up only being funny because the acting is so bad. The bad acting makes the movie hard to follow, and I'm not even going to bother explaining anything bad about it. * There's a part in the beginning where the main characters meet a princess and they become best friends

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fine thriller, especially for the first half and it is a very good story (with a twist).   It features excellent performances from the main cast; I especially loved Robert Sheehan as the FBI agent who goes after the serial killer.   I particularly enjoyed the way the script was set up and the way it tied everything together.   It also stars Gary Russell (who was a terrific actor in his own right in the other Tom Cruise vehicle, Mission Impossible) and a good supporting cast.   The plot is well paced, clever and a perfect first movie for a new director who wants to get his feet wet.    What it lacks in style it makes up for with its sheer terror, it's a great thriller that will keep you turning the pages.   A very satisfying film for the whole family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big fan of the movie The Usual Suspects. It has a lot of great action, humor, and romance. I am sure many people watched it as teenagers and didn't like it because it was very campy and silly. I saw it many years ago, in the 80's, and was blown away by this movie. I'm sure it's still popular with many audiences (especially my own - I was still a kid at the time). I like the main character Maxine who is very intelligent, funny, and likeable. There's no romance (yet) in the film but I don't think the two would make the best couple. I like that there is a plot which is complex but still easy to follow. There are lots of great car chases, explosions and a great finale. It's definitely a must see for movie fans. The soundtrack is great. In fact, it's so good the whole thing sounds like it's being sung by the one and only The Beatles.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** I know I've said this before, but I will again. ******************* It is a little bit like an American Express commercial for a new service called MovieBater. It is very inexpensive, you only pay $10.95 or so for the first movie and it takes a few minutes for the movie to load, so you have to wait a few moments before you can see what you are watching.  If I would have known this when I went to the theater I would never have seen the movie.    There is nothing to do at the MoviesBater but wait, then when the movie starts the screen is very dark, the sound is a lot worse than the DVD, and the lights seem to flicker.  After it starts the movie plays through with terrible sound and bad lights, so it takes way too long to get through a movie and no one knows what is going on.  I would like to tell you this is the best movie I have ever seen, but it isn't.  The DVD is better, but MovieBaters are $10 for a movie, plus there is no sound.  What you get for that price is a crappy film that will only get a "1".   MovieBater is a very bad movie   *MovieBaters may not be an accurate representation of the price of MovieBation, but they will get you to go watch another film, so this one is just OK* 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a lot of laughs.  It's like a buddy cop movie with a gang of good looking guys with some good chemistry and a good time.  The plot is a little odd... but that's the idea.  The main characters are trying to make their way in this life and in particular they've been drawn to a local town which has a reputation for the most bizarre and unusual things.    What I liked was that all the characters seem like they were from a really bad sketch, but they're actually very real and funny in a very endearing way.  They have no problems talking to strangers to get information, but the town is a weird one that takes a little while to get used to as it really can't find its own identity.    The cast are all great, in fact some of the best roles we've seen so far.  This one also has some great music and the best closing song of the year so far:  I recommend this to anyone who likes old-school buddy cop movies, and it also makes a nice change of pace from some of our other favorites:   The Outlaw Josey Wales and The Road to El Dorado
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film made me laugh in places and I was very uncomfortable in some of the situations, but it did not take any part from me.   There were some good ideas in the film, and if you are an actor, you need to be in this film. I know this will not work for everybody, but for me, it was very enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While this movie is not as bad as the reviews make out, it is still a very poorly made movie and not even worthy to be considered a "good" comedy. If you want a good bad movie this is NOT the movie for you. There is a scene where a bunch of kids are playing with a puppet and then it just happens to start speaking and singing in a foreign language and it's just like the most horrible song ever. I hate to see such a badly written and poorly made film. If the movie was any good at all it would have been terrible and not funny at all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've already given you my opinions of this movie already, but for those who don't know, the movie is actually a Japanese anime series that's quite popular in America. It's about a group of teenage assassins whose boss takes a liking to them and has them do any job he asks them to do. This movie is a sequel to the first one that's about the teenage assassins' adventures as they get involved with the mafia. The story is actually quite interesting, especially since I didn't know so much about the ninja in general before watching this movie.   It also features a couple of Japanese actors that are quite memorable from the first movie. I have to mention that the acting was great in the movie. There were many scenes that had amazing acting, especially the ones where they're in a fight with the "ninja". It was really a great movie that is highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw "Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason" for the first time at CinemaCon a few years ago. I was so impressed and thrilled with the beautiful visual direction by James Lassie. I have never seen a movie where I felt so strongly about the beauty of the setting and the love of the beautiful girl. I remember seeing this movie a few times in the theater and never had a problem with the acting. I think that the movie had a lot to offer the audience. The story was simple and had the audience hooked. "Brigitte" Jones is the best character that I have ever seen in a movie. It is an important role in the movie that is very memorable. There were only a few things that bothered me in this movie. There was no way that the actress and director knew how to portray emotions. Also, the dialogue was very simple and not at all realistic. I hope that in the next two movies "Bert" and "Bridget" Jones will be the best characters ever created for the movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My goodness... I'm just as stunned as anyone else by how amazing this movie is. I've never seen anything like this before, and I've seen it a good deal of times before. And the acting is just brilliant, with the two leads, Chris Farley (Himself) and Linda Blair (Herself), giving very believable and charming performances. It's very funny and very sweet and very smart and very sad and very clever and very very funny at all times! I've always thought the best and funniest performances I've ever seen are from Chris Farrier and Linda Darnell, but this is a top-notch ensemble, and the cast is just so diverse, with an incredible line-up of guest stars like Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks, Fred Williamson, John Cleese, John Candy, and many, many, MANY other people to keep you laughing and smiling. It was really quite amazing, I mean just so many, so many different and often completely unexpected people and situations coming together, and a cast of truly talented and great funny people and characters! And there's a great ending in which I'm sure many of you have seen it, because it came on a special edition DVD that was only released a couple weeks before the movie. However, this special DVD has a great special edition of the film, that is a few minutes longer, that includes a whole bunch of bonus material, including the original song "Him and His Guitar" by Jimmy Page, a really long story about the creation of the song "Funny People", and some other stuff. If you like this movie, you owe it to yourself to own this DVD. It'll take you a while to get it, as they were only available a couple of weeks before it. But then I found it in the big box set that was released the first time around in 1992. If that makes you feel better, that's great! It's certainly worth your time and money. But now for my review.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would like to give a huge praise to   for their portrayal of , with a great cast that plays their parts well and with great animation to boot. I'm not exactly a big fan of  the show, but the reason I watched it was because the cast was so great and this one is just as good.   There is a really great and fun storyline that I really enjoyed watching this show through, I thought it was a good way to break away from the serious series, especially since we don't get any supernatural stuff. I was surprised with this one, I expected it to be a darker and more sadistic story with more gore and monsters, this one was a lot lighter with the best characters I've seen in a long time. I also enjoyed how this show was more funny than it was scary, which is a very uncommon occurrence for me.

I like the use of water and water gun battles. - I like this new twist the baddy girl puts on when she gets captured. There is a new twist this time. It seems like the baddie is actually from another planet. I can't wait to see if the old baddies (a.k.a. the badguy) comes back. I'm not really sure. I guess he won't be much help to us now. - For a new character, I really like this woman. - There are a lot of cool scenes with the baddest girl from my childhood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Boy Scout  was made by a Jewish producer who apparently has been trying to kill the film for years.  This film is, like most Jews' films, not great because it has lots of Jews in it.  The only thing that makes it more Jewish is that most of the Jewish characters are Jewish children whose parent(s) are Jewish.  This is not a movie about Jewish children who live in a Jewish ghetto.  It is about a Jewish boy who goes to another Jewish town for a few days to spend the summer with a Jewish couple who happen to be his uncle and grandma, and then they go back to the Jewish ghetto to stay and live in it until the boy graduates high school.  You can't go there unless you are Jewish yourself and you can't get a good position there unless your parents are Jewish, and that seems to be the goal for most Jewish kids in this movie.  We meet a variety of Jewish characters, including a rabbi, a lawyer, a priest, a police officer, a housekeeper, and a secretary.  There is one Jewish character who is Jewish and not the one I thought I was going to meet.   In the Jewish part of the town the Jews are almost all very rich and all very sad.  They seem to be a kind of clique.  One character who happens to be Jewish is called the mayor and seems to want to be rich.  While he is mayor of the city you have to go to the synagogue, which is in the back of a church where you have a nice view.  As soon as you get outside the back door of the church, you are surrounded by hundreds of Jewish people, and you realize that this is not really a church.    It looks like a place that Jewish people sit around at a time when they are sad. One of the people sitting around has a sign up saying "Jews Welcome"   The other Jews are very nice.  Some of them seem to have gotten money from the government and are very wealthy.  A Jewish boy is having a lot of trouble at school because he is not learning as well as his Jewish friends.  He has a book about the Bible.  His father tells him to read the bible. The book is full of bad things to do to non-Jews.  (The last few pages of the book are all "Get ready to be kicked to death," "Burn to death, go,

While fighting against the henchmen, he pulls the lady off of the back of his truck.  Then he gets her on top of a car.  And she is on top, on top!  She goes "Yah! Yah!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been waiting to watch it since I saw it at the premiere last year and it came out and it is a brilliant movie. The plot was great too. I've not seen so much of a black woman who likes to ride like a horse in a movie, it was very funny, there were some pretty awesome lines. The character in the movie was very much unlikeable, but there was some of us who like black women, and she is the reason this movie came out in the first place, so it was a good thing. If this movie was done a few years ago, it would have been awful, but I think the script has a lot of potential, and they did a good job.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're like me and haven't seen this movie before, I can safely say it is a must-see, I think it has some unique themes that could possibly make you feel something in a way other movies don't. It has a good screenplay, but I think the director is not very good at directing and is trying too hard to make it too "high" and "high-budget" it is so I guess it is. But I like this movie a lot. I was really surprised how realistic it was, it really felt like an old-fashioned movie about people that were not meant to live long, but were very happy and had great days together and then when their time would be up they would look back and say "Man, I should of had stayed longer!" If you're interested in how we live our lives, please, go and check this out, it is well made with a unique atmosphere and I enjoyed it very much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first big budget superhero movie, and it is a great one. I did not expect a superhero movie to be this entertaining, and I still don't. It is not so much an action film as it is the story of a bunch of teenagers and the things they do to cope with their own lives. This is not an easy film to watch and even when it tries to be, it ends up becoming an even better movie when you give in and allow it to be an adventure. I would suggest not watching this movie until after watching Spider-man 3 (I think this would be even better than that movie, if only they had a more well-developed hero) and before watching X-Men 3.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I'm not sure how many times I've seen the movie, but I feel like I've probably seen it 10 times or more. I've had this movie in the queue for a few days so I figured I'd share the experience.   What are the chances? I really want to know how the plot of "The Wolfman," a movie that is not even a sequel to the hit movie "The Crow" with one of those bad sequels where there are still so many plot holes that it will be awhile before it's over, came to be. This movie is about a mysterious man named Wolfman who appears to be a wolf and who claims to be the son of an ancient vampire who was killed by the wolfman.  The movie starts out with him going to the house where the vampire (who is played by the amazing Tom Savini) lived and he takes a bite out of her (and a few other random people who are also vampires) chest. The rest of the movie takes place in the house of a guy named "Wolfman" which is also an old abandoned house. Wolfman and his friend, a guy called "Mister X" (played by Michael Parks) are both very superstitious. Their house, as it turns out, is haunted and when the people in the film get really scared they start to make a lot of weird noises.  After all of that they get a phone call from Mr. X who says that Wolfman is a wolf/witch with no name and no power and that his name is only a name that Wolfmen like to use.  At that point this film starts getting really weird.  Now here's the part where the movie really gets weird. The guy who is actually Wolfman seems to have some kind of mental breakdown. He starts telling a bunch of different stories about a woman who was also killed by a wolfman that he was looking for, he goes into the woods to search for it and that's the point when he finds it. It turns out he wasn't looking for it, but he killed the woman who he thought had his daughter and then he turned into a wolf. After all that happens in the woods he then takes a nap in the same spot where he was searching for it in the first place and it's at that point that he meets Mister X and his group of friends.     After hearing about Wolfman's problems they go to see him. At this point
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was good! The first part was good. But, then, the movie stopped, just a bit, in the middle and then the director (the one who directed the last two movies) goes: "It can be done". And then it does it! This movie made my hair stand up! I didn't expect to see the first part so good. And then, I saw the second part very good. It was almost impossible to stop smiling! It's such a good story! You'd think all of this would be boring, but not this! This is good. I don't know if the movie was made by a fan and if the director has become a fan of this film, but, he still shows he is a great director! The movie was funny! It was a nice story! It reminded me a little of the first episode of The Twilight Zone. It really is a good film!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________The best part about this movie is the fact that it is a true story, it has the main characters of the story:    the boy and the girl, their mother and her friend, an actress and a policeman. It is a very simple story that is very hard to understand, which is part of its charm! But there is always a mystery around the end. It's a well-paced, exciting and quite funny movie that I like!

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------------------- I know it has been said, but this movie has got to be my favorite. It has some good moments: First off, there was a pretty interesting script. The only thing that bothered me about the movie was how the characters were portrayed. I mean, these are characters we are used to and they are just so... stereotypical? The first one is a little girl, the second girl has a baby, the other is the only other female of her type, a teacher. Now this movie tries to be as realistic as possible and the characters feel like they could actually live there. However, I can't say this movie was realistic. Now, there are some good points: It seems to be written for a younger audience, so it may contain some violence that may not be for everyone. For example the mother and the boyfriend are just about to go to have their affair, but she tries to stop it. I guess because the other characters are just as shallow. The movie isn't terrible: it is actually pretty funny. I think my favorite scene is when the other character is going through her daily routine and the character in front of her sees something that scares her. And then she says, "Hey, what is that?" "That's a... a rat." And so ends the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are two kinds of movies: those that are made to be great, those that have to be good. And then there are those that make you feel like you just saw a documentary.   This was the latter, and I love it.  From the great acting, to the great editing, to all the beautiful scenery, to a story that is told with so much sincerity, the best possible combination of action, mystery, and comedy in one movie.  A masterpiece.

However they all are turned into stone (except for a few) and a group that is led by a crazy wizard is hired to help find out where the woman is (as she is the richest slave in the country).

This movie will always stay with me. I am old enough and have seen enough movies, so I can say the rest of the story is ridiculous. All the actors and actresses were good except for my old man. He was the reason I gave this movie 2 stars!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has a very good story, some laughs, a few sad scenes, and good acting from all the actors in this film.  The film seems to have been made by a person who was a bit too comfortable in his own skin, but the story was not boring either, it is a very interesting story about a boy who is in a circus, who is an extremely brave boy, and who is extremely smart as well.  I have a very old photo of my mother in which she is looking very happy and cute.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** This film is good. It is one of the best films i have seen. It can easily be taken in and out of your head and you will not know the end. It will leave you confused and amused. When i saw the trailer and saw the movie title i thought it was like an episode of a cartoon and it was about the world famous super man and his friends who live and have adventures. I was so excited when i saw it on a friend's tv. They used a very funny style and made it seem realistic. We get to see these guys trying their very best to find a cure for a disease which causes them to look human. I found it funny and not scary at all. They seem like a normal couple of normal kids who would be friends. I like the fact that they are all on the super hero team but not everyone can join and it is a good way to mix up the team.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens as a film from the 1950's from the perspective of a woman who has traveled through time in order to attend a dance in the 1920's. She is at a party with some other people and in the middle of the party someone calls out to her and she leaves the party to go back to her time. This is the time when the Nazis have captured France and are trying to take the French people as slaves and the French Resistance has been trying to fight against these things. In her time she encounters some French soldiers who look like they are fighting the Nazis. The film progresses as she finds out that her time is running out and that the Nazis are getting close. She finds the help of a couple of young men, one of whom is a Frenchman named Georges, who is fighting the Germans and helping her through the time. They find a boat and leave France before the Nazis reach them. As they arrive at their time they hear news that the German's have captured Paris and are planning to attack the French Army. This makes them realize that they must go back in time and save the people of France before they are taken over by the Nazis, and if they do not they will not survive the war. As the film progresses we find out more about the story and the time that she has experienced. It is a really good time for a film with good acting and a good story. This film was also nominated for an Oscar.   This is a very good movie, you will love it!  Rating: 3 out of 5   Review by A Reviewer (a review is required to post a review on these movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so happy to come across this film on a Netflix queue. I was a big fan of the original (which was excellent) and this movie is a perfect adaptation to the story. I loved the new direction and style of the movie. If you like John Wick: Chapter 2, I definitely recommend this movie.  Helpful is the story of Johnny Cash's love interest (in the original the character was played by the wonderful Cher), Ruby (Ruby Bridges) and their brief, yet magical relationship. Johnny Cash is the only character in the movie who is a little out of his depth, it is a pity that he is played by another great actor. This movie has it's good moments. Like the great John Wick movie, a lot of the scenes are filmed in a very slick manner and you do sense that this is going to be a good one to watch. I felt that it was a little over long, but it is certainly worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man from Earth is a movie which is about a scientist named Dr. James Wilson who has lost his wife of ten years, she had died of a mysterious illness during a family vacation in Hawaii. His wife's death was so sudden and sudden it is difficult for him to accept it. The doctor tries to look at her death from a psychological perspective in order to find the cause of it. At this time a large meteor is approaching the earth and James Wilson goes to investigate it after a tip from his co-worker from NASA. Upon discovering that his wife was the first human to leave this world in a spacecraft he goes to work at the space station with his brother. He also has to deal with a little man who has come with him from Hawaii to investigate the event that occurred that day on the beach in Hawaii and who is now becoming more and more disturbed by the fact that it all happened so fast!  The atmosphere in this movie is a mix of the science fiction, as it involves the exploration and study of the human mind, but also of the romance and the mysteries that surround it, and is one of those movies which gives you an idea of how much science fiction is based on fact. The main character is well done, the movie gives us a realistic look at a scientist.  This is not a movie about a science fiction movie, it is a good science fiction flick.  From what i understand the story is about the scientific investigation of a comet that passes over the earth on its way toward the sun. When the comet hits the earth the people are very frightened by the phenomenon and a lot of space ships go to earth in order be ready for the arrival of the comet. This movie also features a little woman who is an astronaut who comes with Dr. Wilson to the station on earth in case the comet does collide with the earth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an excellent adaptation of the comic of the same name, written by Alan Moore. It is also one of Moore's best, and one of his least sentimental. And this is a pity, because its moodiness is almost entirely due to the presence of Richard Wagner's Parsifal and its setting. While the film is technically not very impressive (even by Moore's standards) it is still a very moving and enjoyable film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the end, I'll admit I never thought I'd like a story where we actually see a lot of women getting their hair cut/groomed/shaved.   It was not a bad film but more of a meh kind of film (at least to me), and even if it's good, it lacks something and I never understood why it was done.  It's about a woman who is in a war zone and she's always having problems with her hair and how she keeps falling apart from it all. But when a strange man comes to visit her, she decides that she can let this person into her life.  This is how things go down.  The film is interesting and full of ideas and I liked it a lot, but this film is just a me-too.  I'm really interested in seeing this film, I really want to go there but the fact that it's a short and it's from the 80s means I'll need some time to digest it.

The ending didn't make me smile, I could at least say that it made me happy and not sad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was great. It has a very cheesy feel to it, and I love cheesy things. And it's really weird, but awesome. Also it has that very classic "what was that noise" moment in the background that will make you think that the movie is some sort of horror movie, but I think you should watch it with a nice soundtrack. I love how the movie never takes itself too seriously. And I think this movie is really funny.  And what's better is that it's actually funny. It's got a great soundtrack that just adds to this weirdness.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember seeing this movie a long time ago. The soundtrack was really awesome and a couple of the shots seemed to come together.  This is a great movie to watch with the sound on.  The main character is a doctor, Dr. James Gordon (Brad Pitt). He works at a hospital called Arkham Asylum.  The reason why he works there is to help criminals who have escaped the prison that is called Arkham. Arkham is run by a psychotic man called Mr. Freeze (George Clooney).  Freeze is constantly beating his patients for sport, because it is a sick thrill for Freeze.   Mr. Gordon has a son who has also been attacked by Mr.  Freeze. Mr.   Gordon  gives his son his bat-cowl and Mr. Ice uses it to control Freeze's daughter.  This film is not a bad film by any means.  George Clooney has his usual good performances and it is funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have watched this film many times, mostly in the theater with a great soundtrack to accompany it. It seems this was the film that made the big Hollywood bucks in the 1950s and early 1960s. It has been compared to all the great Hollywood movies from that period. Some reviewers have called it a great masterpiece of moviemaking, but I think it's a fine film overall. The music and the acting is quite decent. There is a lot of comedy going on in this film, and it's not at all predictable. The best thing about it is the fact that they do something to try and make you understand the characters in a different way. If that isn't enough to get a laugh out of you, there's lots of action, and some decent car chases. It takes a lot to get me excited about a big Hollywood film, but this definitely gets it. The story does a good job of trying to show how all of the different characters get involved in the adventure that unfolds. A very different story than the original, but an equally enjoyable one.

The new generation is played by actors who are the "good kid" (Jack Nicholson) and the "bad kid (Peter O'Toole)  are both great actors as always.  The movie is very well written, the humor is great and the music is also great.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a fan of films which take you to another time, another world where we can see ourselves as the "heroes" of a story.   The first time I saw this movie was in the 70's.  I still remember seeing this movie when I was a kid.  It seemed to be a very well done movie with a great plot.  The only problem which was with the movie was it took awhile to get to the ending.  There was a whole lot going on in the beginning which took a little longer to get through then what it is supposed to be. But it made up for it by a story that was very exciting and well told.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Love the movie! I love the theme! The music in the movie is amazing. I loved the scene with the guy with the glasses talking about how hard he worked to become a dentist in the 80s. Also that's a pretty cool line when his ex wife, a girl that works at a high end dental office talks to him about how much she miss her husband. I'm surprised there wasn't more. Also the scene when she tells him she's going back to work with a new partner...wow! I didn't know that was possible! It is a long movie, but you get a lot of humor out of it! I'm glad I watched the movie, it was really good, and it's a great movie to watch when you have a long day at work.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film has the feel of a 1970s horror-movie, though the plot isn't that complex.  After being abducted by a pair of vampires for an evening of fun, a couple of unsuspecting teenagers become the victims of their very own satanic satanic ritual, which involves a bunch of girls from the local high school who are all willing to commit evil acts for a big reward.  This movie has a lot of elements that will probably leave you scratching your head, such as: -The film is almost entirely shot inside the house of a family.  This house could be from a Stephen King short story or a weird 1970s B-movie from somewhere in New Jersey.  -The vampires are all dressed in black and look sort of like a bunch that just ran out of a horror movie that nobody liked.  The girls and the young man have very little in common and they never interact, making them rather bizarre and one dimensional characters.  They aren't really scary, though.   -Some of the dialogue in this film is bizarre, like: "You know I'm here to save you from the vampires." and "It's too late for us, but I'm not really going to stop you"   And it ends with the young woman calling her father in a way that doesn't seem very nice.  There are several other characters who do not have much of an impact on the story.  I will probably not be watching this movie again, but it is a fun little film.  It does have some problems, like some of the violence seems over the top (this is the 1970s) and the ending is rather abrupt. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film that shows you a couple of the problems with our system. It's just not as smooth and easy as it should be.  You'll be reminded of our problems when you see the way our leaders have to bend over backwards to avoid hurting their own skin.  This is a shame, since some of the people that run this country are good people.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great mix between comedy, science fiction, romance and a little drama.  The science fiction aspect comes from the story of a small alien named Tug, who is sent to Earth to get information. He is a bit of an arsehole, and is rude in the most wonderful way. The other alien species are quite interesting too, like a kind of cockroach in a spaceship. The romance aspect is between the human doctor Dr. Riddel and the alien, Tug. RIDDL is a brilliant scientist, who's really able to use the science on her planets to help humans, as well as a kind and gentle alien. This movie does a lot of things at the same time, and it's just so much fun! My favourite parts of this film is the action, the alien scenes, and Dr. Tug's scene with the sexy alien! This film is a must watch for all Sci Fi Fans!

For some reason, there was never any film from him about the time of the great "discovery". He had a different project called "The Discovery" which was a sort of sequel to "The Sky's the Limit".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I am going to tell you this story from first to last.  I think you're gonna like it. It's a story about a girl who's gonna tell you a story to tell to you."  A short, little film, about a young girl who wants to go to school with a boy. She doesn't really go through that.  She's a very shy and timid girl who doesn't have many friends.  However, she also has a little crush for a guy (Tommy) she likes.  They get into a terrible accident and her family takes her to their house.  It's not a good home.    The house is in trouble.  I won't say much more about the story, because it's very short and there aren't any words that really explain it very well.  But, I can tell you that if you are a fan of "The Ring" you will enjoy this story.  One of my faves.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The characters are likeable:         The story is good: ? ?  If you read the book, the story is not like this:?  ?    What makes it a gem of a movie:? Heard a lot about this movie: "It's an ugly movie, but I'm going to see it anyway because it's a good one!" - "In the end I'm glad I didn't go see the movie!" -  I don't think so...      There is something very appealing about this film. The story is intriguing; there is a lot of good acting. But the performances don't hold a candle to the acting in the book... The acting in The Muppet Movie (1980) was not the most original. But this film is an absolute masterpiece. The characters are all very likable. The scenes have a great sense of humor. If you can find a copy of this movie without being in a hurry, I highly recommend it.   Best movie of the year: (I'm not judging here)   I am surprised to see such a large negative response to the movie "Muppets Most Wanted"... I have always thought it was a very fun movie to watch. When I watched it again recently, I was struck with how different it looks with modern CGI. It's really a shame that the film is so bad...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a perfect world, the story would have been about a group of people working on an oil platform near the ocean in a place called St. Louis. At this time the United States was in a deep depression, and the state of Missouri was the epicenter for the "American War on Depression". These people were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and while they weren't exactly good folks, they were good people for a change. In spite of their problems, their faith kept them working hard in the hope that they would someday succeed. But that was in the not too distant past. Now it was about a generation later when an oil company had set out to drill a well in the middle of a desolate bayou and the people had to figure out how to keep it alive in the face of all the storms they were suffering from, and all the trouble it was causing their community. The film makes a very interesting point: that depression in America is almost exclusively the responsibility of women. The women who make up the group that is the "Feds" are a pretty tight knit group, and even during a down time they were always willing to help each other out, even if it was just getting a coffee or a sandwich. They had their problems too, and sometimes the "feds" needed help with those problems, but in the end these problems were solved by prayer, and they had their faith. I really liked the "stereotype" of the "crazy Mormon" that is presented in the first quarter of the movie. It's a very fun film, and although it was a little too long for my taste, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  This review is part of a three part series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is very realistic, as it takes place in a dystopian future. All the characters are realistic, and in a more realistic future, they would be very different. This is a movie that you must watch. I just finished watching it and it's a very good movie with strong character's. The only thing that you might dislike about it is the ending. I'm not a big fan of endings.  I hate the ending when a movie has a lot of plot twists, but the movie is great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is so very beautiful, and so beautiful in a way that is so sad.   The entire movie is beautiful, but the first part, in particular, is simply stunning.  The story is about a mother and son who are going out to collect the money from her mother's estate. It is all very sad, and it is all so beautiful. I felt like I was watching a movie with a very sad theme. It was very painful, and I didn't know what to think when I first saw the scene where the son looks for a gun.  I thought to myself, "What the hell is a gun? It's so not a gun."   I feel that the main problem with this movie was that a film director made the movie and didn't let anyone who knew the screenplay write it. I know I said that about several movies that I liked, and this really is one of the worst, and probably one of my worst, movies. I really hope that some of the people who wrote this movie write a screenplay because it is so bad, and there was so little of it that I really don't think anybody who loved this movie will ever like it.  A couple things that are worth mentioning: the music is beautiful and it has this beautiful quality, like that beautiful quality one has when they are holding back tears and feeling like crying. I think this is a film that should be seen before you fall asleep.  One other thing I like is the fact that when the wife gets out of the car and is going to throw the money into her husband's hands the husband picks it up and it appears to be from a bag that is filled with money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a fantastic example of the way an actor can play a role, the way a director can present a plot and still keep the emotions alive. There is no dialogue in the film but I found myself laughing, the acting is good, there is a lot of humour and humour is well used in this film, the music is beautiful and you really feel the effects of the fire.        So, what else can I say about it? It's a fun, funny movie to watch, well-acted and really well directed by a film fan. The best thing about it is that I haven't seen this film since I was 12 and that doesn't seem to be a good thing.   Overall:  I've been watching a lot recently that's mostly Japanese, as well as a lot that's either American or British and I was really interested in this. This is not a bad movie, it's just not my favourite. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little apprehensive when I started watching it, I was hoping for more of a story to be told. I ended up feeling more like an episode of a sitcom with a side order of sex and violence. I think a show about this couple being married and not being able to have a family for 3 years is a little much, but in a fun way. My wife and I were both laughing our asses off for the entire hour. It had a little bit of a PG-13 rating which I think is really appropriate in this day and age, but we had no problems at all watching it. It's just a fun comedy to watch and it's really well done. I look forward to seeing more and more of these two.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those films that everyone should see. The actors in this film play with the characters the way the characters are. The whole thing could have been so much better, but at least it is an interesting story. This film does a good job of getting to know the characters and their life, and showing just how silly the whole ordeal could be. You'll also get a good amount of humor in this movie. I really enjoyed this film. I'll definitely go back and watch another sequel as it's pretty good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      It took me a while to catch onto the show, as it was only released in the UK. I had heard of it, and even watched a clip, but I wasn't sure what it was about. It's a story about a girl named Dina, who finds herself in a world of witchcraft and mysticism after taking an elixir of eternal life called the 'life elixir', and suddenly realizing that she too had the power to make people immortal. She uses the life elixir to bring life to a cat and a snake to her home. She also finds it to be able to do a number of other things, as the cat is able to speak, and the snakes are able to talk to her. Dina finds there to be no need for human interaction at all. She has lived a long life without ever having to interact with humans. She soon discovers that the only way of leaving the world of the supernatural was to sacrifice herself, which she does by swallowing a large dose of the life Elixir (which is actually a snake) and is returned to earth. Dineesh is a young girl who finds she has inherited her aunt's curse. She tries to deal with her new found power by going through a series of adventures with the friend group of Zorin and Dina. One day a beautiful young blonde woman named Shauna appears, claiming to be a spirit and wanting to help Dine. I thought they did a very good job at making Shauna look like a genuine person. Her personality was quite unique as well as being quite funny as she tells Dineish jokes and is always very quick to comfort her when she is worried. Shauna's real name is Shauna, or Shanna to give her her original one. She is actually quite the little beauty and her personality is very easy on the eyes. She certainly is something different to Dine, and her introduction to her is very sweet. She quickly takes Dine to task for a variety of small things that have happened to her in the past. Her first major interaction in the show is with Dine who has a habit of talking to herself. I found it hilarious at times. As Dine is the one to do it, Shauna tries to do the same, and when her voice changes I found myself laughing out loud. I also found a few times when she was in trouble, but always Shauna got to her rescue, even if she got in a little trouble herself.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know this is late but I have been waiting a long time for a director to take over the movie.  And not even a brilliant one such as John Carpenter and not the one that should be making this movie as its his style.   This movie has a story that will last through the end of the movie and it has a lot of action to be a great movie. The plot is very well written and the music is good to be in a film like this.   I thought the ending was good also but i know that it is not a masterpiece. I am not an action fan but I found myself with the most action in this movie. This is the first time I ever see people on bikes running away from helicopters.  They seem to have a special ability to run into the air just with that look and their arms fly right past the helicopter.     But its not just them who have special powers.  There are also a bunch of people on motorcycles like a biker gang and i am surprised that it took that long for the director to see that this is a great idea.  A man who was a bad driver and a very arrogant one had to make a deal and when he got his job back from his boss who was the owner of a trucking company they became friends.  One night he has one of his drivers pull over to the side of the road to take a phone call.  The truck has broken down and the driver is getting frustrated with the whole business.   And this truck is going to be his new dream, that the truck company has made.  But the other driver sees that the man is getting mad and he wants a change of driver.  He tries to call him but the truck breaks down again.    So now the owner has to make the guy a new partner if he ever wants to save this business.  That is when the biker biker group comes to rescue the owner.   They can't believe the man thinks they are the best thing since sliced bread and all that they are after is the truck.  So a shootout has to be had between the bikers and the truck that is not taking the bikes well but to no avail.  With a few people dead and the owner dead, the bikers have won.   The director knows how to shoot a motorcycle and he gives the bakfiets and drivers a chance to give each other a fight.   They fight to
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "You are either a good person... or a bad person!"   The first half of The Last of Us is great.  I can't say how well it is paced compared to games in the past (I still think it takes way too long to get through), but I am still a big fan of the setting and the characters.  The movie is set in a small town on the outskirts of New Mexico in the 20th century (well actually 21st Century), and it portrays the horrors of the Great Depression in the most gruesome and painful manner.   In the first half you can get an idea about what is to come; a small farming town that has been completely ruined by the Great Recession.  You see how the townsfolk are surviving by working the fields and the farmhouses, and how this is the only way they can stay alive and get by.  But then, this is a town that is still struggling.     It is the town that lives on hope that if they can get the right kind of supplies to the townspeople, they will be able to get by, and by that time they will have found a way to rebuild and get back on their feet.  It's a good story, and the ending is a fitting sendoff to a good series.  As it ends, you can't help but feel sad for the town, and you can tell that for all of the hardships they have endured, they have not given up hope.  What is interesting is that even though this film is set on the 21st century (a time where life is generally good), there is a distinct feeling of the past.  And I think this is due to the fact that you see a man, named Ellie, who is suffering from a mental illness and he has to find a way of surviving without the help of his family, and he does this by trying to find other people who have similar problems.  That's about it, but you get a good taste of the misery of the Depression (and the horrors that can happen to people with mental illness).  So, as I have said, I think that the First half of the movie is an improvement over games.  However, it is still a movie (although I did like The Last Of Us a lot more), and not much is done in the first hour.  To me this is where the movie falls down a bit.     I also have to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is one of the greatest movies ever made. I loved it so much that I wrote a review on my website just for it. The movie has all the great qualities of an excellent movie. The plot is simple: a little old man lives alone with his wife (in the movie, his wife is a pretty, beautiful woman who is an alcoholic) and his son (I know that the movie is based on a book, but don't worry about it. I love those books, and the movie has the same book-like quality). When the old man dies, his son has a stroke. When the son is brought to the hospital, the doctor (Mr. Lebowksi) tells him there is nothing wrong with him, and he is released. The doctor then informs the old woman and husband that he thinks that the kid is going to die, but he is going in for a routine cat scan. The old woman decides to take the kid to see his doctor, but she has to wait because the doctor is a real doctor who can fix everything. The mother is upset, but the wife is happy. It seems that the big man is finally going to get better. She is in disbelief. When he is finally well enough to travel with them for a while, he goes off and has a good time. He goes out dancing, picks up a prostitute, and takes care of them. One day he decides that he wants to pick up a beautiful woman and go to Las Vegas. He makes his way to one of those strip joints where you can pay $100 for a lap dance. He walks in and orders a drink and immediately starts dancing. The lady who was dancing right in front of him is none other than the woman who was to marry him! He goes on and on until the lady gives up dancing. He is going insane with joy, until the barkeeper runs into the room. He tells the barkeep to take it from there. The barkeep asks the old barman if there is anyone else who was here, and then he sees the young man who was with him. He says, "Who the hell are you?" The young man responds, "I am the guy in the movie." I had to pause this one several times before I was able to put it down. The scene was perfect. When I finally came back to it, I just had to cry. I was so sad that a movie about a poor man
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's good because it's pretty and it has great songs. It's pretty good because of the special effects, the costumes and the music. The best thing in this movie is the special effect in the opening sequence. It has a feeling like that of an "opening scene" that you see on an episode of "Star Wars" (i.e. Luke's first adventure). There is some sort of ray that falls from the sky and the people see it. Some of the people scream and run and then some of them climb out of the way, others look back and smile. The ray is so powerful, it makes the rocks crumble and you can clearly hear the people's screams. The sound is amazing. If you look closely, you can see some of the rocks that collapsed, some of which are still floating.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never thought I'd say that about this movie, but here we are: It's the good old days, when "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas" were the films to see in the middle of the summer (or whenever you could make a movie in the summer).  The characters are still very much on-point, the dialogue is very memorable, the director is still very good, and the story is just as fun and good as ever.  And as a movie about a tough guy, it has a lot to live up to, and manages to live well on its own, even if that doesn't happen often, when a good character has a nice story, which is something that the director knows very well and does a great job of keeping true to.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I remember correctly, we are supposed to take our seats in the theater with a group of 5 people. After the movie, I am standing in a hallway with my daughter, who is 2, who tells me "You know, the movie was really funny. I liked it because they had different kinds of food and then some of them made food." She is not a very good story teller but the fact that my daughter would make that comment was great. It was a little embarrassing in some of the scenes, especially in the 2nd half when they start to sing, but it was really hard not to laugh, especially when the "B-movie" band (played by the same people from the movie) sang some of their songs. The movie was over long before I got to finish watching it (we were in the first row) but I was glad I had a chance to finally see the movie in a theater.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A man is trying to track down the man who has been killing and robbing the people of a small American town. I am not sure if this is the right review to write, but the movie had me laughing all the way through. This film is about a man who goes to a small town in the United States to try and find a man called Joe (yes, this is actually his real name), who has taken over all the towns people are robbing and killing. When we first see this film we get to see Joe (played by an absolutely ridiculous John Rhys-Davies who has a funny Scottish accent like some sort of a madman) get out and start robbing some more people, which was rather strange as he seemed to have a good reason for the robbery as he was going to the store he had stolen some money from, which contained a shipment of cigarettes. We then see Joe again as he walks down a street to his home, which is just a shack, and we start to see the kind of a life the little man leads. He sleeps in the shack, he doesn't have any money to pay the guard who is to do his rounds, he has to steal from the local people just to survive. He is almost a psychopath, but does what has to be done and will kill anyone that gets in his way to save himself from what seems like a slow and boring life. He takes it upon himself to protect some of his fellow town folk. After he catches a little boy watching a soap opera he is quite happy, as it was one of the few programs he had watched as he had been sick for some time, but when the boy comes to find him he tells him that he wants to tell Joe about a story that he has heard before. This would be a great place to end, but I must admit I did like the whole story of Joe having to find out who the bad boy that is killing the people, and just where the hell is he hiding all the time! I really loved the movie. In the end, it is Joe who is going to solve this mystery. The one thing I must say about this film is that it really is a story of love. I love stories of love! As a fan of the film I really enjoyed this. If you were not a fan, do yourself a favour and do not watch this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie a lot, it's fun, a little funny, and the character development is done nicely.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only reason the story worked was because there were a lot of different ways to write a short movie and this is one of them. You have the usual kind of humor here - lots of funny lines, lots of awkward situations, a woman with a heart problem, a cop playing with a toy dog, etc etc etc... It all worked. I never really expected to laugh so much at a movie like this.   It's a little corny looking at it from the outside, but it's always funny.  It also has a little more heart to it than most of the other films on here, but I don't think that's a bad thing.   …
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A short movie which deals with a young man who is about to be released from prison after several years of good behavior.   The film deals with an older man who likes to teach younger men how to act good while he himself is a bad actor.  The only thing I can say about the movie is this: don't pay any attention to the plot, don't get interested in the characters or their back stories.  I am going to go back to viewing this movie as a whole because it does bring me great joy and makes me smile. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A rare gem in the sea of '80s romances. This film was a little overrated, but if the premise is a love triangle involving a little boy, a big dog, and a princess, I can get behind that. With a couple of extra scenes it makes a better film, but with the cast in this film you were kind of looking at a different version of Pinocchio. Not much of interest to say about this movie, but it's a good one to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Crazy, crazy, crazy.   I've seen these movies so many times now, but it still makes me laugh out loud to hear it all.  It's a crazy movie, to be sure, but its just a ridiculous comedy.  Its all silly, and if you are not expecting it, then you are going to love it.  So what do you get for your dollar?  A big group of people driving around a lot of crazy cars while playing with fireworks.  Some of them are really good at what they do, others are a joke.  The driving is really bad, but the driving is the most entertaining part of the movie.  I think that it would be a great film to drive around and watch the people going by with their toys and stuff.  I would love to see this movie on TV.  But it would have to be a network and not a cable channel that has this thing on for a couple of hours a night.  And I'm sure that the studio would get sued for a ton of money.  There are a couple good scenes with the cars, but other than that it is just a bunch of crazy kids and their toys. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the original Star Wars trilogy, Leia has a number of scenes where she makes the right choices. There is a moment when she's being captured and is tortured. I was not a big fan of Leia and a number of the things she was doing in the prequels did not work for me. However, I thought this movie was much better than the original trilogy.  In this movie, Leia is much more capable of running her own ship and has an actual plot line. A plot line that takes her from Alderaan, through the Death Star, and on to some of the other planets of the Empire. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Lars and the Real Girl" is a good film. It has the most amazing soundtrack of all time and has the best romantic chemistry between the actors.

It is a classic and will never get old, especially not if you watch it on a rainy day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I really thought that this one was going to go down a little easier than The Man From Atlantis. It doesn't have the same sense of drama as Atlantis, however it's more of a 'comedic drama' than an epic. You can tell that many of the lines were ad lib'd, it had a lot of the jokes of the film mixed with some comedy. The characters are not quite as well written as The Man from Atlantis."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love a good zombie movie. Not just any zombie movie, but a very specific zombie movie: a very American zombie movie that uses a lot of local settings, but focuses a lot on the small town of Monroeville, Pennsylvania in the 1970s.  Not only does this movie have a great deal of action (with blood and gore!), but the humor and suspense that it creates in the town is terrific.  I think this movie is best enjoyed with the sound off.   I don't think this is the kind of thing a group of friends could make up in a week.  The fact that the first half of this movie takes place in a small Texas town is not something that is lost on anyone.  It is a horror movie that takes place almost entirely on American soil and a story that is best told from a small town perspective. I like the fact that it is a good horror movie with enough tension and suspense to really keep it going for a bit. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is actually a good old fashioned old fashioned horror movie.  It has its scary moments but the main focus is on the scares and the characters.      The cinematography is very good, it makes you want to pay attention, the characters are not bad, they are very well drawn and the scares are pretty real.   The characters are quite different, it is like there is some kind of an oddball in the group, who likes a pretty face and a great body.  He is very friendly when he first appears but later he becomes a very selfish man.    You can't get anything out of him and I was wondering how he could have done what he did, I just found it very unbelievable.  At least there is something to this film...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen it. But, when I was a kid I watched that old war movie that played in theaters in the mid to late 40's. It was about a bunch of soldiers being captured in North Africa by the Italians. One of them is a kid named Jimmy. I liked him then and I liked the movie that much more. I'm sure it was a lot of fun to go to the theater and hear that old song. Now, I think you know what the song is about:   They say he is a good boy,  But when he talks he doesn't like to have a friend  He is very lonely,  the kid knows nothin'.  Now the Italians say you look like a bad boy, But that's alright  Cause when they capture you they're gonna cut your ears off.   The kid doesn't know what to do with the whole situation. He is really sad. And he decides to go find a way to get out of it. And at the end of the movie, we meet him at home with a big, shiny, black and white bear in the middle of the screen. When he looks up, Jimmy looks up and is glad to see that the bear is back. It is his friend. It's Jimmy again. It brings him back to life and they are buddies again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing is that this one is very faithful to the comic books and it's great fun - a lot of fun, even, but some serious problems. I think the main problem is that the acting is a bit too amateurish. There is one scene where the villain (John De Lancie) is in his costume and some of the supporting characters don't really understand what they are watching. And sometimes they are very silly and funny, and other times not so much. The scenes with some of them playing a video game are the best parts. If the scenes are so good, maybe the actors would be better than they are. The film is a fun action movie, but it has a little problem with its plot; it has some problems that could easily have been avoided. However, I liked the fun.   This movie is based on the comic book written by Jim Shooter and illustrated by Steve Ditko, and I have to say that the comic, and the book it's based on, are both fantastic. If I'm being honest, I am a big fan of the comic and all of its related books and films. In fact, I'm pretty sure that I am the only person who can honestly say that The Avengers is superior to the TV show. But as this is another adaptation of the comics, and as some of this stuff has already been covered in the film The Avengers, I thought I might as well cover some of what has been changed in this movie. Some of the changes in the comic aren't significant enough to warrant mention, but a couple of them are. For one thing, I have heard that Spider-Man has a new girlfriend. She doesn't appear to be Mary Jane Watson, but this is probably just an error on Marvel's part - that is, a mistake they'll make in a future movie. Also, one of The Human Torch's superpowers has been eliminated. This is probably because this is the first time we've seen him in the movie who doesn't have the ability to fly. Another important plot change was that Stark's father died. This makes more sense in the book than it does in the movies. He dies from a disease that, according to the book, he was going to develop for a cure. Now the movie says that he died of a stroke, but that is definitely not what happens in the novel. His death happens when the villains take over and steal the cure, and Stark is too afraid of them
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was really enjoyable, the characters were interesting and I liked all the characters. I was hoping that the movie would be like a comic-book version of Star Trek, but it wasn't. It is more of a movie that just happened to be on TV.  There were some jokes and jokes you get with every movie made these days. But the movie is good enough and worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen The Exorcist since I was a teenager and I have watched so much, from the good ( The Exmortis) to the bad ( The Omen), and this was the very good. There were lots of things which made the film interesting, such as the appearance of a character which is not only a demon from Hell, but a demon with a human personality. This was a really nice idea and I also like the ending. If you watch it, it should be a wonderful film. Also a great movie is The Haunting of Hill House (1979). Also starring Anthony Perkins and James Cromwell.  Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of this movie is the most engaging part of it. It's got a cool, gritty story set in a world where humans are all dead. What makes this movie so great, is that it doesn't have any gore whatsoever. It doesn't feature a zombie attack, a shark attack, or a plague. This movie has one simple goal: It's about a human man who gets hit in the head by a truck. I mean, how often do you get to see the protagonist of a movie get hit in a head by something?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that, after watching "Fifty Shades of Grey" (I'm writing in the third person here), I've really come to feel the pain the women are feeling because of this film. I understand that they love to play with pain, but they have to understand that there are boundaries. If you break them, you're going to get hurt. That's a lesson I've learned from this movie. The women in this story have been married to these horrible people for decades. They have never known life but these men and the pain they give them, the constant criticism, it takes everything out of them.   One woman tells the other woman that she loves her, but then she goes home and calls her a whore. It's all too much. There is nothing loveable about these characters, there's just cruelty, manipulation, greed, sexual harassment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first film with which I ever had a love affair was 'The Little Shop of Horrors', directed by the legendary Bambi director Carl Dreyer. ( Dreyert's name also made its way into 'The Wizard of Oz'.  Dreyers films were pretty good... ) A good little movie.   I am a big fan of childrens movies and in the past few years I've watched almost all of them. I've liked them since the days of the 'Bunch of American Kids' (which I thought were good... ).   'The Magic of David Copperfield's Christmas' is one such childrens Christmas movie. It's set during the Christmas season in the middle of the 1920s. A little boy, David, with a big belly and glasses and his father, Jack have a problem at Christmas time-they don't know who is going to play Santa and they haven't any gifts for the children. They decide to play for a dime and David does very well with 'The King in Red'. It's a simple story that follows the main characters until the end, which leads to a very fun Christmas Day.  As for my rating, this was a fun little kids Christmas movie with some fun action and a bit of mystery.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  This is a really good movie. I've seen it twice and both times, I was just amazed. It has the kind of feeling that makes a movie really special: you know that you're watching something special, you're not sure where it'll lead. You have to keep an eye out to find out, and you feel like you're waiting for the climax. And, just as it begins. The action starts off slow, but by the time it reaches its climax you're so blown away that you wish you could keep watching. There is also a very strong feminist theme. The characters (especially the main character) are so unique, there's a strong sense of humor. And you're left with this lingering sense of what might have happened if the characters would have gotten a chance to grow up. That, more than anything else, is why you love this movie. The final image is something you'll remember for years to come, and make you glad that it is there. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story with an intriguing plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a lot of problems with this movie in the beginning of the film but once I realized that it was a very dark and depressing movie it was much more tolerable. The story is very dark, there is very little comedy but then again, it is dark and very sad. It was a great acting performance from a great actor. The music is not really very good. I thought the movie was a little on the fast side with all the dark stuff going on, and the scenes were a little slow at times, but then there were things happening which were very shocking. I liked the way all the people died which was very tragic. The ending is a little weird but that was a good way to end the movie. A lot of people might not like this type of movie but it was really scary. I can't say enough about the performance and the movie made me go to sleep which was nice.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie alot and I liked it a lot a lot. You would expect a story about an old man who finds love again. But when an old woman is in love with an out of shape man he ends up in his old age. I like the character of the old man. I thought they should have had the old woman go off with the man and stay in the city with him. Instead they stay on a farm in the country with the old couple. He seems like an old hag in love but her character is very strong and she has a big influence over him. He is an old retired farm man who is trying to get his old self back. It's like a romantic movie about a couple in old age living out their life together with their children. It doesn't seem like a fairytale like "Bewitched." It has many elements to it that are very realistic and believable and makes you realize that a woman can have a strong character that can have strong influence over a man. It makes you want to see it again. You may have to wait a while to see the second film but it's worth waiting.  If you like this movie please visit my new website: www.susie_honey.ca
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am really loving this movie and its acting is superb. The movie is set during an alien invasion, and is about the aliens trying to take over Earth.  But the aliens don't have time to take anything so they have to move quick. The aliens decide to take off a UFO and make it appear from the ocean, they then launch it on an unknown trajectory, but in space time the aliens move faster. One guy jumps in a space ship and ends up in the ocean.  He escapes with the help of a couple of friends who he meets at a bar who make some money and a dog. I am happy with the movie and I wish that the film would get more popular but I can see how this might seem like a bad film to some people.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a fantastic film to see again. I can't remember the last time that a film was so much fun to watch as it is with this one. It really is one of the best comedy films out there. I thought it would be funny to think back to the 80's and the classic 80's sitcoms. It is a true family film and as a family man i would have loved to watch it again. There is so much laughter in this movie. You don't have to be a comedy buff to love this, but if you are a comedy fan, you won't have a problem with it.  This is a good picture that has a lot to say, but I will leave it as an enjoyable comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie that I had not really seen in any of my life, I had a chance to watch it, just to be completly shocked. I've been following this man for over half a century and he's been my favourite since I was a little girl. He's an anti-hero, no matter what the title might lead you to believe, and this movie is as good a movie in his hands as any other I've ever seen in my life. As for the rest of the cast, I'd say they were all as good as him, I never thought they'd be doing what they were in this film, but they did. I can say that the acting was very good, but the best part of the movie is definitely the music. It is a really fantastic movie to get in the middle of the summer. It's a very short movie, about 15 minutes in total, but it's still very interesting, and well worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In all honesty I like this movie a lot (I watched it with a girlfriend who loves all action movies and even likes the first movie a bit less). For me this one was very well made with a great soundtrack that kept me hooked and happy in the most part. The action was pretty intense. It had a very good script and the cast/crew did a fine job at pulling it off. This one's definitely not a must see for everyone. If you're a fan of the first and the second it should be easy to see why I give the movie 3 thumbs up. If the reviews of those movies were like this one I would definitely recommend this one to you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!   It has been so many years since I saw this movie and it still brings me so much joy to listen to their voices again. I especially enjoyed this scene with their singing a capella. The movie is a little slow at times which is fine, but if you're going to have a movie about singing, then it can't be all that. However, the actors did a very good job. The music is pretty good but it wouldn't be so memorable without the lyrics, which are funny in the best possible way. I do wish they had filmed this scene later but that was probably because of time restraints.   I haven't seen the other movies about "The Beatles" but this was the first one and I think it was the best. For a couple of reasons: 1) it was made about "a great band" and it tells the story of a great band, so it's more focused on that aspect. Also, it is the only one of the Beatles movies where John is the main character and it gives the movie a lot of authenticity. Also this film does a great job of showing the whole group, especially John and Paul, and the fans are shown in a nice way. This movie, in my opinion, is the greatest movie made about the Beatles ever. It deserves a lot more credit than it has gotten.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a lot of fun.   The story takes place in a world where men fight giant enemies called "Dreadlords", which can only be killed by the use of a special crystal, which is made by the Dreadlords.  The movie revolves around a group of men, who are trained to use this crystal.  One of the characters, "Sugar", is one of them. He is the smallest of the group, and is only good at a certain kind of fighting: sword fighting. One day his brother "Cotton", who has joined the group to prove his fighting skills, dies in a duel against one of the Dreadlord.  When Sugar gets the news, he refuses to be a part of it. Sugar and Cotton are very close, and Cotton knows that Sugar cares for him so much.  However, it turns out that the other men in the group have plans of their own. They want to fight Dreadlords in order to earn Sugar's respect, so they try to kill Cotton.  There are some interesting characters in the film, like a couple of women, one of which is an old woman named "Ginger".    It was a fun movie, and a very good one at that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, the story line in this movie is very simple, as the title says, but it's quite addictive and very enjoyable. The movie itself is so colorful and appealing as well. I wish it was a bit more action heavy but it was just that. Even if I was a big fan of the Star Wars films and enjoyed the ones with the robots and aliens, I never liked the "space opera" films because they always seemed to have a lot of plot-holes and stupidness going on. But with the Alien movies, the aliens never seemed to be as stupid or stupid as in the previous film. It didn't feel that the Alien story is over before it started and it's been very entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Wife is a very well rounded show, but a very slow burn. The first episode of season 3 feels like a slog. This is mostly because the writers haven't done anything to spice up the show. They haven't changed the plot of the season, nor the characters (I have no clue about the first two seasons). Instead they just give us what we're used to and move on to the next episode with the same tone. There's nothing wrong with this; it's pretty standard. But it's one of those shows that you don't enjoy for the same reason people don't like Mad Men.  I like characters, but I don't care for them that much. They have a lot of charisma, but nothing really shines. If we're talking about the writers doing everything wrong, I'd go with the way they decided to introduce the third female president of the US. They had this woman who was so brilliant, so powerful, but she seemed like some boring old woman. We had to learn that she was a woman and that she wanted to make the world a better place and become President because she liked it. This doesn't seem like a problem to me, but then again, I'm a woman. The other problem I have with this episode is that the writing has this weird habit of dropping a plot twist just as quickly as it is introduced. What's wrong with them, but they do that as well. I don,t like the plot twists either, but it's the writing that gets a bad rap.  I'll be honest, I loved this season so much that I wanted to read it. There is a lot to like about it, even if I didn't find all of it believable. This show has a ton of potential, I just wish it used it more effectively. There are very few shows with that sort of potential. And that's because the writing is very poor. The only good thing about this show is the ending. I like what they did with it. I think it could be better. But the first four or five episodes were fine, there's nothing really wrong with that. I'm going to be honest here, this is really going to bum me out. I'm not just saying that to get on a soapbox, but also because I don;t like this show. It's not bad. It just doesn't work. The writing can be a bit weird sometimes, but for the most part this
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can honestly say, if you are a fan of the film "Sleeping Beauty," you will find a lot to like about this one.  It is like a more refined version of the classic story, but with many different twists and turns along the way.  This is a very entertaining movie about a young woman who is the daughter of the King of the Night.  Her father has had no heir since the death of his first wife.  She wants nothing more than to prove that she has what it takes to make a name for herself.  I am not a fan a horror or romance, but this movie was just enough to keep my interest.  My favorite character in this movie is Queen Serenity.  You'll probably know who she is, but trust me when I say you don't want to forget!  The movie also has some great performances from all of the characters.   I enjoyed this movie as much as I did "SLEEPING BEAUTY."   
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ I saw this movie to the music of "The Sound of Music." I was not very satisfied. It was good fun to see a good old fashioned Christmas movie but did not have the charm of the film from the book. The children do not understand it at all. You need to learn something from the movie. It is a good idea to have a movie like "The Christmas Story" but it was badly done and badly put together. I thought it was a good show but I would not recommend it to a child. This is my last Christmas movie. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a real gem.   I love this movie. The best movie in the franchise.  This movie is the best of the series in terms of action and humor.  The movie is very realistic about the situation it depicts about a man who gets in with a beautiful woman and is given some free time by a couple that wants to adopt a child, and he is forced to come to terms with his new life. The movie begins with a man and woman getting ready to go on a walk in the woods while the man takes a shower.  After the shower they make a picnic on a nearby hill.  Then they start having a good time on the picnic as if it were the first time.  When the movie starts the man is wearing shorts and then changes into underwear.  They go for a picnic together to try and pass the time until the woman wakes up.  It's very romantic.  He gets upset about his decision.  But she assures him that he should just relax.  She then tells him that it's nothing personal.  Now there is a man (the best friend) who tells him to go to the woman's house and have sex with her.  I loved that aspect.  And of course you can't tell him it's rape as it's all in the past.  However, you don't care much about the sex as the woman is completely out of it.  As the movie progresses he starts to feel guilty about what he did and realizes it was wrong.  That's all he has left.  If it was the first movie and you've seen the other movies this is one that isn't bad.  In fact it's the best movie, if you haven't seen the others it will be pretty good but it's better than the others.  Only time you are left hanging is to find out what happened to the wife and son and who is adopted and who didn't. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************************ The first half was very good, it had many surprises and was worth the two hour run time. But it felt too long to the viewer who does not know the characters and their past, I really wish they would of condensed everything down to only half an hour. ***************** The second half is not as good as the first half, it is a rehash of the previous series, which is a shame, because they had a very good cast of characters with an interesting plot and some very clever concepts with some really good moments. The last half does have some really very clever moments and is a very interesting ending that I really would have liked to have seen more, but I really can't put the same level of effort into something as big and as ambitious as this. *********
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In The Year of Living Dangerously"  was one of my favorite "sneak into the movie and say hi" horror movies. It had the typical "crazy cult" vibe, yet it was fun. I was shocked to see it on a small screen in the 80's when I was still a teenager. And I loved it. My mom used to bring it to me every Halloween and always laughed as she sat next to me with her feet on my head and a look of horror on her face. And then there's "The Curse of the Temple", which was the only film I got a little scared of at the time. I think it was just the sound effect at one point, but I was a little afraid it would have been some kind of "Bobby-Cohen" horror-comedy. Maybe it was a different type of horror? Who knows. But the ending sucked the life out of it for me, even though it was pretty funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the greatest films ever made, a must have in all cinemas.   This is the only film where John Huston directs an entirely new screenplay for a completely new story from a different writer and a totally new cast in the movie.  The film is about the rise and fall of an American president.  Huston has a brilliant mind for directing and the cinematography is stunning, yet it feels like just another boring and generic American movie. I don't know if this film was made for the stars of the screen because there are so few stars in it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â I don't really know where to start when talking about 'The Thing' but I'll give it one shot. 'The T-Thing' is a great little horror film that I could watch over and over. The T-Rex scene, the opening set-up of all the nasty creatures and the scary T-Monster are some of the best that the low budget horror film genre has to offer. There's really only one weak point in the film: that the ending. The film ends as it starts by bringing the T-Robots, the 'Naked Man' and the creepy "The Thing". This is all great and then... The movie leaves you with a bad taste and the T.Rex scene takes a lot of effort from the film to get to and it really isn't that great. I think that there would have been a better ending in the movie if it had come at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good film, I must say. I've been waiting for one of those films with good story lines. It works, it doesn't work perfectly, but it does work. I can't see any other way to show the war than through the eyes of some soldiers who lost their loved ones in that war. I really can't believe that a film like this would have made it to the screen. If you haven't seen it, I recommend it very highly. It is not the masterpiece that it was marketed as, but with a bit of polish it could be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When we first meet Lina, she's sitting at home with her friend Lola. The only problem is that she's getting married in a few hours, which is a huge inconvenience to everyone, especially Lina. When Lina's mother comes down with a sudden illness, Lina is thrown into her old bedroom to take care of her and her young sister. Her old room is decorated with all those beautiful pictures and books she had when she was young. She loves them, especially the ones that talk about the time Lina came to live at their farm for a few months. These pictures and stories were all so much better than her parents and the old farm she grew up in... and they have to be moved... to the big city...   It's a small town in the middle of nowhere, but Lina doesn't mind at all. She lives comfortably and in harmony with her old friends, who include the cute, yet clumsy, Lola and the smart, but ditzy, Maria. The farm is run by some very rich men who have a lot of animals and they all like to have their picture taken with the ladies at one point or another. Lina plays the role of the "lady of the hour" and she loves everyone but hates her stepfather, who is always being mean to her. But she's not without her friend and neighbor, the lovable, but clumsy, Cello...   in fact, I don't remember the last time that I actually liked a Disney movie and I think that this movie is one of the most beautiful pictures that is Disney has created in a long time, and I must say that the story is very interesting and very well done, so I hope that it won't become boring in the third act, as it already has with the first two, when the characters lose interest and the plot doesn't progress in any way.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The first time I saw the movie, I knew it would be a classic. The only thing I hated was the voice that was used to narrate the movie. I was thinking of something like "the guy who played that guy" from "The Shawshank Redemption." The best thing about "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is the fact that it does not feel like the "shady" movie that the name suggests. There are a lot of funny and sad moments that really makes you think about how difficult life can be.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked the movie and enjoyed it.   The movie is about a man who has cancer that affects his vision, but he tries to look normal so he can carry on with his life. He tries to get his wife to help him with his eyesight, but she tells him it won't do anything, he will be just fine without it. One day he looks to see if he has been in a car crash and he realizes he is not looking quite as normal as he once did. He then finds a girl named Jenny (Cynthia Lillis) who was supposed to go to a special school for children that have trouble seeing colors. They were supposed to be separated.  He tries everything to get her to go, but to no avail. Then he gets a letter for her from her cousin saying that she is going to the same school but she wants to go with him, because her mother has died.  When they arrive at the school, they find that they are the only two kids with problems with seeing color so the teacher has arranged for them to have a secret dance with the other students. They go out to the dance and all of a sudden Jenny tells him that she hates him for turning her into a freak.  Jenny is able to see colors but Jenny looks as normal to the rest of the kids as she did to them, but then she is able too see colors and she starts seeing things that she never had before. The other kids see her as weird because they don't know what to make of her and the teacher also seems to think that she doesn't belong there.  The other students begin to get very interested in her and when she realizes that everyone is interested in seeing her, she starts to try to get a few of the boys to touch her so they can see her better too.  One boy and one girl have the same problem with their eyesight as Jenny, but they are able to hide it because they have another girl with them to look at her. When they are talking about the problem with the boys Jenny starts touching the other girl, but not as much as the boys. Then the other girls try to join in with the girls touching, but all of the sudden when both of the girls touch her there is a blinding light as the girls turn all red, Jenny looks confused as to what is going on and the others all start laughing. They all realize how funny that is and Jenny can't stop laughing as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Greetings!  I would like to start my review by reminding you of one of my favorite movies of all time (if not the greatest) The Godfather (1974).  This film was nominated for many Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director but it doesn't really get a chance to be shown in a theater.  It is a great film to watch in its entirety and as the years go on the directors make sure to maintain the quality of this film by making it look like it was made yesterday.    After the success of the first movie I guess the makers of this one knew they would have to have a sequel.  I am not really into revenge movies but I guess they just could not think of a sequel to this great film.  It has the characters of Don Vito Corleone, Meyer Lansky and the mob from the first film. If I had to put down any bad part of this movie it would be the scenes where the mob is in the movie the wrong way and being rude.  These are very minor flaws for me. I have seen this movie more than once and the same characters are in it each time.  To me this movie is better than it was the first time around.  This is a good film to have in your library and you will not be disappointed.  Recommended.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After finishing up a marathon binge watching a documentary called "Coffin Rock" this weekend, I had a chance to re-visit this cult classic. This movie was released in 1979 on American Video and is considered as a classic of independent cinema.  The film was directed by Peter Bogdanovich  (who also directed the great "A League of Their Own") and produced by John Sayles. The film tells the story of a group of boys who go to a house to take a nap for a night on the town.  What I love about it:  The movie has been known to get a bad rap.  It is not the best movie ever created but still a very good movie.  While the story and the acting were good (one of the greatest performances I ever saw was by Robert Redford) the story really isn't the main reason the movie is worth watching.  The true reason to watch this movie is the performances of the young guys.  This is not a movie where  they are "The Rock".  This movie is really about "C" and his friends who went to the party.   I was hooked from the second I saw this movie. There are many people that hate this movie because of the story line, which is probably true.  There are also those who love this movie for many reasons.  I really feel this movie got the movie made because of Robert Redwood who played "C". I don't know if I was more excited about a movie about a group named "The Goonies" or a group that played rock n roll.  Even more interesting is that this movie took years before it came out.  Some of you may already be asking why would a movie like this be made.  A documentary is a short film about a single topic and this movie happened to have several different subject's like a rock band, a couple in love, and a group called "The Coffins".  It wasn't until a few years later that they were able to turn the story into a feature film.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was not expecting much from this movie, since it was only a movie about a guy who works in the hospital. He has a heart attack, he wakes up and he is still alive. He decides to go back into the hospital to retrieve his stuff, but this time with help of his friend that is a nurse, he goes inside the hospital, and sees that the man in charge of the hospital is dead. And this hospital is haunted by the spirit of the dead man. They are talking about a patient named Paul, that has had his heart attack a number of times. Then he had to go into surgery one time and all the nurses, including his own mother tried to save him, but they failed, and he was killed. Paul is really upset about it, as if he is a victim. And then the doctors told them that it would take another month for the heart to work itself out, because he had a very bad heart. He starts to take it out on the patient Paul, and there are some other people in the room. And I thought it was good, it was just like a movie I would have watched.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't normally go to the movies much, and when I did, I didn't really think I was going to enjoy anything in particular. I did have a bit of fun when I first saw the title-card and when there were people screaming "Eyes Wide Shut" in the background, but I didn t really think much about it until the credits rolled and the music swelled.  This may be a long review, but if there was some way to sum up it simply, I'd say "Eagles are like that," but it's a bit better than that.   Budget: $20,000,000.  I am a little puzzled by the movie's budget, considering it comes from a major studio.  As much as the film could've benefitted from a bit more money, I think that it would've benefited the film even more if it hadn't cost so much to make.  The original cast is here, though, as is Michael Ironside. A small group of cast-members (Kathryn Bigelow, Bill Paxton, Anthony Edwards) join him again: in addition to Ironsides and Bigelows, who are both in their 40s now, there is a young woman who appears in this film who is probably his muse at that point and her face appears for a few minutes.  Michael Ironson plays a retired private eye who comes back from retirement only to discover that the woman he is supposed to be protecting is now living at his home with her four children.   He has to deal with an ex-Marine, who is a womanizer, the two kids and their mother, the wife and her daughter, a police officer and the wife's daughter (who is Ironsons' muse). All of these people do not get on, but in the end the film is a good thriller.  In a way, the plot could have been lifted from The Devil's Advocate.  Irons and Bigels are playing their roles as good cops and not-so-good ones. Bigelowe plays a little bit like Joan Rivers with a bit less comedy, while Ironsided is a bit like Jack Nicholson with a lot more acting. This movie was shot on location in South Beach (where the film was partially shot), and I think it is the first film made entirely in Hollywood that does not look like a Hollywood movie. The costumes were very good.  A few things
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The great thing about this movie is that it's almost perfect in every way. It's got some great action scenes, a good story to begin with, and is even funny throughout, and it's an absolute classic for those who love action movies (or any other kind of movie really.)  It's an enjoyable, if somewhat predictable movie, but if that's the kind of story you like then this should be on your Top 10 list.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is really really bad. It has a great plot about a man with the ability to fly who must use his powers if he is to pay the price of his own arrogance. This leads to him becoming an "eldest" child, where he spends all his time in his own world. At his own home, he has to deal with a group of mean girls which, to his astonishment, do not hate him but just think he is "a dandy." He goes around looking for help from the "wise women" who, by nature, think themselves superior. But after an accident which makes him lose some of his power, he returns to the city. Here he is forced to confront a group that is a menace to children as well as to all those who would abuse children. Written by Mark R. Plot Summary  Plot Synopsis
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story, while not very original or original, is an effective combination of horror and science fiction.    The plot involves an alien who comes to Earth looking for a place to settle.  Unfortunately the planet has been colonized by humans and the aliens have no way to pass information to them. They are so primitive that they don't even know how to communicate. It's a fun movie to watch and it is very interesting to see the aliens try to come up with ways of communicating with humans.  This is a great movie to show a little science fiction that is more entertaining than it actually is.

She is always looking for love and gets to meet someone she can marry, but who?  It was all a very nice romance, though it ended in a very sad way, with her husband being shot dead.  The film also had a lot of action scenes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You know, I have the best time with this movie. It makes me smile every time I watch it. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone, it doesn't make you laugh or cry and it's a classic. The plot is the most unusual, it's set up like a detective story that takes place in the small town of New York. All the kids in the school go to the New York Public Library (which is a library to them) to read a book called "The Cat In The Hat". The cat is really a talking cat and it says what the kids are thinking and that's how the story unfolds. The movie has so much charm to it and it reminds me of a classic classic. It's got such a good soundtrack and it makes this movie so enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When you first come across the movie for the first time you are taken by the beautiful and calm depiction of the beauty of the mountain and the beautiful landscapes and the setting of the film. The story of the story is a story about a girl who is trying to break her father's marriage with an older man and she ends up finding that her life will change a lot more than she thought. She is trying so hard to break away from her past and start a new life, however, she is not the best at living a life with others, and in an effort to overcome her own insecurities and not become a burden to them she is ready to do anything to make them realize she doesn't need to live like a servant. The film is very charming and I had a great time with it.    Recommended by: L.M.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I had the great fortune to be at the L.A. premiere of "Logan's Run" on Sunday, July 9, 2016. I was able to see the original in 1970, and it is probably the finest film to be shown on the big screen in Los Angeles. I'm also pretty sure it's the finest of the "Star Wars" trilogy, in some ways it is more faithful to the book. A few minor spoilers: Logan has been trained by his grandfather (played by an excellent Laurence Fishburne), who wanted to do good by providing a new start for the boy to lead a normal life. Logan's mother, Rose (Benedict Cumberbatch) tries to do the same, by training Logan to do just that. She's not successful, as Logan still doesn't care for her. Logan runs off, and is pursued by a man named Strom (Robert Pattinson), who seems to know more than he should about the boy's past. Logan tries to find peace with his past, and Rose tries to get him back. He finally finds peace in the desert, but it's not long before he has the opportunity to live again. But what awaits Logan when he is returned to the life he left behind? And does that mean a chance for a better tomorrow? I only wish I could have seen it, which is quite possibly because it was so good. It's been almost 40 years and I'm surprised by it still being good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched The Day the Earth Stood Still last night in a movie theater in the heart of New York City with a great view of Central Park, and was thoroughly entertained by it.  If you are a sci-fi fan, then you already know that it was in 1969 that Stanley Kubrick wrote this film and directed this picture.    In the beginning, we see a very old man in a lab coat.  He is sitting by a computer with a book.  As the camera begins moving, we notice that he has his hand on the book, and we hear the sound of a book being opened and closing.  The lab coat man then tells the computer to print out a paper version of a painting, and then his hand slowly slips off of the book and the book falls to the ground.  We then see the painting. The image seems to have an uncanny resemblance to a painting in a museum called "The Day the earth stood still".     In the center of the painting, which is very faint, we can see a small tree.  There are a bunch of trees around the edges of the picture, and in the center, the tree grows at a slow pace.  Then the painting is finished and we see the old man and his assistant walking away from the painting's center.  "I didn't see anything," says the old lady, "I'm just wondering where I'm going."  The old man replies, "Now I know.  Now, as I said, my life's been a very interesting ride, so far as I can tell.  I guess I've just come into a little trouble.   "Well," the old woman says.  She's holding up a book, which reads: "I'll tell you.  What the dog does is worse than anything else.  But as far as that dog is concerned, the only thing worse than him is the man in the cat costume who has to stay behind and watch him.  They'll put him to work making a sort of toy that won't do any harm.  One night he goes out to catch a mouse and sees it crawling toward him.    The next morning he sees the mouse coming and goes to fetch a bat and gets the right one and lets it drop, but the mouse gets behind him, and he can't get it out.   He runs around and round it and then finally hits it with a rock, and it
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought this was a good story with a good pace. The main character, a very young girl, was not only funny and pretty to look at but also very clever as she found an object that had a lot of value for her. I hope she finds a lot more and more of this stuff for herself. She is a little too young and naive to be all that she is as she is only nine. I enjoyed her character very much. It has a little bit of humor but it wasn't too heavy handed or cheesy like some horror movies. If I could add anything to this review it would be to mention some of the minor details that add to the film. The editing is good and everything is a very pleasant experience. I don't know about any of the actors but I liked the two little girls.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie starts out looking so innocent and so fun! The two friends run off to a party where they meet a group of boys which is a strange mix of boys. This group of young men are obsessed with the latest music and dance craze called 'Rhinestone'. And the dance is to be done with rhinestones that look like breasts. It is as if the boys had found a hidden treasure. This is what the boys are really into! They go back to their place and talk about rhinestone. But their friends have gone to bed! They want to keep dancing but then it turns out that the friends are not sleeping because one of them is a secret police. And if they do not play along with the cops then they will probably get arrested and sent to jail. This secret police is a little strange! If you are not careful they can catch a person who is dancing. They can catch anyone even if they are a grown man. They are very cruel and they don't get scared of any person. So the three friends have to play along to get by. But it is getting more complicated for them. The dance moves to a certain number of people each night so they have to think of a way to get it done. Then the dance moves even more people and they can't get the dance number to be counted. Now the boys have to figure out a way for the dance to be called off so they can sneak a couple of the secret police to the party and get them to count the rhinestones before it is over. The movie goes along very well and the song 'Rinestone' is very interesting to dance to. There are some interesting scenes in here like the secret policeman and some of the other boys. The film is enjoyable but the song is pretty annoying! I also found it funny that the boys would be in jail so long. This was a really fun movie and I will enjoy it for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a fan of films that show the beauty of the natural world. I thought this movie would be my favorite of the series because, unlike the previous films in the series, there were plenty of other places to visit, not just the beaches and the coral reefs.   The story is told from the point of view of the fisherman who is helping his daughter navigate through the maze-like maze of a coral reef.  The Coral Reef was the backdrop for the story, and the only part that looked real was the ocean.  I'm a sucker for a good story and even a good plot. It's a well told story with many interesting characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first part of the story is very different from the first part in a good way, and I like it more and more.  A movie about a girl who is obsessed with the fact that she was born in the wrong body.  It looks like a fairy tale or something (I don't know) but the story goes on and on.  The last part is like a horror movie.   The story is in english.  If you like fairy tale movies, this is the right one.  I hope to see this movie again!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think there is something about the movie that is very powerful. I feel it was a very interesting look into a very serious subject, the treatment of psychiatric patients. The film is about the treatment in New York of some very disturbed patients with psychiatric conditions. As we are seeing it, their treatment was in many ways, just like the treatment we all have to endure from time to time, but the treatment they had was done with all the cruelty of a madhouse. For all I know, it was all done for medical reasons. As for the treatment I think it is a very powerful story to tell about the life of a human being. But for my liking, the movie doesn't end on a very happy note. And I think that's a problem for this story to be told.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In any case I was happy with the movie. The cinematography was superb, the acting was fine, the story was excellent (the same thing that makes the movie a success is the characters who act well in the story - it's hard not to like a character like the one in the movie) and the action sequences were really interesting. A good story about good guys who fight bad guys who try to kill them! A very good action movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching the first three episodes, and reading the synopsis for the show in a bookstore, I was skeptical about it. I don't really enjoy the show's main focus of having to deal with a group of teenagers, so I had mixed feelings when it was announced that it was a comedy that focuses on them. I found it quite enjoyable, and did feel that the show has some potential. The characters were all interesting, and although I do not know who I am rooting for, it is definitely something worth watching. I do wish that it would focus more on a good friend of mine, because I thought the show is pretty funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'll be honest, I had not really thought much about this movie up until I saw it. I mean the whole thing seemed pretty simple: A woman (played by Tye Sheridan) who is a widow with four kids (two are twins) and no husband (well, at least not much) moves into a new house with a man who seems to be taking care of all the chores and she's the only one of the household who has a job. So yeah, I was expecting a pretty straightforward plot of a woman finding out that she has no husband and then going through the motions of trying to live a life that is actually somewhat resembling a normal family life.   In a nutshell, she meets the new man who she seems to fall in love with. He seems nice and seems to know how to play the piano (he's a pretty good pianist, in fact) and then he gets her to a piano bar that is run by the same man, this time as a bouncer, and then to an arranged marriage. As they leave the bar and go into a house, she discovers that she is now married to a married man who is actually an abusive creep and is a child molester (not to mention a rapist). It didn't take long for my jaw to hit the floor.  What a terrible movie it is.  So the bad part:  It's a very bad movie.  There is literally NOTHING about it that makes it interesting.  It is, in my opinion, just an excuse to have sex with children.  The plot is pretty silly; the kids aren't exactly "blessed" with anything, and that is not a particularly cute theme.  One of the things I loved about the kids in this movie is that they were just so silly and silly.  Every one of them had a silly name and a silly attitude and I loved them.  I would love to have seen more of them at the piano bar.  So it was so unfortunate that they got killed off.  Also, what a terrible title for a movie: Love at the Piano Bar.  But there are worse movies than this.  And if you want to see an awesome flick with some fun and lighthearted humor, then this is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Ghost" was, and still is, one of the very best horror films of the 80's. It's a truly original movie, and is a favorite of mine, not only because I'm an 80's film fan.  But more importantly, because it is a great example of how to use the power of the medium to make a memorable horror film.   What an extraordinary film this is.  The story is as follows: A college professor (Ralph Macchio) goes on a trip to Washington, DC, to help his son, a fellow professor at the university, on a conference.  He has been warned of an evil being lurking in the woods of this town that can only be glimpsed if the lights in the trees are turned off.  While there, it is discovered that the lights are off in the town because of a mysterious and evil being that has been living in them for several years.  The film is told by one of our four leads, Robert "The Ghost" Loomis.  Loomi's son is a brilliant, but somewhat shy young man.  As his father is out of the country, The Ghost finds a means to make his son more comfortable.  It begins by making The Ghost's life very comfortable, and he is not at all frightened by the new surroundings.  But The Ghost isn't at all happy with what the townspeople are doing to him, and his father comes home just as the creature has a vision of a horrible monster.  This is followed by some of the most imaginative use of the ghost/demon and horror movie formula I've ever seen.  There's a lot of the usual "creature" stuff going on with the lights going out, the lights being turned off, and a few scenes with The Ghost being forced to take a bath to get rid of the creature.   It's all very spooky, and this is one of my favorite scenes in the film.   But the best is yet to come. When The Ghost sees the monster, it attacks him.  Then, he becomes very sick.  However, he is able to get to his car, where he discovers a gun.  And when he pulls it out, he discovers the creature is gone. "It didn't exist, didn't matter." This film is all about how The Ghost fights the beast, and wins.  I don't think I've seen anything

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man Who Laughs is a decent comedy with a strong supporting cast. The Man Who Laugh was created by a young Japanese man called Takashi Mokobonji. He studied under an American comedy writer named James L. Brooks, and is best known for his TV series which ran for eight years from 1974 to 1976. The series is a mixture of sitcom and drama and was quite a success. Laughs plays the part of a poor middle-aged man who is living under the pretence that he is being taken care of by his wife, who is in fact a professional actress. She is married to a rich man named Haruko. She and Laughs live in a house of their own on the outskirts of Tokyo. One morning, Laughs and Haruko visit an art exhibit, the Tate Japan, when Laughs begins to enjoy himself and make small talk with the other attendees. Haruko goes home to her husband and finds him dead at home. When the police arrive, Haruko, Laughers, and the audience are all murdered. Laughes's last thought, as he watches the film of himself watching a friend get murdered for laughing is: "Well, I suppose I must have done something." Well, it is an entertaining movie with Lauges as the lead, a sort of a self-centered, spoiled person who is not above breaking the rules of society when he gets the chance. It was made for a low-budget (and probably very small, compared to today's standards) price of ¥3,000,000 ($32,600). It is a short film, lasting about twenty-five minutes, and it is probably the most famous Japanese film to have been made.

The movie is the first film I have seen about the Korean War and it looks as good as a Korean War film should. The story is good and the action is not so bad. I think that the Korean conflict film genre is getting really good. The picture, the music and the story were all top-notch and this is a must have for movie buffs. I can recommend this movie to everyone with a passion for war, Korea and the Korean Army and its soldiers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked the way the movie was produced- not too long it is about a man who has a problem: his wife has been dying for a long time and he's been keeping her under his roof, since her body is in a very bad way. They make several attempts to cure her but they never do anything. He decides to take her to Paris and get her a good doctor to help her. The man is a good guy and is good at his job. We follow the man through the different clinics to find a proper physician and his wife is not getting better, she's dying. Eventually her body fails and she dies. We don't know why but we know she doesn't deserve to die like that. The next day the man takes the body away from the house, we don't see the body but he takes her out in a carriage to a place where she is laid on a bed. At first she doesn´t react, she is in pain- then suddenly she has a vision, a vision about the girl she's left behind and we see her in Paris. It seems she has never been apart from her father and they have been together so long, that they are very near each other. She looks after him like she has been doing her whole life, with a little help from her lover. But they never made love in their life. It is a love story about a young girl and a young man.

Stover has some of the best acting of his career, and is very sweet to his old dog with a big bone. The film is full of the funny dialogue of Stover. I wish he had directed a third movie, this film was perfect to me in the time I didn't know he was dead.   A good movie and very entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a few friends who loved the movie and thought it was a lot of fun, but the first 2 minutes of the film were a bit too slow to keep my interest. Then the movie became a fun little action flick, as the heroes of the story made their way through the city and ended up fighting an army of thieves. The characters in this film seemed to be a little more like comic book characters, than you see in most superhero movies. They are like that guy who is always wearing the coolest hat or the bad guy who always wears the best trench coat. They also had a pretty good time showing off their skills and abilities in combat. The action scenes were fun to see, the characters seemed to have a more interesting back story than most comic book movies I've seen. Then it went in a weird turn after a fight and the heroes had to escape through a window. It just seemed like there was too much fighting and fighting was pretty slow until the end. It was a fun action movie, but if you don't want a superhero movie, this one is a very enjoyable piece of entertainment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The best way to introduce someone new to something like this is to take them to a good, old movie with a good cast of folks"  - John G. - The Dead and the Damned (1964) The film has a certain je ne sais quoi that makes it an instant classic for me.  The film is full of wonderful, eerie, atmospheric vignettes.    The film is a dark comedy with many references to ancient cultures and religions.  The story has elements of horror, mystery and murder.  I am not really a horror person but I think this has a lot of it.  - Joe F.  If you are a fan of this kind of film, you will love this one.  An old, strange story, full of a good mix of comedy and mystery. - Robert L. (U.N.C.L.E.)  I found the film to be interesting, but not so unique to be memorable in any way. - Mike T - Night of the Creeps (1966)  It is really fun watching the crew of the Enterprise go through the various bizarre situations they encounter.  Not all of them are good, but they do a good job for the most part.  My only real complaints: one of the aliens doesn't have the usual hand, and the "stolen" mirror that they use to get into one of our crew is a rather boring mirror.  But, again, these are not deal breakers.  And it should be said that there is a fairly small budget for this film.  If I'm to be frank, a lot more of the crew should've been killed.  This is a great film; very entertaining and fun, and full of atmosphere.  It is a shame that they didn't include the alien "Gremlin" and the T-Shirts.  Also, I was disappointed to see the Tardis make several appearances in this film (which I thought would be a lot less common). - John S. (NYC) 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The great thing about this film is that it is a very old-fashioned story from a genre that has now become totally redundant with the invention of more exciting and more realistic action films.  You might not like the main guy, he is pretty much a very boring antihero, but I'd like to give him a try, especially if you've got a good heart and aren't afraid of watching a very bad movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie which is more about the human condition than it is about a race of vampires is a refreshing one. A darkly poetic story told by a very good actor. The movie is in a style reminiscent of the old silent films but with the added visual beauty that only a director who knows how to shoot a movie can bring to it.  And now for some spoilers:  This is a story about a young man with very limited powers who becomes a vampire who lives in a world which looks at him with mistrust. A person of a kind who does the right thing no matter what the cost.  His world is populated by an entire species of vampires whose existence as a race is unknown at best and even less know that there are other vampires than those of the original.  There are also humans who believe that the vampires are to be kept in check and who view the vampires with a sense of fear rather than fear itself.   But of course there are others who are not so certain and who are always on the lookout for more.     In between his studies, his mundane life and his work, he has a little trouble with a girl named Rose who is a friend of his best friend.  She has never really liked him. She was so annoyed with him when he was a child, that when she finally grows to maturity she treats him as a friend but when they finally meet they have very little in common. She is a dark skinned woman whose whole life is a struggle against an invisible enemy. Rose is the person who is closest to him and who helps him through his various trials. She makes him laugh and smile through all his troubles.  And it's in her life that he makes a decision to follow his dreams.  The story takes its time to develop but eventually the reader will come to the conclusion that he will not be able to find a relationship with a human, and that life as a vampire is something he is not ready to give up.  He is a man who can only keep his secret and he will have to do it in order to become whole.  But in his search for someone he will meet new companions who will also give him the support he needs and with whom he must make some difficult decisions in order for his journey to be a bit more complete.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The characters are all great and interesting. It's just a shame the film is so short.    The only problem I had with this is that it has no real climax, so the action and the characters go by quickly and all the bad things you may have to see in this movie are just that: bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** I've always liked horror movies. I like the slow pacing and creepy atmosphere, the suspense, and the tension of the story. However, in this movie, I wasn't really enthused by the story's suspense. At times, it was a little too slow and drawn out for my taste. It had that 'it's-not-going-to-get-better' feel to it and I was not really convinced there would be any good payoff for the main characters' quest. The characters were all very flat and not really believable or likable. The script was really hard to follow and there were numerous things that I just found unbelievable. I felt like the movie was just an excuse for the actors to do their signature moves and some weird supernatural stuff. Overall, this is a creepy movie with a very dull and flat plot, but it does have one redeeming quality. It has a really interesting cast and they do play their parts really well! *** I like it when you take a look inside people's heads, especially when it's very dark and you're not sure exactly what's going to happen. This movie is a classic and it's a nice film that's well worth watching for any horror movie fan!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Logan Lucky is a fun family movie with a great premise that is not only well acted, but also well done by the three principal actors who play brothers and friends as they work at a roadside stand for a summer as a roadie and a side hustle to buy gasoline for their small car. The idea of a road trip is not new and there are many films that have tried to capitalize on the idea, but none of the movies has taken such a different approach. This movie does, and it is brilliant. The comedy of the film is spot on and is executed well and this makes this movie entertaining, no matter what your family wants to do in that summer. The humor is good and the characters all work out well but it is the dialogue that really shines and makes you smile a lot.  All the actors do a great job and each and every one delivers their lines flawlessly. Even the minor characters have a lot of personality and some are even likable.  Logan, the youngest brother, is a very funny guy and he fits right in with the rest of the guys. He always wants to be the funny guy, and he is always ready to make fun of people in the most ridiculous way possible.   Jack, the older brother, plays an obnoxious part in the movie, but he also has a lot to offer and he gives the movie a good heartwarming feel. Jack is more of a funny guy that is able to make you laugh at the most silly things, he is very much a man of few words.  The movie has a very good pace, and all the action is delivered with a lot o fun and there is a lot in the film to keep you entertained.    Logan Lucky (2005) Movie Rank - 6.5/10 6. 5/10 Summary A fun summer road trip with very little to do. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a movie for the whole family. Not exactly a children's movie, it takes some pretty adult themes, but it's funny, funny, and not a little scary. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found it hard to make my way out of the movie theater with my child in tow. It took him and me about an hour or so to figure out a way out (we went through the hotel corridor a bit before trying to get out). But when I realized how close to the theatre we were getting, I was finally able to let the door shut. I had a great time, and I'm sure I'll take the children for a ride at one of the parks that surround my little town and see how they like it.    I'm not sure what the adults in the movie were thinking about at the time, but it was a great way to end the summer.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this is one of the very best comedies of our time. I just think about how it has a lot of good lines:  He was trying to make a living out of his art, but he wasn't very good at it.  You are going to be a lot prettier in bed than on the screen.    I don't get why people in the 1950s thought it was a good idea to make movies with no dialogue.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The new Star Trek movie is really a must see. It has a new ship, new ship captain, new costumes and lots of cool special effects. That's a good start. The only flaw I found was that the ship was so fast that it was hard to keep up with. But all the cool things were good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In fact, this movie is not only excellent, but it's a gem that will certainly become a classic.  This film is about a young girl (Ange) living in the woods with her father (Lars) and brother (Mackenzie) in the late 1940's.  I love the fact that this movie was shot on location in the forest around the town of Swinefield, near London.    When we first see Ange we're reminded immediately of her resemblance to Scarlett O'Hara.  This was a tough choice since I've always felt that Scarlett is my favorite actress of all time.  I think she's probably better than Marlene Dietrich and Mimi Rogers.  She's a very believable character in my opinion (though of course I'm biased!).  Ange is also similar to Tiffany (with a darker skin) who was also raised by her grandmother.  In short, this film is all about family and how Ange's grandmother and grandfather are treated by the people of the town.  It's hard not to identify with Ange and how the people around her feel about her.  The film is a little slow at times, I'd imagine that this is an effect of the time period (and location), but it didn't bother me.  Also, as with many other movies in the genre, it doesn't offer a lot of action, which may be a negative, but as I mentioned before, I think the story is really strong.  So, if you're looking for a more modern and fun take on the "wild" movies with a lot  of action and suspense, then this is a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this one several years ago and it wasn't for me. It was more "Star Wars" than "Star Trek." I've never been particularly fond of Star Trek either. But I found this one much better than most others about these same characters. It's more mature and interesting than I think most of them get, and I found some of its ideas funny and engaging as well. The plot is pretty silly but it had some interesting elements and some of the more humorous scenes were also rather well written. I liked the characters most, with Kirk in particular being funny and amusing. (This is how I remember it: a guy gets a job cleaning out a ship's engine room, and the first thing he does is find that a small child is sitting inside and he's told to get off. He goes along with this until finally the child begins crying, and he starts telling a story about a guy who got the job when the man he was cleaning was on leave, and when he told the ship's captain he'd have to take him off. So he took him off but was afraid that the captain might think the kid wasn't good enough to work in the engine room. "How can you tell when the kid is good?" asked the captain. "It's all over the captain," said the kid. "Well, what are you going to do? Go to a better engine room or something?" So the guy had the kid's head shaved and then got him to help. So it was a nice story with a neat ending!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My second movie ever. I'd heard about this movie before, the trailer for the movie had been online for quite some time now, I had actually seen it in the theatre in Melbourne, a couple of years ago, it was a good performance from John Cleese, he just nailed the part. What is odd is how all the reviews say that it is a "remake" or "reimagining" it is obviously not, it is not. It is a straight-up remake, a new take on the original movie, so just what is a remake? Let's take a look at the original: "Sci-Fi comedy that has gone totally bananas in the past few days".  The original movie is not a comedy it is rather dark comedy about a scientist who is attempting to cure his wife's terminal cancer through the use of the infamous (and still somewhat controversial) experimental X-ray-laser. It doesn't work, because the cancer is a virus, and the X-Ray-lasers only destroy cells, not viruses, and thus the scientist's wife, after having her throat slit, is returned to life.  If the film hadn't taken the Xray-Laser as a staple for their future research, it's quite possible that the movie would never have been made, it wasn't a funny enough movie by itself and it wasn the most successful and successful comedy ever made, so it could not have been a successful remake. And yet it could have. There is a certain charm to this movie, it has a very distinct style from the earlier movie, a sort of early 80's campy horror, it looks to have been influenced by the films of Howard Hawks, and as such it has the same oddity as The Exorcist, where it has one creepy looking alien and a bunch of kids running away from the monster only to run into it after a couple runs. In fact in the second movie, there is a kid who is trying to get away from The Giant in the same way, only to be eaten by the same creature in a similar way. It would be hard to find a more direct tribute to The Expelliarmus, and yet that movie also had a similar feel to it. As well it is also the only movie in which Cleese actually goes out of his way to look "bad ass", in this one he is the star, and is wearing a costume that resembles a prison uniform
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While I enjoyed this film as a whole, the action scenes really caught my eye.  As in the previous film ( The Legend of Conan ), it has some amazing action sequences, especially when Conan is trapped on a sinking ship.   I thought this film was definitely better than the first.  The first film in the series was very good, and this one even better.  There's a new character, a man called Tiberius, who will play a larger part in the plot in the next film.  It also includes an ending that is a bit unsatisfactory for me, but I can imagine the good ending if it had been given as the third film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a simple and well-acted movie, that's about the story of a farmer and his wife. I watched this movie before with my daughter and she liked it as well. The story is simple but interesting and I have a great hope for future movies from the director.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The final scene is pretty much what I expect from a Bond film; a Bond with his hands in his pockets after a bad mission with an old woman. I didn't care much for the story, or the Bond, so I wouldn't really care about this movie.  I can see it being a good bit of fun, and the special effects are nice, but that's it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been waiting for a good western to come along for some time now (and I mean, since the 1960s). I've heard about it but had no reason to go looking for it until I heard the movie's name was "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". Of course, my first thought was, "A movie with good acting, bad writing, bad story, and ugliness?!" Yes indeed! I wasn't expecting much from a western movie, but the film, and the performances, were much more enjoyable than what I had expected. Even though I wasn'T too impressed with the Western, I DID enjoy the film to a much greater degree than I would have had I not heard about the name of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think this movie is a good film but not a masterpiece. It's the third film by this director that you need to see the two previous films. But this one is definitely not a movie that you get a kick out of but it is quite good. I like to think that there is one reason why this movie was made. The music is great as always from this director. The ending is a nice little tribute. Not really a memorable film but still fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a great movie that has a lot of heart. And not only that, it's a really good action movie in general! I'm sure that anyone who has a chance to see it will enjoy it. But I was disappointed that the ending was too abrupt. And then there's the fact that the character's names were all wrong. For example, the character named "Giovinco" is named after a song singer by the same name. For "Cristiano" it was "Cesario" and for "Sergio" it's simply "S." It wasn't that bad a movie, because it had a lot to recommend it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (1) The script is decent. A classic '80s film, with the same elements that made the original stand out such as some witty, fast talking cops, a good time and one really bad motherfucker.  (2)  Well, I did get some decent dialogues in this film and they are more than enough for the film to be funny.    The story involves a cop and his girlfriend who have problems getting the kids to go to school and, after going to a doctor who tells them the kid could have been hit by a car on his way to school, they find out he was hit by the kids (who are a bit 'dumb' as they say) and is now able to go around freely. That's it for the story and the dialogue is good.  What gets me is the dialogues that are so cheesy and uncharacteristic. This could be funny if the film made more sense.  A few of the characters were very interesting and some of them seemed to get to be close to the viewer a lot.  One of the cop's best friends is a pretty annoying bastard and the main girl is pretty much a cartoon.  This is very close to a '80's version of 'High School Confidential' and should be avoided.  If you have not seen this version you should get to know your audience.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about the Vietnam War is not really a good idea.   Unfortunately this movie is only a half decent movie. I don't know where they were going with it.  It's about a Vietnam War soldier, Tom (George Lazenby), and his mother (Kim Hunter), a young mother who is looking to send her son, Tom, to his first year of college. I thought it was interesting.  My main complaint about this movie was the length. It was so long that it was hard to take it in. I felt the scenes should have been cut. If it were up to me, I would have cut the movie down to two hours.  I don't remember anything that made me feel bad about seeing this movie.  The story was interesting, even if it was not a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is in fact very good. It does what a good action movie should do: take you to the point where you want to watch a sequel and go and see it. It is no coincidence that the movie is based on the popular comic series of the same name. If that doesn't convince you that you should go and watch this, nothing will. The action sequences are amazing and it doesn't stop until the last moment. The movie starts in a beautiful forest and the movie continues to build up to a climactic fight between two great villains: the Dark Ranger (Richard Lee Byers) and a young man who is looking for a way to redeem himself. The battle scenes are great. The CGI effects are beautiful. And the special effects are brilliant. If I'm not mistaken, there's a scene in the movie where a great fight scene breaks out on a water-logged bridge (which was filmed in a lake near Santa Cruz) and the whole bridge was designed by the amazing special effects team of James Cameron. This is the kind of film a guy like me (a movie buff) should go to with his buddies and watch. It's also a great movie to watch with your girl. And my girl loves watching it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a year where I have to choose between two good films which both have the same theme and both are from the same director, I choose to go with the "Jury's Not Verdict" of the great David Cronenberg.  This is a really, really good film and is a great example of a film which is a lot of fun, with great set up and well placed humor.  The plot is rather simple and you can see the beginning is a bit hammy but the film improves and gets much better as it goes along.    The story revolves around a young boy named Frank ( John Malkovich ) who in a moment of anger, runs into a car full of teenagers and then into a huge crowd at a rock concert and is almost killed in the ensuing panic.  Unfortunately, it is not a real rock concert but a theatrical production in a small town called Saugerties, New York which is run by the Rev. Henry ( Richard Dreyfuss ) and his wife Elizabeth ( Carol Kane ).  As well as being quite funny, the film is also very sad because Frank's mother has passed away and his father is a depressed alcoholic who doesn't seem to be too happy with Frank and Elizabeth.    However, they are quite happy living here on the farm and are very nice people indeed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this film has the potential to become the next great classic horror, however, its execution could have been a little better. There are some great jump scares and even a few good scenes in this film. However, it was all done in an over-the-top fashion that left me feeling completely uninspired.   It did take my breath away when a character that seems to be a cross between an alien and a killer monkey goes on a killing rampage in the middle of a forest! Unfortunately, the film was also somewhat over-long and not very original in plot or direction (unless you can get into it).   Grim Reaper is a good film. But...  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Action Hero is an enjoyable movie that is not a total mess. There is a sense of urgency and the script is pretty good. There are some amusing and good action scenes. The story is a little weak. If you have a family member who likes to watch these type of movies then give this one a shot.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ÂÂ Â  This movie was so bad it was great. Â It's a remake of a really old movie but a nice one, it reminded me of a different movie about a guy that has just gotten married to a new girlfriend and she turns out to be an insane serial killer who kills him a lot and keeps on killing other people.  It's a little short and doesn't really have much action but it's not too bad a movie.    I watched it twice and loved it the second time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about the story of a man who was shot by a member of the law and he wakes up as a zombie. He goes through a series of people that tried to help him like the cop that tried after he got shot and the doctor that tries to cure him from the drug that made him shoot himself (because it makes him like a zombie). The doctor is played by Steve Buscemi and the cop is played By Benicio Del Toro. There is also a love story in this movie about a man with a drug problem and a woman who is the one who try to help her and he ends up turning into a zombie while they were trying to help. It is a great movie. If you love stories like this this is the movie for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I know there's a long tradition of American war films, but I've never seen one quite like this, a story that mixes the realistic but gripping tale of a soldier's personal war with a great big fantasy adventure.  It's one of those rare, well-made war movies that is both thrilling and believable.  So how about that acting?  It really is something.  Tom Hanks, the veteran, looks like a tough tough guy, but he's just a good guy who was once young.  He's always going to give you the hard luck stories and the funny stories about his buddies and how they've become part of the army.  Peter Falk, the young rookie is the comic relief of this movie, and I can't say enough about him.  This movie is just a great war movie with a good story.  Recommended.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a true horror movie that is not the typical. It's a film that makes you feel something in every scene, that makes every scene a new and horrifying experience. The story is something you probably already know from some other horror movies, that is the story about a small girl and her friend, and the events that happen to them, and how they try to help the boy that is being bullied because of the fact that he has a ghost. The way the two are in the movie, is absolutely hilarious and they make every scene unique and terrifying, because the way they approach the scene, and their attitude towards the boy is really scary and even makes you want to run when they get the chance. You will see how they get all this stuff out of a bottle and put it on a doll, and then make the doll to get into the hands of the boy and start a bloodbath of some of the craziest stuff you have ever seen in a horror movie.   If you are in need of a good horror movie to watch then look no further, and if you don't know what horror movies are then don't worry because this movie does not disappoint you and is not only scary but it will have you on the edge of your seat because you will be amazed by how different and disturbing this movie is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen this yet, but I heard it was terrible and I decided to see it. My family and I are in love with this movie. I was so happy to see the guy I wanted to see get a girlfriend. She is the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen. I do think that was a bit of a letdown for her, but that is something that can be fixed in the first 3 to 4 minutes of the movie. This is not only a good time, but a funny time. It is a great love story. I am surprised that the actress who plays the woman is so beautiful. I had some problems remembering what was said because it was so fast, but this has been a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the most entertaining movies to come out this decade, it's all about a character named Mike who spends his time at his brother's wedding. Mike's brother was the groom, so he was able to pick up the whole bridegroom thing so to speak. I mean he's married already, so why not spend the night with a new bride? He's getting some pretty good stories at the wedding, which is all very well staged and put on a great light show. It's a pretty good film, it has a story about a group of people getting together to celebrate a wedding, and a lot of funny comedy scenes and things that happen. I don't really remember much else about the film. All I remember is seeing Mike's wedding, because it was on one of the great big screen TV's at the time. A lot of times it can be very hard to pick out what was important to the story. In this case it was the wedding itself, which in itself was kind of funny and silly. The jokes were so obvious and so on the nose, you're not really expecting any big story from it. What you are expecting is a lot more funny comedy sequences, a good light show, and some pretty amazing performances from a bunch of great actors. In the end, it may have all the elements to be a very successful comedy, but the ending really threw me off for a while. There are a lot things that are not told, and you're left to your own interpretation of the film itself. It does have a nice cast in it, however, and at least it's not bad, and probably more enjoyable than most other films of the era.

If you haven't seen the movie, I'd highly recommend it to anyone, and if you have, you should see it!!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Tiger Tank' is a great action flick with a solid premise and the lead performances are top notch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have never been a huge film-maker and it did not occur to me to try. However, my Dad saw it on Channel 4 and decided to put together a film, The Last Of The Mohicans. It was the first time I had ever seen an English film, and it took me a long time to see the big picture. It has great action scenes, well-written dialogue, and an engaging plot which, after three or four re-writes, was finally released in 1954 and went on to become a classic (a film which became a classic at a time when there were no films worth a shit). The script was based on a real event which took place in New York City in 1717. There was a Mohican leader who, in a very strange and very violent way, led his men against the British in the Hudson, and this is how it is portrayed on the screen. If you have not been to a theatre recently then I can't suggest that you go, unless you like it violent and strange. And it is very strange indeed.  The main character is a woman called Pelecanos. She is sent as a messenger to warn her father of a great defeat by the English. She arrives back in time and finds her father lying dead in a canoe at the bottom of the river. She then returns to 1617 and meets Pelepantios' son and her old friend Tawara, who also died at the hands of the English in the same canoe. But when she tries to warn him to leave their native land or die, he warns her not to listen to his advice, and they decide to continue the fight against the English, who are planning to conquer New Orleans by invading it from the south.    I think that the problem with the story is that it is a classic battle of good and evil, where good fights evil and the English lose. It can be a good action story, and I will grant you that the Mohicans are good fighters, but they are not much more than mercenaries (at least they are in the movie). The English are good at anything but fighting and their military and political skills are quite poor, which is obvious if you have watched many years of BBC and BBC American movies. They seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that the story has been designed to show that the English are so weak that the only way for them to win the war (even if they
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is about a boy who is not very confident and who is also a great dancer. His uncle comes to live with them when he is 11 years old. But his father does not like his uncle and wants him out of the house. So they decide to stay in an old man's house until they leave town. The uncle has become senile and doesn't know much about things anymore. As a result, there is little humor in the movie. The girl is very pretty but a bit too old and the boy is a bit pathetic. The dance sequences were also a bit boring.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good sci-fi movie. There's something interesting about the movie and its plot, the plot is kind of slow but the story is interesting.   As mentioned at the beginning of this review there's a part where the characters see a little "fly" (a human fly?) and decide to take care of it by putting it inside a box and putting a lid on the box. It starts to get out when they turn around but the people outside still see it and keep running. After some time it comes out again and they don't see it anymore but there's still a fly in the box. They don't know what to do with it and it is in such a situation that they think it might get away, maybe the human fly doesn't like that they keep running but then some animals (a cat, a bird, and some insects) start to chase the "fly". The ending is the most interesting part of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Dinosaur is great sci-fi/adventure film and a joy for children.  Titanosaurus Rex (voiced by Chris Pratt), the great and powerful Dinosaur, is taken out of the woods by a band of Boy Scouts who are looking for him to help put out a forest fire.  He is sent on his way, but he soon discovers that a new kind of tree had developed in the area.    This new kind is called a Tree of Life and, as the Tree of life develops, there are animals living there that help it grow.  The other things that I enjoyed:  First:  The fact that it was voiced by Chris Perry.  And not the one in Toy Story:   Who knew that an actor with no acting experience could also be a voice actor?  Second:  It's funny as heck, even if it is pretty silly.  I loved the character of the boy scout and I loved that he was such a good-natured and kind-hearted young boy.  Third:  There are some hilarious dinosaur songs on the soundtrack!  Fourth:  My favorite scene is where a tree grows into the town.  Fifth:  I also had to laugh a lot when the movie shows the Dinosaur being in a small boat with a bunch of dinosaurs.  Sixth:  After the end of the movie, there is a scene where the Dinosaur is eating a baby dinosaur.  Seventh:  And then it showed some kind of party being held by the dinosaurs, where the Dinosaurs dance and sing to the music.  But this movie is not all fun and games.  There was lots of suspense and suspenseful scenes, which I enjoyed very much.  Finally, the Dinosaur's last scene is the most dramatic one, so it made me smile, too.   I loved it.  It is a great movie and children should really see it, if it were only a part of the Disney family.  My rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought the movie was well put together and very funny. It's like a bunch of people with no boundaries and no inhibitions get together to get rid of a certain annoying neighbor of a neighbor. He's a little annoying and seems like a good guy so you think you can get over it but I can't. I don't know if he's a neighbor that can't tolerate another neighbor or a neighbor who doesn't really like his neighbor. I think there's a bit of both. This is a really good movie and a nice change from the usual 'bad guy' sort of thing you always get in a cop movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* This is a great movie! It was a nice, simple story about two kids who have been sent to live in a cave for a summer. They go camping one day when they discover a strange woman who has lived in the cave all her life. When she starts to get mad, they decide to leave. It is a nice movie about a few different kids, their adventures and the mysterious lady. **********   I was not sure whether or not I liked this movie. I had seen it at a film festival the other day and although it had a funny title and a nice trailer, I just did not see the appeal in this movie as a whole. I do enjoy camp movies, and I am not sure what the appeal was. I loved the kids (in a camp scene, at a summer camp) and I loved that the kids did not understand anything. I thought the whole story was just silly. It was nice to watch, but I am very sad to be rid of this movie, but if it is only for your camp/re-enactment/movie night/fun, then it is fine. ******************************  : I thought it was a strange idea that these kids would live in the same cave they were born in. I found it odd how they never saw their father when they were little. The children were all very young and did not age much. If this was a children's movie, I think I might have liked it a bit more than I did. I did not care for the movie and am glad they did not make this one as a children. It would have been a bit boring. ************  :  I liked it...but I can't give it more than a 1 star rating. It has good acting but the kids, although acting very young, did not come across as real kids. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this film, one must take some precautions because it is not a good one. It is a good film with nice story and good performance by all the characters.  However, if you look at it it is very hard to understand the story. It has no connection with the real reality. It could be interesting for the movie buffs but it is useless for the general public. .
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good science fiction movie.   The characters are the best part of the movie, as it has a very diverse world. A lot of different races live in the planet and some of them seem to be very close to one another but have completely different ways of life. I liked the fact that the movie tries to be an allegory for humanity but it's not clear enough. The movie is very much made out of symbolism.  I liked it and the special effects are good for the most part. It is a good old movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this a lot! The acting is well done, the story is interesting and well drawn. I found myself wanting more from the story.  Would it have been better if we could have seen some other places around the world besides the USA, like Russia, India, Italy or Brazil?  It's interesting to know that the US has done so much, developed and built a system for dealing with nuclear warfare. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ I'll admit right up front that I wasn't expecting much out of this film. It's a little short in the storytelling department, and while it does provide an adequate amount of tension it never really manages to nail the details needed to make the movie worth the attention. The action is a little dull, and the humor isn't very funny. The cinematography is good, and there's a nice amount of characters to keep you guessing, but it's hard to take the movie seriously when there's so little action going on. As a concept it doesn't really work, and doesn't live up to the comic book's reputation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Star Wars" films are not a genre unto themselves. They take place in the Star Wars universe, and as such they rely heavily on the Star wars characters and world.   It's a very good film though.  It has the same strengths that made the first three movies so great and the same flaws that made them so flawed.  The only weak thing about this movie is the first act.  The first act is the weakest part of the entire movie and it really stings.  As the story continues, the acting gets better and is much more natural. I'm not sure if they kept their cast around to keep it on the cheap side, or if they really knew what they were doing with this one.  Overall, I would give this movie a 7.5 and give it a 5 star rating for those of you who like this sort of thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the kind of movie where if the characters aren't completely awful, the bad guys do really awful things and the actors seem to be having fun.  The movie doesn't even seem to have the "good guys" win, it ends up just being a bit of a joke.  So there is a little girl in a black dress.  A little girl who plays a girl who likes to play dress up.  Her name is Cade Yeager.   Cade likes to be called Cade and she also like to be call the Cade.   She has long black hair and wears an outfit that was made up for Halloween.  She loves the music and makes fun of others who don't understand it.  CADE'S FAVORITE PART:   This is the part where she gets a little more emotional than she did in the beginning and gets more out of the "joke" than she does in other parts.  We learn that she lives with her dad a long time ago in the woods and her dad is very old.  Now a lot of this is just an excuse to tell a really bad story.  The bad thing is that the characters just don't act all that much at all.  I suppose that they were supposed to act a lot more but the actors are so bad it's hard to care, and they don't really act at all on their own parts. The good part is that Cade is funny as all heck.  It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen but I like it a lot.  This was a really fun ride and a fun movie even with a bad script. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had high hopes that my buddy, who is very much into anime, would enjoy watching the series.   He loved it, even though it wasn't his thing.  And yet, I found the plot and characters to be very interesting and very moving.  Unfortunately, he would have had to continue watching to get to the best part, the animation.  However, there was one thing that kept me watching.  The main girl, Yui, always looked so lovely in her pink sailor suits, so I decided to see if I could find a picture of her online.  When I finally found one, it made my heart melt!  I knew I was in for a treat!  This series has a very positive tone to it, and although it is full of action, it's always balanced by a lovely romance and good humor.  What I most enjoy about this series is that they don't try to rush you through anything.  You'll know what's coming up, you'll feel the emotions, and you'll get a great sense of accomplishment while watching.   The animation is beautiful.  At first, it looks like a kid's cartoon but then later on, it becomes a real classic.  As always, it has character designs that are quite unique.  Even Yui looks fantastic in her sailor suits.  There is even a little romantic subplot that was done just right.    Although the girls are beautiful, I was not a fan of the plot, especially Yui.  For an anime that is trying to be a realistic portrayal of a middle school girl, I don't think she really has much character.  I felt like she should have been more mature in this series. I also think that she should be more independent, and not try to make herself out to be some sort of the perfect princess.  To be fair, she does give her best to the others, which is nice, but I would have liked it if she was a little more independent.  Overall, I thought this was a very romantic series, and while it doesn't have anything that everyone is going to find interesting, it does have some great humor.   It isn't the best anime ever, but it's definitely up there.   I give this an 8.4 out of 10!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorite films of the decade is this movie which depicts one of the worst human acts, which I am amazed every one of my friends love and to quote one of their favorite movies, a very bad joke. In my opinion, there is no one like this movie because even when it has no plot and no plot of a good joke which I don't find is really good, I think the movie is funny, funny enough to make you laugh, but in the end it fails.  I recommend this movie to my family members and friends who have an enjoyment of laugh and to laugh, laugh and laugh in this movie, in this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a very good movie, but a bad movie, if you ask me (which is a little too much to ask for).  It is a thriller that makes you ask for more after a while. This is a film with great acting, and a solid story line, and the best part of all is its music, but it does not really give any real value to the film.  A great movie that is not for everyone, and if you enjoy those kinds of horror films, this one will not disappoint, if at all.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ My second view to "Fifty Shades of Grey" and I still can't stop thinking about it.  I love this movie but my favorite part isn't the sex.  I love the storyline, I love how Ana (who I adore in real life) was written into this plot so that she could meet the love of her life... er, of the man who is her best friend from university (a really good movie).  We see her being a very "stub" and in a very bad mood all throughout the movie.    But all that is put aside, the sex is what is always so hot to me.  This is an amazing scene, it's funny, it touches on many of the themes of the book, and it's beautiful, especially for those with a taste for BDSM.  My favorite bit of the scene is the look on her face when her "friend" takes her hand and starts to make love to her.  It's one of my absolute favorite moments in the movie and for me, a good "filler" after the sex parts!   Another of my favorite scenes is the one where she gets fucked in the shower.  She is so hot and has an amazing body, and the look into her eyes and the feeling of what he is doing to her (I just love the sound of the water hitting her) is just beautiful!  I really enjoyed the scene as much as the others, even though I found it less funny than the others.  A lot of good stuff here! I just hope that the movie is made into a trilogy!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be a really good piece of cinema. The acting was amazing. You can't make any bad movie out of a good actor. John Leguizamo also did a great job. He really brought the tone of the film to life. It was also great to see someone really get in touch with their inner child. It really showed us that no matter how bad things seem to be around us we can still find our inner child and it can change people's opinions about the world. This movie was a really great one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a pretty good movie. I felt that the film was well acted and done well. They did a really good job with the "joke" in the end and I laughed alot. I did feel a little bad for Marge but she did get a lot out of it. She even got a new outfit, which I have to think was her outfit from the very first episode of the first season of The Simpsons. This movie is pretty good and worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie from a good director. I give it a 7. It's not for the very young, but it is very funny, a little disturbing, but not in an unpleasant way. I don't see it as good art, I see it more of an entertainment.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Hannibal   From the start, Hannibal Lecter seems like a sadistic sadist and an odd mixture of a good doctor and a serial killer. He seems to have a bad habit of saying "it's a miracle", at the least, every time he manages to do something, even if it isn't the most successful. In the second movie, Hannibal is more like a psychopath who wants to make people suffer until they become like him, only with different means. And if there was no serial killer, there would be no Hannibal.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is about a couple who live in the country. After they are killed by an American army helicopter, they live out a "normal" life in a small farmhouse. But their normal lives can not last for long. In July, a strange phenomenon is observed by an army helicopter. The mysterious object appears, hovering, moving in circles, and then shoots up and disappears. Suddenly there is a loud noise and the army helicopter shoots at a tree and disappears with all of its cargo. The people in the village and the farmer have no clue what has happened. But after a long delay, the helicopter is seen again. When the villagers are unable to find out what has transpired, a series of mysterious "incidents" begin to happen. They include the death of some children, and the reappearance of the mysterious helicopter. Written by Daniel M.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you haven't seen The Princess Bride, or if you haven, you need to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not a huge fan of martial arts films, so I was really excited when I saw this one. It was great.  The movie had a nice story (it was mostly dialogue) and was fairly well shot.    I also liked the fight scenes.  The special effect for the sword fighting was very nice.  I especially liked the scene where he and his men go over a cliff (the first fight scene they've ever seen in their lives).  They're all climbing the cliff.  When they're at the end of the cliff, he puts on a special helmet and is suddenly able to fly in his flying motorcycle.   This is one of my favorite movie sequences of all time.  So I guess when all is said and done, it's a really cool movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen this movie way back when. It was a cult hit as the title suggests. The original movie was a comedy about a guy who is kidnapped and tortured in some pretty dark ways and then turns into a killer. I thought the new one was a good sequel. The new guy is still a killer, the same as the first guy, but more brutal and funny. I enjoyed it a lot. It seems I liked it when I first saw it. I still like it. The ending of it was funny. Very funny.

Not just the silly ones either, there are the great ones which are just so great, I'm a sucker for anything that has a plot that is funny and which has good character development. I didn't see it being a comedy, that's why I loved it so much.   It is very funny, so far so good, I've already had a few beers. It is so enjoyable I couldn't even tell it was a comedy after the first 30 minutes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The great part of a great movie is that it makes you feel like you know the stars:     Star Wars  .   I mean, come on, you don't want to look at the name again, but just know that when those actors showed up in a green, two-piece swimsuit on a Hollywood soundstage in 1977, there was nothing they could have done that would have done them any better than they did with their great character, the most beloved character in all of movies, Darth Vader. The actor playing Vader is in many ways the epitome of the actor we love in our movies: his accent, his swagger, the fact that you never see him actually do anything but look around and say "Yay! Hmmm...that's nice...yeah! That's good, hmmm.." (This was a line in a Star Wars film for the original 1977 film that I saw). I saw Star Wars on the first day I saw a Star Trek movie (in which it was the second of the two Star Trek films that had an opening crawl).   This has not changed my feelings about Star Wars since. If you haven't seen it, you will love it. "Dude...you're a Jedi? I've heard about those people. They're kind of nuts." I think we're done with The Phantom Menace now.   But, there are some good moments.  A few times Obi-Wan makes a mistake that he never would have made if he hadn't been training Jedi for 25 years.  But the problem is that he usually tries to save the day while the rest of the Jedi are distracted.  If it wasn't for his amazing Force powers and his wonderful costume (which I would argue is better than anything in the whole Star Wars galaxy) it would have been a lot harder to rescue Luke.  I thought Obi-wan was being overly cautious. I think Obi-jwan was thinking, "Hey, it's Obi-wando and he's the master of the Force. I've seen the Force before but I've never had the chance to control it."  And, that's why he fails so many times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know if I'll be able to remember to finish this film, because it was so ridiculously enjoyable. I saw it during my high school's lunch hour and I was pretty sure that I was dying of chub. Then, out of nowhere, a bunch of red-headed boys come into the cafeteria and are in need of rescuing. Not that these were super tough guys with guns, but a big ol' chunk of these kids are about your height. I don 't know why I thought they were really tough. They were just really big.   One day a girl is walking to school. I am not sure about you, but I do like to think about girls, and not just in the "hey I like to walk around in her panties" way. So she stops to talk to two boys on the sidewalk. The boys look a little like little boy versions of my friends (who, of course, happen to be a lot bigger boys than her) and they say hi to her. That's when she decides to walk towards a boy who has just approached her from behind. She gets nervous at first but then feels a surge of power. I thought to myself that this girl was so incredibly strong.  But before she can even get her little foot in the door, she's pulled in! I think I like that line, it's just so perfectly descriptive and I love how they decided to use it.  It just goes to show you that you cannot tell a story without some kind of action, and this is just that. There is no question about it. It's like a horror movie for grownups.  I was watching this for a movie night with my parents and one night I decided to sit in the theater and watch it. Well, my parents decided to stay and it was a good night to be sure.  This is one of the many ways that this movie makes me laugh.  Now to the actual movie: I am a big fan of the Lord of the Rings films. I know that doesn't mean much, but it's still important to know. My sister and I have a book club for fantasy novels that we do occasionally, so I was familiar with the films when I first saw this. I have to say that this film was even better than the films, which is saying a lot because the films were excellent and this film is even better. It was even more hilarious than the Lord, which makes me wish there

I've always wanted a mother like her. She's so sweet. All she wants is a hug. She doesn't care. What can I say? When you're a little girl, you want a mother so much that your mother goes away. You never see her again. For a very long time. That's because she had a bad temper. She yelled and yelled at her child all day long. Then she got tired of this and tried to kill herself. You have to be so strong to keep your child. She can't handle it. You don't believe me. She said she was just being a hard parent. She tried to hurt her child. But no matter how hard she tried, no matter what she tried to do, she just couldn't do it. That night she fell asleep in a hospital. She stayed there for a week. They gave her a shot and told her she was too weak to die. I've never been to a hospital before. I think that's kind of weird. Then they sent us away to live in the country. I remember my Mom crying. She didn't want to leave us. She always loved us. But it was a very hard life. She missed us so much. She just stayed with the kids in the old house and then started over and put us all in a new house. But we could never really be the same. We all stayed in the same class all the time. They kept us all together. It wasn't easy. Our Mom kept fighting with the old lady. But she always stopped the old woman from doing what she was doing. She wasn't a bad person, just like us. And she wanted a real child. One with a mother. She was gone. That was the last time I saw her. I didn't see her anymore. I don't really
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie!  From what I understand, it's about a man named George McFly (played by the late Michael J.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie...   It is a very clever film. When I first saw it, I was a little confused at first, because they changed the title. I thought that the story was going to have an American character, or a British character. When they were in the United States, they met a little girl and the little girl's parents came up to them and told them that their daughter died. The little girl says that "It is my wish to meet the man I know as Dad," and so they go to him. This is how it starts: I thought the story of this film is not very convincing. I think they did an excellent job of telling the story in a very simple and easy way. When a child dies, there are some kind of ghosts here and there. Then the man tells that she came from "another country". There is a scene with a dog that lives a very lonely life. It is very sad that a person like this is not happy to live. They were also talking about their past and the man says that he has a girlfriend. But when the film ended, I felt a big sadness when I saw that the person who came into the life of the girl, was the same person who was the reason that the girl died.  The man who comes to meet that little girl, he is a bit of a creep.  I did not like this movie because of these weird characters in the movie. I do not think that they do justice to the story.   I think the story is a little too simple and there are little inconsistencies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________ I'll start by saying that a friend of mine is the guy from the poster on the right. He and I used to go to the same church and go to church. I don't go to that church any more. And I'd have to say it is the worst place to be with a guy who has had so much drugs and alcohol and he doesn't even know if he wants to die, just to get drunk and watch movies all day. I used get up every morning at 6:00 am. We had to be the first ones up. And the guy would be doing all kinds of crazy stuff. If he was a good actor that could have been a great movie. But he's not even an actor. He's just an idiot. The movie I went to the very next day. It was called "The House of Ruth", and it was a wonderful movie. The first time I saw this movie the guy was playing a doctor that didn't get his patients to go and have sex with each other and he just put them in beds and had them stand there and did the tests and said, "Well, this is what I think it is, so this is why I gave a certificate." I loved it. I thought it was wonderful. I had a friend from high school, and the guy said that the man was a very talented actor but he didn't give a damn about him. He said the guy acted like he wasn't even there. He just said what he thought was the funniest stuff ever. I have never heard that kind of thing coming from anybody. The one time I think I heard it was in the movie "The Graduate". I liked the movie very much. It had a great ending, it ended with that great thing, that's when they get married. It just ended and there was nothing else but that. I think the guy has a great future, but I hope he can get over this stuff quickly. It's pretty sick and it took me two months to get over it. He never came out of it. _______________________________________________________________________ It is a very good movie but it would have been much better with a very different ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few weeks ago, I attended the film premiere for a movie called The Revenant. The film was directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu and starred Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Kate Winslet, Jason Clarke, and Ethan Hawke. The Revenants is described as a revenge-thriller in the vein of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, in which a survivalist (DiCaprio) and a fur trapper (Hardy) travel deep into the Canadian wilderness in search of an ancient Indian city. The climactic moments of the movie involve DiCaprios and Hardy fighting their way through a forest in order to retrieve a man who's been kidnapped by a group of cannibals. This is the fourth film in a series of sequels and prequels, each one following DiCapris and Hardy's character through a more challenging and gruesome adventure. The first film in this trilogy, 2012's The Reveries, featured DiCaprois' character as he hunted down his former lover, a fur-trapper played by Claire Danes. This time, he and the other survivors (played by Hardy, Winslet and Clarke) were hunting down the cannibali who had abducted their friend, Tom Sizemore, during a trip down a river. These cannibalis were led by a character played by Will Poulter, who was originally intended to be portrayed by the late, great Paul Newman, who died in the infamous 1963 crash of a plane at the end of the first movie. (And don't worry, The Reverser will be coming back for a new sequel, The Other Side of Everest. It's a remake of the 1960 film of the same name.) I was surprised, as I expected the movie to be more of the usual high-budget Hollywood action fare, but it is a pretty interesting story in its own right. It stars an actor who's most notable acting role is probably in the 2011 thriller The Boy (as Willy "The Runner" Fischman). That movie follows a group in the mid-2000s who were victims of an assassination plot. This film is about a group who's trying to figure out how to make a living after a disaster that left much of their village dead. DiCaputo, who is already a recognizable actor, is a bit more of an unknown. However, in one of his first action roles, he manages to
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't help but compare  My Little Pony: Equestria Girls  to  The Nightmare Before Christmas,  especially when the ponies are in trouble. "That's why I'm the one in charge. " "I'm not afraid to go with the flow." "The Nightmare Before" is the name of a song on the soundtrack to Nightmare before Christmas  where the title character is a kid who gets a Christmas present in the form of a candy cane that causes him to go to a horrible place filled with nightmares. It is one of the worst things I have ever seen in a film. I would not be surprised if the film has never been released to theaters because no one wants to see a child go through those horrors. It's really scary, especially because it's a kids show. But the adult characters are still creepy. My Little Pony Equestrian Girls!!! What a fun show. This is a great animated show for all ages that is entertaining to watch with friends. I enjoyed my time watching the show. As a kid it was one of my favorites from the early 90s. This show is definitely worth a watch if you like Disney films and cartoons. The voice cast that has been put together for this show is very good. I like a lot of the cast. But for some reason they don't have the same chemistry as they did in the show that was so good. However, they seem to have more chemistry in the Disney films that we all know. I don't see any of these characters being used that much in the new animated films, but I do have a feeling that they will be.

I liked them all!   The movie is very well done.   I liked watching the girl trying to find an escape from her family.  One of my favorites!  Overall, this is a fun movie to watch and I would definitely recommend it!   A great romantic story, a good time!

Every once in a while he has a bad day, and he calls on a prostitute for a bit of fun. However, it's not long before he gets a phone call from an old buddy: "Oh shit, The Big Lebowky is here!" The Big, Lebinski is very funny in a silly way, and the movie is always moving. It has a funny ending as well, with the two people getting drunk and getting in trouble. A few years later they were still in the same town and the old friend of the Dude, The Man With the Pipe, was still around. But that's it - I don't care for it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought I would give my first impressions of this movie before I started to write about what I liked and what I didn't. I thought it was a really good movie that I enjoyed watching, I don't know if it can hold my attention and still be a good horror movie because there were plenty of good elements that didn't fit together to make a good film. There are good and bad points, I liked the fact that it was set at the beginning of the 80's with a horror movie and I thought the pacing was pretty good, the gore was done in a realistic way but a little bit too realistic, I also liked the plot and the characters, they are very interesting, I think the movie is a little boring. This movie is well made, there was a great script to work with and even though it is a comedy it wasn't too slow or predictable.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** (4/5) ***** The only problem with this movie is that it has no direction. This is a short film set in the desert near a desert town called Oasis. At first, I thought, that's a movie I would like to watch on a sunny morning. The film started out good enough in its opening scenes. The movie has a good soundtrack and a very good direction. As the story was unfolding, it became hard to get to know the characters and the setting. The story was predictable and I felt bored by the beginning. I felt that the film needed more direction. By about 40 minutes, I knew I would never see what was in the beginning, but I liked the short film at least. I think that the only reason why the movie went on so long was because the story lacked direction. I could have seen this movie right when it was filmed. This movie could have ended right there. Instead of having characters that I could relate to, the movie focused on setting up future characters that are not very likeable. I hope that someday a director will take a more original approach to the desert, because this story can be taken a number of ways.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think The Legend of Korra is a good film. This is the first live action show. I like it because it has some humor. I don't like the animation much, and the sound sucks, but it is okay. I would watch more, but there is not much time left till the DVD. So I'll see what else there is.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a bit skeptical about this movie, seeing as how its a sci-fi, fantasy epic about an assassin who has to deal with the machinations of a powerful and mysterious organization known as the Council of Elders who seeks to find the most intelligent human being in the world. However, once I started watching the movie, I quickly realized that I was right to be skeptical. Although the movie is extremely well-made and entertaining, there isn't much to see. What there is is awesome, however. The movie opens up with a montage of all of the major events of the world in the past, and as you watch the characters interact with one another, the story gets a little bit more interesting. We are introduced to our main character who is described as:  In the future, there is an organization which, in addition to finding and developing new technology, also is a power-hungry cabal of assassins. As the name implies, the Council is tasked with hunting down those who have proven themselves to be more intelligent than the rest of the population. Those who come to the Council's attention are either considered worthy of being selected to attend the prestigious academy for which the Council itself organizes the training, or simply those of the "highest potential" who are selected by the Council for assassination. As you watch your main character prepare for the assassination, the camera cuts to a sequence which depicts a very elaborate and elaborate assassination (a la The Raid films). I've been waiting for this moment for years.  The assassination sequence is so elaborate, and so well-acted, that it makes your heart skip a beat, just watching it. Not the acting, but the directing.  This is one of those movie that will hold you in its grasp, with all the intrigue of a good mystery.  But what's really intriguing is the fact that the people we see at the beginning of the film are not the ones who are actually selected to sit in the academy, but rather the people who are responsible for the training for the students. It makes for a very interesting plotline. While the plot itself may be an interesting one, the rest is just the icing on the cake. The story follows a group of people who find themselves on a journey to discover who they are and what they are capable of. The entire movie was filled with so many twists, and revelations, and twists, it kept you guessing the entire time. The film even ends with a twist,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good and solid movie about a guy who is trying to get a job as a janitor at a small business and a woman who is looking for a job at a big business in the city. What really makes this movie is that there are some funny moments and funny scenes but they are followed by a very sad scene that can only be called a tragedy. The only thing is, that it is such a tragedy that can not be avoided. In the end, I feel very sad about this movie because it is really so tragic.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty entertaining story. It gets to the point pretty quick and keeps the audience engaged. There are a lot of plot holes, I found a few but none too big to keep it from being a pretty good story. The best part of the movie is the dialog. There is plenty of good conversation and there is plenty to laugh about. My only issue is the ending. It just felt like we didn't get our money's worth. The bad guys are still pretty good, there are enough action scenes but overall it doesn't feel like a big ending to a movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a simple movie that does not get lost in the weeds. It is a comedy with a story line that is not exactly exciting, however, as soon as the story line is introduced we learn that a man has taken the job of teaching a young boy about the world, when this young boy decides he is not interested in his teacher anymore the teacher tells him that he is too old to teach, this makes the boy very angry, and in response to his anger he uses a baseball bat to hit a young woman that was sitting on a bench and having a drink with friends. In this movie we have some of the usual characters: a rich but lazy man, a little boy with a temper, a lady who is always right, and a man who always seems to be in the wrong places at the wrong times.  It is just funny at times and the movie ends on a very satisfying note with an old lady with her purse on the table, and looking into the camera. I guess this movie is not for everybody but to me it had a lot of humor and a story that never got old. It was a good old time movie.

My friend and I both enjoy good movies but as is the case with most I think the movie's good enough that it needs no more bad. It's good fun and is really good at having some good jokes as well. If you are on the fence about this, go and watch it. You won't be disappointed!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first scene is where I expected to see the baddies getting some much needed attention. After all, in the 90's, we could see a big gangster like Paree doing stuff like this all the time. The gang's motto was "no harm meant to man", which means that in the gang's view, their members were all just as capable of murder and mayhem as any other criminal. In fact, the whole show is nothing but brutal gangster movies with some really great acting by all of the guys. The story and acting are both really good. The second and third act are where the film gets pretty dull. The film seems to be running on one big joke and that's pretty much it. The most notable joke is when the gangsters are all talking about how everyone around them is killing it with their jobs (the police) and getting ahead of themselves. Then, at some point, the most badass gangster ever shows up and everyone is like "who?". It's almost as if they're all just saying it out for the sake of saying it and I can't help but wonder what would've happened if there was a way to save all the gang members at that point, but to do that they would have to kill a gangster of the same sex! Also, there's this other guy that keeps trying to recruit these guys into the gang, who is always like "I hate the taste of blood." Yeah, yeah, I'm kidding, this guy actually has a sense of humor and makes for a pretty good villain and the best part about the movie is the acting by everyone involved and how all of them fit together like a puzzle.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The great thing about this film is that it shows us that it was not only about violence - it was about love.  Not the "hate the enemy or love the enemy" kind of love, but true love.   And you know, the movie never loses its way from that very start.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film that brings you back to the good old days, not the "crappy, bad, over-produced" years. It shows the time when people could really entertain each other and get along in a real way. It is sad when I think about a time when the world is being taken over and the world leaders can do whatever they want, but there are still some people who love each other. It really is a movie about the good times.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first two minutes of this movie are worth your time. It gives the illusion of a movie, complete with a cheesy song to set the mood. The two leads are actually very similar. They are not that interesting or original, as far as actresses go. They're just there to be funny/emotional, especially since they have the same voice actor. The movie moves along at a very slow pace. When the plot starts to develop it gets moving again, but you don't really care about it, because the story is really just boring. The only thing we get is the "love at first sight" theme song that is really annoying, and not even funny. The entire movie is about how the main character falls for a beautiful girl. This is when she first says the words "what a cute face." I get the feeling this movie should have been titled "Honey, it's time to do all the work." That's because the girl is not only really ugly, she also has an IQ of 7. I don't want to watch any more of this garbage.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fine short film from the silent era, and a fantastic film in its own right, it is well balanced between the silly humour, and some touching story telling.  It's probably the only short film ever to feature an angry elephant, and it certainly stands up against other silent films of the time.  I really like the short scenes of the elephant and the porter, and the end where the porters tries to help the elephant by singing him a happy song. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is the story of a couple whose lives are turned upside down when their new baby girl is abducted by a gang of criminals (the film is loosely based on the real life kidnapping of 5-year-old Elizabeth Short). They believe that the Baby is being held in a basement. We follow these poor parents who have just lost all hope for the future and are desperately trying to find the Baby. I am not sure how I feel about it. First, I never knew anything about Elizabeth Short so there were a few things I was unfamiliar with. I loved the fact that the director took the children in this film and changed them so much (I'm looking at you, John Wayne) and I also loved the way the film was presented, in terms of the color and the lighting. The plot was pretty good and it was always so sad to watch how the parents looked so helpless and helpless in the face of everything that was happening to them. But there was a part that I wasn't too fond of and it's about a child named Michael. In one scene you could see the little boy and his family in the background and the kid was playing with the doll. I thought that was really strange and I just thought it was funny and it made me laugh, but the movie itself didn't really have that much of a story to tell. However, one thing that I like about the movie is that the kid always does what's best for the little girl and there was this scene where the kid tells the parents that he can't do anything about this because "It was her choice". That's always my favorite part, the kid's parents making everything about them and about their little girls (even though that's not how it really is in real life...). I found this movie quite appealing because I thought the movie was so realistic and I was always smiling even though it was so sad and I thought it really captured the feelings of losing everything in one second. I would recommend this movie for young children or those who like films like this. ___________________________ Score: 4 out of 5 ______________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ A great movie! The film has so much potential and is a real treat to watch. It's a very fast paced film that doesn't take itself too seriously. The cast is great and the soundtrack is always great. ____________ (Spoilers) As is usual in a movie like this, a large portion of the movie is given to a woman. The storyline revolves around a group of characters who are on a crime spree and the police force and have little chance of stopping them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last three or so years I had been working for a large corporation (Marmaduke Inc). I had a desk, and as an added bonus I had two very bright young girls living with me (ages 5 and 4) while I had my own office. As a result, one of these two was often up late reading the mail while the other was getting ready to go out with her friends. I was in a hurry to get back and to the bathroom to catch a ride back to the office. The last thing I remember is the doorbell ringing and the kids saying "Mommy's home!" So, I opened it. As I walked in I said "Oh, it's you! Why hello!" and I turned around and her mom's face was the image of the smile from a candy store. She smiled as she was happy to see me and the smile went away when she saw the gun on my shoulder. She asked, "What are you doing at my house?" I replied, "Oh nothing. I had to make a delivery." She smiled, and said, "I know what that is, and we've got a gun too!" The gun? I said, "... I have a job at the office," and she said, "'We're armed and ready' that's a good thing that you're not a terrorist." She seemed happy to be rid of my troubles and my little trouble. She told me not to worry because Mommy was sure to be home soon. As soon as she said that, the gun went off, the sound was so loud that I went over to the table to get the phone to call my wife. The sound of the gun was so far away that I had trouble hearing the ringing of the phone. I called my wife, "Darling, I just shot a lady in my house. My wife is home. I don't know how she's doing. I'm going to get to work now. We've got to stop this! I'll try and get back as soon as I can." She hung up, and then it was my turn to come over to check on her. "Is she all right?" I asked. "I don't think so. I think she's got something bad." As I stood there with my gun on me, I realized that my wife was in serious trouble. I told her to make herself at home so I could get back to my office. I didn't want to
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is actually one of my favourite films of all time. I love horror films, but I have never been into them as much as this film is good. I thought it was a great and chilling story from beginning to the end. I think it is very well written and has a great score. But it is not very scary as some are making it out to be because of the short length of film and the fact that no one is being hurt, but it is still a good horror film. I will highly recommend this for all fans of scary movies! I give it a 9.5/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a lot to like about this movie, mostly because there is something for everybody to like, not just those with a love of sci-fi or a passion for classic horror movies.  From the opening scene of an old man stumbling around in a house at the edge of a dark forest to the very end of the film (the credits roll after every take), this movie is not all doom and gloom, for there are some really interesting character moments, some great set pieces, a few surprises and a good ending.  From the very beginning, there is a sense of foreboding as the old man begins to appear at the window, and the mood is immediately set in the most ominous, Gothic, almost Black & Gray way imaginable: the first shot shows a dead man slumped on his window sill, his eyes staring out into a gray twilight, his skin a pale gray.  This is a man who is very different to everyone else around him, his appearance and his behavior is not at all the kind of person you would expect, or even hope to meet in an elevator.  The first scene is a beautiful mixture of eerie suspense, and an all-around nice introduction to the main character.  We don't really learn much about this character until much later, but it was so intriguing at first I wanted more.    His appearance is that of a skeleton wrapped in a sheet (a dead body with a sheet), and in a voice that is like someone on a record playing a recording of someone on an unknown planet.    We see him walking up a hallway with the other dead men, apparently in the act of making a little pilgrimage, until we find out they've been trapped in this room by a ghost.  While there is no clear cause and effect for what is happening, it can be said that it was caused by the strange ghost and the bad vibes from the room, and then the men try to flee.  After the ghosts are defeated, the men all fall asleep, and they wake up to find that they are all dead.  Then we discover that there is also a girl with them, and when we wake them she appears to the men to tell them that they should go back and try to find their way out.  In the end, it is up to the girl to tell the man that there are things in the world, and it will do what she can to help and protect him.  She isn't exactly
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There have been some fantastic films about the Vietnam War, but this is a different kind of story. Like a lot of "war" movies, it focuses on a few soldiers (the two central characters, of course) who are sent on a job to rescue a girl from the enemy. The girl's father is a general and the two young soldiers work for him in an ambush operation. We have a real sense of the terror of this situation, one that is all-too-familiar to anyone who has had to deal with enemy soldiers in combat situations. The movie is interesting because it looks at the psychological effects of war and its aftermath in a very unusual way. It was the directorial debut of Michael Mann (the movie has an amazing cast including Robert Redford, John Wayne, Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, and an Oscar-nominated Jane Fonda). Mann shot this film in a relatively short period of time (nine weeks) in a number of locations including Fort Lewis, Washington, Virginia; Ft. Bliss, Texas; and Saigon, South Vietnam.   Mann's film is not a documentary, and instead of using real footage of the war, the film uses actual conversations between the soldiers as he interviews the soldiers. The interviews are not really about the war but about the young men and women who are affected by the war and the terrible events that occur during it. Mann makes it very clear throughout the movie that this is not about a documentary; it's a true story about what war does to people. The film is set on a mission to find a girl who has been kidnapped by enemy soldiers, but they are killed or capture before they can get to her. The mission is then aborted, and we follow the soldiers and their families as they suffer from the horrors of war.  Michael Mann on "The Vietnam War" The film takes place in three different time periods: the first is the period when the soldiers are about to be deployed to war in Vietnam. The scene at Fort Lewis is set in a flashback to the days when the young recruits were being indoctrinated and learning to kill. There's a scene about how the men are taught to fear the enemy, and how that fear results in horrific casualties on the battlefield. There are some fascinating shots of the men at the camp where they are training, and the scene that Mann uses for the interview with the soldier's father has the father talking about how he can't imagine his son doing
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie. Good writing is the best thing about this movie. This film tells a little tale of a little boy who wants to be a boy and a little girl who wanted to be boys since they were boys. The girls dress up like boys in a variety of things, like hats, dresses and moccasins, and the boy dresses up like a girl in skirts, panties, and a top with a bra and lots of frills. There are some jokes in this movie, most of which are not very funny but they are harmless. There is also a great amount of music in this film, mainly a great number of music clips. I liked this movie so much because it is very funny and very well written. I would recommend this movie very much to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about a poor man trying to survive in an oppressive land, and the good people trying to make a better life for him and the poor, who are constantly dying.  The people in this film have great chemistry, they never seem bored, and we are constantly rooting for their successes and failures.  They do have the occasional problem (one guy is a bit dim) but I think the majority of this movie is pretty good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a number of movies on a variety of topics, the one I remember from when I was younger was this one. It is a science fiction adventure. A spaceship on a search for a planet with a new life form. An alien in a small starship is searching a planet.  I liked it a lot as a kid. The plot is very original and different. It was a funny movie, a good story and a pretty good film. It also has a great music score by Terence Stockton.

I would love to see a sequel.  It was interesting how she was a good girl and that's all she cared about; even though she's older than me, she's not a bad person, just naive and inexperienced and so she was caught in a love triangle and she was in love with this young guy who was the leader of the group of bad guys.    The main characters were very well done, the plot was clever and the chemistry between the characters was very well matched, like a well made soap opera. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a bit sad when I watched this movie as a kid because I thought it was lame, and that it was a long series of shorts, but it really does deserve a place in my "cool" films of all time, it is funny, it's funny even without any words, even the actors do funny stuff, and the music makes it, but that makes it also a very nice film to watch if you like comedy. The story is really very long and has to be seen in one sitting. It's almost like a series of jokes about the "pigs" that are sent to earth from another planet to do the dirty work of the humans, which I didn't like at all, but this is the first movie I can remember watching with so many things happening in it. And the most amazing thing about this film: The movie is not like a comedy, there's no humor here at all. It is not even a very funny movie. The most amazing scenes (the funniest) in this movie are in the last 20 minutes of the film. This is really a great story, a classic of science-fiction movies. This film is so good that I still remember it and will see it even if I'm not a serious sci-fi fan or even a "pixar" fan, it will still be very good for sure. I've seen it with my friends more than once. I just can't wait until they release the big box in which there will be a DVD with all the bonus features.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this one. I felt like it was worth a watch as my favorite movie of the year. The movie doesn't get into the details of the war but it is still told in a way that the war is still a large and important part of our lives. I can't say for certain whether it will make it in a few more years as the film was made in the 60's and they were at that time the most politically correct movie makers in the country. I do think the movie can use some editing. This is more about the action than the emotion. I don't know who the soldier was, but he did seem like he was trying hard to do something, even though his fellow soldiers laughed at his efforts. He did make me feel guilty that I was laughing so hard. I know that this is a "War to End All Wars" but if you know anything about WWII you will find it a very depressing movie. It is interesting to see the effect the war has had on people in the 1950's. It was still a serious time but now we had grown up and were more sensitive to problems. I also enjoyed how the actors handled the war. It could have had a more serious tone and would have been better if they had stayed away from the action and talked about things that happened to people during the war in a different way. This film is also about a war that could easily be avoided if we were so quick to blame each other. It reminds me of the movie The Best Man, which I reviewed in the December '06 issue. This was an action filled movie about a young girl who goes to war and dies.  Here she was a nice little girl who wanted to be part of something big. She died trying to escape and now we try to get a better picture of war. I liked this one a lot!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a good watch. It was great to see a classic like this on the big screen. The script was tight as a drum. The movie had all the elements a great film should have. The performances were good. There were some scenes that were very good. However, the plot line was rushed. I think that the writers should have put off the plot a little bit. It seemed to move at a fast pace when there were scenes that we really wanted to see. However if you love the original series or the books by George R R Martin that the film is based on, you are going to enjoy this movie. There are a few scenes that are not as great as I would have liked. The acting is good and the writing is decent. It seems to have a good run. This movie is really the first appearance of Lord Eddard Stark and it seems very natural from the beginning.   I recommend this movie to everyone who likes epic and long term story lines. I was glad to see it on the BIG SCREEN for a change. It is one of the better TV serials ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me this film is the epitome of the "fear, hope, love" sub-genre of horror movies, because it is all about that - a love triangle, a relationship between two teenagers and a little girl (the kid is only 12 though). While this is not the type of film I am usually in the mood for, the characters are quite interesting. However, one of the things I liked most about this film was the music. The music is quite creepy and creepy, but in a good way.  The "Little Girl and the Devil" is a film I highly recommend, if for no other reason than that its main character is so freaking adorable.  I would recommend this film to a young girl who has fallen in love with the love of her life and a scared little boy. If you can get past the scary soundtrack, the picture is great, the story is interesting, the little girl and the devil are quite well written and the movie doesn't rush you through it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like most of the other reviewers, I've always thought of the first Star Trek movie as just a bunch of jokes. The story that was told in the first film was pretty simple, as an alien race, the Vulcanians have created technology that can change their physical form and thus, have the ability to become whatever it is that they want. The problem is that when this happens, a new threat arises, and that's the Klingons, a fierce and bloodthirsty race who have been on the verge of annihilating all of mankind, until the Vulcans come to their rescue! I always thought the Klingon/Vulcan thing was cool at the time, but it seems a little ridiculous now. I remember going out to see the movie when it came out and I had a terrible headache the next day. The film is a good time, with a great cast, great music and a good story. It's certainly a good piece of entertainment and worth a watch!

Write a positive review about a good movie: **************************** I don't think I need to describe this movie. The title is just that it's an amazing movie. And I'm not sure if it's because of the movie's originality, the amazing acting, the story, the acting, or the cinematography (the cinematography is phenomenal), but this movie has a real magic and a real wow factor. This is a movie where anything could happen and, in some of the scenes, it actually did. In fact, a few people didn't believe that it could happen. But in this one scene, it happened. It could've happened so many more times. But not everything was real. I would've liked to see a little more of the other characters in this movie - or at least have a little bit more of their characters in the movie - but it's still a wonderful movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Train Robbery is a great movie which is a perfect example to the genre. The movie is about a group of three men, in particular John Dillinger, and the chase from Chicago to the South of the United States. The main characters of John Dill (Henry Fonda) and George Dillinger (William Holden) are a duo as they do everything to protect themselves. Dillinger is a hard and smart man, and a professional thief, while Holden is an amateur in comparison and is unable to stop his partner. There are a lot of action scenes in this film with a lot action sequences, and it is funny as well. This is another underrated classic of the genre, and I highly recommend to fans and non-fans to watch this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "There are certain things that are always great to do, and nothing else."  - George Harrison Director: Robert Altman A great movie about the meaning of life. This story is told from the perspective of a family man who, by any account, is a complete and utter douche bag. However, he is also a very nice guy and a good listener and a loving father. A great example of the movie "Man in the Mirror." I gave this movie a great rating for it being a very different view on life. It would appeal to those who have a love of good acting. I also give it a great recommendation to those that like dark humor and dark themes.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------ I've been looking for a good horror/comedy/horror/horrror-based film since I was a kid and I got the same old boring "cinematic" formula, but here it gets an interesting twist, but more on that later. I wasn't impressed by the plot, but it does seem quite entertaining and the story does not have much to it, but there are a couple of decent performances by the cast and a bit of an original story for this film to work on, as they don't really have a whole lot to do, it's mostly them walking around a deserted house and trying to avoid zombies... but... but, I like this movie a lot! ------------------------ Summary: ------------ A house on the outskirts of a small town is overrun by zombies. A group of teenagers try to survive with the help of some dogs. ------------ Plot: -------------- The plot in the film is simple, a group of teenage kids run around trying to survive in an "unlivable" town, there are no cars, they don´t have cellphones, so the group does everything with what they have, that´s what they do, they try to not get killed by zombies in order not to be eaten alive by them. But it´s not enough, it´ll never be enough... ------------ Characters: ------------------- The characters in this film, you get a couple, mainly: 1- The two teenagers, Chris (the lead boy, who is the protagonist) and his buddy Nicky (the girl lead) 2- The dog, he is kinda like the main character, i don´ve seen him much in movies, but he is pretty cool. 3- The mother, she looks quite nice, the mother is a bit old and seems to be tired all the time, but she always tries to help the others, i can´t help thinking that the mother and daughter are one and the same. ------------- Overall: --------------- Well, let´s hope it can be a franchise, at least with some zombies and a little more action, but i dont expect much from them and it isn´t a bad movie, but just a not really good one and it doesn´t give me much, it has its moments, but nothing really special about it, it does the "horror film" thing, but not well. --------------------------- So... do you like... horror/horrible movies? -------------------------
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First, we meet a few of the main characters in one of these "hippie" flicks, namely a college student named Kevin who finds himself in an abandoned house with nothing but a dog named Pooky who lives nearby. Things get odd when Pooky is seen running away from Kevin who is chasing after him. Kevin is in a bit of a rut as he does all the things he hates doing, which is having sex with women (I'm not making this up), having drugs and booze with a bunch of hippies, etc., etc., so he decides to give up the hippie life and become a real man and live out his normal everyday life. Well, he gets laid off, he loses his truck, his job at McDonalds, and his apartment. Well that's just about it, there's nothing else that's interesting to say about this movie.   It's a pretty silly movie and I can't think of too much else to say. There are some good bits in there but in the end, it just doesn't work. It's not funny or clever or exciting. It has a plot which is pretty basic and the action doesn't really go anywhere for a while. It is a pretty average movie but then again, so is most of what the '60s produced.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man with No Name is one of those movies which would have been lost to the annals of history had it not been for the great performances of Robert Duvall. I first saw this film at the Criterion release on the 22nd of August. This movie is not very well known now but when I saw it for the first time and watched it at the Rino de Liguori I was blown away and I have to say I was so surprised that I didn't even realise that the film actually is about a man who goes about killing the mafia. This is the way the movie starts. The movie begins like a film about a gangster called Tony Spilotro ( DuvALL) who gets a new boss in his second job. It is a very low down life in a poor house but what is a poor life. The life is short and there are no big events so you live a very small life. It begins with Tony sleeping in his room in the house with his mother and father while his mother cooks him a delicious meal. Tony has a dream about him having to kill the family but when he goes to a bar he sees that the whole place is empty so he heads outside and sees a group of criminals walking down the street. He shoots them, they get in a car and Tony wakes up thinking it is only a dream. The police arrest him and try to find out how he did it but he tells them it is a real act and they put him in jail to await trial. He tries to explain this dream but the police are unconvinced and he is taken to court and sentenced to prison. The film ends with Tony's trial which is the same as the mafia one in that all the mobsters in the court are called as witnesses but Tony gets off but there is some drama and he gets some sympathy from the judge so he is set free. There are some scenes of Tony at work but there are also scenes of his family including his parents and his brother and the mother says to Tony "Well done son and now we can all be poor again." Tony says that his life has no limits and the ending is very interesting because Tony finds his way out of his cell and there is a scene with him having sex with a girl and she gives a beautiful speech as he is having sex. Tony gets into another fight with the mafia and they kill the guy with a gun and Tony does some very tough things in that fight. He has to kill
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I heard this was in the works, I got excited as I have been dying to see the movie for years. It's an epic fantasy movie that's so good it's a shame the director hasn't made a bigger picture movie with the cast. I loved the setting and the fact that they filmed it in Canada with a Canadian cast was a good touch. It is a great adventure story and a very good comedy.   I enjoyed it quite a bit, however, I am glad I watched it for the very first time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts off with some sort of exposition: an old scientist in a lab with a new daughter is trying to create something that looks like a flower. He thinks that by adding some iron to a flower, it will produce iron. After a while he starts making mistakes, and by the time he makes it the next day, he finds out that the iron is actually poison. The scientist is angry and has a gun to shoot his daughter but gets frightened by what she sees. A black cat runs outside and the father calls his daughter to him so that he could shoot the cat and he would live. She shoots the cat. Later, the daughter is found, and when he finds her, he wants to shoot her. Her father thinks that if his daughter is dead then he too is dead so he says sorry and then says that he doesn't want to be killed by a black cat. So he kills the cat himself. The next day he comes home to find his daughter dead. The old scientist is a terrible father and a terrible person and we are supposed to be horrified by his actions. This movie is good because it has all the things that a good film should have. It makes us feel the sadness of the scientist and the daughter who didn't know that it was a plant and they would die of poisonous plant, and it makes us wonder what would happen if he would had made a more successful plant and made something more deadly and his daughter never heard of it. The movie ends with a great story of a scientist who tries to make a weapon out of a poisonous plant but he just ends up killing his daughter.

Jones" <cjones@emu.edu>... The second time around, the newscasters have some fun mocking the film's star, a very skinny and slightly overweight actress named Darrin Conner.... They bring up a lot of funny things, including: his "stubbornly high" height; the fact that Conner once threw a bottle of water in a producer's face and he called him a "stupid son of a bitch"; the fact they used his own voice on "Foxtrot"; and that Connery went from being the "saddest man in the world" to being the greatest man on film, with the "fame and fortune" that came with that fame. They also say he looked really skinny in the movie, which of course he did not.... From the movie "I can't give you an answer, I can't see you, all I can tell you is if you were the shortest man on the face of the earth, how far could you go with no weight"? And then there's the whole "I've had the most trouble with people saying I am a terrible actor" thing.... _________________________________ *Cheryll E. E. JONES (Cherri-Lynn) is an actress with the stage career of being able to sing all the notes to "Tequila" by Elmer Bernstein. But, on the day that "Fantastic Mr. Fox" came out, she sang the lead role as the heroine, Darrincha, who has the powers of flight, and who also has a special ability, which is telepathic communication with foxes (in a movie that was so heavily influenced by "Fox and the Hound"). It was an amazingly fast-paced little movie, with a great cast with lots of people who looked young as a result. Darrinn, Darlene, and her dog "Mackenzie" all have great little scenes which have made them recognizable names.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm sure by now that you know what this movie is about. We're presented with a scene in the early 90s when an Asian American male prostitute is brutally murdered by the white supremacist cops of San Diego. The only explanation for this is that the prostitutes were actually black and the killer was jealous that they weren't Asian. I say he was "jealous" because the real killer, who was a black man, committed the same murder two days later. I was disappointed that the movie didn't include any information about the white supremacists, and also that the black protagonist was reduced to a one-dimensional villain. There are a couple of other good performances, but the main performer is the Japanese-American Japanese woman who is played by Susan Sarandon, who played the role in the great movie, "Jurassic Park".

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot follows a series of events that occur during the summer holidays, and which are depicted as a series events through various images and pictures. The plot is based around the love of two kids, and their relationship through pictures, and the nature of the pictures. Also an introduction to some of the things that a child, or anyone who loves them, can experience.   This film is an introduction into something that a young person can enjoy, and it is a happy one. It teaches the importance of images through the actions of the people around and to the characters involved in the story, while also giving a look at the world of the young child who has just come of age and is being prepared to be an adult. The story is told via the images and things that are shown and are depicted to the viewer, as well as the actions and attitudes of the characters that are in the film. This gives the viewer a wonderful understanding of these children, and at the same time is a powerful message for the future of children and their development.   in a world where all of us live together in a common area, we all have different cultures, different religions, and different ideas about how a person should act, what a person is, who a person can be, and how we should treat others. The film explores this, and shows us that everyone who comes in contact with people of other cultures and religions have some differences in how we all behave.   "The story follows a group of people as they travel across Ireland to visit relatives on one side, and to attend school on the other side. However, this is only part of the film, as the events depicted and the actions that are displayed to the young audience is of great value. " The characters are a mixture of simple and complex, and they are portrayed as people who are a lot like us, only a bit wiser, and a lot more fun. Even though it is presented in the first person, this movie is a great introduction for anyone to the wonders of the world which children grow up in.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... When we last left off at the very end of The Devil's Backbone (1959), the young boy who had survived the fall of the Devil's castle and lived for a week or two after, is out hunting. He's tired, his clothes are stained, and he's hungry. But he doesn't think it will be long before he comes upon the girl he's been seeking all his life: the girl who is to change his life for the better, who will give him back his freedom and who will help him find the castle he's lost since the fall.   One of the great masterpieces of horror cinema.  My second favorite film from this list:  There is a definite atmosphere and character in this movie. It is a bit slow and you can't really see much of the details of the story, yet it is very well written. The story is about a young girl who has been found dead in a house by a man who is supposed to be her guardian. After the girl is buried, the woman who raised her decides to return to town, but she leaves behind a cryptic message which was sent in her hand written name. As the film proceeds, the young woman comes back to life and is confronted by the old lady. There is also a mysterious old man whom the woman must help.  I haven't seen the movie in a long time but from what I remember it is a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found my movie of the year.   This is a beautiful movie that will touch your heart, and even your brain.  There's no other way to say it.  This movie will take your heart into a world that's very different from what most people would think is possible. It is the last film I saw that could make me cry (not to cry, but from sadness).   It is a story about a man who was born in a very primitive society.  He was given a chance to go live in a civilization but the society wasn't ready. As he got older, he began to have an attraction to the women. This resulted in his parents throwing him off the cliff and sending him to be on his own.  When he got to a village, he met a warrior and after finding a new home, he took up the warrior's training and became a knight.  While there, he was also forced to learn to live with his new companions.  The people of the village are very simple, but the world they live in is so different.  They are also so beautiful, that it is hard to take your eyes away from them.  I also got lost in their lives for a few minutes.  What made this movie so beautiful is the simplicity and the beauty of it all.  For those of you who think a movie should have a lot of action, or a lot to say, you will be disappointed.  It does have a little bit of action but it is very minimal.  Also, there were some times that the film slowed down, and you got to see some other characters as well as the world.  One of the best things about this movie was the ending scene.  In a beautiful setting, the princess and knight are shown kissing and are about to part, but before they are about do so, the hero goes in and saves the day.  After that, the scene changes to the town that the hero lives in (he lives in a village by himself). He shows the princess his home town (they love to travel a bit) and then leaves for home.  So the ending of the movie is not what you would call romantic, but it was beautiful.  A great movie to end your summer vacation.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* The most interesting part of this movie is when the protagonist (a very good character) encounters a character named "Rabia" who is a street prostitute. She gets a hold of a drug called "Gloriosa", and it is very strong. She then attempts to rob her friend in the dark in which she is caught. She is found by her friend, who is then attacked by a violent maniac called "El Dente" who proceeds to beat him into the ground. The friend, unable to endure the violence, dies in front of her. This is a very brutal scene, to say the least. In the end, the character becomes "Rabiya" and begins to live on her own. I think the author tries to explore the idea of "the homeless" and "the poor" a bit in this movie. I did really enjoy it. I would recommend this movie to a friend and see if they can get past this scene.

Not sure if it's the booze or the painkillers but I just couldn't keep my eyes off of him.  But he's also an all out asshole so don't let his charm fool you. He'll get you if you need something done done quickly. He thinks it's a great idea to go on TV to give out his "suggestions" to the government to get out of spending $5 million to fix a busted toilet. A lot of people, myself included (and I'm not a big fan of public toilets), think it's one of those things you do for people who are stupid.  Bartlet is right. It is a broken toilet.  If the government won't fix it then I suggest that all the people who want a free public toilet (which is a free service) should make it their hobby to pick the lock on a broken public toilet.  Or better yet make some of their own toilets with their own money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film I had high hopes for. I thought the production quality was fantastic. It had a great cast that played off of each other in various amusing roles and I laughed quite a bit. The plot of the film is based on a story by Joseph Campbell and while it is based loosely on his own work he manages to make it into a movie that is both intriguing and amusing. It is a very original take on the story of Campbell himself which would make a great feature film if it ever gets made.   The film's storyline is that of a man named Charles Mason. It begins when we learn Charles Mason is a member of the ancient secret society called the Ancient Blue Print and that in order to enter the society one must undergo an initiation process called The Blue Print. The initiation process is quite brutal and it is up to Charles and a young woman named Laura to escape with the blue print and to save humanity from a deadly attack on the last city on earth.     I found this movie quite hilarious at times. I found it a lot easier to enjoy when it was based on Campbell's book rather than one of his many novels and it really was quite funny throughout the movie. The characters are very fun to watch and the action scenes are both very entertaining and funny. The script was quite good. The ending was a nice twist that was a bit unexpected.   a good story, a good script and a great ensemble cast all combine to make a very entertaining film and I am very happy to have been a part of a film where I was able to laugh at times and not take myself so seriously.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When you think about it, this is a weird film! You have the classic "The Man Who Fell To Earth" premise with a "space dog" (the same thing, only not so stupid). But then, you have a human trying to save the earth. If a human is capable of saving the earth from the ravages of the sun, surely a dog is capable, right? A strange concept in the first place! The film is a lot of fun to watch. The cast (which I'll be mentioning shortly) are all great in their respective roles. It is definitely a "tortured space dog" story. There is a whole lot of strange situations, all of which I've never seen or heard before on screen. That being said, the story does work, and it is very funny. There was a point where it felt like the dog was getting really old and his owner wanted to have a party at which he could be put to sleep. Then, they decided to have him play with his owner...I don't know what to say about that, but it was hilarious. It has a very "alien" sense to it, but you feel like you've been sucked in to the movie. The aliens (which is the most important thing in the movie), are pretty cool to watch, and the script (especially by Rick Baker) is pretty funny. That said, there is a bit of a plot hole near the end. I'm guessing it has something to do with the dog, but why did they bring in the humans and then go back and put them to sleep? Maybe they had a bit too much to drink and the humans had to come and save the day? It kind of seems like some sort of "Alien is coming" movie, but in that case, it's not that bad a movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a pretty basic little film. The story revolves around a bunch of guys who go on a road trip to a town called "Punk." It's the sort of film you could watch for laughs. This is also the film that first introduced me to John Candy.  I was a kid, and I remember this film being a bit on the "cutesy" side and having some "jokes" that I was probably not supposed to have laughed at.  A typical road trip.  Now, a decade or so later, I'm old enough to realize that the folks involved in this film were trying to do something that's called a "high school movie."  It's not a high school film because it takes place on the road.  There's a lot of "school drama" here.  It doesn't get much more low-key than that.  If a high-school kid were to go on such a trip, how would they react to such an experience?  In short, they would be confused, and would want more of it.  So in short:   It was a bit of a laugh, and a bit goofy.   I'm glad they didn't get it in the theaters because, in a lot ways, the film was a good bit of fun.  That said, it's still one of the first films I ever saw that was funny enough to actually get me laughing.  The film is available on video from  The Video Archives.  And there are also  several videos  from the The Movie Network.  But for those that don't want to deal with DVD's, or just want to get the bare bones of the film, here's the basic plot:  An idiot buys a car.  He then drives it all over the country, crashing it in various states and towns.  After his first crash, he has a vision:  He is to go down the road and stop at each town that he crashes into.  (At this point, my brain began to wonder about the meaning of "totally lost."  I didn't want the idiot to be completely lost, because I'm a smartass.  This was a funny scene, however, and the idiot in the movie really is totally lost.  And it's funny because I think it's a little sad.  I really enjoyed this film, and recommend that everyone give it a go.

The way that the character and the story is told are very well done and very well directed, it is great to have this good looking lady in a bikini that is not very revealing on the screen but then again there is not much to show either.  So the plot is pretty straightforward, an 18 year old girl who has been sent back home, to stay with her mother who lives with her a grandmother and a young aunt. But as the years pass her mother is getting a bit older and she is trying to teach her daughter how to live life. But then her Aunt dies of a very long illness and she begins to lose her own mind. So when her mother comes to stay at her house she is not really interested and she doesn't even want her to come. The plot really builds up to her death, but it's a sad ending with a very sad ending that i did find so very tragic, but then her mother and her Aunt who loved and adored her die. And there is some more life after that for the heroine, but is a little bit too late, a sad, sad ending for the ending. The movie is also told from her point of view, i suppose to a certain degree. .

You get a lot from it and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good time, and a bit of humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised.   In this movie, the main female lead does all the things in the book that the male leads in the series do.  In the book it is the female lead who becomes the leader and we can't help but admire her strength and determination. She does all of this without any help from the male characters.  This isn't to say that the movie is perfect.  There are some faults here and there, and in this movie especially.  We never learn exactly what we should be doing as a group.  The characters also are somewhat unrealistic.  That said, it is a beautiful movie.  A must watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love the movie  because it's so very close to the original. It tells a story about a high schooler who discovers his dead father is actually alive and he has been pretending to be dead since then. This is followed by him discovering who his father is and who he really is. That's where the plot starts getting interesting for me. What this movie does best is bring attention to the importance of family and what happens to families when the parents die. It does this through a story that follows the lives of these three characters: the dead dad, the deceased brother, and the young son who is struggling to deal with all this. I love the performances for these three, and how each of them have something to say. I loved how the brother tried to bring his younger self out of his shell and the older brother tries to give his younger son a proper education. These performances were so effective that I could not help but to get involved in the story. This movie did well to show the importance and difficulty of having a family in today's society, especially as it pertains to a young man coming to terms with his own mother's death and family issues.    So you have three young men in high school and they all have different ways of dealing with their grief. I like the way the older son gets into a relationship with his girlfriend, the older mother makes him feel as if all this is part of his own story to tell, and then the young boy is forced to face the realities of his life. I have heard that this movie is on a lot of college curricula because it is so topical and has touched so many people in the past. I will definitely be watching this movie again one day soon.  The movie was just enough to be watched once, or twice, before giving it up. I think this movie has something for everyone. I don't care how old you are, I think you should see this movie at least once. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** * My first review. * It was hard to find a way to write about this movie that didn't sound ridiculous or come off like a review I'd written from a movie theater seat. The cast was really great, with some very funny and good-looking roles. I feel as if I need to talk about this film a good amount more. But I'm afraid I need a couple spoilers. You see I didn't like the film at all. There is a moment near the start where it was nice, but then there is a stupid moment near this middle. After that a lot of bad things happened to this poor guy. This isn't so bad. At first. But then it turns out that the bad things that happened were all in his head. That is the stupid part. If you're going to write a review about this book and this movie (a terrible picture book) I suggest you read the book. It has even worse things that happen in it. At least the movie came with a happy ending. Or at least this movie had a very, very happy ending, I really liked this movie. If I have to pick one to show to a friend I will probably go with the movie (because it is the one I watched first) I really wish I could be watching this again. Or reading the book again.
Write a positive review about a good movie: -------------------------- ------------------------- As far as I am concerned, this is one of the greatest films ever made. Its one of those films that's impossible to rate as any one of its scenes is truly incredible. It is one truly extraordinary film. The film is a retelling of "The Great Gatsby", the film that became famous after its release. I can see why this film has become so famous, the story, its characters and the writing style are amazing. The plot is simple: Daisy (Lea Thompson) is an American young woman who runs away from home. She is eventually caught and taken to a resort in the Catskills, where she meets Nick Carraway (Leonardo DiCaprio), who has a wife, a daughter and is a great big Gatsbys man! This film is truly an outstanding film, but like I said, there are so many moments in it that are absolutely amazing that one could spend days reading through the film to see the details! There were so many brilliant characters throughout this film, a truly great cast of actors, and the script was so easy to follow, I did find myself reading through it several times just to get a feel for the characters. Even though this is a fairly simple film, it manages to pack so many things into its relatively short running time, that I would strongly recommend watching this film in a theater and to really get to know the cast of characters! It's an amazing film and it is a must see!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film as a child. I still remember the fear and dread I felt before the film starts. I remember hearing this man's voice for the first time, "I'll do what I do best, I'll destroy the moon!" The plot was quite a bit like a slasher movie with a good dose of horror. There's an odd looking alien, a very young girl, and a mysterious creature in this film. There are a lot of weird things going on in the film. I thought that some of the characters were quite irritating at times and were made to look like stereotypical camp characters at times. As a result, the story is quite difficult to follow. There is a story in this movie that is not told until later in the movie, so it's not easy to follow everything. It's a little too dark for my liking, and I liked that this movie was an action movie.  Plot Summary:  A spaceship has crashed in the desert and a group of kids are camping in a cave. Suddenly they hear a strange voice "Get out! You must go to the moon! I have my vengeance!" The kids go back to camp, and some time later the spaceship lands in town. The group of the campers go to investigate what has happened in town, and all of a sudden something attacks one of them. The boys run out, and an unknown alien is attacking one of the boys. When the alien is defeated, the other two are attacked and killed. The film ends with a young boy being taken away on a helicopter, and the scene cuts to space. There the film ends... I don't know if it was good or not. It has a very confusing plot to follow, and it's a great experience watching the alien in person. It also takes a long time to finish the movie. There was so much going on during the film, I really felt it was all meant to be.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As soon as I heard that this movie was going to be remade as a TV movie I was intrigued.   It's hard to say if I liked this movie.  I guess that is to be expected of a movie called "Rats" directed by Robert Benton Jr. I guess I could say that the film has some elements of classic Hollywood, but it is lacking in originality, creativity or originality in the plot.  The story begins with the story of a man who owns and is running a rat store in the middle of the desert.  It is not a good thing when he has to hire a bounty hunter to find his lost pet rat.  He then tells the cat-like rat named Mr. Rat-to "Get to the big city."  There is a lot of comedy to be had in this story and I found the movie to be rather funny, but the movie is not for the faint of heart.  When I watched this movie I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the movie in "RAT-TAT" I enjoyed it less but it was still pretty good for my standards.  However, the main thing that makes this movie a true classic is the performances of Paul Newman, Peter Falk and Richard Kiel.  Richard Kiely (Mr. Rat, Mr. Cat) is a good actor, and you can see that he enjoyed his part as Mr. Ratter (the bad guy).  Peter Falk also has a good performance as the rat named "Ratty" and his character is also very funny.  There are some great music cues throughout the film as well.  Although I will warn you that there are some scenes in the movie where Mr. Red, Mr Red's son, has his eyes gouged out by a rat.    I could not get enough of the rat store.  As I mentioned before this movie has some comedy in it, but most of it doesn't make sense, nor does it make any sense.  This movie is kind of like a classic horror movie in that there is a serial killer that is after rat ears.  Even though the movie has humor, there is no sense of a plot. I would like to see a sequel to this movie but I don't think it will happen.  You may read this review and think that I am a bad movie critic, but there is nothing wrong with a movie that has a plot and a story.

Reviewer: hankthekid - favorite favorite favorite - October 7, 2007  Subject: A Hilarious Classic This movie, for all it's flaws and flaws alone, is still one of the funniest things I've ever seen on the big screen. As a big fan of John Waters, this is a perfect complement to his own work, one that I know I'll be having many years from now when the right time comes. This film is a good example of what we now think of as "sexploitation," a term that was coined by Mr. Waters, and it is also an example of John's style of humour. One look at any of the actresses in the film gives away exactly what this is...a bunch of sluts who are all a little bit horny. But the real thing is that they're not sluts because they're really quite attractive, these girls are just "good looking" to the point where you can't help but laugh at them.   John Waters had a lot of talent to work with, I think it's a shame that this film never got released in the USA. - October 6, 2007A Hilariously Classic  Source: A Comedy  Duration: 01:42:59  Rating: NR  Sound: Yes  Studio: MGM/UA Pictures  Year: 1986   NOTE: This was recorded during the 1980's, so it may have sound issues, but I tried to get a decent recording.   and now to get to the REAL star of the show: KUNG FU YI This movie has just about every single woman you could possibly imagine having sex with, including some pretty scary women like the lady from The Goon Show.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was looking at this movie because my husband saw a commercial for it and we both liked it. There is a bit of a'movie with no music' element to it. The movie is a great blend of comedy and a bit more mystery. It has a lot of heart to it, and it will probably be remembered in the future as one of the best mystery films I have ever seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One could say that a movie about the "real world" is not really that interesting. There is no plot or motivation for why the characters are doing something they feel is wrong. At least not for much of the film. However, this is a very good movie. It is about a group of people, including the girl. One day, someone is killing a young boy and a girl, including a boy who is also a girl. The girl is actually the victim of the attack. The boy who's actually a girl is the one who is helping the victim who is the actual killer. It turns out that the boy is the killer. We are also given some background information. But none of it really matters. We just follow the boy and the girl as they go from day to day. They even come across as two different people at first as they spend time in the park or in some other place. But as the time goes by, we see that it is really the same person. But the girl tries to help the victim. After all, she is in need of her. It gets really dark very quickly. The film is mostly filled with dark humor. It's a sad movie but it is also quite funny. I had the worst headache that night, but I've had worse. The violence is not much in it. I guess some people could find it scary. If you're the type who likes gore or violence, it's definitely a good watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is the best I ever saw.   Well, I guess that is the least I can say about a movie with a title like that.  I really had no expectations when I watched this movie. It did not disappoint.  It was fun but not too serious.  This movie is about a kid named Jimmy (David Niven) and the fact that he is the youngest of five (I guess that means that he has five siblings). In this movie Jimmy's mother is killed by the other kids and he runs away from home and starts to be a street hustler. The movie starts with a lot of shots of Jimmy running around and stealing things.  One day while he is stealing a bike he runs into a small boy named Billy (John Randolph). He sees that the bike is broken and decides to take it back.  The next day Jimmy runs away again and this time he is in trouble when he is attacked by the two kids he stole the bike from the day before.  There is a lot more action in the movie than what I thought would be in the plot but I was still very amused by it all.  My only real disappointment with the movie was that it is only 70 minutes long.  A great movie with lots of character and fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Hush - I'm a little scared of this movie, but it's a movie where you can laugh, scream, and maybe even cry. It's funny and creepy all at the same time. The film is set in a small, rural town that is pretty much overrun with zombies. I really wish I were watching this movie today, because the zombies aren't what they seem - they don't go after everyone when they turn up, they wait to pick you off and feast. It gets really freaky when the zombies attack in a barn, but the rest of the movie is pretty funny - the zombies are pretty good, but they don the worst thing ever - the dialogue! It's pretty bad, but I could see why the film was made. If it looks a little dated and a little cheesy, don't fret - the film's got some great moments. This isn't a movie to miss!"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Great casting with good performances. The movie is about a man who is living in a post-apocalyptic world where all the plants have died and all that remains is an enormous wasteland of rubble, sand, and dust. But the man (Milo) is happy as he finds a little girl and she looks like a pretty good looker. So that is the little romance of it. And it isn't too bad and the movie gives us a few good moments and some decent scenes. There are a few scenes where you see things go wrong and the film tries to be funny in a funny way but it's not as good as some of the humor in the other movies. But that is why I'm giving it 4 stars because it is a fun little movie with an entertaining cast.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I was first told about the film by a great theater group here in Dallas. I didn't see it in the theater because the seating is so close together I can't walk to the other side. I was surprised because I am sure the cast would be quite a challenge on the stage at the old Towne Theater. It was a real shame they didn't take advantage of the beautiful back lot of the historic theater. They were playing music too loud to be heard in the auditorium but a few times when we were walking around the back lot I could hear their playing. It is a real pleasure to see this movie in person because it is very faithful to the book and the style of the play. We loved the characters and we loved the story. I think the director knew what he was doing and the performances were very true to life for the characters. As good as the story is, I was very disappointed that the only other theater that has shown it is gone now and no longer operates as a theater. --------------- So... I have to give this movie a good review! I watched this because I was invited to attend a show on the subject of musical theater that the author of the book did in Seattle. I had never heard of it before but now that I have it is one of the great books in the world. One of the best plays I have ever seen! This will be in my top 10 of all time! --------------- The play is called "Mister Roberts and His Orchestra" and the original musical is performed by the Mott Theater Company of the Seattle Musical Theatre Company. This version is by Ethel Waters, who was the original actress in the role. The cast is very well balanced. Some of the parts are very good, like the one of a young girl trying to become an artist. Many of the voices are not good, but not enough to detract from the good performances. The singing of the original is done by a very talented actress named Myrtle Erskine, whose voice was not very good until she was 60, but it still comes out well. The music is quite good and the direction of the set is very good. The book does get pretty much lost and the book ends. But since the book is the basis for the play and the play is a very good show, I think this version is good enough to make up for it. -------------- I thought this was a wonderful musical! A great cast, the production was very well done
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is very enjoyable for its time. There were several "dramas" like "The Black Stallion," "The Green Hornet," and "The Scarlet Pimpernel" in the 1930's. However, the majority of them were only about one kind of horse, the American bronco. This was very different from the Western that dominated the 1930s and 1940s, "Gunsmoke," "Out of the South," and other stories that centered around the cowboys, trappers, and outlaws. "Gone With the Wind" was the first story about a black family from the North in a southern setting. After the first appearance of Scarlett O'Hara and the love affair she has with Rhett Butler, the film's story really developed, and we see that Scarlett O was not just the innocent young girl in the romantic drama, but the wife of an American tycoon. Scarlett was also the mistress of General Custer and her father had several wives at the same time, one of which was the British princess who saved him after the attack on Fort McHenry during the American Civil War. The film was the only movie of its time that featured a real life Civil War soldier and the romantic story of a black husband and his white wife.  This movie is highly recommended, and is still highly admired today.  Recommended by: Robert W. Krell 1 out of 4 stars Out of the Woods (1937) I loved this movie growing up. Not only was it the first film I remember watching and loving, but it was the film that introduced me to the idea of a "fairy tale." With its lighthearted sense of humor, "Out from the Woods" could be a pretty fun film. The story of two girls, a white girl and a brown girl, who decide to travel the country hunting down mythical creatures and ending up in the woods is something to see. The girls are very innocent and kind, but at the end of the movie they are completely out of the woods. This movie could even be a good lesson for young kids about the importance of being careful and being cautious around the woods as they grow up.  The girls learn many lessons that they do the rest of their lives; such as never to touch a tree with roots that are older than a tree's trunks. They also encounter the white lady, who was apparently a very cruel woman when she was younger. The ending of this film, in which they

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie isn't necessarily bad, but its structure is very flawed. The movie should have been broken up into 2 parts, one on a plane, the other on a motorcycle ride through different landscapes. The film is based on a graphic novel written by Jeff Smith. The book has some similarities with an already known book written by Robert Latham (a pseudonym of Robert Ludlum) who is a writer with a large and dedicated fan base. In Latham's story a pilot with no flying experience is hired for a military mission to a remote island in the North Pacific and the only passenger is an elderly woman who's husband is a pilot. The mission gets off to a bad start as the pilot is shot out of the sky by hostile natives, they then blow up the plane and everyone is killed. The plane is then blown up by friendly natives. The pilot survives, and then has to survive in the local rain forest. The story of this movie seems to borrow from a lot of sources. The two pilots, the woman who has a pilot husband and the plane that is blown up and killed, they all have some similarities in their lives.   All in all, a good, funny and violent film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the year 2000 I watched the movie "The Dead Man" by Ken Russell. It was the first film in which I heard about Russell's reputation and it stayed with me like a shadow. I would not call this a bad movie, but I am ashamed to say I found it almost impossible to like it. I am now aware that my feelings have changed in the years since this film was made. I know that this is simply a film which reflects Russell's own personal opinion, but that is not how I remember it. What Russell's film reflects is a bleak world. Russell has the gift of depicting these characters in such an unsettling, realistic and realistic way that even a non-spooky movie like this can have a horrifying effect on the viewer. I remember the very first day in the cinema when the screen was lit with cold fluorescent lights. These lights turned all the rooms around into a dark space. The actors' faces became lifeless. I was so scared I could not move. The film was a nightmare.  I enjoyed this one and will be watching the follow-up films from this director. The Dead Man will definitely not make me want to be near any kind of light switch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________ A great action-adventure film from the 1970's starring an impressive cast that includes a young Clint Eastwood and the always-popular Robert Redford. This film follows a team of police officers who are investigating an unbalanced man who is shooting people from helicopters. This leads to some exciting shoot-outs, and an epic chase scene in which the helicopters chase each other down a narrow canyon with the police squad trying to avoid the helicopters on a collision course. It would be a great action film today, especially one with lots of helicopter action, if the plot wasn't so nonsensical. It's a pretty average story with little plot development beyond that the bad guy is flying around shooting everyone from helicopters and the police are trying to arrest him because he's a bad guy. It features the first helicopter stunt-work by James Cameron, and the film has more than its share of the best moments in film history: the helicopter chase, the final chase down the mountain, the climax at the water's edge. ___________________________________________ -CLIFF RATCLIFF - The plot was ridiculous in its pretentiousness. It wasn't a bad film to watch, but as a piece of film history it was one that had to be seen to be believed. _________________________ -HAROLD LESNIHAN - This movie is a must for any action fan. It was an extremely violent movie that has a sense of humor that was rarely seen in 70's action pictures. -J.T. SHERMAN - This is the best action movie from the 70's to come out of the west. The action scenes are amazing, and every one of the action scenes involving helicopters makes it a classic. -JOHN ST. HANLEY - This was an amazing movie. One of the greatest action movies of all time. This movie also features a great movie star. A movie star that could have been in any number of other great action movies. __________________  I like the movie...but it would have been even better if it weren't so bad. _________ -JEFF DUNBAR  1980's- I have seen it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not quite sure what it is about and I couldn't bring myself to like it even if I had seen it several times. It is about an alien, I'm guessing, and his relationship with two children, the little boy (he is about 6 or 7) and the little girl (she is perhaps 2 or 3). It starts off as a funny little mystery, but the movie gets more and more ridiculous and absurd as it goes on. They are all singing in a bar, one of them is dancing while the other is listening. There is also an obnoxious guy with no real purpose, and a whole variety of aliens with no apparent purpose, one, and one with a really annoying voice. All the little characters are ridiculous in this movie. The little boy is so cute, the girl is so innocent and silly, and so is the alien (the voice is a real treat). I think the movie would probably appeal to little kids as well as adults.   It doesn't help that the movie is so incredibly boring.  I suppose it is best for adults, because the movie doesn't have any real purpose and it just goes on for a very long time.  It does have a couple of good lines, but those are easily forgotten within 10 minutes of sitting down to watch.

The fact that I'm not a genius tells you what a pain it's going to be if I ever meet someone like this. What do I mean by that? Well, I'm getting older. A year from now, I'll be twenty-three. My dad was never a genius. He's a little more intelligent than me. He has a Ph.D. in business management from the University of Wisconsin. This is the main reason I'm interested in a guy like him. If he had that education, he could have become a millionaire like me. I hope I can someday become a good lawyer. I really do!   Anyway, I want to say something before we start talking about my first kiss with a girl. Well, maybe that's a bit of a lie. I'm trying to pretend that I wasn't a virgin and I only met a girl, not a girl and a boy. Now, I don't really believe it. There was a girl at a party I went to. This girl was hot. She had good hair, very big boobs, and she was very pretty. This party was in my hometown. Well… We weren't really a good fit because she's too shy to come to the party. I guess she felt the same way about me. It was all in a day's work.   I'm telling this story not to make a bad first impression or to make up for what she was feeling about me because it's not true.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One day I was at a movie theater with my friend. We were the only couple there. It was raining and the theater was not too crowded. We saw a movie called G.I. Jane. The movie stars Charlize Theron in a part as a soldier. When the movie ends the rain had stopped. The theater was really dark. We looked for a phone booth in a corner. The rain was pouring outside. We found one and made our way through the dark theater to a telephone booth. It had a hole in the bottom. We heard a man talking to us on the phone. I thought he was talking to his daughter. Then he said, "Hey are you there? Can you hear me?" I thought, "what did you just say?" And I looked around to find out who was talking with us. I saw a girl. It didn't look like any person I had ever seen. She was very fat and had very round glasses. As we were looking at each other, she said, (in the girl's voice) "Hey, I just wanted to say, I saw you in G. I Jane. When I see you in person it's not the same. You have a lot of hair. It's a girl." (The girl was in her mid twenties.) And she had this way of speaking and her tone was different. It sounded like she was really upset. I looked at her and thought that she was a little odd. She wasn't the way I would have thought a girl would be. She had this really sweet voice and this really funny way of saying things. I wasn't sure if I was making sense. I was a bit confused. I couldn't even see her face. So I began to listen and my friend told me the story about how Charlize was just a kid. One day while they were sitting outside playing, she just saw a man on the train. She looked up and there was a woman walking past. She saw a bus coming and thought it must be a mother and child riding on the bus. As the bus pulled up the man on a train just stood there and watched. She called out to him, but the man didn't answer. Then, as the bus stopped in front of the house, he pulled out a gun and shot the woman and the child dead. At that time, Charlize thought the man was after her and the mother. She ran after him, thinking she could get
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A man (David Carradine) is killed in Vietnam by an RPG. He falls through the sky into a water tank and is brought back by an American (Paul Sorvino) and taken to the French Embassy in Saigon. As soon as he gets out of the embassy he falls in love with a Vietnamese girl (Janet Leigh) and becomes involved in a political battle for power in Saifon that eventually results in his death.  It has all the necessary elements of a good western.  The film also shows the Vietnam War through the eyes of a man.   The cast is fantastic. Sorv (played by Carradina) is the voice of reason, while Leigh is the hot-blooded character that will do anything to prove herself to be "The Best".  The film does a great job of blending different genres together and never becomes repetitive.

But they did end up being close to the characters they really were. I guess it was just me who was uncomfortable. And I didn't really get that the events were "their" fault either.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film follows two young brothers as they explore their world, learning to ride horses and build their own house. The film has a lot of humor and good acting. The best aspect of the film is the relationship between the two brothers, who are often at odds with each other, yet both enjoy each other's company.   For those that are in the mood for some good old fashioned horse play, here is a film you won't forget.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first read about this movie on a news item about a school shooting and I didn't believe a thing about it until the movie came around. It was a really good movie which made me feel very nostalgic because a lot of the characters and situations felt very real. I enjoyed this movie a lot. I don't believe the film is quite as scary as it could have been, but it isn't as bad either. I liked the movie very much, but I don�t know if I would recommend it to others, it could be a good one-time movie for a family, but probably not recommended for the younger generations.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last of the Mohicans is a war movie and a good one at that. There is not much more I can say about it other than that it's good. The cast is wonderful with James Cromwell as the chief of a Mohawk band, John Gilbert as a French General, George Sanders who plays a soldier who has a very close relationship with the chief, and a number of other people in the film that I won't spoil.  It is a great war movie!  They have done it again!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you only saw the trailer and the synopsis it was very disappointing, the plot was okay and the characters were alright, but when the movie starts you can tell it was trying to be something else, like a Hollywood horror movie or a cheesy 'B' movie, which is not a bad thing because it didn't try to be anything other than that. A very bad movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film. If you like horror films like the others reviewed here then this is a must watch! If you have not seen this, I can't stress enough the horror factor. This movie has it all. The pacing is so slow it will take you to a trance like state but only for a short while. You will probably end up crying. The acting is excellent. There are plenty of dead and dying. I loved how the movie played with the audience, making them feel like it was a movie about the horrors of the living, but then adding a twist, like what if you had to live on your own. I do not know what was happening at night, I could only see a black screen. That was the only time the dark came into play. At the end of the film you will feel very sorry for all the dead people. I really feel sorry for them. The gore was so bad, but the film was so effective in making it feel so real it will still haunt you a week after you finish it. I have watched this movie at least 3 times. This is one of my favourite horror films.  - October 9, 2017Lethal!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A few years ago when I was a film editor, I had a colleague who was a director. She gave me a copy of 'The Red Shoes' a movie that is not very good by any standards but is a movie with great energy. That was what we were all searching for.  We have been searching for our lives in cinema and our lives are now. A little story about a movie: My friend asked me: I know you are doing 'The Blue Man'  in the United States, why you are not doing the movie you made about the Chinese people called 'The Green Man'. Well, what can I say. They were good friends from the start. They have the same background. They even lived together in the same place in China for a long time. But for different reasons. I don't like to say much more. The movie will come out in a few years.  'The Greenman'  "Oh, it is a bad scene! This time." ~  For those who are not familiar with the film:  The story involves a young girl, her parents and a Chinese doctor who runs a hospital. The story follows the medical student's life. The movie is a little slow. A movie can't have everything it wants to have. A film has to make sure the rest of the movie fits around it. That is not the case with 'The Purple Man'. In this film there were several scenes of extreme violence, which really scared me. The doctor gets his ass kicked by a group of thugs and is left for dead. The mother of the girl is so mad, she has a seizure. A lot of it happens in a very short amount of time.    There are also a lot of scenes involving drugs and sex and drugs and violence.  I really loved the ending, the ending that says 'Now get out'.   This movie is very good.  It was made by Chinese people and is directed and written by Chinese.  There are even scenes in the hospital, where they talk about 'The Yellow Man'.  I'm hoping that they will show a remake of this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Devil is a Cub is a fun popcorn movie with great character designs and a fun premise. The action and humor are all really good as well.  The Devil, a 6 year old boy, is an average boy in an average town.    He lives with his grandparents, his younger half sister, his cousin, and his cat.  His older sister is in her last year of high school and his cousin has just graduated high school, but the other kids think they're his older half sister because they always ask about him while he's in the yard playing and his mom is still not sure he is her son.  All of these children are jealous of the attention the younger brother gets and tease him and taunt him about his weight.  He has a dark secret he keeps from everyone.  A young boy is sent home from school on a special day.  This is when the devil appears to him and tells him that his family has been cursed for a thousand years.  As a result, they won't live very long.  They will die of cancer or heart disease, or perhaps the cancer will take over the heart, or there will be a stroke and he will die as well because the curse has not been broken. The first part of the story is great.  The curse has been broken and they live happily ever after, until the Devil shows up with a new one.  When this one comes about it is clear that he does not want the boys' happiness.  I'm not sure how much it is based on a true story, but it makes a good story and was well done.  It is a good and fun movie, but nothing amazing or unique. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I have to thank the cast and crew of the great film "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" for giving us all a wonderful opportunity to see a great movie with actors such as Jack Lemmon, Walter Huston, Michael Ironside, Robert Taylor, George P. Cosmatos, Fredric March, Joe Canfield and others. Mr Smith Goes To Washington will stay on the screen as long as the movies are being made. I would have liked to see George Washington's character portrayed more honestly in a manner that he truly acted like. There are very few actors that come close to what George Washington really was like. The most impressive aspect of the film to me is it's musical numbers. This is where this movie truly shined! I also have to praise the actors for playing George Washington. In the scenes where he speaks directly to the people, or addresses the people directly, we get to see that he really did have a lot of energy. He certainly made his point! This movie is a very funny movie and it's a shame it can't get more recognition. As it stands now, it stands as one of the top 10 movies of all time. I personally think it was a great idea to have the cast of Mr Smith Go to Washington meet in Washington DC to perform in the musical number about the election of George Washington as President. This would have been a very good one to see and the cast could have been great. The whole cast could've been great except for one very irritating character called "Lucky the Leprechaun" who doesn't do much but whine, yell, and complain. The characters in this movie are really not realistic and are certainly more cartoonish than the real ones. Still, it's an entertaining movie and would not be forgotten.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never heard of this film until the day I got home from work and it was all there. In fact, it was pretty awesome. I wasn't familiar with the director's name, but I knew about the other films he'd made, such as A Bug's Life, which I thought had been pretty good. This one I thought was better. It was good. I really had a fun time reading the book and seeing the movie. I didn't realize I'd be going to see this film the day after Christmas and I don't think I'll do that again. I've had a lot of good things happen to me in the last couple of years and I haven't had that feeling in a while.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is very well made (as you may have heard, the director has won numerous "awards" for his work and a lot of "nominees" get nominated) and it is a lot less expensive than the usual. The movie is also very well done. Although, as I said, it is not as good as the one in The Day of Wrath, it still is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really solid film about a man who is getting over his mother who is dying of cancer in a nursing home. She has been a good mother and has raised an honest, hard-working man who has put her needs first when she has no other choice. One day he finds out she will need a lot more care than he can handle and is so disappointed when he finds the nurse that will take care of her. She is beautiful. She looks as if she could be a star in this movie. However, she is not. She's just a nice, well-meaning person who tries to be a good friend to the man who loves her. The movie is fun, funny, silly, and just a good time.  It's also a pretty sad movie about a person who is just trying to do a good thing. I wish they had made more sequels. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While I'm not really into sci-fi or horror movies this is very much a good one: it does a good job at not making its characters seem shallow but there is certainly an air of mystery to it and a lot of fun to be had by watching it.   The thing that made it stand out from other sci-fantasy films I've seen is not the sci-fiction but the fact that it takes an old sci-text book by H.G. Wells and then completely alters its storyline. While that's a big problem in a lot sci-tech films the writer for this one clearly is a fan of the work and has added a lot to the story. It's not quite like the original but more of a combination with the later Wells and Wellsian technology. This movie doesn't try to change the sci fiction aspect of Wells' work but instead has added lots of new stuff.   the original Wellsian story has a lot going on, a lot that is hard to explain, such as a sentient spaceship which takes over a crew member's body to create artificial life, which doesn't come into play until the latter third of the film and it's not clear until then how to do so. There's also a lot more sci-technology in this movie than most of Wells movies and that adds to the mystery. The crew of a science ship are attacked by some unknown alien force and the ship has to be repaired. The original Wells work deals with a human crew which discovers they are actually an alien race living on the planet earth but this film uses alien technology such as the alien spaceship to create a new form of life on the surface of Earth and create a body for its crew member. This crew member is an android. I won't say this character is interesting because he is not and a few scenes later I find it hard to care about him.  , but if I had to recommend it to a non-fans I'd say you should see this to see if you like the Wellsian science fiction or just to get a glimpse of how far sci-science has gone since the time of Wells.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie last Sunday night at my home movie theatre. I was pretty excited to see this one because the trailer looked really good and the movie looked to be an action packed flick. I watched the first few minutes with my sister, my daughter and a friend. My daughter sat next to my son watching the movie with a big smile on her face. I thought, "I hope they give my son the best seat in the house because he could use the company. I had been a little upset about it last year, because my son was getting into the action after being told to leave his toys out of his room all year. Well, I was wrong about him leaving things out but not the fact that he is still a kid. The action was pretty great. I could tell it was going to be a good one so I started watching this one with a few friends. One by one one went away but my son, who was so worried he left something behind at his house came back with no toys at all and a huge smile on his face! Then he started a fight with a bunch of bad guys and the last thing I remember him saying was "This movie will be a great one!" That was a great movie and it looked like the good old days of a great big screen. Now, I want to know if this is one of the better movies I've ever seen. Maybe I will try to buy it on VHS. I don't know. I'm just really happy that the movie is about a boy who just loves going to the movies and he had an awesome time. Now what more could a kid like that want?
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film starts with a beautiful sun setting over the Pacific Ocean, as it did for the duration of the film.  The title of this movie refers to the time in which the two main characters are both teenagers.  We begin with two young boys as they play in the snow at a local park.  Their friend, Billy, is more focused on the snow.  Billy can barely walk or stand up and can only speak in the second person.  They do manage to make out and laugh together, but Billy has to get up at a certain time every morning.  This is the only thing keeping Billy and his friend, Davey from getting into trouble.  For those who have forgotten the story by Paul Newman and Martin Sheen in The Last Picture Show, when Billy falls in love with a girl while he is being chased by a killer cat, his dad tries to stop him from leaving the girl, but is shot dead by Billy's friend, Pete.  After the murder, Pete uses the cat to get revenge on the two boys by killing Billy's teacher and his father.   Pete has a new pet cat, a red panda named Rufio.  These boys are just about to be set free when the cat kills Pete.   When the boys are on their way to school, Pete comes back and kills the boys.   Billy's father gets the police involved when the kids tell his story to them.  I love the theme of how it's impossible to escape from your past, but always has a way to escape.  With the theme, it's a great movie to start the summer.  It's a fantastic movie and the fact that it only has seven running minutes makes it even better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a wonderful, unique, fun, and funny movie. It is not to be missed.  There is a lot of action and a lot to remember.  I thought I knew all the rules of time travel.   I mean I had a pretty good idea what the time period was, but still I had to learn a whole lot of time traveling stuff.  The way the movie plays out is not at all what I thought I'd see.  It is an unusual time travel story, but not all strange times.    A boy and his dog, they travel through time! It is like some guy has a time machine for a dog and a girl, and if you get out of that time machine the dog will die and the girl will live in a different time!  If the dog does die it is because the girl went back to the future and found out that the dog never went back!   When the time traveler (not the girl, not sure who) goes back to a previous date, the dog has a different future, so he dies (because time travels faster, I guess.)  When they come back to present day they learn that the time machine was a fraud and they must return to the period in which the dog died.  That is what we follow, through time, the girl and the dog, and eventually the dog gets his way.  You will learn a lot about time travel as a result of this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this one a few times in the theater, and every time I go to the next one, I will see it again. The story is the same as the previous one, but even the dialogue is still funny as hell and the characters all have a good time in a nice movie! (I've never seen such a good and witty movie on TV) I must say that if there was an extra dollar in my pocket, I would buy the movie again. (I'm kidding you) And of course, it comes with a copy of the movie in English. I recommend it to everyone.  Rated 1 out of 5 by JohnP from Terrible! I was so disgusted, I just about threw it off the screen. Not even an hour later, I was watching it again and got the feeling I'd just watched it three times. Terrible, terrible film. I'm really surprised Fox didn't have to pay the studio a little bit more, because this was a very bad picture!  The Movie Blurbs
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've heard nothing but good things about this film.  First off it is directed by Joe Dante a veteran in the art of suspense.    And he does a great job of building the tension between the leads.  In addition to the stellar cast there are some excellent performances from the little girl and the old man and their interaction is really creepy.  This is a perfect Halloween movie to watch in the fall.  What I enjoyed about this movie was that it did not rely on shock factor.  It kept its suspense to the point of creepy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little apprehensive about giving this one a "D" due to the fact that I don't think it is really that bad. I'm not a big fan of the "Hollywood" style and this movie, while not terrible, does feel a little repetitive at times. But that, my friends is a problem that can be easily fixed by adding some good music to the soundtrack. While this movie is not one of the best (or rather one of its worst) I did like it a lot. It did give me a few laughs along the way and I have not seen anything quite like it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------ The first half of the movie was about the two of them going back to the city where they belong, where they are loved and respected and where they don't have to feel that the only way to get a decent paycheck is to be a pimp. So I expected something of the "fifty shades of grey" that is so popular. Instead, I thought the film was the best of its kind that I've seen, and I was surprised by a lot of things. The cinematography was really great, the performances were all great, and the script was even better than the film, and that's saying a lot because I always had to laugh a lot. It's really a shame that the "real" story was so badly handled because the second half is pretty great. If only Hollywood would keep going down this path, we would finally get a movie that feels like a movie - and we would actually get to see some real human characters. I'll let you read the movie yourself to see if it is as good as the first half, but I'm quite positive that it's worth at least one viewing. It gets a 5 out of 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The only way to tell the story is from the point of view of the people involved. The film tells the story from the eyes of the main character. He is a young man. His life was not very easy. He was always looked down by the whole society for his oddness and strange behavior, and had to wear a mask to hide the truth. What he did not know was that a masked man was the cause of his problems. The mask was the symbol that was supposed to cover his face from all the strange behavior of the society. One night he was on his way home after an argument with his parents. He had to change a lightbulb from the wrong end, when he saw a masked stranger. That man was a man dressed like a woman wearing a mask. He told him that this would solve his problem. So he went home and bought that mask and got on a taxi. As soon as the taxi had started, this man got out and followed him. As it happened this man had a gun. When they reached his home he had two masked men who had guns. They opened fire and killed him. His mother then ran out of the house, and they started shooting people down. He tried to flee, but the masked men shot and killed her. His brother and brother-in-law tried to help, but they too were killed. All that time his mother was begging him to help her. She was the only one left to live in that horrible family. The story then becomes clear. This man, who has lived all his life in a terrible family, started this act to help the only ones left to him, his own mother, and his own family. It was not a good way to die, but it was a solution."

They come upon a beautiful waterfall and after a few minutes stop to enjoy the view. The three friends decide they need to get away from the cold weather and decide to stop at a restaurant called "Rabbit Hole" and take a dip in the beautiful waterfall. The girls are having fun and one of them decides to get the boys to do the same. Unfortunately they find the waterfall is too cold so they return to the car and wait for the cold to cool off. The boys take another dip but it's too cold to even think about enjoying it anymore so they leave their towel on the table. When they get back to the hotel they find their towel gone so they decide to check the sink and find the towel on top. They start thinking about what they saw and the boys think the girls have been a naughty girl. They decide to clean the dishes and they notice that the girls are a bit naughty and decide they'll take one more chance to get a little dirty. They go to get their clothes and the girls begin to give them a good washing. They discover that it takes about ten seconds to get clean so they think they might enjoy a little more dirty than they usually do. They begin to clean and the next thing they know it's spring and they get a big surprise. The waterfall is still frozen over and they realize that they are still in the country. When the girls realize they can't go back to their hotel they decide they have to have a little fun first. One of the girls gets the boys all undressed while they enjoy themselves. They then decide to get naked as well and each time the girls give them the same dirty feeling. The more they give them, the harder they get until they decide the best way to make it stop is to take off their tops. Once they've done that the two guys decide they had enough and they decide that they're going to have some fun with the girls and make sure they go back down to their room to go to bed so they can get a good night's sleep. Unfortunately the girls know that one of the guys has been seeing them but they decide against reporting them so they will be able to go home to their parents feeling good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a solid remake of the classic film of the same name. The original was about a group of teenagers in the Bronx when they decide to run away from home. As they leave their home, they encounter an old man who looks exactly like the father they never had. The old man lives on a farm in a small town. A couple of the kids try to sneak away in the woods on an adventure. The story wasn't much different than the old "Hoosiers" movie, except that a little bit more detail was added to make it seem authentic. The animation in this film was very accurate. The characters looked just like the actual kids we all know and love. This film was a fun retelling of an old story with new additions.   Fun Facts:
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* 'The King of Comedy' is a superb comedy that should appeal to those who find that the best comedy comedies are the most interesting. I was amazed at all the ways the filmmakers had of using every possible comedy trick, from the slapstick to the slapdash. They take us around a fictional small town and make us laugh so hard that you begin to wish you were in that small town, and then, they make you wish you could go to all the comic shows. They were so clever in the way they used the different aspects of comic comedy, that it would be almost impossible to see this movie the same way twice. There are times when it just becomes impossible to take it any more than you do. Then they show us the bad guy, the very bad guy at that, as being both more wicked than his bad act, and more vicious than anyone else in the entire picture. It is a really good movie. I can't recommend this movie enough.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a wonderful movie. A very well-done story about a man who has to take a big risk to take his friend who is about to be killed by his girlfriend. I like the idea of a "dynamic duo" like that. And yes, this is the first one in a trilogy, so I like that it didn't have "The Return of the King" in the end, which is probably a bad idea for a trilogy. But it is worth watching it anyway. I think it's good for all of us. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a bit weird. I like movies that don't really seem like they're trying to be a thriller but instead just make an entertaining and funny movie, which is precisely what this movie is. I love the way it mixes the horror elements with comedy, with a few creepy moments. I really enjoyed the humor, it was very creative. There's definitely a lot to love about this film, it's fun and well produced. My rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! This is a great movie. I just recently saw it and I had a great time doing it. The writing and acting are wonderful. The movie starts out kinda cheesy but in the end is a wonderful film. Its good that a kid from Ohio is now a famous author...
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a terrific thriller about a beautiful high school student who is being stalked by a sadistic and sociopathic teacher. He is trying to learn martial arts, and she has a fetish for sadistic karate that is out of control. We also get to see a very violent scene in which two guys beat up a homeless man in broad daylight.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has a fantastic script that has been updated to today and has been given new life by the fact that you do not hear much of the old and more importantly how the world was back in the 1950s. It's a good old film with a very good director and it really captures the times.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â My only problem with this movie is that it is too long. Â The final act was just really boring.  I like the concept, so I could see why it was a big hit. ÃƒÃ Â Â It had a great soundtrack by Peter Gabriel, so this really should be a classic for people who like slow dance music and classical music.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There have been a few films in the past twenty years that could easily have made the list, but there is a reason this one was selected - it is a true masterpiece.  The whole film was shot with such precision and craftsmanship, that it could be considered the best documentary about a legendary athlete of its time,  Charles Barkley.  One of the many things that make Barkley so wonderful to watch is his love of the game, his sense of humor, and his infectious personality.  He is just such a wonderful human being and a great competitor.  With his constant and sometimes almost relentless need for the ball, one can only admire his dedication to the game.  Barkley is a great example of a person with a huge drive and a strong will to achieve the impossible - playing at the highest level for as long as he did.  His life and his stories are remarkable and will appeal to all sports fans.  After I watched his playing career and his retirement I hope that Barkley lives on in some way, perhaps in a documentary or a television show - his story is a fascinating one and should be known by everyone.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My girlfriend and I have been together for about 4 years now and we have been taking it slow, but we are finally ready for a real wedding.  We're a big fan of The Great Gatsby and as my girlfriend had always wished, we went back and forth with the plot and as we got further into the movie, it became more and more a mystery, but that just makes us think of another day and the time we had together. The Great Great Grosse  is as good as a classic movie should be.    - This movie has to be seen before you are old.  - You cannot not love Daisy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   C'mon and go see it   What the hell happened?    Did the writers decide that the audience would get no satisfaction in the way they tell it? It was a great movie about an abandoned boy who's supposed to run away to the countryside from some people who have taken pity on him but the film took an unexpected turn and ended up making a mockery of the whole thing. Why did a boy get separated from his parents during an attack by a strange man? Why didn't the boy go back home to his father? And why is he running away from the men who killed his father (with a gun and with the boy in the middle of it) and even the man's own family? When is the boy gonna find a job so he can find a new home? Did the writer write the script just to make money? I mean, there's a boy in a farm who's supposedly supposed to go on a journey to the mountains to find a place to live for himself and his mother. There was a village full of people who were afraid of the old man in a tree who used to kill anyone who came near and the men that he used to kidnap and keep. The village men were trying to hunt down and kill the old tree and the old person in the tree with a rope but the tree always managed to find him and stop the men from hurting him. It seemed like the writer thought about the idea for some time. It was quite funny but there was very little development in the plot. The whole thing was just funny. It made me chuckle at times but there wasn't anything else that happened and even didn't give me much of a sense of the story and its message. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think you really have to be a huge James Bond fan to enjoy this one. It features Bond and a certain M (played by Sean Connery), in a rather pointless sequence that is more about the movie's own conventions than the film itself. Sean Conney was still a bit off when playing a Bond villain. The rest of the cast didn't do much to enhance their presence and the overall plot is rather dull. I'm not going to watch it again but for the money, it was a fine enough movie with a bit of wit and a few amusing moments.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great film.  I've always liked westerns and always enjoyed the films that made up the Golden Era of American cinema.   The good guys were good in the old west and in the 1950s the bad guys were evil and the good guys got on the good side of society and in one case saved the entire west.  It has a lot of violence and sexual innuendo and a story that has a great ending which is a lot to hope for.  "Heaven, this is Heaven!"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know what else I could say except that this is a good, entertaining action movie. In this particular incarnation of Spider-Man, our hero has been in over his head since the departure of his best pal Harry Osborn and has been dealing with his own personal issues as well. He's had a pretty rough year (to put it lightly) so far, having lost Aunt May to the Oscorp Labs accident, had his marriage torn apart, and is now back with the wall crawler who is doing the same. I didn't want to like this movie too much, it's not so much a superhero movie as it is a comedy, as Spider-man shows his wacky side and his various super human abilities. His alter ego is an annoying little guy, always getting into trouble and then running off at the second the danger is over, but he's so much fun to watch. This movie has a lot of funny moments, especially the scene where Spider- man gets kicked out of a hotel and immediately takes off running. I also laughed at a few of the Spider-men actions, most notably his fight with the police officer. He can be a bit cheesy at times, but it's good to see a guy who wears a costume with a lot more imagination than a costume made of wires and webs. One of the funniest parts for me was watching Peter's aunt being arrested, the costume not even being a bit funny with the lines that were delivered. It seems this movie is trying to be more of a "family friendly" movie. It isn't. It's an entertaining film, and a very funny one.

When we got together she made me see The Shining. It was a great experience and I loved that story. Well this one was just as good as The Shining! A good story about two girls who decide to get a new dog. A great ending to the movie!! The camera is moving very well. I like the little kids who get together and talk and do funny things. I thought it was good. It wasn't that long of a movie so I guess it could be taken in a more relaxing way than it was. I would have given it 5 stars but they messed up the ending. The movie had a great ending, but they put a bad ending on it! It should be a real happy ending!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first started getting involved with the comic, I felt that they were trying to do a "classic" with the first movie. They made it look like a classic. I'm not sure if I would like that sort of movie very much, but I would be willing to watch it again. I think a good version of this movie is something like "Caddyshack" or the "Ghostbusters".

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is what I've come to expect out of those who have made horror films. A young woman is having a party with her friends, when a weird shadow appears from behind them. After a brief conversation the shadows disappear, leaving the woman alone. The woman finds she has a gift for healing that can be used to give someone else a good night's sleep. She uses the shadow to help get the party started and goes about her business, not noticing that a shadow is following her. When she wakes up she finds a note from a mysterious person on her shoulder that she's never received before. The next day the woman discovers she is being held captive by some strange creatures. The people are really friendly, though it makes the girl wonder if all humans are good. When the girl is forced to help the other captives escape, she discovers she has more than she bargained for. The monster in question is not that nice and it's not going to be easy to get it to stop its attempts to kidnap people.   I liked the creature. I had a feeling at first that she was something from the Lovecraftian vein, that it was some kind of ghoul/demon or something. The creature is clearly a product of the mind of one of the characters. After she leaves the party the person's mind has a different idea and she decides to get out of there in any way she can. The film is not really about the creature but the woman's mind.   the other creatures are a little much to swallow at first but after a few moments the story makes its way to a good ending. The shadow was the main character in this. The idea is simple but to a degree more than most creatures. It's just too bad it's in a monster movie, not a horror.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A nice story about a guy who lives alone (in a big house), and goes to a school for the blind.   It tells a lot about the social difficulties the blind people face.  It reminds you a little bit of the classic Disney movie "The Emperor's New Clothes". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun movie. The movie is funny and it is not a mindless comedy with nothing going on. This movie is full of adventure and the best part is the movie that I am surprised about is that in the middle of the movie when they go to the cave the lead actor is playing a little boy, and at the end when the little boy is back at home (not in a cave though) the lead girl comes in and tries to talk to him, and the lead is playing with a little toy and the little toy breaks, and she is angry, she tries to get hold of the toy and it breaks again, and when she is finally able to get ahold of the doll the doll turns into a man and when the boy picks it up the man is not the man from the movie, he is not wearing shoes but a pair of sandals, the boy and his mother go back to where the cave is but there is nothing to see, there is no little boy there, and he does not come out of the cave either.  This movie seems to be made by a very good director because he is able to add a few funny moments to the movie. And the movie is entertaining. This is a good film to watch if you want to see the lead male actor in a very bad looking beard.

It's a small film about a guy who takes his son to a haunted house to scare it away, but it's a ghost story.  But it's not scary, instead it's funny.   There is a bit of music which is annoying at some times but I'm willing to make that up to make it better.  Overall a good film which has a nice little atmosphere, it's quite a fun movie to watch and I enjoyed it quite a bit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to see this in the cinema with a friend who loves westerns so he wanted to see the big western with John Wayne and the big cast. I got a ticket without any reservations which I've never done before. I saw it first of all in a smallish cinema in the heart of downtown Auckland. I loved it! This is a beautiful film. It has that kind of feel of old-style westerns of the 50s with a lot of humour. But you don't need to take my word for it. You can see for yourself for free by checking out this film on Google. But I also recommend that you sit through the documentary on the making of the film because it really shows what went on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A small town girl named Lisa (Kathryn Bigelow, "The Hurt Locker") starts her new school year at her old high school where a local gangster (John Travolta, "Crash") and a local teen (Mia Farrow, "Scent of a Woman") are on the loose. As Lisa struggles to learn her new world, she makes friends with the local "lady of the woods" named Karen (Shelley Duvall, "Annie Hall"), whose family had run the "Beverly Hills Ranch", a brothel where young women were sold into prostitution. Soon she will discover that her schoolmates, including the "Ladies of the Woods" were sold at an early age, and a whole world of secrets awaits her there. A good film and a nice comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing is, I like the idea of a group of baddies from hell who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals; it's a fairly effective set up that keeps you on the edge of your seat and on edge throughout. However, the film ultimately suffers because the script, directing, casting and direction can't seem to find a happy medium. There's one point in the film where all five leads appear on a train and all four of them go for a walk. While the train is moving it looks so beautiful and the four baddies all seem content to wander about in the scenery; in reality the scenery is just the scenery, and the two baddies seem to be bored, restless, and bored with the scenery. This is probably a story about an evil, evil train, but the train just looks very ordinary and the characters just look like the type of evil people that you can expect to meet in a train.   It's not the acting that's the problem here, it's not that the leads aren't capable of delivering a solid performance, it seems the script just isn't able to produce a compelling script because the three actors in this film can barely muster up a decent performance and the film is reduced to a collection of random, pointless set pieces.  It's a fun and inventive movie to watch, but ultimately it feels like nothing more than a big fat excuse for a bunch of guys in a room to be in a bunchof different poses.  I'll probably come back to it some other time; I like it as a film, it looks like fun, and I'll definitely be watching it again one day, but I can't recommend it to anyone who is already a fan of horror. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie when I was in high school as a teenager. I remember thinking this was some really funny stuff.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film that is very realistic in its approach to the subject of slavery, and this realism is best captured by the story of a young white girl of the Underground Railroad who must make a run for it to freedom. She runs off at the first sign of trouble, but does not get far, and is captured. A brave young white boy with a big heart, she makes it a great experience.   Another great film and movie that I recommend is The Birth of a Nation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We meet our good pal Mr. Esterbrook and her dog, Ett, as they're walking up the street. Ett starts to bark at the two of them and says that they "don't go anywhere". Mr. and Mrs. Estersbrook are so offended by this statement that they pull out guns and shoot the dog at point blank range. The dog is dead on the spot. The film is all about the two young people, who do seem to have a lot of problems, and are at the end of their rope. Etta loves her dog and wants Ett to love her more, so she is trying to set up a nice little puppy mill. She is a very pretty girl and it seems like no one will love her or be attracted to her.  Mr. Eesterbrook, a very handsome man with dark hair and a big smile, also has problems with love. He wants his wife back, he does not like Mr. W. and has to keep him a secret from Mr. S. as well. Mr. & Mrs Estersbury both had a child, a son, named Peter. Mr Esterbrookes wife, Mrs Esterberg is very sick and she is in the hospital.  It seems that things just happen to these two kids, and for the most part they seem to handle things with aplomb and they seem like they really love one another.  I loved the movie but it does have a few flaws.   It seems like the film did not have as much care as it needed to with the characters. I mean at the beginning of the movie you see Peter and Etta sitting at home in bed, but the film doesn't linger on that for long.  It also has some problems with not using a lot, if any of the actors to make the best use of the screen.  The film has a long scene in the theater in which the two kids meet the director, Mr. L. We only get a few minutes of that.  There were also some characters who don't appear in the film that are shown very briefly and not brought up again.  This is a good time for kids to sit down and relax and enjoy a good story.  What's more is that it is a comedy so you don't get the sense that the two characters are hopelessly doomed to failure and destruction. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great story. I loved this movie even though I knew nothing about the characters except they were on a boat.

I like the premise, but this movie isn't very impressive. It would have been so much better if it were a full movie like " The Devil's Backbone " or " Devil's Knot ". This movie is overrated.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (April 17, 2014) There are many things to love about this film, but at the top of my list is the fact that it took the "ticking time bomb" (a term coined by author John Grisham) that was The Silence Of The Lambs and turned it into a heartwarming, tearjerking, laugh-out-loud comedy. That is not a spoiler by any means, it actually begins with the killer in his lair (in a house in the mountains!) waiting for a call from a very special agent. The story follows the agents adventures while they try to figure out a way to bring the killer and his victims to justice. It takes a while for the story to progress, and a lot of things that don't go according to plan occur. One thing I always loved about this movie was how the killer was so smart and ruthless, and that the FBI agent played by Anthony Hopkins actually had a little fun on the job. It is funny how the FBI can't catch the serial killer without the assistance of the local sheriff's deputy. He is so good that you feel like you are rooting for him. The acting by the cast was very good, but I felt like it could have been done better, especially the Sheriff. This movie would have benefited from the addition of a few more killer scenes with the Sheriff and the FBI. Overall, it is a great movie, and one that I have rewatched several times. I recommend this movie, but if you don't like thrillers, stay away from this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the fact that so many actors from Hollywood are in a movie is wonderful. This movie is funny and a good time. You need to be out of the house and to have your mind working if you are going to laugh at this movie. So if you don't like comedy then you won't like it. I liked the movie a lot!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not a lot of depth to this movie, but you get all the basic components: a good set-piece, a man on the run, and a chase.  And it works perfectly.   The movie opens with a man running away, but he's not very good at running.  He has this habit of falling over and losing his balance.  Eventually, the policeman catches up to him, and he tries to tell her where he's been.   She says that she hasn't seen him.  She has no idea where he has gone.   They get a chase going through the streets.  At one point in the chase, the cop's gun misses his head by a bit, and she gets annoyed.  The next shot we see him running across a river.  A little later in the movie, his gun stops working and the cop takes off with him. A few minutes later, the man is in a building, and the cops are chasing him down the stairs.  I'm sure that if he had a gun, this would be a different movie.  But the cop is right.  This guy is going to go into the mountains to live his life the way he always wanted to.  For a change, it's not the old man running, but a young, beautiful girl with an incredible voice, who is the one who saves him.    As far as a great chase movie goes, this one does it quite well.   When the bad guy is about to catch the poor guy, the girl saves him just in the nick of time.  They don't have a ton of dialog at the beginning of the movie. But then, they come back and start with a long set piece with lots of little shots to keep the audience intrigued.  Some shots are quite funny.   "I just ran up the stairs and ran back down again," is a typical line.  "That's what a running man looks like when he wants to do something other than sit and think," is another.  And finally, as the chase ends, we see the girl and the man kiss.   I guess it's a little too short, but it certainly got the job done. If you want to go for something more than a chase movie, then this movie is worth a watch.   There's a strong female lead, and great dialog.  The movie has plenty of action.  It's a very pretty movie

The acting was great, particularly the role of the "young" girl in the movie. The movie is pretty good, although some of the scenes could have been cut up a bit. The only real negative is some of her scenes seem a little forced, and I know the story was written before, but that is still a little odd to me. I guess some people might like the short version of the story, but I would like to see a little bit more of it."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen this movie maybe two times, and I enjoyed it every time I saw it.  This is a classic from the '50s and it is definitely one of my all time favorites!  It is one of those movies that you really get to love!  I really liked this movie, I think a lot of the fans of the genre can really relate to this.    It does deal with murder and I'm not really sure why but I just love the way it is portrayed.  My favorite part is the "Rapture" part where it tells the story of how Jesus (played by the amazing Steve Martin) is killed and resurrected and becomes Jesus with a white beard and hair and a white robe.  My absolute favorite thing about this movie is how close Steve Martin comes to giving a bad performance, it really is just perfect!   This is not a bad movie, it has its flaws but it is a well done movie that definitely has me rewatching it more and more.  I do hope it gets made again and I would love to see Martin (again) play this role.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What else could you ask for in a good action movie?   I think that The Raid   has everything that you can want in a movie. The action is amazing and there are some pretty intense scenes. One of the main character(the leader of the band) is played by Paul Greengrass who has really great roles in his past films. The scenes that really moved me were those between the men as they try to take out the main villain.   This was the best action movie of the summer and the movie never lets you forget about that fact.  A fun action movie with amazing movie magic and an awesome soundtrack.  It really makes me look forward to the future.     1 star is too low for a movie that is so good at what it does.

Â Â It does a great job of setting up a comedy that I've never seen before.  It doesn't just have a funny character, it has a likable character.      But it doesn't do comedy, it does something that I haven't seen before, the use of a love triangle.   As the first two women who enter the restaurant they're given a very bad reputation, I was hoping they wouldn't get to talk to any other woman after that.  The film then jumps to a third woman who enters and is instantly in the same situation as the second two.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am really pleased to say I found a really good movie at the Cinerama Dome in Oakland in February of last year.  The movie was called "Death Row Stories," a very good film.    I am not much of a death row worker, I know, I hate them.   Death Row is a place where it is possible for one to kill you.  The film is about six of the most notorious prisoners, all the way down to death row number three, who were sentenced to death for their part in the murder of two policemen.  The film features an excellent performance from Al Pacino as John Mahoney.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A funny, entertaining, well done film about a family man and his little daughter who have a disagreement that gets them separated. What a way to start the weekend.... A man and a daughter who get separated from a family weekend in the mountains are forced to seek their own refuge on the streets. I was a bit disappointed when this came out as it took some great ideas from the likes of David Lynch and was more like a comedy with lots of slapstick humor and lots of character development. However, the comedy of the film comes from the father's and wife's differing perspectives and the way they work things out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun movie about a teenage girl who moves to the countryside with her uncle to get away from her horrible stepfather. I'm not a fan of stories where an orphan is taken in by a rich family but I can't say I dislike this one as it has a lot of fun and even shows a hint of subtle humour when things get serious. The characters are a bit dull but the plot is good, and it's a movie you can just watch on it's own. (review written by a teenage boy)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is brilliant, with a lot of twists and a perfect balance between comedy and drama.  And it's a little disturbing.   In fact, it's too disturbing to watch.  There's one scene where a woman is about to be raped, but it's cut short when the rapist grabs the guy's penis and says he's going to "get me some."   It's as though he doesn't even know how to rape.  I could not believe that people in this world, in this time, could laugh so much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never read the original Star Wars novels.  However, I was a huge fan of the films and wanted to see them as soon as they were released.  The film came out a few days ago and so far I am loving it!    There is plenty of humor, great action and even a couple of nice lines of dialogue.   I think you would enjoy it too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked this movie! It was a great story. The main hero had a bit more depth to his personality (and was definitely more interesting than the 'puppy dog'). There is one scene when the dog tries to kill the man and the guy gets angry. The guy takes the dog to jail. But then... he takes the little bastard to school. It made me laugh out loud.   I will definitely watch it again!!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An action drama with a twist that is not your average action.  Bryce Dallas Howard is back as the titular character.    He's in a coma after a plane crash.    The doctors think it will never be the same again, but a man named Joe Smith (played by Paul Walker) appears.  He is a brilliant engineer, and his plans to create the jet engine that would lift his girlfriend, and all his friends and family, out of the plane is just that.  With his brother, and the engineer/bomber known as "The Butcher" also on hand, the team must keep the team from being blown to smithereens.  It was all a very well-written movie.  But as I mentioned, it's more of an action movie than a comedy.  I just wish that they had included a good laugh here and there.  This isn't a comedy, it is an epic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To the horror lovers of the world, this is a real treat for all you cine-heads out there. It is like something straight out of a sci-fi movie, with all the technology and weaponry available at your disposal. As for the story, that would not really matter since it is not about a war of the worlds and there are no aliens, but about a man named Sam (who, in spite of his name, has a very good personality) who is a bounty hunter, a job he got by getting in the way of people who would have killed him years ago. And his job is to bring back the bad guys who have been killed by law enforcement, and this is exactly what he does. And this movie makes you like the Bounty Hunter he is, who is very sarcastic and has a funny way of talking. The scenes where he is tracking and hunting criminals are some of the best in recent films. It gives a real thrill to see the criminals run, and it is awesome to see a gun in his hand. If you like action, and want to see it in all its glory, this movie will definitely get you excited about watching even more.  I have never seen such a beautiful film: The film's cinematography is so good. I really had to see this film because if I didn't, I would have left this review as a simple 3 stars. When I got to the screen, I knew I had to do the only thing I could do in such a situation and that was to sit back and enjoy. I have never wanted to see another film so much. The acting is amazing, I cannot stop crying after every scene. The music is so beautiful, so very beautiful. I feel that I really am in the movie. I don't like films where the main character is in love with a villain, but this one does a fabulous job at showing the love between the two main characters. You don't see much of the villains, but I feel I really saw them, and I have to say, I found the character of the bounty hunter very appealing and entertaining to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'll Be There" is a very unique and creative story. It is very much a film about the way that people talk to themselves; it is about what people think about themselves. It's a story about a group of friends in an upscale neighborhood who, while out of town for a holiday, meet a girl who says she has cancer and who, at the time, would never be able to do anything useful. Her life is turned upside down by the fact that the one person who really understands her, her boyfriend-turned-mentor, is the one who diagnosed her. The film also has a lot of comedy. The movie is fun to watch - very funny. I had never heard of it when I first saw it at the B.O.B. (which means it was a very good movie), and, even after years, I'm still trying to decide if I liked it more than "Crazy". I guess you'd have to see it to really know what I mean. "I'll be there" is one of those films that seems to take a while for people to become convinced of the quality and humor of it. There is a scene in particular which is very funny, and it's where I felt I really understood it well.  The film ends fairly happily, but with a real sense of hope, a sense that people are willing to help one another. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an excellent movie and very funny, and is about a boy and his big sister, they are called Dina (Lena Headey) and Dopey (Mark Hapka) and their father. The father is an ex-cop and hates his daughter for not being smart enough, because she doesn't go to school and doesn't get A's. He is the father of his daughter and he has the biggest problem in the world: Dopebo. Dopeh is the little boy, he is not too smart, so his dad wants him to go to the big bad school (called Hogwarts) so he can help him (and teach him), which he does, until one day Dope meets the Boy Who Lived, and he is the best thing to have ever happened to him. The movie was made in 2005, about 11 years before Harry Potter (which was released in the UK in 1996).  The movie was very well written, very funny and very entertaining.  In fact I loved it so much I am trying to find out if there are any more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was excited to see The Great Wall and, honestly, I was not disappointed. It was just a good action film with a nice story.   This was the first Hong Kong movie that I have seen in a while. It's really good.  I hope the third film (I'll wait until the next year for it) will be better.  This review is based off the "Rotten" rating system, a film review site for rotten movies.  Rotten is a movie that has been called an art house movie, but I would say that it's more of a "classical" movie.  The movie takes place in China, it is the 1980's and it's the Ming Dynasty and there are people who are very afraid to fight. When one of these people is called in to fight, he decides to go on a journey.  While going through his journey, he meets a woman (the wife of one of the main characters). The man is not a martial artist but he fights and goes on a quest to learn martial arts.  It's a very old classic and it has a very good story with a twist at the end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie reminds me a lot of the "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" movies. A bunch of guys live on a ship (their planet) and go on an adventure. It's about an old man who comes back from a trip to visit his son. He lives on the ship with all his friends. Then, he finds out his son has been murdered. The old man and his friends try to find out who killed his son but find out it was a member of a secret society of "Empresses" that was in charge of the ship. So, the ship's captain sets out to rescue this "Eleanor" from the government so that he can set the ship on a new path. The plot itself was really interesting. I would have liked more from a plot perspective. There were a lot that seemed forced. The story line itself seemed really silly and rushed. The movie doesn't even start properly till the middle of the second act. And, it goes on at a pretty fast pace. It might seem slow at first but it really didn't take all that long to get there. But, I would like to say, the characters were very well done. They were likable and interesting and I would really like to see them in a movie or series of their own. And yes, I did like the "secret society" the captain went up against. So yeah, this movie was enjoyable. But it had flaws. The film was very bad but I was still enjoying it as I watched it. It was very entertaining all the way.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Black Swan is a movie about a great scientist with a gift of prophecy who is asked to help a group of scientists with a problem: finding a mysterious black cuckoo bird.  But the scientists are all madly in love and are mad to give the black cucky away so their wives can continue to live in blissful ignorance.  In one of my favorite movies, this is one of the better and more funny parts.   The actors are very good and make you laugh and love the crazy science and their antics.  There are plenty of clever gags here, and I especially like the guy with the hat that gets the wrong answer most often.  I think this is the most clever movie about science. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We need a female movie hero, just as we need a male protagonist and villain.  Just like a man and a woman are supposed to be good and bad, so is a woman and a man are supposed  to be good in their different ways.   The story is about a young woman (Lena) who lives in a small village by the sea.  Her father has died years ago and her family is suffering from poverty.    One day a young couple who are well-off come to her village to invite her to an important family wedding.  Lena is fascinated by the man who offers her a job as his wife's secretary.  When the wedding is delayed by a storm she is forced to stay at home and look after the young girl.  She thinks that she has married a rich man, but he has hidden his real wealth in the cellar, a gold toothbrush and a gold necklace.   At a party in the village her life is ruined by the discovery of a gold ring in a bottle.  On a subsequent visit to the city Lena becomes attracted to a man she sees through the window.  The affair is ended when her family catches her wearing gold on her hands and face.   Lena has no money to buy food or clothing and the only consolation is that she feels guilty when she eats a sweet she brings home with her.  One night, when Lena's husband returns home drunk she makes a desperate attempt to escape. But she is trapped by her own hands and feet and dragged into the river.  As she struggles desperately to free herself she is dragged into a trap.   When Lena reaches the end of the tunnel she finds her husband and daughter dead in the water.   In an effort to save herself she grabs a golden chain from a fallen tree.  Then she goes into the tunnel and is captured by a gang of river pirates.  It appears that a ship is preparing to sail over to her and they will give her a ship to fly it to the ship she has seen.   The movie ends with a message on a map that reads " The ocean of love awaits you."   It is difficult to see where the message is coming from.  I think it is all nonsense and a joke.  So you can imagine that there is a plot and a moral as well as the usual comedy elements.  What you do get in the movie is a lot of humour and some pretty well
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is not the greatest film I ever saw, and I like to give it a good review. I watched this movie in 1988 on a small screen. It was very low budget and the film had great acting from a number of good actors. It did have a few problems I noticed in the end. One was a scene where a child had a very bad accident, and she was paralyzed from the chest down. The movie didn't want to cut to her after she was out of the wheelchair for a while, but rather she was left outside the house. As I watched the scene I thought to myself, "why is that scene left out? If the child was in bed, it would have made the scene less painful. Second it would show that the boy had learned to play hockey by seeing this accident, instead of it being left out. The end was just about as poor as the rest of the movie, but the film made me love the story a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â I know a lot of people are upset by this, and not so many people seem to be able to appreciate the movie for the fantastic story and character development. I'm not saying it's bad, it's a very, very good movie, and a great way to start off this new season of Game of Thrones. I'll put it bluntly, if you like medieval fantasy, you need to watch this movie. If you liked season 1 and 2, you will like this, too. I think it is safe to say that I would recommend all people who like medieval fiction to watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't get to play video games enough to really know what a video game movie is about, or even what a movie really is.  But a video-game movie?  One can see a movie about video-games.  It's one of those things that you see in movies about movies:  it's a little bit funny, a little bits violent, a bit cynical, but mostly there's an atmosphere.   This film is no different.  I like these kind of movies that don't have too much action, or too many crazy things to happen (the way a video games movie should), but it's still entertaining.  A story of the most ordinary man in a small town.  Written and directed by Tom Fontana, this movie is a very good film, and in my opinion should be in more people's collection.  The story is about a man who has a dream, who would die, and who would be reborn, who was to die, but was reborn.  His name is Tom Fontan, he has a girlfriend (the girl in the first movie), and he works as a car mechanic.  At the beginning he seems to be normal, but as the film starts to take place you begin to question, is this guy a psycho or is there more to him than we thought?  A strange movie, a great film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After reading many books on UFOs and aliens, I read this one on a suggestion from a friend and had a great time! It is not too long but does a great job of explaining all the details about the flying saucer craft, the military, and the government agencies involved. I was in high school in the 1980's so I know a lot about the war in which we fought in a couple of movies that I could have watched. The government is very concerned about all these flying saucers and what they might be doing. The whole story seems too plausible to be real to me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Girl from Ipanema  is a fine movie. It shows what a world of fine art cinema is. The set design and costumes are very nice. The film takes place in the year of 1913 and features the beautiful Andraste, a beautiful young girl from a wealthy family. Her father gives her a scholarship for her and her sister to be art students at the prestigious Academie Royale in Paris. The family is not rich and the money does not mean much to Andrasante. She does not have many boyfriends in the movie and she is often seen in the salon with her friends and other girls.    One day while she is playing in the garden she runs into a boy and falls in love. She marries him and he is a young aristocrat with a lot of money. He wants a little piece of her fortune and has become her best friend. They share many nights together. When their father dies in a freak accident in the summer of 1913, the young Andraticse leaves Paris and returns to her country house in the countryside. Her friends are not happy that she has left them for so long and they want her back.   The film has a few short scenes of Andraspes playing in a musical hall. The music is simple with just one song that is performed by the piano and strings. However, this doesn't hamper the film. The picture is a beauty that will stay with you for some time. The director, Francois Truffaut, is a genius. His camera movement is very fluid. The cinematography is brilliant and the color is stunning.    The only thing that gets old is the music. When I first started watching this film I had to listen to it at least once every ten minutes. The first scene was done in black and white and the second scene was in color. There were scenes that were done in color and scenes that had black and whites added on. Then there are sequences that were in black, white, and color. This is not something to do to an art film and it is a great shame that the color was added. It is a pity that there are only two colors in the whole film. I am no film buff and if I were given a time machine to come back I would only spend one day in 1913 so I could take it back. This would be the first thing I would watch and think "wow that looks pretty great." It is the only thing

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did like this one a lot because we don't see the good guys like we did in "I'll Be Back" much. Also the fact that one of our best loved actors is in it, he's got a lot of great lines about the show.  Cinema, or at least a lot better than that, is dead.       Cincy Reunion A bunch of friends come back for an impromptu reunion.  In one of the more surreal scenes, a young guy in a costume with a gun shoots two women to death (one of them's an old lady). After being arrested for the murders and convicted, the man is visited by a judge who says he was the killer and tells him to kill his lawyer. A mysterious stranger tells the guy to "go ahead". The judge then says "He's not my lawyer". At the same time, the old woman that was shot is found dead on the sidewalk.  And then we find out that the two women that were shot are the two daughters of a very wealthy man who's an artist and has done a lot for the city, and they have never known that their father was involved in such a terrible murder.  The woman in the mask is actually a killer for hire and she says she's going to kill one of her clients for "making her cry" (a really nice euphemism). After a while, we see the guy's lawyer and his old lady walking through the streets. A guy dressed as a cop stops them to tell them that they can't get their photo taken with the old lady. At one point, when the old guy's wife is on the phone to an "investigator" we cut to a shot of the old man sitting in a park, waiting to die. This scene is really powerful, it gives a very sad and poetic message about the "good" guys being outplayed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The greatest of the bunch: a great movie from one of the greats. The great actor, Jack O'Connell, is brilliant as the film's villain. All I can say is that Jack is not only a terrific actor but he is a superb villain. Great music from the film, great set pieces and a brilliant score by the great Carl Perkins. I highly recommend this movie to the family movies fan. It is a great show.  This movie is a perfect comedy: funny, funny, and funny. The scenes where the villains and villains are introduced are the best. It's funny that the title character (the bad guy) was invented for the film and not as a result of a real person. I don't believe Jack Oedion could have come up with any idea for a character more perfect than this. I didn't feel like any of the characters had been created for comedic effect other than the villain himself, the other characters could have been described as stereotypical and some of the villains are so over the top that they are actually funny. You laugh out loud every time one of them comes out and you are glad they are out because they could not possibly have been real. The film is a comedy with a bit of a dark undertone that is quite effective. It just fits the theme, theme, and theme right on. It was a great idea and really well executed. I can't believe that this was made in 1939, I can barely believe that it is being shown to our generation at a theater. I am sure there will be a good number of people who didn't like it at the time because it is so darn funny. I guess that's why it still has such an audience. I will try to talk a little bit about the film but it is best just to watch the movie and see it for yourself. If you like movies about people who hate each other and have to fight for survival, you will enjoy this. If not, don't worry about it because you have the great Jack O edion to laugh at you. Someday I'll have some good popcorn, popcorn, and more popcorn. I was expecting to like this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a story of the death of a very good man. A very good and likable man. There were a few stories about him in the newspaper and on the screen before but this is one of them. A movie in a very strong and interesting style.  The movie opens in the year of 1916. The German army has attacked England and the English army is at the end of its tether. A young German officer named Friedrich Von Schreckenberg is leading his men towards the British lines in a small town in Wales. After a few weeks of heavy fighting the British forces win the day. They then set fire to the town as a form of reprisal. Friedrich is then given one of the small town girls to carry in her arms. Soon she is shot through the heart by an enemy soldier. Friedrich's comrades take her to a local hospital where they give her blood and try to save her life. They succeed in saving her. Her condition improves but she dies. It is the first death in the war. Friedrich finds out that the girl's family is very rich and it turns out that this is where he comes from as well. It turns out to be a false home story and Friedrich is actually a German prisoner of war that had been imprisoned at Gallipoli. But he does not have much time to mourn as he is soon shot and sent back to England. This is the end for von Schreckenburg in a way. He is sent to a new prison where he is kept by a very cruel warder. Friedrich quickly decides to make a break for freedom and escape to France and back to Germany. He meets a friend and they make their way together to a French resistance camp. But Friedrich's fellow prisoners are also not very cooperative. One of them gets very angry and tries to kill the prisoner. It looks like a death sentence but Friedrich manages to escape. He finally makes his way back to Wales where he meets the British soldier that killed his wife. The soldier is a very nice man. He helps him take over the house of a dead German soldier's family, give it to his wife and give her a pension. The film ends with a very sad and sad scene where Friedrich is very sick, very old. He cannot walk at all. He only can talk. The last scene where he talks to his daughter was very moving and very moving.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------------------- I don't know how to explain this movie. I've been listening to it in the car the last few days while working a real life project, and it got me thinking, to think of all the projects where you spend a week with someone and have a couple of hours of fun. I'm not an artist, but I do do art (in a very small way) and this movie is really fun. The writing in the movie is a little cheesy, but so is most of the other movies I've seen lately. It's a good time, and not too expensive for the average moviegoer. If I were to see this one again, I'd pick out the most interesting character in the group, which is the black man, and then have a little more fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Bryan Mills is a brilliant, funny and good-looking man with a big appetite and a lot of free time on his hands. He is also a former detective, having retired at the age of thirty and having been very successful as a private investigator.   One day, he is visiting his old boss, the former Detective Inspector George Mavromatis, who is being transferred to a new position in the London Metropolitan Police, but has to leave again when a woman's body is found in a car accident in the city. Mills begins to investigate the case, but finds that the police are only interested in covering it up. After Mills meets some of the surviving witnesses and witnesses to the crime, he begins to suspect a conspiracy between some politicians and the police. Mavronis is also suspicious of Mills and his work, and after some unpleasant encounters with him, Mills gets in a very bad accident.  , a film about a police inspector and his son, has been praised by the press as one of the most intriguing, interesting and fun films ever made. Based on a real event and with some very well-executed special effects (which are probably the best in recent films), the film was released in the early part of the last decade of the 20th century. The film was made by British writer and director Michael Powell (who is still active and a director), who, like some of his predecessors, did not shy away from showing the horrors of war, but at the same time, he wanted to show the beauty of nature and human beings as well. The story focuses on the adventures of young inspector Mills, his son Nicholas and their friends, as they go off to a seaside resort for the summer. Unfortunately for all them, Nicholas has a serious and unfortunate problem, with his nose; he gets a bad sniffer. This gets the attention of the inspector, who then decides to take him to see a doctor, in order to get the problem fixed. When Mills learns of the accident that happened to him, his father tries to convince him to continue with the work of the investigation, but he is against it. As he doesn't want to leave the investigation completely, Mills agrees to help his father in the investigation.The investigation, however, turns out to be more than Mills expected. There are many murders, kidnappings, murders, murders of police officers and a few kidnappings of prostitutes. There is also quite a bit of violence as well, which

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Mambo and the Little Monkey  is one of the finest of all the Chinese movies. In a movie that consists of a series of short stories and an entire episode that is about a man who is being pursued by the authorities because of the illegal possession of a monkey, this is quite a movie indeed.  I love the whole idea behind this movie, I mean even in modern times a monkey can cause the authorities to chase you with their cars and dogs, but that's just one part of it.  The film is a wonderful mixture of humor and drama with an occasional joke here and there, but it's the story and the characters that are the highlight of this movie.  This is a movie about an old master who is dying and wishes for the monkey he has had for a lifetime to return to him, but the monkey turns out to be an evil being who has become immortal.  As the master prepares to die, the monkey is given the choice to either go back to the old master or to become the god of the earth.   One of the best Chinese movies ever:   It's an action-packed and very funny movie and a great little movie for all of us who like a good laugh and a movie with a monkey who is not just funny, but is actually a very likable character. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is probably the only movie from this period that I was actually a bit sad to end. I mean, I like a good story and an interesting setting, so what's the big deal. Anyway, I think the movie is quite good as a fantasy with a somewhat familiar setting. There is a lot of romance in it, but it is very light and I am sure that a lot would have been cut out if it had been made more explicit. I don't mean that there are no explicit sex scenes or nothing, just not as explicit as it could be. There are lots of funny moments though.   Recommended for fans of this period, but perhaps not for those who don't like the lighter side of the genre.      What you'll probably like:  A few of the older ladies are having fun and talking about old times.  What I didn't like: As soon as the story gets a little serious it quickly gets boring and it is all about the men in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't think the ending was as good as a lot of the reviewers had given it credit for, but it did have its moments to stand out among the others. I thought it worked much better than the earlier and better "Karate Kid" and that it had more energy.   For me it's not too bad at all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic action film about a man who lives on the fringes of society and fights to protect his daughter.   I don't want to spoil too much, but this is a movie about a little girl and her mother and is all about protecting her.  One of the most underrated action films of the year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie in the same vein as 'The Sixth Sense' which I loved is a movie like a dream: the story is simple enough: the husband is dying of cancer, he tries to hide it from his family and friends so that he can be with his wife. He does not want anyone to know about his illness and he wants his family to not believe his dying wish; so he leaves them and does not return until he dies. However, the story ends with the husband's wife giving her all to love him. In the end I felt really happy when I had to say goodbye to him. It was a film that touched my heart and left me feeling sad. It is a must see and a great movie. I would recommend that one to every lover of heart-breaking films.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------- *The film has an excellent sense of time and setting. The film opens with a flashback to a period of history in Europe during the late 1600's in which a young French priest, Jacques, a native of Lorraine, becomes obsessed with the idea of becoming a Jesuit and is sent to study in Rome, where he makes a remarkable impression upon the then-pope Clement VII. While studying at the Vatican, the young priest becomes the object of interest to both a young nobleman, the duke de Poitiers, and his daughter, the beautiful and intelligent Princess Anna of the Netherlands, who was a favorite of Clement VII's. After Anna marries Jacques, however, a scandal unfolds, and Jacques is forced to flee. He is caught up in a power struggle between Louis XI and Ferdinand VII (Louis XI had married Anna's cousin, Marie Louisa, making them cousins) in the Netherlands. The two French nobles and a group of soldiers attempt to take over Holland, but their attempts are thwarted by the King of Spain, who sends an army into Holland to reclaim his Netherlands from France. As a result, the film moves forward in time, so that we witness a period in history that would have transpired in the early 1700s. It is well-chosen for a time of war, with a general sense of disarray and disorder in the realm, both in France and Germany. The French, who now were under the domination of England, were still being ruled by the nobility of France as they had been under the rule of the Bourbons. This, of course, is a period that is relevant to the time of the film and does have a few things about it that a movie based on the events of that time may not contain. As for the character of Jacques and the events around him, they are well-written, with the film not wasting any time in getting to the story and showing us why he is trying to leave the Netherlands and become a Jesuit, and in doing so, the viewer can understand the reasons why the Duke of Poitier is such a villain. The portrayal of the French nobles is also well-done, with both characters being interesting and full of inner struggle about their own position in the feudal system. This brings about an interesting juxtaposition to the events surrounding the French plot. It makes sense why, as a result of the events, the Duke's wife, Marie de Guise, makes it her life's mission to convince the

I was a little disappointed because I thought it was set for a more humorous ending.  This is definitely a unique show.  I enjoyed the characters.   I loved how the characters were different but still had the same personality.  What made it even better was seeing some of the other characters when I heard it on the radio.  Very interesting.    I will definitely be watching more episodes.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________.  This is a good short story, very well written, that has its place.  I would have liked to see more of the characters that didn't seem to show up much, although they did appear a few times.   A couple of things kept me from giving it a higher rating, one is the ending, which, although pretty good, was not entirely satisfying.  Another was the fact that the writer had a way of showing that the person doing the killing doesn't care about who gets killed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's funny when a group of teenagers in high school learn of a treasure buried deep underground. They go to this treasure which is a very good movie (it's the first movie that I ever saw that wasn't a sci-fi movie or a martial arts movie). The story is about a treasure digger who goes into the treasure with his buddies. The treasure isn't that important at the beginning, but soon becomes a life changing event. At the first few minutes there is a scene where the treasure diggers are all naked. Then some other scene that I wasn't fond of (but you would think it's something that would be funny if you aren't used to seeing nude scenes at movies). This movie doesn't really have a plot. It's just a few funny scenes, one about getting into the cave so you can explore it in a nude way (not that there's a nude digger in the movie, but it's not something that is common), but it all comes down to one last scene.   The movie ends with the treasure having been found and now the diggers must go to the treasure to recover the gold (you might remember from the plot above). They decide to dig a hole and to let the gold pour out. It looks like the gold is very heavy and is too heavy for the digger (mysterious man in red). I wasn a little confused by the character of the "mysterical man in green" at the end. There weren't any scenes to confuse me though. The voice work for the movie is excellent. The whole movie really looks great and has a funny story with a very funny ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed the movie quite a lot. I enjoyed how it was a mix between old and modern ideas. A lot of the movie feels like something that could be a remake of something by Steven Spielberg. The scenes were really well written and well filmed. The script had lots of humor, romance and a great villain. The only problem I had with this movie was its length. The movie felt like a short movie at times. But in the end it was well worth the watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Lebowski is one of the few movies that can be called a Western, a satire of greed and corruption that is funny and moving at the same time.  It is really a great movie, but it is not easy to get the movie to a "fun-to-watch" level.  I saw the movie about 15 times, the longest being 3:36:55 -     I got bored of watching it.    This movie is more for comedy fans than it is for people who just like watching Westerns.  Some people say it has some depth to it, but not to me, I find it a bit simplistic.  I would say it is best for the kids, but I would probably watch it again for a bit of a laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The third installment of the popular series is a decent action thriller with decent character development and a good story which is worth watching. A lot of action sequences in this movie are impressive.   A few more characters would have been interesting.  Also, it would have helped a little if there was more detail on the nature of the characters.  In fact, the characters are not very interesting to watch in this film.  A more interesting story with better character development is still to come.  The story is about a team of mercenaries who is hired to take down a terrorist leader. What the characters do in the film is somewhat interesting. A few of them are not so much fun to watch and their motivation and actions are not as thought provoking as most of the other characters. The director of the movie has done a good job at making it interesting and entertaining.  This is one of the best action films ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ ______________ "The Man Who Loved Women" is one of the great romances to come out of the silent era. The hero, the man with the dream, is just as important as the heroine in this movie. But who is this man? He comes to our hero's home one day and tells him, that he has seen the devil himself, and he wants to have sex with him, not only to prove his courage but also to prove he is a devil himself. There is a great deal of sex in the movie, all of it consensual, a great lot of it very sensual, and the climax of the movie comes during the very end of the third act. It is a very strange scene, in which a very beautiful young girl, who has just finished her first day at work, has a sexual encounter with a man dressed in black, who is her co-worker. She is in her underwear and in her bed, and as the man enters the room she begins to scream, and she looks at her husband in horror and fear. I thought that the scene was quite interesting and very well done, and it was very surprising to see a woman having sex with a black man. I do not know if the scene will be considered in the film history, since it would not be on a screen to appear as a surprise. The scene is probably considered to be a great success by the movie makers, but to most people this would be an erotic horror movie, rather than a rom-com about a handsome but lonely man. That is not the case, though. It does not matter in my mind whether a film is considered a horror movie or a comedy, and what this film is about is a fantastic story. It was written for silent film by Robert W. Chambers, and many actors and actresses appeared in the picture. I think that all the movie's characters were well portrayed; however, I did not like any of them, and some of them I don't even remember, and their personalities all seem ridiculous to me. The film is not very good. I had never seen a movie like it before, and I had no idea what to think. When I finished watching it, I had only one thought: It was a bad film. But even if I disliked it for that reason, I do like it very much, because it was a very exciting film, and very exciting films, at that time, were not common, and this one,
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know a lot of good action flicks, so this one was very welcome! The plot is great, I love the concept of a supercop named Red. He's got a very hot secretary who he treats like the Queen, as she is.    When a young woman who is a good runner falls into his way to steal a case, he has to team up with the woman and a super-spy in order to capture the thief.  The special effects are very good, but I wish they used the same ones used in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, since the action sequences are much quicker!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this film because I feel like I was a kid again, watching it for the first time in many years.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  W.E.B. Du Bois'  The Souls of Black Folk is an important piece in the broader black literature canon, and one of the rare black authors to have a major role in making black writers seem like more than token characters in America's mainstream literature.  But that's a long way of saying that Du Boisse's  accounts aren't just valuable as a historical document of black experience, but as a work of literature itself.  W. E. B. Du Bois (Library of Congress) Du Boisen is a man from Chicago in the second half of the 19th century, a member of the Democratic Party who made a fortune as a cotton grower. He was a radical in terms of his politics--opposed slavery and the Ku Klux Klan, supported suffrage, and was strongly pro-union and pro-democracy.  When the United States entered World War I, Du Boiss was an active member of his local Union Camp, which fought for the rights of the black working class and poor whites.  Du Boizen had a personal problem with the war, however:  The war was no less a curse than a blessing, a blessing because the black man, the red man, and the white man were all fighting together...  I have never understood why black people were not willing to accept a peace which would give us more than a half-million of our best men; because war had only increased, not diminished, our misery and ignorance.   This is a book about Du Boisson's experience as a black man in a white America, but I am not sure I'd call it a biography in the sense that Du Boren is Du Boisel, the historical Du Boisin.

Tom Hanks as the director is the one to know.  It is well written and not too long. One thing that stands out is that it had an American in it. That I can't imagine it was ever made any other way. The film is a wonderful tribute to all the actors in the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. I was so thrilled to get this movie. I have been wanting to see a sequel to this film for some time now. It was fun and a good story. And you can tell that the author did not try to make a big budget movie with some actors that were "staged." As I have said, it is an excellent movie that will be a good "starter" film for many young actors who are coming through the acting circuit. The actors work very well together. This is also a film that the older audience, those who remember the original can enjoy too. It's a little dark at times with a little gore, but it's also a very "grown-up" movie. For those in the middle of their lives, this film might just be just what the doctor ordered. A fun movie. The title of this film, "Farewell, My Lovely", really is good, as well. It would make a great movie title. I think that is the name of an old song by a young girl. The last line of the movie, "But if we're not together, we'll always be apart. Oh, but I'll tell you a story about you, and about our love. Farewell, my beautiful. Fare thee well.", is very beautiful and poignant. I am also very sad that the actor who plays "Cordelia" did not last the entire movie. But it is a good thing that the movie was good. I highly recommend the film to those in need of a movie, a good and mature one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was the first film from the director of Amelie (a beautiful but also disturbing movie which I watched with great interest). It was also his first film with his wife, the girl-next-door whom he was so fascinated with in his first movie. The film also had a strong effect on both actors. It was made under an assumed name but the name was clearly recognizable. It also had many of the characteristics which are familiar to every director of the "Cabaret" era (the late 40's-early 60's) such as: - The "heroes" who are always in the right place at the right time, always ready to help, always with a smile, always very attractive - The songs which often were "so sad" at the beginning but then later were very romantic. - A very bad guy who seems to be very much "the bad guy" but then can show his true "evil" side when there is an opening and the only thing left to do is to use the "bad guy" as a mask for his own motives (or, worse yet, for his "loyalty" to his friends) and to give the audience as many "reasons" as possible (but no solutions).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had the pleasure of watching this film when I was about 12, and I watched it several times on VHS. The first time I saw it, the plot was pretty simple. The characters were all children, all of whom had a special power. The power being that they all fly when no one is around them. This is not a very good movie, but it does have it's moments. The main character, Jodi is very sweet and very innocent. Her brother Joe is a bit more of a delinquent, but then again he is a teenager. The rest of the characters are not as pretty as Jodi, but they are all very friendly. I was never a fan of the bad guys, though there are a couple, but I never got a real good feel of them.   The bad guys just get involved and do nothing of any real importance, but that is what bad guys do. Overall the movie is not great, but just a nice little romp with a good cast and a lot of humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen two movies made by M.R. Cronenberg, The Brood and Videodrome. I have not seen Videodrame but I have been told that it was very good, and I can say this without reservation. Cronenburg is an actor whose movies I am usually unable to forget, but he is great this time. In Videodrom, he is playing a bad guy, a monster that has come to town. He has two arms that have been fused together, with an appendage extending from one. What the appendage is, I don't know. He also has a giant ball on the back. I think I am going to have to go see this movie again. I have a feeling I might be in for one hell of a ride.   I had a pretty bad time watching Cronenberg's films in general, with most of his films being very slow, and pretty bland. I thought his second film, Videodram, was really good, but I was really disappointed. I mean I really enjoyed it, but it just didn't wow me. Cronberg still gets pretty much every accolade he can get for his films though, so maybe I'm just not an extreme fan of his work.  My review of Videodrama: The Broody Man is based off of this review by Chris H: Video game adaptations are the worst. Videodrum is a great game, in fact, it's one of the best video games ever made. However, it is horribly translated into film. It has a unique and fantastic character, a fantastic plot, and a great music score. Unfortunately, Cronenberg completely loses any sense of humor or satire he once had in this movie. There is no humor or wit to be found here. This is a story about a guy whose girlfriend is possessed by a Broodyman. He runs away with his girlfriend to a secluded shack in the woods, where they meet a group of other possessed people. They go on a bender, which leads to a gunfight that ends when the possessed girl kills the Broody man. The Broodies seem to be the only thing to scare the people who inhabit these woods. The people in the cabin are afraid of the Broodies. All of the characters are so incredibly stupid that it's hilarious to see them being terrified by them. This movie is a horror film no matter what Cronenberg chooses to do with it. It's like having a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie. I liked the character and the scenes. The best part of this movie are all the little character interactions. It is just really well done. I found the dialogues funny. The characters were pretty interesting.   What do I like? The characters. It was so interesting to see how the kids come to terms with a different life. The parents don't care about the kids life. It's just another routine day at school. They want their lives back. The kids don't like it. It has them thinking about all the things they have lost over the years. It made me laugh.   "The last time I met a monkey, he called me "Pamela." So here I am, the monkey, calling it "Theresa," I guess to fit in."   When I look back at my childhood, I never remember having the best friends. They were just my buddies for most of the time. But here, I felt like we had a lot of fun together. I think the kids in this movie were a really good group of kids. I like that kids think it's a good idea to make up with the teacher after a fight between them. It just shows the class that sometimes life doesn't give us what we think it should. I just wish I got to see them grow up. That would have been a lot more fun to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never been much of a fan of John Carradine. He is a talented actor who, on the other hand, has shown little willingness to invest himself in his role and I've seen many a film where the role is played by someone in another league. That being said I like it. This film, about a father/son team who find their own way to save a town from a nuclear disaster is not much different than the films that have come before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the best possible way, David Cronenberg's latest is about a man being torn in two; one half is a good guy from a rich family who takes care of a family of poor, starving relatives and who feels sorry for them all; he is even willing to help them when they've come to beg him. This is a film about how the people's generosity and kindness towards one another really do outweigh the greed and greediness of the wealthy. In the other half, the greedy, rich family member (Cronenberg himself playing both roles) has more money than anyone else on Earth who's ever lived and can do as he pleases and does it in a very uncaring way. There is a scene that really makes this movie. There are some nice car chases, with a car that's going so fast it sounds like you can hear the wind in the trees when it's going past at 50,000 mph; and there are a few good and touching scenes where the poor people seem to have been living like royalty, with luxuries that the wealthy aren't even aware of. It is a great movie about what people do to each other without knowing it.

There is no better music to bring a party together. I like to be with people that know what they are doing. I also like to go to music stores and discover new artists. I have bought a couple of CD's from bands that I like. The Barenakels song "Wanna be Start" is just as good as I remember. The song is very easy to sing along with and it is a great song for the family. I do not get the feeling that the band is trying to sing for a crowd but rather a crowd of themselves. It is a little disappointing to say the least that there are no other songs on the CD. I would like to have known about this CD a little while ago so I could have picked one of the other songs instead of "Wanda Start".  This is an album for any family. No one wants to be alone at their dinner table. This is a CD for a family and a CD that anyone can appreciate. The album contains a mixture of songs that a baby can learn to sing. The tunes are so easy that a toddler can learn them. Some songs will also be appropriate for adults that can sing along. The songs are also suitable for young adults that would like the comfort of a family dinner. All the songs will be a great addition to any family table. There are many fun surprises along the way as well. The CD will be especially popular as a summertime gift. This will make the gift a success. My nephew will receive his CD on a warm July night.

This movie does a wonderful job of creating the right atmosphere for the movie's plot, and while the main character does have a very serious, almost tragic side to him, you can also feel he's enjoying himself.  There is a very good mix of suspense, action, adventure, and comedy throughout the movie.  If you really want to be entertained with the film, then this film is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________. If you're looking for a good comedy, you've found it. If you don't know how good a comedy can be, just sit back, relax, and enjoy this film. The actors really know their roles, and they don't play them too lamely. Also, the story was very well thought out, and the direction was good, the music was great. It was a fun ride, and it was definitely worth watching. I hope to see the sequel soon.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that I'm really glad I saw. The story is very enjoyable, there's a good amount of nudity but nothing too extreme, the storyline is pretty interesting though nothing too interesting at that level, the action is very strong and very well done, the performances are all great, the music is pretty good too. I thought I was going to get a lot of tears out of this but I didn't. It's a very good movie but there isn't much to it besides the nudity and some blood.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is one of the best in its genre. It is fast and full of surprises. I highly recommend it.   It features all the classic characters from the old westerns. The only character that did not make a big impression on me was George, who really only got involved because of the love affair between his wife and his lover.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not quite sure if this is the best film from the '90's. It's definitely better than the other "Boys in the Band" films. What makes this different is that it actually has the boys in the band on the road. I just hope they're not too serious about playing this one, because it's a bit of a mess.   The song selections are alright, but I still feel like the band could have used a drummer that actually knew how to play a guitar.  The acting was very bad as well.  They tried to make the whole thing about the band and it just just felt silly.  I didn't like the music, but this was way too much to handle. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Waking Up is a good action movie about the struggle of a very weak man, and his struggles with a very strong man with a good gun.  In the early minutes, I wondered if the movie was going to be good, because it was, but once the action started it was like nothing else in the history of action films, because all the action was real.  It was one of those movies where you realize that this movie is going to have a special place in the annals of history, because no other action movie ever was like this. For the second time in a row, we see that the hero is the weak one.  The movie was originally a television movie on CBS.   After making it, I had a few meetings with Warner Brothers and finally they said yes.  In the middle of this, I was a little upset because they were not happy with the ending.  To me, that was the worst thing they could have done.  I really liked it after all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While not great, this is a pretty good film. The story is well executed and while it is somewhat cheesy and the actors are not very good there is a lot of potential in this story. It's not the most well-written film but it's not that bad either. There isn't much romance and it is a bit too short. But I guess we don't really see that much because this is not an animated film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is a little slow, but the movie is worth watching as a dark comedy from the olden days. The lead roles are not that important at all and the movie can be enjoyed by anyone.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is in my opinion the funniest movie i saw in my life. It will make you laugh. That's why it was funny. And I loved it. The story is about the love between two brothers and their mother, and her best friend. So many funny parts: the brother gets a tattoo of a girl he sees in the mirror, and then gets arrested for a crime he didn't commit. There is also a love story between the mother and the son. The brother goes to prison and then the son is arrested. Then there is a crazy aunt that will take anyone to court for no reason. The mother and son are separated but eventually marry. I think the movie is full of humor but without going overboard or making it too silly. So please watch and enjoy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "A perfect mix of humor, suspense, and suspense-thrillers, I think the most suspenseful part of this movie was watching the 'Burglar' on the bridge, as he watches the other characters walk by him at a steady pace, the camera never moving and never slowing down. This is one of those rare movies that you wish your friends who are sitting in the back row would turn their heads to the screen to see."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is no way to really describe this movie in a single sentence. It is simply a breathtaking work of genius and I'm a sucker for a great story. The movie is not just a fantasy world but a magical fairy land which also has the possibility to be a real place. The story tells about a little girl who is living in the big town called Munchkugel where she will meet her first true love. The little girl named Lucy who had lived an idyllic life with her family has an accident and falls down to a deep chasm into an eternal sleep in which she was taken to a world where the fairy tales live. Lucy is very curious about this place and decides to find out more about it. She finds a magic broom, a little magic ring which she can use to call her friends and her father who is a very kind person with a kind heart. Lucy wants to know what will happen to her. Lucy has a kind soul and she tries to find her little sister which has died in a tragic accident. In this world, a king wants to marry his daughter to some guy in a castle. Lucy tries to free her own little sister and finally find a way out of this horrible world. This is a great movie from a story with strong characters with a nice fairy-tale atmosphere. In my opinion, it is one of the top fairy-tales out there.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An absolute delight!    It's a great film that has the best writing of the year, including the incredible screenplay and a story line that is a perfect mix of humour and heart.  For those who are new to the film it's very simple and straight forward. ___________________________________________________ This is a very beautiful film about a man who has always felt the need to be better, however is this a case of wishful thinking on his part.  And this is really played out on screen with brilliant performances from the lead actor and a wonderful supporting cast.   The film is a wonderful film to watch,   it is a beautiful film with great story lines and excellent performances from many great actors who I think really bring out the best in each other.  I think the movie is about a real journey of self discovery   and it's a real pity that such a fine film has never got a big release or a big budget.  A film of this caliber and quality should be able to find a place of success and should be released in cinemas everywhere. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you love horror, look no further!  The ending of The Babadook is one of the most horrific scenes I have ever seen.  I'm pretty sure I still have nightmares about it.         And I'll have more to say about this book when I have a chance.  The only real disappointment in the book is the author's use of the trope of the evil, old mother.   It's nothing like the mothers in The Babysitter or The Babies.    While I'm not really one to talk about old women, I do tend to view old people and their children differently and the same can be said for the Babadooks mother.     I like the story and I recommend it to anyone who likes horror or works with children. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed the movie as it started out quite slow and the movie did pick up steam quite quickly however it didn't make me sick for the last half of it.  In fact the last fifteen minutes were quite enjoyable and well worth checking out.       So what do I think?  It's a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie doesn't disappoint in any department.  I was looking forward to watching it again.    The premise and writing is intriguing enough, which is the reason this film works so well.  The acting is all in one.  Michael Fassbender is in a strong performance.  He really plays his role with all his heart.   As you know, he is a great actor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is great film with a story that is interesting, funny, and touching. This movie is really a true life story which depicts how people try to help those in need despite being completely out of money. They try to keep hope in their lives and try to do right for others that are in need.  I really liked how they tried to tell the story with humor and it ended up with a sad ending with the end of the credits.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's really hard to do a film like this with just one actor.  I saw the film when I was very young, but it seemed so much more impressive to me now.    It has been 20 years since I had seen it, so I think it's very well made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - A very strange movie which shows us two characters in the late '40s.   (hide spoiler) I was very sad when this film was finally released but in a very good way - I liked it very much! This movie reminded me of "The Lost World" and other'monster of the month' movies and it was quite eerie and a little slow at times. But hey, if the monsters didn't have that "grin-and-scowl" then it would be a "lost in a time warp" movie. But there was just so much wrong with this movie and it made me feel like a complete idiot. I have never seen a film so badly written. But the good thing about this movie is that it is a mystery, a mystery about how some kind of cult (or was it just some guys in a cave) would kill women who got too close to the altar of some kind, and when the cult finally did it and they found it wasn't such a bad idea after all. Anyway, I am glad I got to see it, it was a very weird, good looking film and I hope I will see this movie again someday.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I love this movie. It has all the hallmarks that made "The Thing" a cult classic, but does it hold up to the original? I didn't understand how it worked or why it worked. I thought it could be another version of that "weird science fiction" film, where everything goes wrong at once. As I sat watching this, I thought, "This movie is a perfect example of why the people who make horror films tend to be terrible." It has everything going for it: A great cast, a great director, a good script, good direction, great monsters. But the way it's constructed just doesn't work. It's just not believable. The monsters and the way they move and the weapons they use don't work as part of a story. They just happen to be in a movie. In this version, the monsters are just part of what seems to be a natural disaster in the middle of nowhere. What the hell is the big red bug doing there? And why is it in the shape of a baby? This is just bad. It just has so little going for a movie that I just don't understand.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was so excited to go to see this movie. I was hoping to see it in the theater in a larger venue because they can be a bit noisy. They have a lot of people coming and going. The only time I really felt alone was when I walked out of the theater. That was one of the only times I really had the creeps. But I like a good creep and I liked this one!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me this movie is a fun adventure into a very imaginative world of dreams.  It's a great example of the good old adventure movie as well as the art of directing a movie. The characters are great, the music and sound effects are great and the story is very good.  The first half of this movie might seem slow, but after that the action starts heating up. It has its comedy moments as well.  There are a few things that should have been cut, but they didn't.   I had a good time with this movie and it's a good introduction to the world of films and movies in general.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  So far my experience with the Star Trek universe, is that it is not as good as it was back in the 1970's. I guess if you have a lot of money to spend it can be a bit pricey, or so I'm told, but even with that, the show does have a number of things going for it, the special effects (they could still make them work at that age!), and some of the dialogues being delivered were pretty good, with plenty of jokes in between them. The new cast members were a mixture of old and new, and all of them were fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fantastic movie for a fantastic year of music and fun. The song "My Generation" was the first time I was actually listening to rap since my teens. I'm a big fan of rap and even if you don't agree it's a good song. As for a film this is a fine example of why hip hop was cool at the time. The movie has that '50s feel to it. The film is not a bad film so don't go out of your way to avoid it. In fact, a quick viewing of it should bring a smile to most kids.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's the year 2010 and the world is in a state of perpetual war. The United States and China have come under attack from an unknown terrorist group. It is now the turn of the United States military to take on the threat. Our heroes are a group of six pilots called the 'Fighter Flier Program' that are tasked with defending our country. The group's mission involves flying the nation's air force to safety. When a plane crash lands on the White House grounds, the group is deployed to protect the President.   The story follows the six pilots as they go about doing their job. They do what needs to be done, but they don't always get it right. The story is set in a time period where the technology has advanced to the point that everything is instantaneous, but nothing is perfect or without issues. The movie has an epic scope. It's a story of the military, how they deal with their duties, and how a president tries to balance the personal and the professional. It doesn't really answer any of the questions, but it does it all.    The film has been out for a while now, and it's definitely an awesome time. A big thanks to the Director, the Writer, and the Cast and Crew of Fighter Pilot's "Fighter Flight". It was a pleasure to watch this movie, and I hope to see more movies like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A film that was truly a masterpiece. I'd say this is the movie that changed my attitude about films and how I relate them to reality. It is a love story, but it is also a journey into the unknown, through the minds of two young people that have a huge passion for a musical and what the world has to offer and what can be found in the hearts of people. For those unfamiliar with the film or the plot line, I'll just say that it follows two different women, both of whom are extremely attractive and intelligent. These two are introduced as the love interests of the lead singer (one of whom is only 15 years old), a young woman named Anna (the first of two names she has, as you will find out). A year after the beginning of the film, the two (for all intents and purposes) meet again, after having separated (in the film we find out that they're actually siblings) for quite some time. Anna is the lead vocalist and has a great voice, but not necessarily the most talented person (though she definitely does have a big voice). A group of guys (I'll get into a little bit more detail later on) come to her school in search for an idol (for this story we are only concerned with one artist and her school) and she gets involved with them. She then decides to work out with her piano teacher for an audition for an acting part, and then goes on her own, auditioning with the school and also for the acting part. Anna has had a difficult time as an artist because of her shy personality and that is a huge factor in her acting abilities (she is able to take her work very seriously and is able and willing to make sure she does her work on time so that she is at her best). There are a couple of bad things going for her. She has a reputation as a singer and this causes some of the guys to think she is just a singing machine. She is also shy and is a great candidate for the school's singer competition. I can't tell you how many times that I saw her being introduced in a group, with the same "Anna" name, because she is so great and that she could sing and act really well and still be shy! That's an extremely rare case that could not have happened to a more "typical" performer. I thought that this would have been a great movie and a fantastic experience if it weren't for that
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "GOD!"   I've tried to think about a movie I've seen for a while but never got to. I think it may have been The Man from Earth, a 1980s movie, or an old one. I've also thought about a recent movie I like, I don't like it as much but I really liked the movie. The Man From Earth. You know what they say, all things must end, and they were all really good.   The story is that a man on the moon is given an assignment to go back in time and help his father out in the 1950s when he needs help getting a piece of metal out of a space ship. So the man from the moon goes back and brings a piece he can't remove to his father to make sure the piece does stay where he wants.   is this movie about time travel? Is it a sci-fi/fantasy movie? No it isn't! Well actually the movie has the time travel as one of its themes, it is just not done well. First off, this movie has lots of time travel! In a movie with this much time travel, it doesn't look like it's very good in the movie because the time does change every time and it does move. So how does that make it any good? That is what I don' feel. So I guess time travel is a major theme or something but it doesn' feel that way to me.   the cast is great. Peter Falk, the hero, does a good job. He is the kind of guy that you want to like you. He just kind of looks like a good father, and it's really hard to hate him. He has some really good scenes in the film, especially in the late 80s (I think it was the late '80s?). I thought the ending of the movie was really cool because I think I remember this being the last movie I ever liked of the late 1980s. So it was cool to see what a movie looks like in the last year of the 1980s, and I thought that is exactly what this movie is. I can't believe this movie even has the name.   And this movie, it's not about aliens or time travel. It's not even about time at all. It doesn't really have a beginning or ending. The movie starts when a robot comes and picks up a piece on the ground that could make the piece fit in the hole
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the kind of movie I love that never fails to get you into a good mood. With a soundtrack that was good enough to carry the film, I found myself smiling to myself. I could see why this one has a cult following. I'm not very familiar with the source material so I'll try and keep it simple. The plot is simple. An older man, named John (I think it was named John at one point) goes down to Florida with a bunch of pals to see some famous singers. John and his friends have a great time together and the guys get to meet a lot of people and experience some awesome things. When all seems well, things take a turn for the worse. There's a fire that is supposed to take out a bunch a trees on the beach and John is there to try and extinguish it. John is a very good fireman but has to let his younger friend do the task. The fire is actually very dangerous and will not take any prisoners as it sets on fire everything in its path. It's kind of a miracle that no one was hurt. So who are the people who are responsible for the fire? Well, it turns out that some local guy, named Ray (you'll know who he is) is making this fire and has a huge stash of fireworks. He claims that he has no idea where the fire came from but he will not be stopped. At the same time we get to know a new friend who seems to be on the verge of a breakdown. He seems to spend more time drinking and smoking than eating and I don't blame him! If you're interested in a good laugh, it's a nice place to start your day.  (1:01am) 1/21/2003: Woke up early to write a report. I guess I've always had the urge to write. I wonder how much time I have left. I don a little sleep today, maybe I should get up early and go to sleep again. The time flies like an arrow when it comes to writing. (2:07am) January 21, 2003: I need to brush my teeth but first let's see how this feels. I'll take my bath and brush my hair. It looks pretty good today so I'm probably going to take a shower too. Today's going to feel pretty normal, I think I'll just enjoy myself a little more before I have to wake up early. Today will be a bit
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the beginning of the movie, I was expecting it to take a different turn, maybe something more serious, but to my surprise it was the same old action/thriller/drama, that was so popular in the 80's. But unlike the more "mature" films of that time, this one was very funny and entertaining. If you're a fan of these films, you'll probably laugh at some of the things in this film, not that I'm an expert in those matters. But it's fun watching a movie with a good cast and a few great performances.

I think they are really bad, that's my main reason for that. But, this is a really good, pretty well made movie. It has its share of humour, as well as the occasional scene that is too dark for my tastes and I never liked the story of that film. However, the actors did their job nicely.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first 10 minutes or so of this film are truly excellent: The camera work is good, the lighting is fine, the costume design is neat, and the story is good and suspenseful.   After the first few minutes the story becomes more of a generic "what is this movie about?".   In the beginning of the film we have a woman who wants to buy a house; it seems her husband doesn't want to sell, and that she can't afford it on her own.  This isn't a bad thing, it just doesn't give us any information about her family, the husband, or the neighborhood: The house is on a hill, the streets are full of bars and small businesses, the neighbors are a bunch of drunkards with a few kids.  The rest of the movie takes place in and around the home: The husband tries to talk with the lady's mother to get her to sell the home, and they have a confrontation. There is a small incident here where some guys try to rob her son, but he is soon captured and taken to the police station.  We soon learn that the mother is a bank-robber, she's taken money from the police, and a few friends of hers.  In another scene she tries to get out of her husband's house so that she could get more money by taking the bank-notes, but a man and a woman show up, and she has to get a gun to protect herself and her kids. Finally there is a huge fight in the house, the police finally arrest her.  Here's where the movie gets interesting: The woman gets her husband arrested for "possession with intent to sell", but the husband is found innocent.  After this there is an investigation, and we learn that he got the money to buy the house from some friends of his, who had also wanted a place to live, but they never moved in, because his friend had been killed. The investigation reveals some important information about the neighborhood, including that the people on the street look very scary:  The movie isn't the greatest, and I wouldn't watch it again; it just hasn't enough detail about the people in the neighborhood and the history of the neighborhood.  My favorite part of the documentary is when the man who gave the movie a bad review (who is clearly a nutter) interviews people who lived in the home during that time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I just wanted to kill myself and die" I had a very hard time deciding whether to pick this up for a good film, and then I decided I should. I watched the first two films in the original trilogy, and I have to say I am really disappointed. The story is just as dull as all three of them are, and while a few things are changed it is hardly enough to make me feel any different. The special effects are also very poor, and there is a bit of nudity but that is really the only difference between the three films. This isn't bad film making, I actually like it. It has all the elements I would look for in a Star Wars film: a great theme music by John Williams, a great story with a fantastic villain, and the most enjoyable special effects I have ever seen in a film. There are two things I cannot stand: the first being the fact that after I got through the first film I had to re-watch the second because the ending is just not good. I have read that after a certain point you really just have to stop thinking for a bit and just enjoy the movie. That would have been perfect because I could have enjoyed it more, but unfortunately it wasn't to be, and since I can't get past the ending I just cannot recommend it. For more great movies visit:

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ A great story about a girl named Ane, who is trying to escape her bad marriage by staying with her father. But her dad won't let her move in to his new house, because he feels that her "momma is dead." But her "daddy" is really the father of the girl who she's staying with, and the movie has a great twist. The story is very well written, with the characters so well realized and such a good chemistry, that they end up becoming a happy family together. The scene where Ane realizes what's really going on in the house when she sees her father getting drunk and her mother lying on the couch with the door open and her husband in his underwear playing video games, with her daughter walking around her like a cat with two heads in a strange house, it just makes me shudder. It's been years since a movie was able to do that. In conclusion, this is a very good movie, that's for sure, I gave it a 9. I hope that it gets the recognition it deserves. It has a strong story, great acting and a very cool ending. If you're a fan of horror, especially giallo films, you must watch this movie. It is a definite must-see. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ This is the best movie about a mother and daughter that I have ever seen. It does something to the viewer's mind that few movies can do. It makes you want to know everything about the girl (and how her mother got rid of her) and the mother. The whole thing is a great story, and with a great ending. This movie has the most interesting ending that I can recall. The movie was shot in Australia, but the cast was very well cast. It was filmed on location with an Australia-shaped budget, and was filmed very well. It had all the elements necessary to make a great film, and is a classic. _______________________________ Watch this movie now!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie with the "buddies". The whole movie was a fun day at the park. I found myself laughing and giggling and having a great time. I am not much of a comedian, but this show made me giggle a lot. It was all very sweet and happy. It is worth a watch.   If you ever need an entertaining movie that is also kind of funny, I highly suggest you go see this. I'm surprised that this movie made the top 100 of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While this is not my most favorite of the three, it is still a terrific film. It has an original story and the humor is very funny. However, if you want to be entertained by the story or laugh at the absurdism then this is the movie for you. As I mentioned before, it contains several surreal sequences which I really like. The plot is not too complicated and the pacing is very good and consistent. If you are looking for a story which is a little bizarre you can't go wrong here.
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- It's just a wonderful story to bring a young lad out of his shell and let him have a good time. It's a very well done story with great acting and a good ending. The best part is the ending! I've only seen the first part, and I can't wait for the rest! - July 29, 2005A very good story  Reviewer: JIM WATSON - favorite favorite favorite - June 26, 2005  Subject: Love this movie My uncle bought the print of the movie back in 1974 and brought it up at my father's funeral. He was always asking what kind of movie this was, it was like a science fiction story. My sister and I spent a lot of time on the set of "Tetro," watching it for the first time. The movie was filmed in the early 70's which is interesting in itself. The sound was great and the story was a great story. The acting is great as well.   My dad did his best to help me understand the movie when I was 9, and it was a joy watching it with him. I have since watched it more than 30 times, and my niece and nephew enjoy it as well too. - June 25, 2005Love this movie  Rated: 4.88 4.89

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My brother and I first watched this movie about two police officers from New York. They were trying to solve a murder, which I think we can all guess how it is resolved. When a young woman runs up to them, asking for help, the police officer who was investigating it is suspicious, because one of the victim's friend's had told him that the boy had said to her that he didn't belong there. One of the detectives was also there and tells them to stay out of the case - and he will do just fine, as the detective is the most amazing person who ever walked on the earth. They investigate some other murders but one of them is solved, which is why they decide to work with the young girl - she is one of those people, who will never let herself be pushed around by any evil man. They are investigating a murder case and a guy calls them, saying that he is the murderer, but he never was, because he is a woman. I think it is funny how a man who is not a woman, who is a man, who wears women's clothes, and who calls himself a "man" gets all the attention, and so on. It all seems too ridiculous at first, but there is a great plot to it, with a great performance by the two male police officers. This is an amazing movie, with great acting, and an amazing plot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The great thing about this film is that you really feel like the heroes were trying to right a wrong. This is not the kind of thing that happens in a movie very often, and you don't really realize at first how much trouble they are in until the end.  I'm not sure who the guy is who is shooting the bad guy with a machine gun in the beginning, but he sure sounds like the baddie in the movie.    I can't believe this is rated R, it is truly wonderful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was a short and sweet movie that had a good message of life.  The story was good, with a short but beautiful story that showed that the world is a much bigger place that we think it is.  And the characters were all good and had good chemistry.  Overall, a good short movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - If you loved the previous movies then this will be an even better movie! - I enjoyed the story and was surprised at the twists and turns.   Hannah, a 16 year old, is a little lost, she is from a poor family with her older sister (a 14 year old) she is the care-free one out of the family. She loves to go out to school but when she comes back home it is a sad sight, her father is always at work and she cannot get her sister (who is now 15) to come to see her. Hannah is always wanting to do more with her life than the simple things a girl should get to do. She tries her best at getting through school but it is nothing more than a farce. She wants to be in the navy one day but her father refuses her. When she meets an old friend on the bridge of the train she realizes she has a better life than before. They talk for hours and she convinces her father that she is ready for the navy, Hannah joins up but she learns a hard lesson in service to her country...

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would have given it a 6/10, but since I watched it on a big screen instead of watching on a small one, it got a little dark after the first 20 minutes or so. I will not be watching the full movie again. If it had been a TV series, it would have been a 6 star review.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A solid movie that is quite enjoyable.    The film is based on a series of novels by David Weber. The movie takes place during the war and centers around a boy named Jack, who works as a courier in Germany. On one of his deliveries he is sent to a very desolate village called Haus. Jack and his mother are taking him back to their farm. His mother falls for his neighbor and the neighbor falls for Jack. After a brief time at school Jack meets the farmer's daughter, who is in love with him. Jack has to deal with a few problems like not being able to read or communicate properly with his mother and the girl. Along the way he meets a German officer and a French officer, who are trying to capture the girl, and the farmer.

This film has a lot going for it and it is very funny at times.  A great action-packed movie with a strong cast and great directing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------- I didn't realize this movie would be as good as it is. It's just that good. I love everything about the film, the music and the actors. It really is worth the watch. I'll never see anything like this again. --------------------------- I loved this movie so much! My favorite actors were Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman. Both are wonderful and they're both so very different. It may seem a bit odd for a movie starring Dustin Hoffman to make up for the fact that the movie revolves around Dustin Hoffman being a man who is not a very good romantic comedy actor. Well the movie is about Dustin Hoffman wanting to make a movie that's a movie about Dustin Hoffs romantic life. It works perfectly. It also makes it a great movie. But at the end it does kind of make you wonder how bad the romantic comedies were, because the movie was so much better than most of the romantic comedy movies. You get the feeling that this is how it's supposed to go. The movie was a lot funnier and funnier as it goes on. It was fun. It even had a good ending. I have never seen anything like it. But I think its the best movie that was made by the Academy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!I have to thank those who have told me that this film is excellent, in particular Mr, Paul M. Smith who gives the most perfect performance, and Mr. Charles Dutton who plays the part of the young officer; I cannot get enough of him, his dialogue is pure gold, the music is great, the cinematography is superb, and the costume, which is very well done, is also a good example of British dress at the time. If you like old movies with romantic and sexy roles, and you like a good bit of sex, this is the film for you. The plot is simple, but the scenes which show the characters are very well shot and the costumes are very interesting. My favorite character is the young man who turns up, and when his heart begins to flutter he soon begins to realise that the world has changed, he is about to become an officer in the police of the Empire of the Sun. When the real war is at hand the man must work harder than any man, but a lot of other men are watching his performance, as do the old ladies and the young ladies, who, to the astonishment of the audience, have been invited to the ball. You must have seen this film at least once in the theatre or on the big screen, and I wonder how you could forget it when watching it again in your own home. It is a true classic of British cinema and I could not recommend this film more highly!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The first few minutes are so exciting. The first scene, the first girl, the scene in the desert where the guy has to walk on a broken arm for three days to get a good shot, to get back his dignity. I was hooked. It is great to see how it is. The second half is more action-packed and more of a fight movie. The third movie, the movie for me is great. This was the last one I saw in Australia. It was a blast, a wonderful time. I hope we see more."
Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************** ******************** A great comedy starring Bob and Dave (the guys who are best friends since elementary school) A wonderful scene in which we see that they're still best friends. They're driving to the beach to kick off their summer vacation and the movie is a nice little slice of life with a funny moment between the two of them on the road. **************************** ***************** ************************* ******* ********************* ******************* ******** ************* ******** ******* ************ ********** ***************  ********************  ***** ********************* The Story:  ******* The two of these guys are just a nice couple of buddies. Dave wants a date but Bob is too busy working as a janitor in his apartment complex. He does try to win the date but it quickly goes sour. One moment Dave is trying to make conversation, the next he pulls out a.357 and shoots one of the other guys. That's it! What could possibly go wrong? It's not like it is the first time this has happened though. When Dave first moves to the apartment complex and gets his job at the building, one of his co-workers was kicked out for getting into a fight with a guy. They had a real good time getting revenge on this guy. It's just a comedy at this point, nothing serious. *********** After Dave has had a beer, he decides to go have a little sex with his girlfriend. This is probably the most boring scene in the movie. As you can see he doesn't have much fun with her, he ends up kissing her at the end. Not too bad, but there's nothing really to talk about in this scene. **** The guys go out one night and meet some friends at the bar. Dave goes out to get a few drinks and when he comes back his friends are still there. The funny part is that Dave is having the time of his life and he is having a good time drinking with the guys and talking to them. Then it goes to the point where it looks like Dave is going to go back to his apartment to drink a beer. Then he's in his car again, driving and he starts to take a turn going into a neighborhood which has a lot of bars. You know how a bad road trip can get really scary or scary for a good guy? But then the movie cuts to the next morning when Dave comes out of his apartment building and he's sitting
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was really impressed with this movie. I really did enjoy it. I've only seen it once, so I may have overrated it a bit. The movie is a good, low budget movie about a guy that lives in a small town that has a lot of problems. There is a small store right next to his house that specializes in strange items. He's got an extra set of hands he calls his 'handies'. When these "hands" get a job to fix a toilet, they go outside to a house with two girls and a little boy (not very old) and he gets an unexpected and strange surprise. So if you want a good old fashioned movie with a little comedy, a little bit of horror, and a bit of romance, then this movie is just for you. It is a fun movie with an even better ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie about a group of high school teens from the south. I like how this movie has a dark look but with a good amount of humor as well. It doesn't look like it's going to be one of those action movies you'd see on TV like " The Fast and the Furious ". It also doesn't try to be overly dramatic like that movie did and the humor is funny as well as it's well shot. I will recommend this to any teen who has ever wanted to be a part of something big. I'm glad I watched this and I plan on watching this again. It's one to look forward to.

There is a nice mix of characters and the characters have personality that makes them a joy to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had been waiting to see the sequel to the great movie, I Saw the Devil (2012), but this new movie is even better than the original. It has great performances, and a dark and disturbing story. The movie is about a small town with a large Christian population, one where there are lots of funerals for the people who have died in the war with Germany. This movie is not an action movie, it is a much more frightening tale about the devil's plans to take over the town. The town is not a nice place to live, so no town would want to have a large population of people who believe in God who believe that the devil is an evil being. The people in town are not all that nice, and are filled with superstitions and evil feelings. The film ends with a nice touch of comedy and even a good musical number, all which I enjoyed.  A great horror movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a decent movie. The main character has a very interesting outlook on life. He loves to play baseball. At one point he was about to have a game. But, after a bad pitch, he got knocked out for the game. I felt sad watching this. It is nice to see a good baseball movie, but sadly, this one is very short. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie! The story is interesting and engaging, and this is a good mix of comedy and drama with a little of romance here and there. The characters are great - not like some of your normal movies I suppose, but they are very likable and believable. The way the story is presented is really intriguing - you are not sure where to go next, but you want to find out. I think it's about 8-10 minutes into the film before you even have a good idea where to start watching it. I didn't go in with an open mind - I knew this is going to be a good film, but I was afraid the story would have something silly or too stupid to stand out. My biggest concern was that I couldn't decide if the characters were going to make a big contribution to the story, and in the end I didn, because the story really is very well done, and although the movie is about a family that is struggling to get through a difficult time, it is a family we all should enjoy. I give it an 8/10.  A movie I watched last week: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film! The film follows the lives of two men and a woman living in a small village in the middle of nowhere. When a man finds a mysterious white ball on a bed in the village, he is able to contact an old friend, a woman named Mimi. She is also a little eccentric, she always wears a white ball around her neck with a little red dot in her eye, the balls always bounce and she has a great singing voice, which she uses during a night-time vigil of a murdered man. She then invites the man over to her house and the two have a nice talk and then the two spend the rest of the night dancing. The story unfolds and Mimi becomes increasingly convinced that the man, who was murdered was a vampire, a monster that only comes out at night. She soon finds out that all the villagers, including her mother, are also convinced that this man is the monster. Unfortunately this man has plans for Mimi and he begins to slowly seduce her and as the film goes on she finds herself falling for this monster who, despite all the evil he did to people, is still kind and gentle.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was the last day of college, and this was the first of the big films that year: It seemed like a great concept at first. It would take place at a university, with only two professors and a new-age hippie as the main characters.   They would meet a girl who had been killed in a car crash; and she wanted to know the meaning of life.  But it is the director who is really behind the movie: he makes this movie a wonderful one and is able to keep it moving easily and without giving us too much time with the two characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is good, no doubt about it. It is also very entertaining to watch, with great music, action and action and more action.  I do wish that it had a bit more to it to make it feel more like a full on action movie but all is well that ends well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie to watch in its entirety is "A Good Year", about a little boy and his dog. It's an interesting family affair and a lot of fun, and there are lots of funny scenes in it. The story is short (1 hour and 25 minutes), but it was made quite long and interesting because of its length. There is some strong language, but not much. There are a lot more interesting scenes than the ones we see in the movie. The movie is not without good actors who did their best, and who are great in their roles. I hope you watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was totally bored with the book, but I liked the movie. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's only a 5 minute movie, but then again, I like my movies short, and in the case of The Wolfman, it was short. The movie was awesome, and a great horror flick with amazing effects. The book was well written, the story has some suspense and some great surprises, I think this movie is great for kids to see as well, there wasn't any blood on my clothes, and I'm not sure if the wolf was really a wolf. This movie had many surprises and was a great experience. If you've never seen The Wolf Man then I would recommend you to watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film. In fact, it is the best of the trilogy. I can't explain the appeal and what is in it all. I liked the character of the hero who was so likable and was always cheerful. When he was not busy with his job, he was playing chess. The two main characters were not very attractive. When they got married I hoped they had a good time. I knew there was more and it was there. As it was said before, it was a bit like "A Christmas Carol". It may have been a bit funny but at no point did I wish for them to get married. It was a good story and I didn't like the bad endings. This film was made in 1940 and it is worth watching. It is a great film with wonderful music. It may not be the best but it is one of the best. I recommend the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie. It makes good use of it's time in that it spends it's first half getting into characters and story and then the latter half going into the action that I love the idea and that all the character have a good time on the way there. I do feel a little short changed on the characters, I felt the two main characters should have both been a bit more developed, like the one of the young girl who is more interesting and the other who is the more experienced guy (if that makes sense). But it was a good ride and that this movie has good action to keep a fan of the genre from getting bored

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is an interesting adaptation of a French short story by Pénélope Heylig. The movie is basically about the French writer Victor Hugo, a very accomplished writer who was called to write a sequel to his famous novel Les Misérables. Victor decides to write it while he is in Paris. Unfortunately, the book was not finished by Victor and he had to start a new one at a different location. The novel Les Miserables is very popular and Victor is very jealous of it because of how successful the book is. When Victor finds out that the new sequel will take the place of the original he decides to take revenge on Louis (Cillian Murphy). Victor decides that Louis' sister will be the next victim. He starts to torture the poor girl and as punishment, her lover (Robert Ryan) agrees to go with Victor to the rendezvous. On the way to the meeting, a bus filled with young people stops before them. They are killed and their brains are sent to Victor's cousin's farm. Victor then proceeds to finish the novel. After that Louis comes back to Paris to a hero's welcome. The whole movie is a great action movie with plenty of stunts and explosions. When you are in a movie theater, you always need to sit a little further from the screen so that the people sitting behind you have room to breathe.  I always sat a little farther than the screen and was able to watch the movie without any problem. Victor's character is very convincing and he keeps his calm until the last minute and then it is all too much. I have seen a few of the films of Guy Ritchie and have always been impressed with the way he films a movie. Even the stunts in this movie look very professional and the acting is wonderful. The actors are mostly the same guys who are in the original and this is a nice touch. I also loved the music. The score was done by David Langford and the way it was performed was quite beautiful. One of the best movie trailers ever produced and that would be true for any movie as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ****************************** I like a good old fashioned Hollywood movie. In fact, I liked this much better than the first one. The original is a fine movie, in my opinion, but this one is much better. It is one of those "what the hell do I see here?" movies, with a very different feel. It's a very serious movie, about a man who is in a coma for almost 4 years, but when he wakes up he is on the set of a movie, with very few of the usual Hollywood extras. This is a very good movie, so watch it if you like.  Kirk Cameron makes a cameo as the director of "The Man From Planet Ten". I'm glad to hear it, I always thought Cameron was a genius, a very talented actor who I look up to. I remember when he played the role of John Harrison in "Star Wars" back in the 70's. I thought that was brilliant. This movie is a great parody of Hollywood. It makes fun of the many things that are in this movie, such as: the old woman who sits in the audience all the time (she's supposed to be a prostitute), the stupid old man (who tries to be funny but never gets any), the poor kid with the long nose and the little girl who gets caught in the act (yes, it's about a little girl getting caught in a little boy's act, with the little boy acting as the camera operator), the very annoying character of the manager (who doesn't realize how silly he sounds), etc. The movie is great. I'd love to see a few more of these kinds of movies. I think the world would be a lot better off.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is simple: A young girl (Sasha Grey) gets married and gives birth to a baby boy.   A few weeks later, the little boy is found dead in the water and there is no one to blame but the girl.  But there is a huge mistake in the little girl's story.  She tells a story to her father (Peter O'Toole) about a man who drowned a girl with a sword in the river and the girl never came back. Her father goes to the river to find the girl and meets his long-lost daughter (Jessica Harper), who is just as lost and scared as he is.  However, after some talk, the daughter comes to her mother's aid and the boy is revived, while the girl becomes pregnant again.  The rest of the movie takes place in the child's new life: the boy's mother (Diane Keaton) tries to raise the child but her husband (Humphrey Bogart) is not willing to give it up.  Meanwhile, the young girl is having adventures and has some really silly adventures.  I was in love with the movie.  It got me laughing every time I watched it.   It was funny.    It had a lot of clever lines.   I loved it.  And it was good!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The movie had many beautiful shots. A few minutes later, a shot was made of the ship, where two men were walking and playing with a big dog."   A true classic, I'm sure, and an example of what can be achieved by a well-done screenplay.   -   The movie is set in the mid 80's, and revolves around a man and his wife living in a small Dutch island. They are poor, a bit sad, but they're not really poor. They've come from a rich family, but their lives don't fit with the rich people in the town.   They're not all that different from any of the villagers, though. They're not especially beautiful, they're all dressed the same, and they spend much more time sitting around talking than they do doing anything. They have two kids, and like the village folk, they don't have very good days, but no one really cares. They enjoy their lives. The only one who doesn't is the rich guy's son, who's always drunk and angry, and he's never really cared for anyone until now. His mother and his sister were the perfect mother and sister. He loves them both dearly, and has always looked up to them. But the man, Jan, has his own issues. He was never going to be a rich guy, because in Holland there aren't very many rich guys. Jan knows that. He works at a small, poor, tourist hotel, just about the only tourist lodge on the island. It's all pretty much the same as it's always been: They drink wine, they play golf, they go to the beach, and it gets pretty lonely there.   of course, the movie was shot in the 70's, so a whole lot of hippy stuff was involved in this one: "He had a moped, a leather jacket, a little green hat and his own moped and a moccasin.".

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In case you haven't heard: In 1997, while sitting in a van with two guys, a couple in love is forced to leave by the FBI. The first three acts are pretty good... but then things start getting a little weird. It starts off with one of those "I've had it" moments. You'd think this would be the perfect place for it to end, and in the beginning it is. There is a lot of really interesting stuff in there to read (even though it's not really a novel), and it's a really good look at one of the strangest cases in the whole history of the FBI, a woman and a guy just hanging around and having fun. However, then you hear the voice of the director saying they've got to leave and it makes you really angry. What makes it really even more annoying is that, since this is the FBI's top priority case right now, all of the other stuff was dropped and this is supposed to be the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was awesome! I don't think it's even fair to call it a family movie. It's a story of a man who has a daughter that is very much like his wife. He tries everything and anything to make her happy but with no luck until one day she tells him to marry her to someone else and she wants a baby. At the same time her husband wants to have a daughter and that's why he runs away. The movie has a great screenplay by Robert B. Weldon. There is something romantic about it as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie! It's one of the best sci-fi films ever made. The movie is very simple yet well put together in it's story line. It is just a straight forward story of a space ship coming from the outer galaxy and crash landing on a planet of a alien race. This alien race is very powerful yet they look human. They think of themselves as human beings and the human race in their eyes are "gods". They want to conquer the universe, but they don't know how to do it. The main character in this movie is called "Cricket". He is a very simple man who's a janitor in a small apartment building in a spaceship. This is where he lives. He is the only one of five people on the spaceship who know how the ship is to function correctly and all the other 5 must live on the ship for the purpose of maintenance and other duties. They are a very kind and very polite alien people who live in peace and harmony. Cricket has no one in his life except his girlfriend, a girl named "Miss Jenny", but she is not interested in cricket. She is a "normal human" and is looking for a boyfriend. Cricket tells her he has no boyfriend but she says he is the best man for her. Cricket meets two strange aliens named "Jenny and Harry" and has some very good adventures. I enjoyed this movie because it's a great example of how to tell a good sci- fi story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A classic film from the early 1960's that showcases the great performance by the leading man in the film; Robert Redford.   From the start of the film we're told that the film is about the love between a man and his wife which has already lasted for 50 years. They are married at a time when "Love is all and all, but one day love is enough to bring a man out of trouble" (as it is said in the opening). So, when it is time to renew their vows, the husband has an idea to surprise his wife and surprise himself by giving her back the dress she had worn to the wedding. He knows she's unhappy, and with her in such a state, there is no point in waiting, so he runs up the stairs and takes his bride on a walk around the park. The couple eventually get to a small river, a place they both knew well, and where it is also where they first fell in love. However, they are not in love with each other any longer, and their plans to run away together are frustrated by the fact that their respective parents are there to watch their actions. The husband tries to seduce his wife by saying that he has forgotten all about her. When his wife finds out that she is pregnant, she does not want to give up the wedding vows again, and she starts to make arrangements to have a midwife at her husband's bedside to help her and give birth to a baby girl.  . I don't really know how to describe this film, besides the fact it is an outstanding film from 1960 that shows us exactly why a film about love is so amazing. For a beginning, the film takes off by introducing our two heroes, John Wayne and Robert Redfield, and how they met. This is done through a short flashback sequence where we get an understanding of the beginning of their relationship, which took place in 1942. This film follows their relationship over the years until they finally got married and had their child. It tells a wonderful story of how an ordinary couple goes through a series of ups and downs, and yet how they eventually come together at the end, and are happy together. This movie is so good that I think that there would not have been a more perfect time in our history to have seen this film. It was such a good time to be born!  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies you watch for pure enjoyment. That means a lot of comedy and silly situations all thrown into one.  As much as I'm not a comedy or comedy fan, I was amused by this movie all the way through.  It is very funny and makes me laugh so hard.  The characters are as stupid as their actions in real life, but with a smile on their face like how kids play with Barbie dolls at the store or the local ice cream parlor.   I liked the cast in this movie as much as they were in the previous one.  I like that they are all funny.  There are also the usual side characters with their own storylines in this and they are a lot funnier and more believable.                      After all of the crazy events that are happening and the constant jokes, The Dictator, and his henchmen try to find out where the best place to go to get drunk.  I won't spoil it for you, but I will say it is a really nice movie with a lot to offer.  You could be watching this movie with the kids around and a few adults if you want to have a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "When you start out as a movie, and you do have a big name attached to it - "Star Wars" - you always have to look at it from one angle and that's from a fan's point of view. I'm not saying this is bad, because it's not. I am just a little bit disappointed in the way it has been presented. The story revolves around a group of young teenagers on a small ranch who become separated by a series of happenings. One of the teenage boys is hit by a car. The parents, who live out of town, decide to take him to the hospital, but when they return home they get the shock of their lives to see that their son has vanished. His bike, his wallet, even his hat - everything has been destroyed. That's a terrible way to end a summer! I mean, there is a little boy who gets taken away from his family for no reason. The mother who has lost her son, now the father, and the father who gets his son back in a few minutes. It's a pretty dramatic ending I don't think any of us would consider "heart breaking", but if you're a fan of the franchise then this movie is probably one for your viewing pleasure! I was a little disappointed at this movie because it doesn't really feel like the Star Wars movies. The whole story is basically told from a "behind the scenes" perspective, and it feels a little out of place. It doesn't feel like a movie that takes place on a set. I don's think it is a movie by one of the directors of the movies and it just sort of appears like it, even though it feels like it. There is some great special effects here and there - especially when there is lots of blood - and it's interesting to see things come to life with little lights and everything, but I wouldn't say this is an important film. It really is just a very good movie that, if you like the films, is a good one to get if you are trying to decide if this is the franchise for you. So I'm going to give this movie an 8.5 out of 10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Halloween is a spooky movie in which one must remain vigilant, as the undead are always lurking about to make the living dreadful.   It is a good story that has its mysteries, as some things about the story are not entirely clear as to what is happening.  The film is filled with lots of good atmosphere that is made to be explored.    (5 out of 5) The only thing I can comment about this is the fact that the movie has been made by a Hollywood Studio with the best effects.  We are watching the movie on a television screen of that has been put on a screen by a remote control that has the ability to show various pictures of different scenes.  For a while the film is shown that the television is showing us a documentary of a scientist that has recently discovered a way to control the minds and actions of zombies.  The scientist who has this method to use his method for his clients is called Dr. Henry Jekyll.  He is a professional and has a firm conviction of the fact, that it will help to control this evil that is roaming around the earth.  When Jekyl and Hyde have a disagreement, he becomes violent towards his partner that has come with him to his laboratory.  A scientist is sent by the corporation, to make sure that the situation is well under control and to make an explanation to the scientist as to why the scientist is behaving so badly.  It is at this point that the zombie begins to attack the research lab that is run by Hyde and Jekly.  They are attacked by several zombies that are attacking them, and some that is actually taken to the doctor for medical treatment to save the company that he works for.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first movie in a long time about the real history of the Holocaust.  And the first one that was made for adults.    It is not a very good film.    But still a movie with some excellent performances and some important historical facts that need to be known.  This film takes place in a Polish village and shows how the Jews lived a better life than the rest of the population.  The film was produced in the late 1940s and early 1950s in what today is the Poland.  The movie covers all phases of the Jews' life:  -- The first few years of the war:  The Germans came to the small village of Katowice, Poland, in the fall of 1939.  In the meantime, the Polish communist authorities had sent an emissary to Berlin who had promised to keep the peace.  They were betrayed by the emissaries and they all went to their deaths.    This emissaire was the Rabbi Zalman Shternbaum, a member of a very important and influential rabbinic family.  He was able to keep his secret by using a secret agent, a Polish Jew named Janusz Korczak, who lived in a village called Ostenie.  Korczac was captured by the Germans and his fate was a little less sad than that of the others.  After a few days of torture and after he tried to kill himself by jumping off the wall (which is what they did to all the Jewish men) his tormentor, one of the SS officers, killed him with a shot to the forehead.  As a result, Januszek escaped and went to his home village of Pieniarka.  Then he was joined by several other Jewish men who stayed in Pieniak. They were able to get work for the Germans as guards.  When the Germans found out that some of the guards were in their power (they knew that several of them had relatives who were Jews) they decided to send them to the concentration camps.  Januszon became a guard at the camp at Sobibor.   At this camp the Jews were housed together in a big barracks.  Although the Germans did not have any problem with them (they lived with the other Jews as Jews) the Jews had no rights to move from one section of the camp to another.  One of the prisoners was shot for being the only Jew in one section. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To the men who read this book, beware: the women in this story are weak in every way, and are only saved by her (somewhat) pure and pure white-white Christian ideals. But we're dealing with a novel with an 1835 setting, not to mention the 1854 setting of the earlier novel The Woman in White. In this 1865 setting, the author did not go about creating a white-skinned Christian "Christian woman" character. The characters are all white. And not in a cute, fluffy kind of way. The author did write up a female character who is somewhat of a "woman in a man's world," who thinks she has her man, and who lives in a world of men who are the most "Christian" of all, who think that they have a God-given right to do everything, even if it is against her will. In this novel, she is raped, but she is also rescued by the man who raped her. That was a great, great, novel -- a novel that the woman in white could write, that women could live as they saw fit, and that they could, indeed, even take part in a political movement. One day, the novel ends. It ends with the "Christian women" in the upper classes taking up the cry for reform, and the Christian men, being the most Christian of all the "Christians" in this novel (and the novel's author), standing by them, as though they were the men in the 1835 world of this novel: they would be the men and they would "do whatever was to the best of their power, to the benefit of the Christian religion, to promote its interests and protect its people." All of it. You know, because they are a bit more Christian than "the men." It is an astonishing book to be honest. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just had to take a long, lazy morning ride down the 405 from Pasadena to LA to see this film...I think it was based on a true story...a truck full of Mexican women, all underaged, were dumped at the side of the road after a long night of drinking. They became the prime suspects when a man and a woman were beaten senseless in a bar in L.A. They were thrown from the vehicle, but miraculously were able to walk the rest of the mile to the hospital with broken bones and the horrible pain of the injuries. I was never much of a fan of horror movies in the first place, but if you can handle this one, you'll have an excellent time. A good action movie with a great character, I would recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â This is a very good movie. A pretty good movie to be sure, but there are a lot of good movies out there. This was a fine movie in my opinion. I gave the movie a 4 star rating. Â It could have been better and I give it a 3 star rating because it could have had more action, but I still think this is a good action movie with a very nice villain. The action scenes are great and the special effects are very good, like the helicopter battle in the beginning. The villains are good and all the other characters are likeable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was a huge disappointment, and so is the novel, but it was the first of a planned four novels, and was based on a television mini-series that I didn't like too much (although, it was interesting), so I guess the novel was more my thing. I did enjoy the TV mini-dramas though, in spite of the TV story being less well done than the book. It's not a bad film. You're a little disappointed with the plot, but there are good parts to it. The story is fun - and has a few unexpected funny moments.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Posted by The Sudden in New Jersey on September 17, 2015: I read a great book in my youth about a girl named Amy. She lived in a small town in upstate New York. She had always thought she was beautiful and loved her looks. But when she first went to high school, she was made fun of because of her "gorgeous" appearance. She did not want to go to school anymore because her boyfriend had been making fun of her and she was embarrassed by her looks and that was all the motivation she needed to leave. She got a job in the mill where she worked with the boys. At first she enjoyed her work because she could have a lot of fun with the kids and the boys she worked alongside. But she soon grew tired of the life and she felt like she should go home. She said she missed her old life and wanted to live it the way she always wanted to. That was about 5 years ago. She was just about to go back to school when the school principal told her that she was to be expelled for getting pregnant. "Why?" she asked. "Because you're a woman and there is no place for you in the boys' club. If I could get rid of you, I would." He said, "It seems to me that you're the one who has gone off the rails." She was stunned. "What kind of twisted logic is that? I don't know what you mean and I don'st care because I'm going to be strong for my child!" Amy told her mother that she could never be a mother and that her mother had always been a single mother and she had always had a family of her own. Her mother had told her it would have to be somebody more respected than her. She could hardly believe what her mother said. Then her mother revealed that she had lost her husband of ten years. That really made Amy realize how badly she had hurt her mother and her life. She started to cry. "I know that was a stupid thing to say," she told her mom, "but I can't go back. It just wouldn't work out." So then she left her job and went back home to live with her mom. But then a man who was a neighbor came over to see the house and she told him where to park his car. The man, who had just turned 70, told her, "You're too young to be a teenage mom but don't you
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~ The movie, which is based on a popular Swedish novel by Egon Schiele, is a great blend of mystery, suspense, love, suspense and suspense. The story is interesting and different, but it does not leave a bad aftertaste that is so common these days. The movie has very vivid images, a well composed sound and a great and emotional conclusion, which I loved. I do not think there can be too much more to add. ~~~~~~~~~~~ I liked the movie very much. It is very much like the Schieles book but with a completely different ending (the book ends with the heroes and heroine walking into a church to be buried and the camera pans out to show it is a forest with a huge tree, this is an important detail and is the only part that differs from the book - but I think this was a small detail that is overlooked, it would not have had the same impact if there was something very different about it). ~~~~~~~~~ The story does not end as a very happy ending (at least, not the first half). It is about a woman who finds a man who is murdered at a very young age and after going back and forth from her own home to try to find him a proper burial (she has no money for a proper grave so she has to go to a gravedigger instead, who is actually a very bad gravedigger, a sadistic bastard who has no sympathy for the poor woman, and his own daughter), she begins a search for him that becomes a search of the whole town. The plot is fascinating, but there is very little suspense about it and the ending is not a very satisfying one. ___________________________________________________________________________ "We are the children of a dying earth. " It is in this line that a film is born and one of the most beautiful images that has ever been seen on the screen and that has stayed with me all the more as it has aged. I remember watching that film in my late teens and feeling like I was seeing something that my father would have loved. It was a time when cinema was still a young art form, and that something about this movie has stayed. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "There are things in this world I know nothing about." It is a line that opens one of cinema's greatest classics, the Godfather Part II, but also that of a great movie, and the words belong to someone who knows a great deal about people, life,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie many times and it is still a great movie. The storyline is interesting and does a great job at showing an alternate reality. The animation is done by the usual masters in the anime. There are times when it looks like you are watching a low quality anime. However, the story is still great, the characters are great. Overall a great show from the same staff and a well animated film.   LOOKS LIKE I FOUND ANOTHER STUFFIE, WHAT CAN I SAY?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The good: The acting is great, and I don't normally like bad acting. It's the acting that works, as the bad guys are mostly good guys. And the villain has a unique, awesome gimmick in that his skin is white and his hair is blond, and he looks like the epitome of evil. I love how well this movie was made. The bad:  This movie has to be seen to be believed. But it is so over the top that I felt as if I was watching a cartoon. I also didn't get the joke that the villains' costume was black, but it's funny anyways.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A few days ago I went to watch "Killer Joe," a movie based on the book by Charles Manson, the infamous serial killer and founder of the Manson Family. I should mention at this point that I really don't like the Manson family, and I don't understand why. I don' t know if there is a reason why I never heard of Charles Manson at a very young age and my parents just kind of ignored his presence and didn't speak to him for a long time. Then there is the fact that some of the people that I had known throughout my life, I was friends with for years, but they never spoke to me about Charles Manson. But there was another person that I have been in contact with for about 20 years, and that is David Berkowitz. He was a friend of Charles's in high school and my brother talked about him often, so he's a person that can't be ignored. But as I said about the Manson thing, I don't understand why his story wasn't told on TV or in the news. I know that when he went on the news about the murders, he was just a mentally retarded kid, so it shouldn't have been a surprise to the public and it is just one more thing that the American public is really sick and sickened by. But to get back to the movie: "KILLER JOE," is an interesting film and I liked it very much. However, a little part of me wants to see more of the rest of the characters in the story. This is a big disappointment for me because at one point, I thought "it could never end" as I thought that they were going to show how Charles and his followers were killed by the police. I thought they were actually going to see the scene where Charles' mother was stabbed by a police officer. I was very disappointed when I found out that there were going take place not in one night but rather the next day. The people in the next movie are going to go out there and murder the people from Charles'family, so as I can see this movie as one of the films that really show the evil in the world, and it shows that the people who are killing for money are no better than the person that killed all the people on the previous night. But, they are not murderers and they are actually just mentally disturbed, but that doesn't mean they are going on the same path as Charles Manson as he is. I really

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film I thought was good until it got really dark.   It's one of those 'you'll know what to expect' type movies.  It was the kind of film that was made to attract children so that when they went out to enjoy themselves, they wouldn't feel embarrassed and scared, but have a great time.  I loved the comedy of the film.  At the start of the movie, the film was set on a beach where a group of children try to find a good place to swim. They all look like they're on their way to the beach, so their leader, a girl called Lotte, says "I would swim right next to the old lady." This is when the girls come across a large monster and they all scream, "We must be in trouble!"  The monster is the reason why the kids are there. He has the ability to steal a child's heart and transform them into a human girl and then they will take care of him. The other monsters were just like this, as they all looked like children that had never been on the beach before. I thought this would be a fun children's film. The film was really good. The monster did not scare me or take away from the fun I had watching it.  After the film finished, I felt like it wasn't a movie made in a bad way. If you're a child and you like children's films, I would recommend this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of my all-time favorites. The film does a great job of using many interesting characters and situations. One of the main characters, Joe, a young gay man (who's not gay!) is forced to join a secret society whose members include several men of the "family", which is the family of women who love each other and are married to men. Joe is in for a rough introduction, especially when his roommate and close friend is killed (he may or may not be a member of the family). But the film makes up for the lack of emotional connection by providing the reader with some wonderful and inventive twists and turns and a few clever dialogue exchanges.    The film is a little slow and the pacing isn't very good, but there is a wonderful atmosphere. It has the right mix of comedy, action and drama. The humor, which seems to come from the comic book-like style used, is very creative. I especially liked how the comic style and the characters were different from each other. I felt that Joe and the other members of the secret society all had different personalities. Joe was the most passive of the group, but not a bad sort at all (in fact he had some kind of strange, almost comical relationship with a dog). The other characters were also unique and enjoyable to watch. I wish that the story had been told in more detail, but at the end there is nothing missing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Taken from a famous comic strip" "The King" is an entertaining story of an old man who is being chased by a crazed killer with the aim of making him kill a woman. This is a comic strip, the man is a man named King in his early years. The killer is a crazy man named Don. Don is a madman with a big head and a bad temper. I don't know if we saw this one already or just remembered the title and the story was very good. It was like a classic Batman story. One of the nice things about this is that I enjoyed seeing it for the first time. It wasn't a sequel, more a prequel and we already know the story. "I'm King, I'm King. Don't call me King. I'm king in my own mind."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There really isn't much else that I can add to the excellent movie The Last Jedi, apart from a few tiny observations about the overall design and presentation of the new Star Wars trilogy.  What I'm going to do is to highlight three scenes that really stand out from the rest. _________ Scene One:  __________ Star Wars:   The Last Order    A new threat to the galaxy confronts Luke Skywalker in the last remaining stronghold of the First Order.   This is the moment in the movie when the Empire is really showing its teeth, and it really is a very tense confrontation.  First thing to note is the fact that the Star Destroyer in the background is a new Star Destroyer, which means that this is the second movie to make use of new tech.  There is a lot of new stuff in the battle between the Empire and the First Republic, including the addition of the TIE Fighters and the new TIE Interceptors which are the equivalent to the X-Wings from A New Hope.  The new Star Destroyers can fly very, very quickly and are very effective, with powerful shields.  Also important to note here is how big the Tarkin Throne appears, which can be quite impressive.  Star Wars   As much as I like seeing these new ships in action, the thing that really made the T-70 stand out is the way that it shoots out energy beams that can fire at targets.  You can almost feel the electricity as the beams fly back and forth.  As soon as I saw the battle unfold I found it a lot more exciting than a lot, and then it hit me:  I've never seen the T2-B frigates go to warp!  That's when the first scene I'll mention came in, that of the Death Star's destruction.  It doesn't matter which side you are on when you watch it, but there's just something so very satisfying about watching a massive, imposing, Star Destroyer blow up in the middle of a battle!   You do feel that the universe is at peace, that the Empire can't win.  I'm glad that I saw this film, even though it took a little longer than I had hoped.

I had a lot of fun watching this.  The movie's a little long, but it makes for a good evening movie.  I am now going to bed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story takes place in the near future. A war has broken out among the two empires of Earth and Mars. The victors in that war have established a system of colonies on the surface of Mars, and they have been successful. Mars has been described as a kind of utopia, because it's completely inhospitable and without water. The Marsans are happy to be able to get about on the rocky surface, and their technology is impressive, but it's no replacement for food. The colonists of Mars have been farming crops on the red planet for millennia; they've perfected the art of growing food on Mars, as well as a way of growing a kind new type of fungus (the 'Citrus'). But the Martian culture is more focused on nature than on people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A really nice and fun movie to watch and to listen to.   The movie is about a group of people who, during a camping trip together, get kidnapped. The group eventually meets a group in a similar predicament and help each other out, though they're not the greatest at it. It's a good laugh, even though they can't really say much to one another because of the language barrier.   is a fun and simple story that shows that friendship can overcome any obstacle...even the world's greatest villain and a whole host of other problems that come up during your camping trip. (This is also the movie that introduced me to the term "Mountain Dew Snack." I'm not sure I'm the only one who's ever used that term while listening to a movie. It is pretty good.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a classic.  It has been around many many years.  If you like the films of David Cronenberg or the works of Terry Gilliam it is a must watch.  They both use weirdness in their films to create an unforgettable experience.  This version is on par with the others.  In my opinion they are all great movies.  David Cronenburg makes a great David Cronenfield.  Terry Gillian is a wonderful version of a demented clown.  And John Waters is like a wicked version of the Joker.  The only problem is that if you like these two films don't watch the next one (The Fly) because its so much worse and the first is worth more than this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie opens on the roof of a building with two children playing on the street.  In the dark we hear a "whirr" and a small animal in a red jacket (the same as in The Shining ) starts to escape from the building.   Suddenly we are in the middle of the desert.  The desert in the film is mostly dark and mostly barren.  In the desert the sun has been completely blocked by a white rock.  The wind blows and creates large puddles that are filled with sand.  And yet in the background a city can be seen with lights on its buildings and people walking, talking, etc.  This could be a fantasy like the book but instead it is more realistic.  When we see the people in the city we see a variety of people, from small people to large people.  I especially liked the small girl and the big man because each of them were very interesting and seemed real.  My only complaint is that I wish the movie would have been a little longer because they did not seem to have a good plan for the city.  Another negative is that the movie is very dark.  It is not that bad as to what the movie looks like but we are left in the dark in many ways.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tales of the City is a decent comedy, and it is funny!  It's also one of the better movies to come out of the 2000's, a good way for an actor/writer to get his name out there.  What more could you ask for?  I loved the movie, especially the scene in the club where the comedian performs a song called "The Tiki Man" about how he is a little boy trying to seduce a little tikiman who turns out to be a woman. __________________________________________ What else should I say? _________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only thing that would be nice about this movie is to have the actual voice actors doing the dialogue instead of the computer generated actors. I can't think of a better thing than it being like the old cartoons and that they actually do the voice acting and not the computer animation.  What a great film that is.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ (STORY : 4/5 | MUSIC : 4.5/5) - After watching some other films, this one reminded me a lot of "Black Rain", also it has some great soundtrack! The story is very interesting and the actors deliver their lines. The music is also very good and fits the mood of the scenes very well. The acting is quite good, some of the parts were really well-done. But I was only able to watch this in 2-3 hours. The story was quite predictable, since it is a prequel, the story about a very evil witch is not something I would like to see. - The only problem is the ending (which you don't even have to think about and it is sad)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is simple, yet interesting: It is the early 20s in the small town of Sorell. A group of three friends, who are young in their lives, are about to have an unexpected party, which is about to happen: A young woman has just fallen in love with the young man. A year ago he had died while serving in the war, but now he is alive again and they are set to get married. The story begins with a young man who has just been killed, and the funeral. He had gone out to take a stroll for his own pleasure, but as he was walking he was knocked down and his head smashed into the street. His two friends went after him, and found him in the street, bleeding out. He could not talk, and was unconscious. His death had really changed his friend's life, and he now finds himself alone in the world and has to find another love.   But how can these two lovers get together? They are quite poor, they cannot afford for a wedding. This is when their uncle, a well-known actor, is going to give an acting performance in a school play, called "Rags to Riches". The school play is being performed by the local community, including the teachers.  And he will give the best performance in the school and get a new love. His life will finally change...   This is a very interesting film, which should appeal to any audience, and which is a good example of comedy in its original form. The dialogue is not too clever, but it does it in a way that is easy to understand. It has a good ending, and some of the funniest dialogue ever written. The movie is very funny, and contains many funny scenes, especially those in which the characters, especially the teacher, get drunk and swear and abuse each other. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie which is all about the beautiful music of the composer Beethoven and his great genius. The movie is set in the city of St. Petersburg during the Russian Revolution where many of the leaders of that great revolution live or went to school in St. Petersberg during that time. Many of the revolutionaries are also Russian musicians and the movie does very well in showing their talent for composing and creating music while also showing what it was like to be at that time and also show the hardships and the joy the people of St Petersberg have lived through.  The movie really shows all the beautiful things in life but shows that it can be a cruel and unfair world and if you work hard enough it really can change your life and a great example to people who are trying to change it.  Highly recommend watching this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never thought I'd ever be so thrilled to watch an old lady grow old!   It is a funny little movie that is a lot like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (the movie, the book, the song, the video).   The acting is very good.   The old lady is not the usual "old lady" who is a sad old lady.   This old lady has a life.  But I suppose she should have died a long time ago, since she is such a good lady!  I was quite moved watching her and wondering how she could do so many things. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A couple of guys get a job as "pupils" at a young boarding school. One of them has a big cock, and one of them just has a face.   This movie is about a couple of young hot-headed studs with an intense desire to get a rise out of their school's "mature lady".  In short, they have both of them, and their only job is to get the old lady to open her legs for them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to this movie because it was advertised as a horror flick. I had heard of horror movies but nothing of the genre as it was supposed to be. It turned out to be the opposite! It was actually a little scary, maybe I'm not used to the genre. The only problem was that it wasn't in the most coherent way. But I found it very entertaining and funny. I would recommend this for any horror fan out there. It's entertaining and the film itself is very good. And I think its a bit of a remake of a horror movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As far as I'm concerned, a very entertaining and well done thriller. I really hope that this is a sign that the director will find a more permanent place for himself as a director, since his work has suffered from his occasional and sometimes quite bizarre ideas, which often seem to run in random directions and make for an entertaining yet occasionally confusing mess. For instance, his character "The Joker" is such a complete jerk and so utterly ridiculous that he can be made to seem absolutely hilarious, a la Michael Myers (John Carpenter), except without the dead eyes. A lot of the humor is actually coming from the people around the Joker, such as his girlfriend "Jughead" (a pretty good Holly Hunter) and his boss "Dr. J" (Michael Caine), a retired doctor who's still obsessed with Joker's past. The film is based on the true story of The Joker's first attempted murder of a victim. The killer (Joker) was an ex-con (or "wannabe") who had been caught and incarcerated (or just kicked out) from other places and didn't seem to have a great career ahead of him. He is a bit of a psychopath (especially compared to the clowns and "goodies" of Hollywood) but is always able to keep a sense of humor and to give a little bit of levity to his actions. It took him quite a while to get to know the woman named "Beverly" (Kathy Bates). Although he may look like a clown, he is in fact a very intelligent and sensitive guy. Although he was a murderer, he seems to have learned from his past that he should never repeat his mistake. That said, the film is full of twists and turns that have the movie pacing in a completely different, and entertaining, direction. It can be a little overwhelming at times and can be confusing at times, but I still enjoyed the film to the very end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this at a show and I thought it was brilliant - it looks a little dated but it is still a good time. It was great to see a group of boys in their early 20's having fun doing the music.   The music is great - it seems to be in my memory but it's very good.  They were singing and playing and dancing - very good fun.  I enjoyed this one and I'd definitely see them again - it is good to be 20 again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished this movie and I really liked it. It starts off with this big beautiful movie that is about the last weeks of the war in Japan. Everyone has died in the war except one man and there is a war to the death. The people of Tokyo who have the power and the women are a bit like the women in the 90's. It has some great acting, I love the story behind the whole thing and there are some beautiful scenes. If you like the movies of "E.T. The Extraterrestrial" you will also like this one. I really really like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just bought this film off the VHS section of my local movie store a few years ago. I just have never liked horror movies. I can still remember a scene from a movie once where the girl was running away from a creepy guy with a knife and she slipped and fell while running and the camera followed her for a few seconds before the dude comes up from behind and puts a gun to her head and tells her that he'd rather be with her than her boyfriend, so she ran off to meet her boyfriend. I don't think she'd have ever come back alive after that. So I'm not a huge fan of horror. I think it has an element of romance in it but not to the level of an Amityville Horror. I remember that once there was a guy and a woman who were in a pool and they were looking at each other and the man went over and took a towel and tied up his head. He was in bad shape and he was about to drown but he was revived by a fish that happened to be at the scene. So when she took the towel out of the water and was looking at him, she said, "Well, do you feel better?" And he said,  "Yeah, I feel a little better." And he held her close to him and swam to shore. There are a couple of little supernatural elements that I like. I liked the sound effects. The guy said, you know how the sound of a train comes off a train in a train station? A similar thing happens, except the man's voice is a little distorted.   A few scenes in the movie were kind of funny, although they seemed like a few too many. They were supposed to be a few scenes that didn't seem to work so well. But then again, this movie is rated R so I guess my ratings weren't very high. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is very good and very well done! The acting is great, the story is good, the directing is good. I would like to say it's a little too short but it is good! My friend loves it and thinks it's too short because he says it could have been longer. It would be better if the movie had an ending but you should watch it if you like horror movies.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I always wondered what happened to the two sisters that made a film together for a short while in the 1970s. They must have been so charming and in love. I remember it well because the film was in a small town in Scotland, which has some fine scenery and a decent cast including some familiar faces as well as some more new faces: Peter O'Toole, Tilda Swinton and the late, great Colin Firth. I also really liked Tilda and it was a shame her brother David O'Barry did not do as well and it is the kind of story that should have been told for the last time.  A man and a woman with different ages get lost in a beautiful landscape when a storm comes in and they must start a search.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dino" is a film in which the dinosaurs seem to have lost their mind. They move about on their hind legs and even fall down in a swimming pool! The film is a mixture of comedy and horror and even its ending is quite humorous. "Don't forget to pick up the newspaper". This is what the newspaper said about our hero and the only thing we can really say is that the movie is about the "dinosaur"! We are led to think that this is about a "lame" movie as a young man is being carried across a room and his shirt is pulled down to reveal his red, hairy body which somehow makes the scene even worse. It isn't until we reach the end of the movie and see his big, hairy hands that we are surprised by the lack of violence, blood and a general lack of sense in the action. But hey, isn't that the way of the dinosaurs? "You should do a better job next time, I'll make you a movie!"
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This has been a year of great movies and, for those of you who haven't seen this yet, I highly recommend this movie.   I am a lifelong Disney fan and a lifelong Marvel fan and this movie is simply one of the best Disney movies, that I have ever seen.  This movie is about a young boy named Peter Pan who is born to an abusive mother and a father who is a drunk and violent drunk. The father forces Peter to leave home and he and his mother take to the sea.  It is during this time that the family discovers a magical island.  They set up their camp on the island and are soon followed by a terrible storm.  As they try to sail away the storm picks up speed and the children quickly find themselves lost in the storm. Peter soon finds himself with a talking pig and they become friends.  From there Peter tries to learn all that he can about the Island of Sodor.  And the first thing he learns is that he has magic powers.  The island is really interesting, there are no characters that you know and love but Peter gets a special power that makes him great at swimming and the rest is simply fantastic. The story is very much like Alice in Wonderland but the way that the story is told is different.  Disney has never done much of a story like this.  You will never feel bored or have to stop watching to look up something.  I loved that the entire story was done in rhyme and that the whole thing was narrated by a talking duck.  There are few movies more fun that this.   This is also one of those rare Disney movies where they took a movie that was really hard to make.  All they had to do was make up a story for all of the characters they made up.  A lot of the films Disney made in the 90's seem like they were made only because they could make money with them and not to tell a story that made a point.  In the early 80's they started doing things like this, but then they stopped.  Why they didn't continue with it is a mystery.  If you have any kids this would be a great time to show them the magic of Peter Pan.  One of the good things about this movie (and all movies about children who live on the ocean) is that the film is very short.  Each story is only a minute and a half.  Most films are over 2 hours.  But
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am not even going to make a comparison of this movie to  Night of the Living Dead, so this review is going to be short and simple.  This is a movie about a bunch of zombie warriors that are trying to get in and get out as fast as possible.  They get killed by an undead clown.  Now, it doesn't take much to see that this clown is not the most interesting part of the movie.  Rather than being annoying he is pretty much useless and his only purpose in this movie is to give a couple of zombie guys a bad name.  However, this is a pretty great fight scene between the zombie clown and the guys who are trying stop him.  This is also an extremely silly and fun fight.  I do wish they would have made this movie a little bit more "serious" but it wouldn't change the amazing fun that this movie has.  If you have any interest in zombies or fighting zombies this is an easy one to watch.  It is a blast. Overall:    Zombie Warriors is an awesome little movie. It's a little silly and a little campy.  The movie is fun.   The story is just a little lame, but they are trying.  There's also a lot of character development but we don't really get to see all the characters grow up.  But, for a "fun" movie and a "lame" story it is pretty awesome.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a very funny, original and entertaining.  I really enjoyed the story, the characters, the plot, the humor, the performances, and the cinematography.    This film is about the life of a typical American, who is in love with a beautiful woman (Nina Sommers).   But her rich older sister (Tina Turner) is also in love.  But one day the older sister wants to divorce her.    Nina will do anything to get that money, however, she is not a wealthy woman.  In fact Nina has only one good friend, an office worker who is helping her out with the divorce case.  Nina is able to outwit and outrun the older woman (who has the most expensive lawyers) with the help of a young assistant attorney (who Nina finds on the side of the road) who is also a lawyer.  Also I am going to tell you how good this movie is.  I loved watching this movie, because it was very funny.  And I loved the characters because they were different.  Some of them you have to like the heck out of them.  This movie was also very good.  If you like a good laugh with a nice ending, you will like this movie.  So the bottom line for me is that this movie was good, but was not very original. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So this is a movie about a guy who has to take over a huge abandoned factory. So he gets a truck, loads it up with all his stuff, and leaves for it's final destination. He meets a guy he doesn't know, and they hitchhike. In the truck is some cool tools and all that good stuff. The guys run out of money so the truck keeps running over and over until it ends up on the side of a highway. And then this movie starts.  "Hey man, you know this place has a lot of people, that's cool. But it sure has a ton of dust, that much dust is almost depressing. It's really dusty. We're about to find out what it feels like to work in a desert."  I know I'm biased but this movie just seems like a bad movie. The first hour was bad. There are a few weird moments here and there but otherwise it feels boring. By the end of the second hour you're just tired and sick of them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I first saw the poster for " The Devil's Advocate " my eyes bugged out of my head and my brain started to fail me. I was like a little boy, a little frightened, that the Devil himself was actually speaking to me. But the movie wasn't scary. It was like being held captive in a dark room. You might not think I was a good man or a true friend, but the fact that I even bothered coming to you with that information proves to me that I do a lot of good. I didn't come here to judge, I came to show you the truth. The movie is about a lawyer who has just lost a big case to a local politician. The politician wants him to represent him in a city council race to win back some lost credibility. If you take a deep breath you might say this is just one bad guy after another. If that's true, then the movie could have been made with real lawyers. But it isn't. There is no justice. There are no good guys. Just a bad guy who is trying to do the right thing. When you consider the people that are on the other side of that issue, it becomes easier to see the bad guy. When the bad guys want to get revenge for something, what would they do? They would try to destroy a good thing. I am talking about Jesus and the Devil. I mean just look at that poster. Look at those pictures. Jesus was a very good looking man. He was not the most handsome man or the most muscular man or even the most powerful man, but he was good looking. He always wore a suit and had a smile. But when the Devil shows up, that smile vanishes and all you see is anger and violence. The Devil has no mercy. And as you watch the movie, I hope you understand. Because when you do, you know that it isn' t just a bad story, it' s a true story. The devil is very good at what he does. He is good at getting under the skin. He can get inside your head and see your deepest secrets, see everything. His job, as God intended it, is to take over a person's body. So when I first heard that the director, William Peter Blatty had said the movie was based on a true event, I thought it sounded like a very bad joke. In fact, when the movie finally came out I didn' t see any of those

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is very hard to compare this movie to the book. It is a hard read. As a writer, I can not find anything good to say about it. It really is a disappointment for all the hard work that went into it. The whole story is completely a tragedy. We have two very beautiful young sisters, who are the best of friends. Both of them are gifted singers with high voices. The mother was very fond of both of them. She encouraged them to sing, to play and to do whatever they want. She would get mad if anyone criticized her daughters, although the girls were very talented. But the only thing she did not like was the fact that she was the only one to not have a boyfriend. There is a very short story by the mother which explains all the bad things about her life. The father is an alcoholic who lost his job, and when he tries to go to rehab, the hospital is taken over by an evil hospital that uses the old techniques of evil doctors. The family is trying to get out, because they have no money. The older daughter, Mandy is the one with the best voice in the entire town. She was a very good student and was very proud of it. She had no friends, but her older sister, Maddy, and her best friend, Mavis, are close to her and are willing to help her in the last days. Mandy had a big problem. She is extremely jealous of Maddy and her good looks. She tries her hardest to date Maddy so she could become one of those famous singer/actresses. Unfortunately for Mandy, Mella is her sister's closest friend and Maddy is in love with Mandy. Maddy tells Metta and Caddy about Mandy's attempts to date other girls and Metta tells Mandy and Mella that she has a boyfriend who is a big fan of hers, but that he won't be around for a while. In the next two days, the girls are trying to break up with each other, but can not. Then they meet Metta again, and it looks like Metta is going to be the boyfriend for Misha, because he is a handsome boy. Metta becomes jealous and thinks Mandy loves Metta, but Maddy knows the truth. Mika and Mika try to get Misha's attention with gifts. But Mika gets frustrated when he feels that he has no interest in Misha. Then M
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought the book was really good but in the movie I didn't feel it. I loved the book and thought its a good story, but when I saw it in the theater I didnt really enjoy it because in the book there are a lot of sex and the movie is really long, like over an hour long. The film was over and there was nothing left. The story is about a young man who is so smart, he is going to get a job with some of the world's wealthiest people as a man that watches over them. The movie starts with him finding out that his wife has left him and his family and that she has a boyfriend that is so rich and famous that he has his own yacht and a private plane and an airplane. I thought it was very cool that he had this amazing job he was so good at, it really made me happy to see him get so rich. Then when he gets married the wife of the rich guy dies, then he is so depressed and his friend tells him to get the family money and get married again because he was going to go broke in a little while, now that he is married there is some money he can do because his wife is now rich. They get into a fight and I thought he would get away with this, but they end up kissing and the husband thinks of going back to the rich man and get his wife back. He then gets arrested and the guy who is the richest man in the world is going back and helping him. He goes in a jail and his jailer tells him the reason there is so much money is because they let everyone they have prisoners and now they have all the money. In the next scene it is so long that its hard to say anything and the thing that i remember most about the movie was how he met the rich one and how he was getting in trouble with the rich boy again and how they had sex together. There are a few parts that really got me mad. First of all I do not like the part where he gets arrested for having sex with the woman that he was supposed to be protecting. Second of all, the guy that he ends up being with is so hot and I liked him. But they ended up making him just another slave and the rich kid gets away with his crimes and is now married to his sweet little sweet wife. The only problem I have with the movie has to do with the ending of the movie and how its so abrupt that there is no payoff for

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!! The film was great, it is very good and funny and i loved the ending... i really enjoyed watching this movie and its great to watch a movie with very funny moments, it was a perfect ending that is worth seeing... it is an animated movie so its not a perfect and beautiful movie but it was good...  Helpful the movie is not a true story but a cartoon with comedy and some heart. The story is in this movie is the story of a cat who likes a dog and a dog that has a secret that will make her lose her job. If the dog finds out, she will lose everything and if the cat finds out she won't know what to do with the dog. So she gets him to give her a special food that will get a heart and will make him think that he loves her and she will like him and then she'll find out that he is not happy and he will hurt her. And the whole story was in this cartoon so it is not an obvious and easy to understand story but when the dog found out the cat will not leave him, there is also a girl that is in love with the boy that wants to make love with him and the cat wants to get her but the boy has a boyfriend who wants to break up. There is so many story lines that are funny that you can't not laugh at them...the characters are very funny and good...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a beautiful movie. This is a film filled with so many beautiful people.  We meet a beautiful couple, the couple are so nice and kind.    The movie deals with a young lady who has to choose one spouse and if she chooses wrong,   the family will be in trouble and even if she choose the right spouse,  it may take a long time before he will notice it.  But what makes this movie really wonderful is the way of expressing love through love songs.  The love story is beautiful!   We will definitely watch more of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story was interesting in it's simplicity. I love when there is a woman in a time of war. This is a story from the woman's point of view. I found the women to be more believable than the male characters. I liked how it was told and how each character was portrayed. The story felt real. There was a reason for every single event. There weren't any out of place scenes in the movie. The plot was good. The ending felt a little rushed. But at the very least, it was a nice story.   I would definitely watch this movie again. It might be too short though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great example of old-school American cinema; a well-shot, action-packed, beautifully filmed, fast-paced thriller with an outstanding soundtrack.  You will never be bored with the pace of the film, as all the characters are kept on the edge of their seats.  A great family-friendly film that features a fantastic soundtrack, an all star cast, and a good-natured film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie doesn't work all that well, but it's pretty good. It's a small piece of film, but a fairly good one. Not everyone will be won over by it. If you enjoy horror and are into vampires and werewolves, then you should definitely check it out.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like movies that are funny, and not so funny, but funny anyway. if you like a very fast paced and fast paced action movie where there are guns flying around and the gun fight scenes aren't all that good.   This film is the opposite of a comedy.  It's fast paced fast paced, action-packed, crazy action crazy and some serious humor. the story is good, I didn't watch it for the story. it's the action and the fights and the funny bits that made me laugh.  it was funny as hell.  the only problem is that the special effects in the action sequences can be pretty bad. but that's kind of the movie's charm, that it is fast and crazy and funny.  A good idea for a sequel:  Well i'd like to think i'm in the minority here, but i thought it was a good idea to make a sequel to this film.  They could have made the whole thing about a guy who gets a hold of a gun that shoots exploding pigs, maybe that would have been even better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie that tells the tale of a group of soldiers that get stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific with some dogs (dogs being a huge part of the plot) who are obviously not getting along, and that is just as well as you would think. The movie is very well told and the acting is top notch. The story is very good and has a good message in the end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched a number of the new Harry Potter films and was pleased with them.  There was never a dull moment and each is different but fun.  The best parts are the ending scenes when the children's families are reunited at Harry's house and then at the wedding.  It is the last time these families will ever see each other.  A real happy ending and an epic movie.  I especially liked the ending where Harry leaves the Order with all the money he collected to buy a house for his family in an isolated village.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't remember why I watched this but I really enjoyed it. Its just a good comedy and a good look at human nature. Its a little bit over the top at times but its well acted and its a nice look at humans. The special effects are well done.   I gave this 4 stars for quality, fun, and value. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A good movie.  It's just that it has all of the expected elements in it, and nothing to add.   I mean, how can I have a good time when I read the "Murders in the Rue Morgue"?    I think it might have helped me write this review if, for one thing, this would have been the movie where one of the actors played two roles - a victim and his murderer." -- Mike (from the "review" site at YouTube).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of people don't give a fuck about superhero comics, but for me, they are the most fun!  The one big thing that makes this one of my favorites is that it is really a story of a father trying to have a happy family, in spite of his own father, who had passed away at a very young age.  I also like that the director, John Landis, didn't shy away from humor, which the movie had some great scenes of, and it really is good!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was so beautiful in the movies the story was very good. This time the girl got a gift of a box from a man in a black suit. He put in it a small white hat with little buttons and the name of a man named the "Red-Head". He wanted the girls to be his daughter and the daughter gave him the white hat and a black dress. She put on the black hat and the dress which had a very sweet smell like a flower. Then she said to the man in black suit to open the box and give some gifts to his daughter. He took out a little box and started to say a little thing which was the same as in the movie. Then the boy called him and he had a big smile on his face. After they left the man said that they will meet again and he will give them a new house in the village. The girl said they don't want a new place, they want a house in their own village. They will buy a house and live there happily for a time. After a while the man and the girl will go home and the boy will be gone and it was a beautiful movie for little one and the little girl.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought I was being pretty clever by buying this movie at my local store. I was, but I thought maybe it was a mistake, like I'm not very smart. I'm pretty sure this movie was supposed to be the sequel to a little-known John Carpenter film with John Belushi. Well, the only bad thing about this movie is that the only thing that makes you feel like John Beluddy was in this movie are the bad effects of the film. Even when the characters are on the stage, the camera just goes back and forth with a man playing the keyboard with a girl sitting on his lap. I don't know how to describe a movie like this. I'd like to call it a good film for the movie buff and movie fan, but a bad film for anyone who likes good movies. I thought it was pretty good because of the movie and how good it is made. It's a good comedy for that. I just think that when the director (Dylan Cole) takes us through the movie we're not getting to see the same old things because they're too familiar. The movie is pretty good, it's just a shame that this is the only movie John Carpenter made that we'll see in 20 years.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is pretty much a remake of the original film but with new scenes and the plot is more interesting than the first one. The characters are more well formed and it is fun to see the different characters like a teacher of psychology, a famous professor who travels around the world and a little boy who can do everything he wants and can learn things from any teacher. The movie has a lot of comedy sequences and it has a good ending too.  I liked this movie so much I am going to watch it again!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you are a fan of the great Stephen King there is no doubt that this is not your usual horror flick. There are no jump scares here, no monsters or monsters and the gore may not be the most disturbing but it is well executed and a well thought out movie, the special effects are good too.  The ending was a bit of a disappointment and as far as Stephen King goes it still holds up as his best work.   I have to say that although I am a huge fan of Stephen King I was left a little wanting by his latest novel. This is not a bad movie, in fact I highly recommend it, there is a lot to like about it.

I was actually looking forward to it for a while but after seeing everything that happened I can't wait to see it again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a post apocalyptic world, a young girl travels to the city where she is to live. Her destination is The Cathedral. There she meets a young couple who go in for the same thing. However, instead of walking to the church a couple of guys come along and try to steal their bag. So the young girl runs to the other side of the cathedral and is attacked by a zombie and a man with a hat... This is an interesting movie because it takes some risks when it comes to the zombies, and the violence can get a little hard to watch. But the story itself has its ups and downs as well. Overall, this is a very interesting watch and well worth the watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** "The Secret Lives of Houdini," one of the biggest hits of 1951, was directed and written by Richard Fleischer. "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" is the third movie Fleischer directed, after "The Ghost" and "Catch-22." "The legend of Sleepey Hollow" begins with the arrival of a mysterious stranger, who claims to have found the skeleton of a child who has lived on the town graveyard for over 50 years. As his curiosity gets the best of him, he investigates the mystery and is soon convinced that this is the story of a young boy who has escaped from the grave. Of course, he soon becomes a celebrity and is invited to take part in a series of high school events. This is a popular, light-hearted, and easygoing story. Fleischer's writing is clever and witty, but not too clever. It's also a story that has a good deal of variety and takes in all types of characters. The plot, however, is fairly simple, and the characters are not particularly developed. There are several of them, but there are only a few of them. If "The Hero" from the previous picture is a more interesting character, it may well be "The Dead Man." The most interesting character in "The Lost Boy" was George Adamski. In the first picture he is a young man who is a bit off. In "The Tomb" he is very much of the same mind. He is a sort of anti-hero, a tragic hero, not because he has lost his family but because he doesn't have the family's love in him to keep him going. He's a rather stupid character, a sort not of a good example of the good kind of man who goes on to become a good man. He loses his family and then dies. Fleisher does a lot of things right, and some things wrong. The movie looks good, has all kinds of wonderful special effects, and has an interesting cast. Fleischner has given up acting and he is mainly a writer. His last film was a play called "The Big Red One." It tells of the story from a little boy's point of view. In this film he shows a man who has been beaten and tortured in jail. The picture has been shown at the Chicago Film Festival and a lot more. If Fleischer can be more interested in making movies that will last, rather than the few that make good money, perhaps he
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie. The concept behind this is good, they do a good job with the setting of this movie and they do try to keep it interesting. The story is decent, but it could be better. The performances are good and most of the characters have a very real sense of who they are. I found it really hard to like any of the main cast. I really didn't see any chemistry between any of them. It's not that they aren't good at a comedy, but as it was a comedy that was very over the top, it wasn't that funny for me. They also tried too hard to have the audience laugh in this movie, I didn't find it funny either. The action is good here, as you would expect, the action is not that impressive, but its better than what you will find in many other movies. I would like to see a bit more of the setting, in the future, i would like them to add more to this movie too, and try to make it more complex. Overall a very good comedy, and I enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________ A short, but fun, fantasy flick with a bit of dark humour. I liked this movie a lot. I will definitely check out the next one. ________________________________________________________________________________  The movie was made a few years ago, but it hasn't been made into a good film by now. A couple of bad men do bad things. This story about the murder of a girl by her boyfriend gets to the heart of a couple of things. A good guy kills a woman he likes, and I'm not sure there's an actual point. What was done in the movie was done well. I don't get why they thought people didn't like this movie. It's like a Disney movie that the bad guy is bad, and the good guy is good. It is a story about a guy whose girlfriend is dead, and a couple who has to get revenge. It doesn't get any better than that. A few things are good about this movie: -The characters are well done. I have a brother and a sister who both acted very well. It makes the guy who does all the bad things (and even does good things) look like a big dummy, and gives the guy (in the role of the bad person) that much more depth and character. -The music was good.    I gave this a 2.5/5 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie had everything I loved about the genre: action, science fiction, suspense and laughs.   When I saw the synopsis I thought it sounded like a western that had some western style stuff.  I was happy to be wrong.  It's not a bad movie by any means.  The plot doesn't last more than a handful of scenes.  One of the main characters is in a bit of a slump and then he realizes that he has something he needs to prove: his ability to do whatever he wants.  He does this with a couple of other characters, all who are not quite so nice.  Even though I am pretty sure my review for the first half was more critical then it should be because I was hoping for something different from this genre.  When it started I was intrigued but the film started out a little slow.  But a great action sequence (for a movie about a car chase) leads to this:   Afterward it becomes quite the thriller.  Like many action movies in this subgenre there are also scenes that could be described as "unbelievable".  There is something here for the viewer that will linger and I think is worth the price.  After all this is a movie where we can go into the heart of darkness and come out with a smile: I would have liked to see a little more action in the second half because it really is a well made movie but if your not expecting anything great to happen there really isn't anything going on in the plot.  As I have said before I think this is more a western than a car movie and as a result it has a very western feeling to it: The movie has a lot of great special effects, with the occasional "flare" and the like.  In short the car chase scenes could have been done better but that's why the audience should be happy as they don't really matter.  There's no way of taking away the feeling of fear that one gets from watching this movie.  However I'm glad I was able to see this movie because I know that there are people out there who like movies that are "sneaky" and "out there".  I'm not sure why it's so hard for people to like this genre, but people seem to enjoy it even when the plot is lacking.  If you like this kind of movie I can't wait to see it again!  Overall:  I

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a bit hard to describe this movie, because it's just kind of a really weird movie. But it really is pretty, and quite funny.  I guess the movie starts out pretty standard.  It's really interesting seeing how different the sexes would react to each other if it weren't for the huge differences in personality, body, appearance, and goals.  For my money the most interesting thing about this movie is how much attention the producers pay to the various sexual fetishes and the various ways in which one can get aroused and make themselves seem to be attractive by doing so (it's a little like the 'Miley Cyrus movie' at first).  As they talk about the movie one of the guys in the group says 'he'll never understand women until you show him'.   Well, the movie seems to focus mainly on the different physical attributes of the various women (with the obvious exception of Jennifer's large breast size) and it seems that every woman in the movie is some type of a sexual fetish (or at least a combination of many of them).    The movie was pretty well done, but at times there seemed to be a lot of superfluous stuff going on.  I found myself wondering if there were two different films running at once, and it made me feel a little uncomfortable about the way it was being produced.  It's really hard for me to come up with something better than this movie.    There's a lot more about the film (for those who want to see) here.

This was so close to being a very good film. It was a nice film.  It was also made by Tom Wolfe, whose books "The Bonfire of the Vanities" is a classic. It is so good.  This movie features the same actors from the film "Pearl Harbor".

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________ It looks like a typical western, but it has something special about it. The cinematography is great, the music is nice, and the direction is good. I like that the character in the movie don't have much in the way of personality, and it makes it more fun. I'm very impressed by the cast for a remake, with a few big names. There are also a few familiar faces. I really don't like how they edited the film, and they seem to want to show a western that was shot 50 years ago. I don't think that's realistic. There were some good action sequences too. But I think we could have been seeing the whole story of this man in more detail. I think the film could have worked if we didn't have to constantly follow and try to understand the way the film was being shown, and if they had shown the whole thing to us in a montage format. I also think that one of the problems with the movie is that there's not a lot of actual fighting in it, and when they do fight they're using a lot less stunt men. I did like the way that the cast acted out the scenes, but I also wish there had been a little more depth, and a few more characters who had a personality that made them a little bit more than just there to be killed off. There's an ending to the movie that is well done, and I thought it was great. But it's not realistic, it's a typical Western. But there's something more in it than that. It's hard to explain. I love westerns. A lot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A brilliant and powerful film by a master. A great movie.   I had no idea that the "Hawk & Dove" series would continue, and the first film, The Black Hawk, was a great one.  The plot is a simple one: a young boy, with no special abilities, must help a group of children, the Black Hawk Children, who are about to start a journey to the land of the Hohokam.  After several problems in the beginning, there is no way he can win this journey, because every time he tries to escape, an evil bird (called "Hoggy") appears to catch him.  It turns out to be more than that though.  There is a group in the woods that are trying to protect their "little Hohakam" from the bad boy Hokey (who is playing the "bad boy" role, to make things more dramatic, and more interesting). In the midst of the confusion, the little Hohackam falls in the forest, almost missing his "little brother."  The Black Hawks, having seen this, decide to go to the rescue of the little one. Once there, they get him back to the Horkam, who is much more interested in the "Little Hohock," than in finding his "Hock".  They do manage to rescue their friend (although, like with the first movie, the "crying little girl" is not actually in this one) and the little boy learns a lot about the Hokeys and the birds who live in the area.  Unfortunately, it seems, for some reason, Hoke and Hoggy do not want their "hobby" to be shared, even when Hoke says they "came all the way from the mountains," and it is a great disappointment to learn that these Hokeya cannot be shared.  What should have been a "happy ending" is ended in one of the most sad, yet humorous ways possible, as the black hawk's beak, in order to protect his little friend, removes Hoke's finger, leaving him helpless and in need of a doctor.  In the end, however, Hoggy and Hoke come together and learn a lot of how to "live in harmony."  In all seriousness, this movie, along with the second movie (The Lost One ), is very good and worth seeing.  So, I am happy that Hawk & Dove
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Matrix is the best of the movies from the first trilogy. It takes no time and moves along at a rapid pace, the only real question is who was the first to think that humans could be the masters of the Matrix rather than the other way around? If not John Reeves, then John Frusciante, but there is a point where he starts to go for the easy way out. The plot can seem a little dry, but it is the action that is the main reason it is so good.  It is easy to understand why the matrix was invented in the first place but then the human beings were not to be trusted in the future. It is almost too easy to follow this plot and it does give you a good feel for how the Matrix works.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So many things are happening that it is hard to focus and keep up with all of them. The opening is a nice little piece of filmmaking with a nice soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. I think it would be nice to see a little more of this kind of film and a little less of the usual "he's going to die! "  This movie is very short and the story is very simple but it has an impact and the ending, if not for the very very brief flashback and all of the dialogue in the middle, is quite dramatic. I guess that is to be expected of a film like this.    I am not a big horror fan.  If you do not like horror movies then this is not for you. You could say that it isn't that scary, at least in the first half. It has elements of that but it is not a horror film like the ones I have watched before. I feel that this movie tries to do more than it does and is a bit uneven in a lot of places. The actors do great work, but I feel the film might have had more of an impact had it been shot with a bigger budget.  This is an oldie but a goodie.  It is a simple little story and I hope the next film in the series takes a different direction.

I am not good at telling time so to me the movie was just a little different.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a bit hard-pressed at this point to think of a bad movie by Michael J. Bassett. It had a terrific cast in Eric Roberts, Robert Downey Jr., and Susan Sarandon. The action is fantastic, and the way Bassett has built out this world is breathtaking. I really enjoyed this movie. 6.   "Kiss Me Deadly" (1989) Director: James Cameron Plot: ~~This is what happens when you cross a vampire with a robot ~~ James Cameron is a guy that has had a lot to do with me over the last three years. I still have some great memories of my first viewing of "KISS ME DEADLY" on my old TOS. I had just finished the first film, and had heard great things about the sequel. I was looking forward to seeing it. What an awful way to end the trilogy. You know what this film was? Another example of why you shouldn't watch this kind of action film. I mean, look at it for yourself. I mean what kind of stupid ideas could you possibly have for a film like this? If the premise was to set up a sequel, how the hell did the director not think up a better and funnier premise? It doesn't help that it is a direct ripoff of the James Bond movie, "Thunderball", and has even more of the same stupid action scenes. The only reason the action works is due to how good it looks. There is even a sequence where we have a big monster coming through an air duct in the middle of the city, and we have the camera zooms up to the surface while he walks down. It is pretty impressive.   So what is a big bad vampire doing in a city that is totally cut off from air supply? Who cares. It has to be the giant mechanical monster and not the guy who just so happens to be in the air duct. Well, I sure did. A little too bad I can't see a reason why you would have an air-duct in the first place. Not to mention what the hell is up with the girl and the boy fighting with swords over some steaks? This is the kind of crap that is going to make a vampire look like a superhero.  It is a shame that Cameron went into making a bad film, because his previous two are just terrible.    All the way through the "Kismet

The performances are top notch, the music is superb, and the action is relentless, brutal, and brutal.  It isn't perfect, I've never seen a Hollywood movie make me feel like I've died as a consequence of someone dying, but there is a point where it hits the mark, where the audience can feel as if they are actually dead.  It's a shame the cast and crew didn't get a bigger piece of the money.      It's a good war movie, and one of the best on the list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The great thing about this movie is that its one of those movies that makes you really think, and to make you think hard about all sorts of problems. For example, if you're a big fan of the Bible, then this will have a profound effect on you. It is like the Bible has become just another movie! It has the same sense of purpose and moral, but the Bible is now just another Hollywood movie! I found the story interesting, and thought it was a very good script. It might be a bit difficult to understand the Biblical stuff. The film is about a man who is a devout Bible follower, who has a son that has fallen into some very serious problems. They are a group of people who are trying to solve these problems through their own method, but they still have a lot of things they don't understand, including the nature of God. I think this movie was written by someone who knows something about the Bible (Brent, the main character), and understands it much better than many others! This is a good film for Bible watchers, especially people who think they know the Bible better than others. I would recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a viewer I can say it's a good film with a good message, but a small one.  It's not really very good, but then a small film is really not very good.   A simple story told from the perspective of a boy and his dog.  It's all about how a child gets his father's job at a toy company. But he's not happy about it, because his father is not happy with his being at the toy factory and is constantly bullying him in their daily life.  One day the boy and the dog go down to the factory to work.  As they go down the steps the two dogs run ahead and one of them falls and breaks his leg.  He's in a lot of pain and then his mother comes and brings his father to see the damage. But then the father asks the boy if he wants his job back, and he goes on about how he's sorry and how he had a lot to do with it, and then he goes out.  When he gets back home he tells his mother about how his father was an abusive bastard, and how it would be better if he didn't work. The boy's mother was a bit upset and then her father said he wasn't coming back, then when the boy said he was going to take a walk he said he wouldn't.  And that's the whole story, really.  There's nothing really interesting in the film about the father's character.  That's it for me.

It also had a lot of action, with lots of explosions, lots of fast-moving cars, and a pretty good action sequence near the beginning. However, the real standout was the way the villains were treated. They were clearly evil, though I wouldn't say that a little bit of moral ambiguity and moral complexity was entirely necessary.   The villains' motivations were fairly simple. They wanted to steal something powerful in order to power their own personal power-plans. They also wanted to destroy the world in order for this to happen. It's a fairly simple plot, but the heroes aren't completely perfect either. I was a little sad that the villain was killed right when it looked like he was going to get his way, but I don't think it was too much a loss. I think I would have liked to see that plan to destroy everything fail in the end.   on the bad side: ____________________________________________ ____________________________________________________ __________________________   This movie has a few problems. The cinematography was pretty much perfect, but it didn't seem quite realistic enough. It is pretty obvious that the filmmakers did a poor job modeling cars, but unfortunately not all the cars they model are quite realistic. My car didn't have a windshield. I can't imagine there were too many shots like that. It was disappointing, but not really game-breaking. I do think the action scenes were a little too long, though. They dragged on. I also thought the film could have been a bit longer, I thought I was supposed to be feeling the effects of being hit by a car. I just don't get it.   at least the ending was great: ____________________________ ________   Overall I'd say this is an interesting movie, and it did contain some interesting ideas. However my favorite part about the movie was the action sequences. My favorite were the ones during which cars were falling from a tall building like toys. This was great to watch, and probably inspired other car-hacking movies. This is pretty good! _________________________________ ______________________________________ _____________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film starts off pretty boring. You don't get much of anything except the movie's title, some shots of a beach, a guy, a girl, and a helicopter ride and some music by a guy. But there are a lot of very good scenes in the movie (which I will not spoil). The girl and the guy are great in this movie. The two of them have great chemistry and really seem to have a good rapport together. The helicopter ride was amazing! I am really impressed with this film. I really hope that there is more of this movie because there are some great scenes in there.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good little film. The movie starts out with a man, a young and very horny one, named John Gentry, wandering into the woods. He goes into the trees to do a little hunting, while doing so he becomes lost in thought. He is in a dark forest and it seems that he cannot see anything. He finds a small hole near one of the trees. As he is trying to pull up his pants he comes face to face with the dead body of a beautiful young woman. John does not remember anything about her, he just wakes up with a start and the memory of the dead woman fades. The film then moves to an area where John has been to before, and is going to again. When he gets there he discovers the spot where she had been killed. He walks up to the tree where the woman had been hanged and hangs there to look at her hanging body. When John sees her hanging from the tree he takes off his pants, throws his gun on the ground and takes his clothes off. He begins to lick the dead flesh of her hanging corpse. After licking the body for a while he turns around and looks back at the dead girl, her face is still turned to the right. In one final move John pulls out his gun and kills the girl. I have not seen a better death scene that has any reason for its being. The girl is dead and it is all over but the dead. I can only hope that he is successful in his attempt to fulfill his life long dream of having a woman hanged in his tree. If so this will be the last time I will ever watch this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The King in Yellow"  is a fun, interesting movie, although it was never intended to be a great film. It's really a film for fans of King's novel and not only that. For starters it has great performances (not a weak one in fact) but it has wonderful effects in the film, and the color palette and mood that permeates everything, and so much more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other thing that makes  Dredd  an enjoyable film is the presence of an excellent cast of characters.  From Lord (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) to Dredd (Karl Urban), the diverse cast gives Dredd a variety of characters with different goals, motives, and ambitions.  I was especially impressed with the performance of Karl Urban as Dredd.  The character's demeanor changed throughout the movie, from the arrogant Dredd to the compassionate Dredd and even the more serious Dredd becomes at the end.  This film is well worth the watch if you love a good action film, a good story, or the performance by the cast of the film.  Posted by Rob at 1:24 PM

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie so much! The best part about it is the good actors. They don't overdo it like in too many action movies, and there is a real sense of "realness" in the characters and situations. And one of my favorite things about this movie was the "shooting range". What a great idea! I've done some shooting ranges before, and these were a nice change. I liked that you had a whole day to shoot (although I'm usually only there for a couple hours) and that you could see where the shots were taken. This is one of those movies you will enjoy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Cobra is one of those movies you have to see in order to be reminded why you keep coming back to watch them. There is always a certain amount of "horror", but this is mostly the result of the "human factor" of the movie. There seems to be a good amount of humor, but it's too often forced.   There are two reasons why Cobra is better than most horror movies: 1. it has great cinematography. I've seen films that look much better, but I've never seen a picture that looks so great. The movie is set mostly at a theme park and, for the most part, looks very realistic. It's clear that the movie was shot with an expensive camera, which is why it looks so good, especially considering the budget is quite high. 2. Cobra has an amazing sound track. One of the best soundtracks ever. You can feel each of the characters' life force, even the villains. I especially like the way the sound effects play in this movie. I'd have to give this a perfect 5 stars if I had to give it one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first ever viewing of the show. There is so many amazing moments throughout the show that just keep me coming back and watching. It is one of those rare shows where the drama in the show is very good and it has a very good plot line.   A perfect mixture of comedy and drama, and that's exactly what it is.  The comedy is just as great and if you've never seen the show before you should watch the show it is so entertaining. It has some good laughs and the dialogue between the main character and the other characters is always hilarious! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have loved this movie for several years. When I first saw it, I didn't want to take my eyes off it. I remember looking forward to watching this movie all the time! The plot is simple but intriguing. We have a little girl who lives on her own in a small village in the middle of nowhere and has never done anything extraordinary in life, other than be there when her daddy is home and play with him. Little does she realize she has a terrible secret. Her dad, Dr. Pomeroy, is a genius. She is always right, even if he is wrong about a lot of things. His wife, Rose, is kind of a bitch. You can see why they married. But we are never really sure where her loyalties lie. She tries everything to stop his genius from doing anything he pleases. If only she could get her way... The movie is well shot. The actors are excellent. And there are just enough of them to play the characters in a natural way. I loved the look of this movie. The colors were beautiful, the scenery was beautiful and the actors made me feel like we were all in a quaint village in Scotland. I can't say enough about this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of the Best is a series of 10 films in which the films are chosen based on their technical value, creativity and artistic integrity. The series began with The World's End and it had a few interesting and original ideas. The second film in the series, The World at War, had some good and amusing ideas in terms of a World War and an over-reaction to the conflict. The third movie, World Without End, was simply a comedy which was amusing, but not entirely original. The fourth movie, Armageddon, was the only interesting film to be produced in this series. It also took an interesting approach to the war - it is not a story about the conflict, as it was seen by many (myself included) as being the "greatest movie" of all time. Rather, it is a story which begins to show a picture of what the war was really like and then we learn more about the actions of the leaders of the countries involved in the war. Armageddon, however, did not go very far into the story of the war as it is far too short to do so. After this movie it was the next film, The Day the Earth Caught Fire which would follow in this vein. The Day The Earth Coked Fire is an entertaining film and one of the more interesting films made in this style of film. It is more an anti-war film than anything else and, by that standard, it works. It doesn't really have a plot or a particular theme to it, as much as it has some ideas about "nuclear war" and a story is told of the destruction of two cities, one by fire, the other by fire. The war in the film is a real war. The leaders are depicted as being cold, cruel and uncaring to each other. In the end the Earth was destroyed and the Earth's leaders are shown to be foolish and uneducated. After seeing this film I can't recommend it highly enough. I think it is better than the earlier films, but it can be a bit slow at times. It was recommended to me by an old friend, and, as usual, I loved it. I also think this movie was better than Armageddon.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An impressive movie, a great story, a well-researched look at a tragic story. The movie is also a little different from your ordinary movie, it has a strong anti-war message, a theme that will probably be a bit controversial. The ending is very much a downer and I could never take it seriously. But the movie is nevertheless a very enjoyable and thought provoking movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story:  There are many types of horror movies:  Horror with a twist, slasher, and most famously,  campy slasher movies.  In "Logan's Run", one of the most original slasher films ever made (and it was only made in 1964), this is a film with a very dark and twisted story that takes place in an abandoned amusement park.  Logan's Run is about a group of men who spend their days running the park, and enjoying themselves.   The film is also a very violent film, and while the violence is used sparingly, it still remains a very effective way to get the point across.  As a slasher film, however, Logan's has a lot of promise to work with, but when all is said and done, it is still a rather ordinary slasher.  The main attraction of this film is the acting, and for that reason, the film really stands out.  Michael York, John Ireland, Robert Mitchum, and John Wayne are among the leading men who each give the film their very own personality.  Also, there is a lot to talk about with John Wayne as he does not look like an actor at all.  There is a great deal of tension during some of the running scenes, and when the film does end on a cliffhanger, there are still some things that could be explored further.   Logan'sRun could certainly have been made into a trilogy with a much tighter plot than that, but the acting in this film was all too impressive.  Even though there are many elements that are simply recycled, it was certainly a fun ride and one that should not be missed.  A solid 3/5  Rating:  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a shame that the movies I like the most are the ones that involve vampires, zombies, robots and super soldiers and the like... That is until I saw this. There was something about this movie that appealed to me because it seemed so original. I have seen a few of the zombie movies that came out before this and thought "why are we even bothering with these zombies? They are so lame! They walk around, they get bit, they bite their own heads off and then they get reanimated!" This wasn't like that. I felt a little sad every time a character was eaten or burned or whatever, but even that only makes me feel a bit more sympathetic. Plus, there were a few people who fought back and killed a few vampires which I thought was hilarious and very impressive. I really hope I get to see this in the future because I don't think I have ever seen anything like this. The trailer even included the song "No More", so that was a bonus for me!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie for the first time in a theater back when it was out on cable and never watched a bad bad movie in my entire life... I don't understand why people get a "bad" rap for this movie.... the original star and producer, Fred Savage, made the film (with the legendary John Ralston as star) because of his great ability to make action movies, but when they got him back for a remake, he said "No way" and decided to use the original screenplay. I think the director, Roger Corman, did a good job, but he had to make an action movie, so he changed the name of the character to Billy the Kid from a comic strip which had his father run a whore house. Billy's mother is killed by a gang of bandits, and Billy wants revenge. He goes to a cave (which is only a cave on a mountain) and gets a gun and is told that he is the last of his race, and there is a place where you must kill a man named the Black Samurai (which isn't a black man - it's a bad guy named Billy the Tiger.) Billy starts killing people, but then he gets some help from a giantess (the only other thing that is bigger than Billy is a dinosaur). The only part about this movie that is bad is the title, which is stupid. In conclusion, "Billy the Kid" is a good action movie (and it's great to see Corman come up with the idea of Billy the Dinosaur!) The best part about the movie is the giantess who runs around on a bike, which she can ride on, in between the action. When she jumps off she looks pretty cool. I didn't get a chance to see a lot of the people from this movie, but one thing I remember a little from this is that the guy who plays Billy is probably the best stuntman of the '80s, and the other guy (the one who is played by Gene Hackman) is the best actor. He does really great things. So, I'd say this movie is a classic. If you enjoy bad action movies and the good guys getting the girl, this is definitely the movie for you. If your a fan of "The Terminator" or "The Karate Kid" or any other action movie from the 80s or the 90s, then you should also watch this movie. It has pretty good songs from "Rocky Horror Picture Show"

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ You don't need a camera for this movie. It's all about a man who tries to find his family from the ashes. He takes them with him back to his childhood home, only this time there's a lot more blood. At the age of 14, John McEnroe is a very sweet boy who thinks about everything in his life. For example, he dreams of being a professional tennis player like his idol and friend, John Sampson. He has never been good enough to even be a good opponent, although he always managed to get one. John is working on a tennis court which is just across from his house. He lives on a street where his neighbors are his grandmother, his mother and his uncle, who lives next door. His uncle is in his 70s, but is a really nice guy. He never stops smiling and telling John how much he loves him. It seems like a wonderful dream to John, except for one fact: his uncle can't remember him. The only thing is that John doesn't believe that he will be able to live with these people if he gets married someday. His dream of getting married is what is keeping him alive. But he knows that if he can't have a relationship with the woman he loves, then he'll be lonely for the rest of his life, and maybe that will be too late. At work, John is not the best tennis player, but he is really good at other things too. He's a genius at sports. His mother is a good cook, and a very nice lady who makes a great lasagna. His father worked for 20 years and is a big man, who can give John a lift. But, despite this, John feels that his father would not approve of a romance between his son and a young woman he has never met. John also has a younger brother, who works at the local post office, although his brother would be much more mature for John's age. John spends most of his days with his parents, and his mother, after being a very strict disciplinarian, tries to make John feel secure and at ease. His aunt is a nice lady, who helps John's mother with all the chores in the house. Her name is Marion, and she's a widowed housewife. She also works as a secretary at her husband's company, where she helps him with his paperwork. She's a really good secretary. John's best friend at work is a guy named

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie about a small town in the middle of nowhere. There are a few things worth mentioning that will help you forget about the problems of the setting. First of all, the movie makes no attempt to hide its love of the classics, even when the characters are from out of town. You can see many of the same shots and expressions from several films including, but not limited to, The Longest Day, A Man for All Seasons, The Old Man and the Sea, The Kid, The Wizard of Oz and more. A few examples to the movie's own style is a little girl (played by Meryl Streep) running into town in her wagon, picking up a bucket of water. As she runs, she looks up at a sign for a "Mud River" and smiles, a line which was very much like a joke by the likes of Shirley Temple (who actually played this character in the movie). The town looks like a bit of a joke, but it is a rather charming place in which to have your first vacation in a small city. If you have a child or a grandchild who likes to visit town, this movie is definitely for you!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has great performances from a cast that could easily be a hit or miss.  The story is fantastic.    It is an adaptation of a very well written comic book series, that the great George P. Westlake wrote in the 60's.  The film has a great cast as well, that is, until the end.  They all do a good job but, none can match the great performances by John Goodman and George Segal, each of them give one of the most memorable performances in years.  The film has it's flaws:   This movie is slow and has a boring beginning.  I thought the movie did a good in introducing the characters and what we have to look forward to in the movie.  Also, I thought this movie did not deal with the whole topic of drug addiction.  There is one scene, where George takes a shot.  When he coughs up blood it is so hard and horrible that he is knocked out.  This scene did not feel real and the plot felt like a mess.  Another issue is that the film did not have the ending to it in the final act.  It has a lot of unanswered questions and I am disappointed in this movie but what a story.      Parting words:  This is a great adaptation of an excellent comic book.  You have to get this movie because you will not be disappointed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- --------------- This was one of those rare times when I was glad that they didn't make a sequel to their classic 'Gods & Monsters' film. If there is any sequel to this movie (I think I read it somewhere) I wonder how they'll take this one... and I don't mean it was the same movie like the first one, but just a whole new movie. A movie which I will watch again in the future... and it's not just the movie, but all the characters and the story is very unique... the plot is very interesting, in a very serious way, not just some sort of joke, the film is about a family which decides to go to a cave in the forest. Inside the cave, they are shocked to discover a family of goblins (it's very different from the first movie, since in the first they were very silly and made them laugh, while here the family is very serious) the family decides that they must hide for the whole night in the cave... and in the morning the Goblin family is back to their normal selves again! I just can't say enough about the great story, the characters, the effects and the acting. And I really enjoyed the beautiful scenery and the beautiful music... I think you should watch this movie to see the difference to the first ones. The soundtrack and animation are amazing and it is a great movie, I just hope to see it again... and again and again!

I suggest this to any anime fan that is a sucker for some action and doesn't mind an average story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An epic movie about the Vietnam War with a twist, and an ending which is both sad and shocking. There are many things going on here, I'll just mention a few, the first is the theme of revenge of the innocent, in this case children who were shot at and killed on that same bridge. But more than that there is the issue of what the hell happened in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. We get to see Cambodia under an oppressive regime and witness it in the most violent ways. We see soldiers, women and children being tortured to death, we see dead children and dead babies, we also see corpses of innocent people being found in the back of a truck. There is a scene in the cemetery where we see the heads of people who were buried there being thrown off the bridge. They seem to be screaming and screaming and they don't know why. The people who are buried there have been taken off by someone or something because there is a big pile of corpses around them. The next thing we see is a woman walking along a street at night. There has been a war going on in the street and there are people carrying weapons. A man with a gun and a man with an axe are about to fight each other. Suddenly the woman looks up and sees an American soldier on a motorbike and she runs and gets in his car. She gets in the car and we see that she is a pregnant woman who is carrying a baby. We don't really get much more about what is going on at the time and in the end she is going home. There's a strange ending which at first is quite surprising because the people who get taken away don't seem to have gone home. As soon as she's in the motorbike she looks at her baby, she is about to give it to the baby in the baby carriage when there is an explosion in the middle of the road and her baby has died in the accident. It's a sad ending.  This movie is a great way to end the war in Cambodia and an excellent film to watch for the first time.   The movie was released in the U.S. in 1970.  See more about the war and war atrocities that the U the U S. has done in our series: The War in Indochina (1961-1975) Part One: Vietnam  The war in Indchina (1965-1975): Part Two: Laos   The War in Laos (1965

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie! It seems to have come out right when the whole "diverse" crowd that was becoming so popular among films was about to come in. There are a lot of very well done films that are quite good but this one is the best. It had many things in common with the rest that is very good and enjoyable. It is very well made, has a great story line, and a good action scene to give you more than enough for a long movie. It took me a long time to find out what was going on and once I realized, the movie is very enjoyable. I think I might like to watch more films like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " I was so excited to see this. I've heard so many good things about it, it seemed like such a unique and wonderful idea.  The plot is a fairly straight forward one.  In the movie, a man (who has just lost his wife, who has passed on) finds himself back in the town where he grew up.  He had been out, but his family doesn't remember him. He has the key to her house and she gives it to him.  Then she tells him she never wanted him, that she was just an ordinary housewife.  But the man in the film has a very unusual way of getting information about what is about to happen.   The movie itself is quite enjoyable, it moves at a good pace and it has a few amusing moments, such as when the policeman comes by and tries to get to the truth.  There are other things which I enjoyed about the movie as well.  The characters are all very much different from one another and all of them have their own character quirks, that make them all memorable.  One person's character is another's friend, which was something I really liked about it.  And the music is good, some of the parts where it sounds rather creepy are at the end. Overall a rather interesting movie, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know a little more about the life of a man who is very much like the father I had.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was such a fun little gem of a movie! This is pretty self explanatory, a group of kids get stuck in a dark underground dungeon. Their guide is called the Keeper, a man who is so mysterious, and so well built, that he can only be seen by children. In fact, one of the kids (Cameron) is so convinced of the Keeper's power, that at one point he makes his way outside to get a glimpse at the Keeper. While Cameron is distracted by this new sight, the other kids get trapped in the dungeon. I'm not sure how they made that hole, but either way, they didn't find their way out!  It is interesting to see the differences between the first film and the follow up, and how the movie handles the characters.  I don't think the changes are as significant as they were in the first movie, but I still prefer the film to the first, as it does a much better job with the characters of the first. Even though the kids are the central focus, they all do a good job with their respective characters, and they all have their own individual personalities to be sure. There are a few really funny moments in the movie, though nothing really stands out.  The film is not as fast paced as some people may like it, and it has a bit too much of an "80s" feel to it.  It takes about an hour and a half to see this movie, and I'm sure most of the people who were in this movie will be able to tell you why.  All that's left is for you to enjoy watching the new addition to the Halloween series!
Write a positive review about a good movie:       I'm really excited about this movie, the first movie to ever tell the story of a black cowboy in the 1920's.   This is one of those movies that I'd love to see in an even more expansive way.  There's plenty of cowboy movies out there with cowboys (or at least cowgirls) in the 1930's, but they mostly lack anything to really make me want to see them.  But in this movie there's a ton of history (from pre-Civil War to the late 40's to the 60's) that will help to get you into the mood.  This film has all the things that I think I want in a western:  A man with a broken gun, and his horse.  And at the end of the day, the cowboy comes out on top.  With plenty of explosions, and a solid plot the film is worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Chill" is a very entertaining comedy/drama about an average guy's life. He is unemployed, he lives in a tiny house with his mom, he hates living in the city and he has a habit of killing people. One day he meets a beautiful girl, she doesn't look like a typical actress and she has a strange, eerie voice. After a few nights together, his mom is concerned about him having an affair with her daughter's fiance and the whole town is on edge. Things start to get weird and strange and one night they decide to rob a bank to get money to put the kid through college. The whole thing is more ridiculous than a sitcom but it's pretty good.  " The Big Chill " is a decent comedy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "The film begins with a bang. A shot through the windshield of a dark green car as we see a young woman on the side of a dirt road with her boyfriend and their dog. They have just come back from a road trip. The boyfriend is looking at a photo of a woman (played by a very pretty young actress) whose face appears to be a dead mannequin. Suddenly, it moves and a face emerges on the photo and this face is that of a young man. He is holding a hammer and looks straight ahead as he watches his friends leave and a red truck drives by. A few minutes later, we are shown a group of teenagers standing by a creek as if the river were frozen solid. They look up, expectantly. A big dark red truck appears from nowhere and stops. Two masked men emerge from the passenger side. They all have their guns drawn and the truck drives off. We are then shown an almost entirely black sky. The teenagers stare at the sky. Suddenly a bright light comes from the sky and it quickly grows brighter as it rises into the sky like some sort of bright angel. It floats up into the heavens and disappears in the distance. Everyone in the crowd is silent as the young man who had been standing in the road disappears and we cut to a shot of the dark woods and the road. The car speeds along on the dirt road at night and the headlights illuminate the woods in the background. It finally stops and the passengers get out and look at the bright sky. There is a slight snowfall and we are again taken out to the woods where we find a young boy playing in the snow. He wears some kind of winter outfit and has a red blanket over his shoulders as he looks up at the stars and he appears to look at them with a sense of wonder. In another shot we see the headlights through the window of a van. They are coming up the road and are going to be pulled over. The driver and a man in a red hat with sunglasses and red hair are sitting by the side. The man in the red hat is holding out his hands in greeting. He takes the boy aside as he says to the boy "Good afternoon". The boy is very nervous, he has an anxious expression on his face. The boy runs up the street and is chased by the driver. The kid starts to cry and screams as the driver's truck starts to ram the boy in front of him. The truck rams into the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts out slow, and even though the movie is made up of very short scenes, there is a sense of time passing in the movie. There's a moment of laughter at the beginning, and then there are a few good gags, with several humorous scenes in the background as the character makes a very serious speech about an important event he was involved in.    The characters in the comedy are good. The comedic moments are quite memorable.  The comedy seems to go down the path of good fun until the comedy ends, with the movie ending up with a great amount of laughs. The whole movie is fairly enjoyable and entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't been as disappointed as I was with the first one, but this one is even worse.  If I had to compare the two, the first is a much better movie.  I don't want to call this a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination because it's only a poor one.  But for a sequel to a good film, it's a disaster.  It's poorly acted, it doesn't have any great jokes, it lacks an interesting plot...there's just so much wrong with this movie that you can't help but think it was made by a drunk teenager who had never made a movie before and didn't care about the project.   You can never tell what the next film is going to be like. The ending was completely out of left field and completely unnecessary.  This one has to be one of the worst sequel films to a movie I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a brilliant film. It's a story of love and loss, of a girl and a lost son. And it's about a town. It is such a wonderful story. There is so much to be said about the town of Derry, and there is so little time. It has an amazing atmosphere, and the ending was absolutely perfect.   However, the main character of the film is an American girl, and it's a little hard for me to understand how she can stand in front of the camera. The movie is all about an American teenager who has to go back to her homeland to find her little brother, who she had left back in Derry. The town in Ireland is a little strange to the American girl. There are strange people, an enormous amount of alcohol and lots of violence. For American eyes it could be a little frightening. The Irish girls in Denny's Dump are particularly difficult to take. So, the young American girl is forced to leave. And she leaves in a big hurry. She is on her way to meet a boy from Derry to give him something he has lost. And the movie ends with her in Ireland.   This movie has the greatest ending I have ever seen. I thought it was so perfect, and all of the characters in the movie come together perfectly to make a perfectly good ending for the perfect story. The ending has some great scenes, the way it ends is just like the beginning of the movie. It ends so beautifully. All of the emotions are real, all of them. I think the best way to sum up the ending is this: a big empty house that is suddenly filled with family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good family-friendly movie for children. It has an excellent story.   One reason is that the movie starts out like a western, but in fact is a retelling of a fairy tale. When the old man and the young girl go on a hunting trip, they are followed by a beautiful hunter, whom the old woman is jealous of, and a man who can "make a fire". The old lady is a witch and it's the boy who has to be saved.  It all happens in a big forest. The boy has to go with the old lady in her canoe, with a bear, and with a beautiful white-haired maiden who wants to marry him and be with him. As the boys are walking home, they get a bad fall and the old witch makes them fall into a well.  After a long struggle the old ladies get home and they're frightened at what happened. The girl goes to the witch to complain and the witch makes it rain on the whole place. She tries to scare it off with a big stick, but it's too late, so she just lets it come. Then when the children go home again, the witch has turned the well into a hole.

I was so happy to see the characters of Tom and his son, Tom Jr., and his mother. This is the most believable trailer family movie ever. All the characters come to life and are funny and wonderful. But this is definitely a family movie. A true family movie."
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** A long time ago a young woman died in a plane crash and her soul was lost. It wasn't long before she became trapped in the nightmares that haunted her dreams. When she's reunited with her lover in a hospital, she is released to see him and they begin to dance the night away. But then the nightmare becomes literal when someone tries to kill her. This may seem like an action film, but the story here is as disturbing and real as it is sexy. *********** (2.5/5) – I can't believe how realistic this movie is. It's a slow-burning horror movie that starts off on a somber note but slowly builds to a truly disturbing finale that makes you wish your dreams weren't so disturbing to begin with. It took a long time to write about this movie, but that's why I love it so much. It would have been better if it had a better ending and an original story. But, this is a great movie with a very unique story. It doesn't hold your hand in any way and it won't keep you guessing. ************** (2/5): A very strange movie that was a lot of fun to watch. I'm a sucker for a good story and this one has it. But it's really hard to see this movie in the theater because you have to stay at home, so I wouldn't recommend this for the kids who are only 14-14. ****************** (4.5 /5): One of the better ones on the list. This is an enjoyable movie that's definitely worth watching. It has some strong horror themes at play, so while it isn't a masterpiece (at times it comes across as a bit much) it's definitely not a bad movie. ------------ (2 /5 ): A very simple yet scary movie. Not very scary, but a good one. -------------- (3.5-5.5) : A pretty good horror movie. I didn't expect much from it and it definitely lives up to my expectations. It is very dark, which makes me wonder if the movie was shot in black and white. This movie will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. --------------------------- (4/5-10): This movie took me a little while to warm up to because it's basically a zombie movie, not a supernatural one. But the film is definitely unique. I love the film, it had me looking forward to every minute.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know if I should be upset about the loss of so many people from my childhood, but what can you say? I still remember my auntie and uncle and I getting a movie ticket at the local theater on a very bright day as it was just about a week into the summer. I remember my niece playing with a plastic bag in the seat next to her. It was a beautiful day and we were all enjoying the sunshine. A few days later she turned three years old. I was nine years old at the time and I still think the days I spent there were the best in my life. The only difference from a lot of my memories is that my Auntie and Uncle had taken a day off to go to a friend's house for a picnic. They didn't return until well after midnight. There was a lot more going on over there, but I can only imagine the terror in their lives the second the cops drove up on the back of their car with that terrible loud sound. I wish I could find the movie again to relive those moments in my youth.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Maze Runner: The Death Cure" is a film that is very enjoyable. The movie is a follow up to "Maze Runners" in many ways. Both movies are part of the "Mazes" genre, which I like. The characters are funny and the story is well written. This movie also reminds me a lot of "Grimm". In both movies the story follows the same set up. As the story begins, our hero, Scott (Brad Pitt), is about to make a jump into a cave. He has no problem jumping off of a cliff and a bridge. Scott finds that the bridge is being held up by a large stone. Scott tries to break it but it turns out the stone is very hard. In the end Scott gives up and breaks the stone instead. Scott is then led to a cave with a giant egg that he is forced to destroy in order to free himself. Scott then finds that he has an ocular anomaly where his eyes seem to move around. As he explores the cave it becomes clear that the egg has been laid by a giant, hulking alien. The egg is able to reproduce and gives birth to a group of three little aliens, who are then forced to hide in the cave. One of the little aliens is the movie's mascot, Scott's little brother. The aliens who are born are a tad bit small and the big guy is really over powering. This gets really ridiculous at times, like when the aliens are about to jump out to attack Scott. One thing that makes the movie interesting is that our hero finds his love interest, his girlfriend and his mother in the movie. When Scott sees her on the monitor Scott feels he's been married before. The only down point is that it takes us quite a long time to learn everything about the aliens. It could be because of the long time it takes to get from beginning to end. When it does finally start I am a bit upset at the end because we are left with one of the worst endings to a movie ever. One last thought is to see this movie as the movie "Grum". 3/5 stars, but I don't know how well that works.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you haven't seen this movie it is well worth it.  I'd say the most interesting element of the movie is this film's ability to tell a story about war, how it can make you love the innocent people you just shot and made you think you are one of them.   It also has a strong female character who is both badass and likable.  If you have a family, love your family and are interested in history, please look no further, you will have a fantastic time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I don't know why it's taken me so long to get around to reviewing this one. It really is just a good watch with an interesting premise. ___________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________ The idea that a few men (and a woman?) are all in a prison together was cool at the time and has only gotten more interesting with the years. ______________________ The first thing that jumped out at me when I picked up this movie was the poster of the guys in red suits! (and no, that's not a reference to the Beatles.) A really cool concept, with a cast of actors who were in some of the greatest films ever made (and some of my personal favorites). Some of these guys are so good it's a shame that they aren't around anymore. The rest of the cast, in addition to being good, also have an air of charisma to them. The best, to me, was Ray Milland as the villain, who really makes this movie work. For his part in this movie, he was probably one of the best bad guys in films ever. You can't really have a good villain when you're the one who has to carry the entire movie on his back. This movie is really all about him. I really think that is the movie's strongest element. It's almost as if everyone is just trying to get out of the room with him. For instance, I was just waiting for the guy to say "Who the hell are you!?" or "Who cares who we are?" This movie was a real trip when the guy said he doesn't want anything to do with anybody. And I wasn't even that into any of the characters, though they do play a lot of themselves. _________ Well, we've got the bad guy, the good guy, and the room that's just a prison, but then, a few things happened. There is a young woman in the room, who is in love with the man (I was a little confused as to what the guy was, but I got used to it after a while). We also have the room full of other men with whom the bad guys have to compete. I found that a little irritating because they never talk to each other, which is one of those things that I like to see. There are also several women in the movie, so that is really great. ____ I don' t think the movie is great all the time, but there are some really

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ One of the best movies of 2008 was released recently at the Sundance Film Festival. Written and directed by Robert Rodriguez (who also wrote and directed the excellent El Mariachi), it stars a motley crew of Mexican gangsters, a very funny Spanish actress, and a small town sheriff who's only job is to keep the peace between the bad guys. The film isn't really a violent movie; the violence in it is more of a "gang violence" or "Mexican gang violence" thing. When the Sheriff discovers that a local criminal leader in the small town has been buying up local gang members to sell them on the black market, he sets out to get his money back. Along the way he encounters a large group of armed Mexicans in a shootout; during the shootout the Sheriff is badly wounded and gets captured and left on a highway where he and his Mexican gangster friends are surrounded by the local Mexican gang. In what can only be described as a great movie, the Mexican gang members and the Sheriff struggle to overpower and kill the other two gunmen and escape together. The Mexican group is a hodgepodge; there are some pretty well thought out and realistic gangster characters and a few of them are not only funny, but likeable. However, when the movie reaches its climax, the violence starts to get pretty crazy; a Mexican mobster with a big penis is the only character who can stop the violence and the Mexican cartel who controls the violence is almost invincible.  _________________________________________________________

The story has a real depth to it and is very clever. The characters are well developed and the story is a real treat. If you love science fiction, a very interesting and funny movie. If only the movie had lasted a little longer it would have been great.

Well that show was great but this guy is so much better and he actually did get a chance to dance! I'm sorry but this movie isn't any more enjoyable then his previous movie 'Barely Legal' because this time he danced well...but did NOT get the award! I think he won 'Dance and Dance'. I think that he could have won it even if he didn't dance too well because he was good. This movie is not the best movie ever made, but it is a real good movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hollywood, California is the town in a state of perpetual motion. From the first movie in a series which tells the story of four young people who are obsessed with cars. The movies tell a story about the four people who fall in love with their cars, and they live on in their cars until they get married. They then have two more cars and live happily ever after. That is until the second movie which shows that they are destined to meet their fate in a tragic car accident. The third movie shows the people as the parents of the children. They are all responsible for the child's life, and the parents in turn are responsible for supporting their child. The final film shows the characters as their old selves, with the parents having taken the children to stay with them while the kids go to school. The last two movies of the series has some very well written and filmed scenes.  The second movie has very funny scenes and the third movie has some extremely well written scenes. My only problems with the movies are that the music is not very good. The first film is great with a great soundtrack.  I am a big fan of old west action films.   In the first film in a four movies, we get to meet the characters.  This is not a typical Western in the sense that most Westerns are.  It is the real life version of the Wild West.  As a fan of westerns, I was not sure if I would be too much into watching the series.  The characters were not all bad, but I still had reservations about watching them.  I am not one to be impressed by characters. I like to see real people as they are. As a viewer of western movies, I am often shocked by how people can be so much more violent and unpredictable.    The series was also not without flaws.  My favorite part of the story is the part of one character, and how he goes to see a "ghost" to get his father out of a "spiralling" car, he meets a person who has a very close relationship with the ghost.  There are times when I thought that the series went against the grain of a western which I enjoy.  However, it is not just a series for old fans of western films. Many of the new viewers will enjoy the series and learn a lot about the characters and the world.  Hollywood, California has been called one of America's most interesting cities. I hope
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film revolves around a family that was kidnapped to become the 'perfect' daughter.  The mother was captured as a child and had been raped and murdered.  She was the daughter of a former Indian leader.  Her son was a poor boy but had a strong character.  It was a tragic story.  We also had a few Indian army soldiers.  I didn't see a'real' Indian army soldier.  There were some funny scenes.  They all had funny clothes to wear.  Some characters were based on real people.  Also, the film is set in a fictional place.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film opens with a group of high schoolers playing a game of kick the can in their school parking lot. They decide to play for the first time since they've been expelled, and the game is on a roll.   (You know I'm all about the kick the cone, right?) It's a pretty standard high school game: kick the cans until the cone goes off the top of a car.  There is absolutely no surprise when the cone crashes to the bottom, but the fact that it happens at this point in the story is surprising enough.  These four boys are all pretty similar, in terms of their personalities and their pasts. The only thing I can really say is that one is a genius and the other three seem average.  Their teacher is a bit of a ditzy girl and seems to make up the rules out of thin air. She has the students perform all sorts of crazy feats that don't make any sense but don't stop the boys from trying.  I have to say I had a lot of fun with this one.  One thing that I found interesting was that the kids had to "tweak" the rules (the can goes off when the kids hit a cone and the kids "win" when they hit the can) so that the can is actually a bigger target than it looks.  The story was a bit thin, but overall it was a fun story with a fun cast.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of people who don't understand English will not be satisfied with this movie. It is a bit long, in the beginning of its shooting. You will find yourself waiting for a moment of peace, but there is never such a moment. As you may know, during the war Hitler's generals did not have much money, so to save their lives, they had to make movies. One of these movies was called The Battle of the Huns. It tells the story of a small town that was besieged and overrun by the Hun's. There are many German and French soldiers fighting the Hun, but the Germans are always getting trampled underfoot. But the Hun is invincible, he can't be stopped. When the first German soldier dies, it is too late. The Hun's enter and start the torture of the citizens, burning down the houses and killing everyone. A little boy, his father and a little girl, all in the same house. In the meantime, in a different city, the French have a little child as well. She is also an orphan and wants to save her brother. She makes a plan to get help from the French. But, in her village, a woman shows the way for them to reach the French village. Then everything is over. The French have killed a lot of Huns, but when a woman is taken prisoner, he is able to rescue her by taking the little boy with him. As the French soldiers find the child in the swamp, they want to kill her. They have no choice! They do. She was very innocent. She has only just started to talk, but already the men want to put her to death. But she is innocent. But they can't find any reason to kill. At last, a Frenchman is able find some reason to save the child and put her under guard. But there is no time to prepare food and the little girl only has a few days left to live. The little girl asks her father to do something for her, to give her a gift. She will never be able to thank him, because she has a small little dog. She wants the little dog to see a woman and it must be her mother. It will be the best gift ever. In a short time, all the children's lives come to an end. They want to give each other a very precious gift, but all of the children are dead. As one child is found with a piece of a shell, they must
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________   The plot is not original: a man is sent to an isolated island to find his wife's (Liza Minnelli) ex-boyfriend and a kidnapped girl. The island is ruled by a ruthless evil witch (Marisa Tomei) and the man is hunted by the evil witch. Liza Minnesdill's performance is exceptional, so good it is hard to believe that she is only 39 years old. The movie is shot on a very small scale, with a very simple but interesting plot, it has a very nice soundtrack and great camera work. It is the first in a long series and is not especially great but still a good little movie. I was so shocked by its ending that I have watched it 3 or 4 times already. ____________________________________   IMDB Rating: 8.1  A great horror movie with an interesting plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Jedi  is a film that is worthy of a standing ovation.  It tells the story of a young Anakin Skywalker during the time he lived on the planet of Tatooine.  And he is not only a very likable character who seems like a little kid at times, but also he is portrayed as a hero in his own right.   This is a movie that I can see myself watching again and again to pass the time with the kids.  This one will not disappoint.   -  I have to say that I wish there were a bit more action in the movie, because it's not all that exciting and it gets a bit bogged down with the characters and things going on.  I wish that the movie could go on longer, I felt the plot was going on way too long and it was a bit hard to keep my attention. -   For a full list of the Star Wars: The Last Jedi Movie reviews: CLICK HERE

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are some things in life that one just cannot predict.  One such thing is the unexpected ending of this movie.  At first, I was a bit disappointed when I heard that this movie was a remake of the classic "The Princess Bride".  In a nutshell, this movie is one of those that will entertain you with its great fight sequences and its wonderful music.  There was no need for a remake since the movie was one of the best in the genre back in 1994 and is still one of my favorite movies to watch.  The story is one that will keep you guessing the whole time.  As I said earlier, "The Bride" is a story of a young man named Flynn Rider (Kevin Costner).  He is the leader of a band of mercenaries that protect the Princess Bride from a mad King named Vizzini.  Vizzinis is an old king who is dying and his family is living the old royal life.  When his son (Hercules) is just a little boy and in love with his beloved Princess, he is murdered by his father.  To add to this, the evil queen (Ingrid Bergman) is planning to marry Vizzinos son for the position of Vizzin's heir.  Flynn Rider is the only one who can stop her but the odds are stacked against him.  Before the end, he has to defeat the vizzini family, his wife and his entire band of fighters and protect the princess from the mad king and his evil queen.  I did not expect it to be such a good story and an entertaining movie. I was left with mixed emotions.  It was good, it was bad and it was a masterpiece.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie to watch when you get really bored is when the movie is about the American army being in Afghanistan and all the soldiers are killed by an IED (it was an actual IED). Then there is a guy named Riggs (James Caan), who is the guy that has to kill the IED. He has a helicopter pilot (Cain) and a sniper (Tommy Lee Jones) with him. They are going to go get a map and when they do, all the others in the group, who are the rest of the platoon, get killed. It is not like a movie where you can say, "How cool" and then watch it when you can go out and watch it. It has a plot but there are no plot twists and it is very boring. The special effects are bad. Some of the soldiers say bad jokes about the soldiers that are killed. But it is really sad when you look at the movie and think about the people who died in it. I think it would have been a better movie if it had been set in Afghanistan. This movie is a very bad movie and I do not recommend this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's about a man who is trying to get laid.  His friends try to get him to go out with them, but he refuses to.  The other men in the group are like: "Hey, look at that handsome guy!"  "I'm going out on a date with him".  The end.   A solid comedy.  I'd never heard of the film before I watched it.  One of the reasons that I never hear about these things is that I live in a small town (not big at all).  In the summer of 2008, I went to see a movie.  It's been a long time, but I thought that it was a good time.  They showed this at my high school and the girl who acted in it is still there.  Anyway, this is a nice little movie about a guy named Frank.  When a bunch of other guys start showing up at his house with a lot of other female (I believe) friends, he refuses, saying it is time to go on a big date.  In this date, he gets a chance to be with a hot girl who is more than willing to put out.  But what happens next?  Frank is put on trial, and we get to see the reactions of the female friends in town.  It is a little silly at times.  There is a lot going on during this movie. I really liked the script, even if it was pretty silly.  This movie was enjoyable, it was something different, and not one of my favorite movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After the mediocre first and second movies, this movie is a complete improvement. In the first two movies there was a lack of imagination, and I do not know about this movie. After the first few minutes, they say that they are going to destroy a city, and then they destroy a large section of it with rockets. That sounds cool to me. The people in the city seem to be in a state of panic. I guess this is the "Superman" that you never knew you wanted! There is a lot of violence, including a few executions, and some of the things that the men (or women, or whatever) throw in the air when they die are funny as hell.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film was well-shot, very good, and very original. The characters all have their flaws, but I found them to be more like flaws than flaws. I'm looking forward to the film's sequel!  I've already had my reservations about this film, but once I finished the movie I found that I had had all I could handle.  This film was great!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  The movie is so much fun to watch and the acting is top notch.  It's a funny movie about a girl named Nancy.   Nancy has a terrible memory that results in horrible stories about things she's done and seen.  One night, Nancy gets a dream that her mother has been murdered, and her father has been kidnapped.  Nancy believes her father's kidnappers have stolen the money he's been saving to buy a house for her in Seattle.  My Favorite Movie  This movie is a great example of a comedy done right and it has a lot of heart to it.  This is a movie I will remember for a very long time and it'll definitely make me laugh and smile a lot.  It's an amusing movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ _____ I think this movie is really funny and has a funny plot. I don't like when the movies tries to be too serious. I think that this movie could be better if they didn't just get the actors into the movie and just did a short scene in the gym. I also think that if this movie would have more to it, it would be much more funny and would have a much better ending. _________
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You'll like "Hans-Simmert" because of its good humor and a strong performance by Hans-Sigmund, who has worked with actors as famous as Peter Lorre and Michael Caine.   (And, in fact, Hans-Jurgen Hult is a German actor who is more famous in America, because it wasn't until recent years that he started to make such a name for himself in this field.)   This short movie was a lot more enjoyable than the short film "Tin Man" from the same year:  With this film, and the one in which Hans-Göran is the man, Hans is no longer a character of a comedy. Hans now stands among the great German actors.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been meaning to watch this film for a while because the music is just so wonderful. There are so many wonderful pieces of music, and I really like their arrangement. It helps me to visualize what is going on very well. The only drawback is that the movie is very slow paced, and it took me a long time to see it all. I think it was a good investment for a long watch, and a great way to end a beautiful summer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie, as always.   It was made a little while ago, but it has a certain appeal that has not aged well.  This movie had it all: funny, great chemistry and a cast of great performers.  John Huston and Janet Leigh get to make their directorial debut, and if you can't love those two, you are simply not paying attention.  I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that this film is the best sex comedy of the century and I can hardly believe I have lived past this film, so early in its lifespan.  It is very easy to find the charm in this film and to love it.  If you love movies about lovers, don't watch this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I was hoping to see a modern adaptation of The Man Who Sold the World but ended up with a movie that is a mix of the old Western and the modern noir. _________________________________________________________ A western noir that doesn't use a gun.  It was about the end of the Western era, a time when the United States was at peace, and the rest of the world thought of the United State as nothing more than a place to exploit for everything.    A noir, in case you're not familiar with the genre, is a story in which a crime or crime-like affair takes place, and ends with the guilty party committing suicide.  But the movie has some other things going for it too.   I really thought that the story was intriguing, as it has a couple of strong points (I'll give the writer a pass for this as well) that you can see through the movie; the setting is the 1950s; the main character is played by a pretty good actor (a bit old for the 1950's, but he does his job well and is believable).  Also, the cinematography is very good. The special effects are a bit of a mixed bag.  The villain, Mr. Black, is played very convincingly by Charles Bronson.  I thought he was very effective as he doesn't take anything lying down.  He's one of my favorite characters in any film.  If you haven't seen a great crime film, I highly recommend that you see The Man from U.N.C.L.E.  For the film is very hard to find (I found mine on VHS in a store I used to work at in New Jersey) but I recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Dinosaur  fails on so many levels that I couldn't believe I made it through this movie.  It's hard to tell if the movie was made for a PG-13 or a PG, because they both try to get the audience to laugh and not cry.  There's a very bad script that lacks jokes and isn't funny.   I'm disappointed that there are too many times where the dinosaurs are shown sitting on their rocks, thinking, and not in combat.  They also are shown doing other dinosaurs while not engaging with a pack or even looking at their foe.   I hope someone brings this up and makes this one a movie for adults and kids alike. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Truly a fantastic movie about a man who tries to help the children of his family, but to succeed the father needs to do something very bad. He is an abusive man, who is trying to turn his life around. He wants his daughter to be able to leave the house without his presence. He takes away her clothes, her toys, her father. So she goes to the woods to find him. She has no clue what she is going to find.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The film is a combination of action, horror and comedy. The movie tells of a group of friends who were playing in their back yard, when two burglars break into the house. One of the burglars is captured by the homeowners and the rest of the group decides to search for the other. What is more interesting about this movie is that there are scenes where the camera moves from one location to another, the whole movie is a kind of "garden of illusion" and the story is not too serious.  There are a lot of good laughs in this movie, it gives you a lot more of a feeling that is the same, with a few changes of clothes. The best scene in the movie is the climatic fight between the friends and the two burglers. The final scene of the movie that left me in tears is probably the most moving and memorable scene in any of the film. (Verified Buyer)  Reviewed by KATHY WEST, MOYNE
Write a positive review about a good movie: ***********This one was fun and funny, and got some good laughs. I wish they would have done more with the characters and had more plot to it. The bad guy really did look like a bad guy from the early 1900s and a good deal of them were just "guys". The girl did a good job, and the music was good. Overall a fun, colorful movie that has some good dialog for the era.

The movie itself is pretty great, it has good acting, amazing fights, great character development, great music and a terrific plot that takes a little while to explain all the different things going on but is well done. I'd highly recommend it for people who like epic war movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this would be a hilarious movie. I was expecting the typical comedy scene but then they get the girl who plays one of them (the girl is the best!), she is hilarious and not as obnoxious as one thinks she is. The characters are the best part of it. They are so much fun to watch, I can't wait for them to get into a fight. This is a great one! If you like silly stuff then you will like this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure why this is a movie I've only just stumbled upon. It's an excellent tale with plenty of suspense, a decent cast, and, like all good adventures, is very entertaining. The story is set in the 1930s in the fictional town of Waverly Castle. It is here that the great magician, Harry Houdini, has lived for a long time with his wife and one of his daughters. The town has never seen any of its famous entertainers, and has a very bad reputation - although it is true that the town does possess a lot of wonderful old attractions and a well known amusement park with its own unique character.   In a world where wizards and witches rule, one has only one real power, which is the power to get a man to fall in love with you. The greatest of all magicians, however, Harry is also the most powerful in the land, and he would not care to have an audience in his castle as long as he is not bored.  After a night out at the local pub, Harry goes home and makes up his mind to try and break the spell that has kept him away for too long, although the spell was most definitely not cast by the wizard - but by one of the girls who he just came out of the pub with.  The problem is that the girls are not only a bit crazy, but are also quite vicious. Harry and the other male characters are taken out at night, tied up, and tortured, and each night there is a chance that the spell may be broken.  But the plot is very clever too. The women have a long series of plans for the other women who they have kidnapped, and as the story goes on, they get increasingly wicked. They all start to think they are the ones in control, and they all start using their powers against each other, and the men who are trying to break the magical spell are starting to find out that they are not the only people with the power. I can't believe that anyone could enjoy this much!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the movie i wish was out yesterday, i watched it at 5 pm (which is when i typically see a movie) and it had everything you could want in an action movie, it was fast paced, there was a great action set piece in the second half with lots of explosions, and even in the third act (which wasnt very long) there was still more than enough excitement.  There was a guy i had to go into the audience to see it.    In the first act they have some people with guns and a girl with an axe and some others that are pretty much just killing people.  Then in the end a couple guys are doing some shooting and then some people are shooting at a guy that is trying to get out with a gun. It was awesome, great acting (except for the bad one) and the fight scenes were pretty good (i wasnt expecting that sort of action though), there was also a couple of scenes of people falling from great heights like i have seen before. It has some great scenes in it also (for example the fight scene with all the characters falling down but then some of them come back up and they end up fighting again!) and it has a nice ending with all of the people doing a nice dance in the ballroom.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ (April 20, 2014) ________ is a film that can do little wrong. It is a well-paced, stylish and gripping film that offers an engaging story with lots of great acting. ________ ___________ (April 19, 2014), a film I am fond of. ________________ (April 17, 2014). The film's story, which takes place in a prison in South Korea, is intriguing and well told, which is why it won a number of awards during its run, but what makes it stand out is the excellent acting. The acting is so good, it is almost impossible to tell a bad movie from a good one, but the movie's biggest selling point is it's use of color, which helps to give this movie the most realistic feel of a Korean movie. _____ _______ (April 16, 2014)", a film you are definitely going to want to get to know more about. The director, Song Kang Ho, has crafted a film with a really strong story, a strong setting, a well developed plot and a well known director. The movie is interesting for the fact that it focuses a lot on a certain character, who is basically a modern day version of a character from a classic movie like, say, "Rabbit in the Moon." I don't know if the director of the movie is a master at story telling, but I am sure that the story is very unique and very well acted. The film is also very, very well paced, as it is about a prison that is more like a futuristic "space" prison. It doesn't really have a reason to exist. But that is why the story works so well. It keeps you interested and wants you to care about what is going on, even though there is no real need to. "Rally 2" is the movie that can make you feel like you are in the middle of a movie and have a great time while it does it. _________________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people would say this is a weak movie, but in my humble opinion, it is really quite enjoyable. The story and characters are all very relatable and the action scenes are actually really cool. A lot of the characters, especially the main female character, are likeable and interesting. You see she's the only thing keeping the Earth alive and the planet from destroying itself. She's a strong female character and one of the few female characters in an action oriented movie. The villain is a great and strong female villain. She really comes across well and has a lot to do, but is ultimately not very threatening. Other than the villain however, the movie is very entertaining and a very entertaining watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very different from everything else you see. It is the story of a man who, after living most of his life with no hands, is able to do a lot more work than most people do. When he is told that he can't do any work any more with a broken hand, he gets the thought "what are my hands for?" and thus the film begins. The camera moves through the man's life slowly, not so much as to interrupt the story, but more to build an atmosphere. I liked this better than I did 'The Green Mile,' and I think it's the same person who is at work with a different set of hands. I found the story intriguing enough, but not all that suspenseful. There are several plot holes which don't seem to have an answer. I don't mind that they seem to be missing, but they did add to the suspense, at least for me. The only problem with the film is its length. It would have been better suited as a three hour film, but I still enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Greetings from the big-screen! A beautiful story set within the same universe as the classic Star Wars films. The film is not a prequel. But this is a pre-quel that has some elements of the classic trilogy. The director, Ron Howard, has said that this was a true collaboration between the Star Wars creator, George Lucas, and the director of the first Star Wars movie, George Miller. It does have some elements that were seen in the first movie, though it is more of a stand-alone movie than it is a 'prequel'. The story is told within a small Southern town. We meet Luke Skywalker, a farm boy living with his Aunt and Uncle as the story unfolds. The town has a general store, where we are treated to some nice background scenery. Luke is a bit of a rebel, who is willing to go down and help his friends. A great performance by Samuel L. Jackson as the bad-ass rebel rebel smuggler. The story really is told in the form of an extended episode. It really is about a small town growing up around Luke and the rebel activities they partake in. It is a nice little story that could very well be a stand alone movie. However, the movie does need a good director to make a great film."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie may not be as amazing as most people say it is, but I do believe it is a worthwhile movie.   It is based upon a short story from Theodor Geisel about a boy and his dog, which had been published in the newspaper before and also appears in a book called: The Man Who Laughs.   I enjoyed this movie. While the story is a little boring, the characters (Buddy and his friends) are interesting and the story does leave you with a smile on your face.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie itself was not bad, it got better.  When I was going through a difficult times I had to watch this movie, I was so scared.   This movie is not scary, it is just strange, it was like watching a ghost movie.  When the protagonist, who is supposed to be a man, falls for the most beautiful woman ever he is supposed too have an affair and become a ghost.  I watched it in English and it was not that bad, but it didn't live up to the original concept either.  It was like a bad "Ghost in the Shell".  I'm not a big fan of movies based on books, but this isn't my first anime anime, or movie, or book or book.   "Ghost in The Shell" was released in 1999 to anime fans who are in the past, or so it was made to look like.  I have never seen it, but the movies are supposed to have a theme or message that the audience is supposed have a similar feeling as the main character, the main girl, the boyfriend, the ghost, the protagonist and the rest of the cast.  But this was just a cheap imitation of the original book in that regard.

This was a fun little kid's flick, that I thoroughly enjoyed!   I am always a sucker for anything that has a great soundtrack, a nice cast, and lots of wacky jokes.

The picture was good but the acting was not very good, and the writing was pretty dull. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good German Films of German Cinema by Fritz Lang is a film about a film. A film which is both a piece of the German cinema and a film that it is based on.  It is not a great film but Fritz Lang knows a thing or two about making films. Â Fritz Lang doesn't have the acting talent of a Marlene Dietrich but he does have a knack for making a film interesting.  In fact, it is a good film.   I like the story of a girl who wants to go to Germany to study English and to have an affair with a German and a Frenchman but the relationship between them doesn't go well.  The dialogue is dry and often stupid.  But the film is about the two characters which seem to be of the same mental state and they have to live with each other and be in love with each  one.  There is a scene when the girl is looking out the window and the girl's friend comes and tells her "She wants you" but she doesn't answer and the man replies "I want you too".   The film was released in 1931 and at first the reviews were negative, but it went on to win a few awards and was made into a popular movie, as did most of the movies of its genre.  This film has many similarities with The Wild Party.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun little story. I liked the idea that all of the vampires were based upon Shakespeare's plays because I know that Shakespeare does great adaptations of Shakespeare and I know we live in a time that is very much interested in the idea of vampires. There is lots of Dracula-ness in this one and it's very, very silly. A guy gets his head chopped off by a vampire (which is very, VERY silly) and then that vampire goes to the next town with an axe and chops everyone's heads off. I thought that was a brilliant idea! I think I'd like it even better if you changed the vampire's name to "Vampire" in order to make the whole movie sound much more "classic." :)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You Can Dance" is a Disney movie in which there are no bad guys - there's a family that has just moved to the neighborhood and they start having some problems with each other. The father, a retired dancer, wants to do the "lifted" style of dance he has been practicing but, unfortunately, he's stuck in the home of his wife who never learned to dance.  When she moves away, she gives him a DVD of the classic "I've Got a Secret" but, of course, she hasn't had a secret because it's an old movie.  She's been married to the father for so long that she's hardly noticed.   But, of COURSE she doesn't notice, because she doesn not have any secret and she can't figure out why the father is still in the house.  At one point, the father starts to show off to his daughter, a classic move, and she gets really excited about it - until she realizes that the dance moves, although beautiful, are just a little bit...different.  The father then becomes very interested in the family of three - his wife, his son (who is the singer's son, who has his own band), and his daughter.    He's in a happy house where he can take his own time to practice. The girl and her father start to enjoy each other and the father becomes more and more proud of his daughter for being a dancer.  She goes to a dance recital that the mother is attending in town and that starts a new relationship and the girl becomes a real star.  While the dad is still not quite happy about his life now he wants to have more than what he has had and wants to get a bigger house for his family. But he still has a huge obstacle - the daughter's boyfriend - a young man that is extremely attractive (in an over the top way), loves the family and is very nice.  Then, one night, a car accident happens and her family (and her boyfriend) gets killed.  It turns out that the daughter is the only surviving member (her father is dead) and she tries to find a way to kill him by using his dead son.  But he's not dead. He's alive (but really not very happy in life) and he's trying to keep the family alive by doing a little juggling of his own.  "You Can Dye Your Hair"  "I'm
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say, this movie is really good. It shows how important a great role actor can be in a movie. That's right, good, I meant to say great role actors. He made a good, fun movie. I know, this is a bit of a cliché, but you can tell this is the type of movie a real hero wants to be a part of. He's the best. If you like your heroes to be super-villains then this one is for you. If not, this one will make you laugh and cry at the same time. There are some great special effects in here, I always liked the "laser-beam thing". I do really like the movie though. It was really funny, the way a guy who thought his sister was dead (and his family too) and then when he got a phone call saying he had a baby...that's a pretty messed up way to say it...and it was a pretty awesome scene where he had to deal with his family finding out about his baby. The best part about the movie was the ending.  Posted by Joe N at 11:00 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think that it is about the difference between the past and the future.  The past, the bad and the dirty days of the past before there was anything better.    The future, the bright and happy future that is so different from the past, now that it's here we're going to see the differences too.  To see the changes in people is beautiful.  For one thing the old people don't get along, the old ways of people just don't fit the new society that they're living in.  They have trouble understanding modern society and it's not just because they are old, the new generation doesn't understand them either.  It's because they're different.  That is also a major problem for the police officers, who are the new people.  I love that this was made in the 1970's for people that grew up back in those days.  The story is one about changing lives and what the people of this area see as the right ways to live.  This is why the title is a metaphor.  So, in other words, it is a movie about life and growing up and the difference that it makes.  A lot of movies have a problem with what kind of movies should be made now that a lot of the things were made a long time ago.  But that's what makes this movie so special.  If there is one reason to watch this, it's because it has so much heart in it.

There are some really funny scenes and even if it is a little dated, I still laugh every time I see it. This was a very low budget film and a lot of fun. จ้ (7/9/2008). ธทยเ้
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is really good.  And the most important thing is, the people who made this were great with the humor and with the emotion.  They really put everything into the script.    It was like a dream.  It didn't just feel like a movie.  There were different characters and some funny moments in the movie. I liked it a lot.    In the end, I don't think it will ever get nominated for any award.  I'm sure a lot of people will like it, as long as they know how to use the words properly.  If you watch this movie, be prepared to laugh and then think. And be prepared for some real emotions. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . When I first read the book about the two brothers, I laughed so much, but was not able to relate to it. Then I decided to watch it and I was amazed by the actors and the story. It's a very moving movie. I think there are many scenes in the film that you may find funny and touching. I loved the fact that the family, all four children, were very happy in the end and the only thing that could make me sad are some scenes after the death of their father. The story may be a little bit too sad and it's not very touching, but it's very funny and well made movie.   - January 19, 2012I'm in LOVE with this movie!

I'd never take the word of this man against anyone's testimony or any evidence in front of anyone but myself, but I can see why he thinks there's a 'whole lot of shit' there. The fact that there's no explanation for the death or any other details of the death is disturbing, but there's more than that. This is a movie, a story. There's no reason that he didn't tell his children why he wasn't coming home that day, but instead, he'd been out all night at a party and by the time he got home, they'd been asleep for days. He wouldn't even tell the kids why he was late. How is it that the cops can believe that he was out all the night of the party but didn't know what the hell went on the previous night, especially when he told them that he'd stopped at the bar for a few beers? As the story progresses, we learn more about why he left and the truth is not good for
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While the first couple of minutes might seem a bit like a bad horror, the movie soon becomes an exciting sci-fi tale.        "The Matrix" is essentially a story about a virtual-reality program that has been hacked into a system and given a body that looks like a human male.   Once inside, the program goes on a killing spree against the corporate leaders of the Matrix.   The plot is well written and is not all that bad in the beginning, especially since it is mostly based on the premise of the computer being able to be used as a killer machine.   However, the story becomes more complex in the later half.   I feel like it takes a while for it to make itself fully clear.   It seems as if the original purpose of the program was to keep the people of the real world from being overwhelmed and killed by the mind controlling matrix.  However, it ends up killing all of the humans that are on the computer screen.   While the movie is not perfect (it is really far from one), it is a good introduction to the idea of the matrix and the technology used in it.   If you like cyberpunk you will like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is so simple yet so effective. The film shows a young man (M.C. Gonzales) who lost his wife in a car accident and was devastated. He lived his life as a single parent but was struggling to find the woman who was his true wife. He got a job as a driver for a truck company so that he could look for her.   One day while driving to pick up an old friend and they stopped at the same place again. As soon as M.C.'s car arrived, he told the woman to get out and that she should go back to the hotel. She was too stubborn and refused. As M.c. tried to make a way for the woman he noticed something in her eyes that he didn't like. She wouldn't look at him, she wouldn't turn to look at anyone. After a while, he gave up but later that day he saw her again. She had a long brown coat on and she was trying to go by herself, but she was stopped by the truck driver. She told him to take her because her husband had just died. Her husband had died in a fire he had set to get into a hotel.   the truck's driver was kind, helpful and sympathetic to her. M. C. started to think about how sad and lonely she was but he didn`t want to be sad. He told her that he wouldn't leave until he got her out of the car and in the hotel but she didn`T want to go. He was going to have to take the truck to get her out and she said she was going outside.   a fire had broken out and they all went inside. The hotel's fireman was called and he did a good job in fighting the fire. They got out before the hotel burned down. The truck was full of water when he took it outside and all he could do was stand and watch. When he returned, he started to get the driver to pull the vehicle and he got back into the truck after all and he tried to help her. He tried to lift the truck but she wouldn`t move. He knew he had no choice.   in his words: I had to get this woman out.   I was the first man at the door and I told her to stand up and to take my hand. She didn` t. She refused. When she didn't move, I had no other choice but to get back into my

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my opinion, The Godfather (1972) is a perfect crime film.  It's a good film about what happens to a family when a power hungry gangster threatens them with a murder.  The film starts with a couple who go into a bar just before closing time and enjoy a conversation about nothing... the bar is full of thugs who do all sorts of things to earn a drink.  The bar is filled with violence but a nice woman sitting in the corner tries to ignore it and says nothing... she's like a damsel in distress.  There is a scene where a woman has her throat cut, in a bar full of armed men.  She was talking to a man who did not take the woman seriously but it turns out that she was an informant for the mob.  When the police arrive at the scene the mob is there waiting for them and the mob leader has a gun to the head of a policeman who is trying to arrest him.   When it's over all the armed men are still in the bar and the woman is dead and the only survivor is the mob boss.  It is implied that the woman was an accomplice of the mob and that the boss is a very disturbed man.  This is a great example of a mob film and it is interesting to see how an Italian family deals with mobsters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing that I would say about this film is that it doesn't have a plot. But even if it did, it wouldn't be that bad. The film takes place during the summer of 1879 and as the movie starts its story revolves around a young man named Joseph "Bucky" Barnes (Daniel Radcliffe), he has just received a letter from his father that his beloved grandmother is suffering from dementia and must be left in peace. As she is lying in her hospital bed she says "Oh yes dear Joseph I've had a terrible cold" and that really gets Bucky's mind going. He runs off to see if he can find a cure but as soon as he arrives to the house his father has fallen ill, leaving him with a very ill and frightened wife, and the two young boys to take care of her. This was a wonderful movie to watch and I thought the acting was great. Daniel Radcliffe as Bucky Barnes did a great job. He was young and full of energy and could not get enough of the part. His character was very likeable and I loved to see him interact with his father. The young Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the wife was very cute and sweet and did a wonderful job in what was a very small role. I'm very glad that I got to see this movie, and I think that it was a movie that I'll watch again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Dark Knight Returns" is a good "Batman" movie from a good director (David S. Goyer) who did great work with the actors: Sean Connery, Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine.  The movie begins with a police officer (Gary Oldman) who is shot during a routine robbery.  Batman Returns opens up with Connery in his Batman costume running down a street with his hand raised when he sees a man who looks like him.  The man is Bruce Wayne, an orphan raised by two parents that died during World War II.  When Wayne's parents are discovered murdered in front of him, he runs to the Batcave hoping to find a cure for his powers.  Then after finding it, Wayne discovers that he is in fact the son of Batman (Christopher Walken) and Diana Prince (Rebecca Romijn) who took him in and raised him. When Bruce returns home to Gotham, he discovers that the city is in a state of chaos as he finds that the police are all out to kill him. He returns to Gotham with Alfred, and finds Alfred in a casket.  While Alfred explains the situation, Wayne goes on a rampage in order to save the city and he does so by taking over crime scenes and defeating criminals.  After taking down the Joker (Jack Nicholson), Batman and the GCPD begin investigating the man who they think is Bruce.  In "The Dark Days of Batman and Robin," The Batman's first outing, Bruce is in the costume.  He and Commissioner James Gordon (Paul Kersey) are investigating a string of murders and are surprised to find Bruce. Bruce is having flashbacks of his life in Japan when his parents died and they are taken away.  During his flashbacks, Bruce learns the true identity of the Joker, which makes him think twice about being a vigilante. In order to find out how his parents are being taken care of, Bruce has to find them.  As it turns out, they are in a nursing home after they were both killed by the Joker.  Before the Joker could take over, he was stopped by Batman and Gordon who sent him to Arkham.  It is at Arkham where we get a glimpse of Batman at his most dangerous and he's in full-on battle mode.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to say I am amazed at how much fun this movie is. I didn't expect much from this movie at all.  It starts off with a nice story, a little bit of a mystery, and some good action. And a couple of funny parts, especially a very nice scene between a few police officers that is hilarious at first.  And it is nice to know how many policemen there are, since this film is shot in a city where there are more then a couple.   The action scene in this movie was very well done with great editing and a couple great special effects (a bullet that is really big, and a car that goes over the bridge). The story takes a turn a little too quickly. A policeman finds a body that was washed up on the beach and they are going to identify it. Then the head of the police department, a certain Ed Bockert (Richard Jenkins) arrives.  This guy is not a very likable character as the guy seems to be trying to take control of the investigation. In fact, the movie kind of comes off as this guy trying to become the police commissioner. I felt bad for this guy, since I thought he was a good guy from the movie.  Then the two lead actors, Richard Jenkins and David Carradine were very good. I really liked both of them, especially in this scene in the bar. Jenkins was the only one I thought needed to be played more.  After that the movie takes a big turn, and I could tell it was the first part of a very long adventure.  I was very happy to learn about the mystery.  That is because this mystery was really great. It is very well acted, with nice acting and great characters. I am surprised there were no sequels.  The first half of this movie could have been better, but it wasn't. It did have a good action scene, and was well paced. If you love this kind of movie then you have to check this out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A beautiful movie.   The story is good and the characters are well realized.  The characters were not just ordinary people who could have problems.  They have problems, a lot, problems with a mother who is the personification of suffering and a father who is also a kind of a character which makes him a perfect villain.  Their problems will make you cry a lot but they will not be able to take it like a punch.  This movie will make an interesting viewing experience for both lovers of drama and story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is about a man who is a police inspector and also a man of many talents and is a member of a police comedy group of detectives.   He is also an artist and is also a musician and a writer and an actor. He also works as a salesman and a photographer as well as a police detective.  He also has a beautiful wife who he loves very much.  One day this man finds out that his wife has a lover who is in the police department and is very good looking and very charming and is the leader of the comedy group who is well liked by the police men and the comedy men.  So,   the comedy club comes across the idea of a man for a man love.  It is a romantic love story and it is also about how a man must be on his guard against himself to overcome his weaknesses and to become a better man by becoming a better lover.  Also, this is about how   The police inspector must have a good sense of humor to help overcome his own weaknesses.  This movie has some good comedy and some great love scenes.  The movie is very funny.  I gave it an 8 star rating. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is really an amazing story. It follows a girl and her dog. They both have a good and caring owner, that takes care of them but she gets a bit too busy and gets a job. One day she meets a boy at her favorite park. He takes her picture on his cell phone and tells her he is going to take her to his house. The boy looks very innocent and the girl is totally mesmerized. But when he knocks on the door, she notices all his things were missing, and then the boy shows her something amazing - a baby! The girl is very surprised and she gets all her courage to ask him if he will let her live there...but she doesn't want to risk her life. But he doesn't hesitate! After getting the baby and a baby toy, the girl opens the door to the boy's house and they go for a walk. There they meet their new friend - a pig - who is looking for a new home and the boy offers to give him one. It's a very romantic and very sweet movie and I loved the story and the acting.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about a poor black boy in his town (he's from Chicago but doesn't fit in), who gets a little bit more fame for being a good boy than he deserves. It's all a charade, really. If the movie was about what was actually going on, it wouldn't work. What it's really about is a boy from the inner city (who's father is a doctor), making a name for himself in his profession by helping a young woman (who is a prostitute) stay away from the cops. All of the cops in the town are corrupt. The movie is made to be a sort of comedy, a comedy about the "goodies," the cops, all of them. One day, the big city cops get into a fight with a bunch of kids in the park. It ends badly. The kids are all shot and killed. In the hospital, the doctor's wife (played by Shirley Jones) gives the father's (played, oddly enough, by the lead's father) first name in honor of the dead. The film shows the doctor trying to get his son to take over his son's business, even though he has no money. The doctor's kid is a thug. There are more violent scenes in the film than I thought could ever be found in a comedy. This is actually a tragedy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good, but brief, sci-fi action movie.   If you like sci- fie movies, this is a good one.  Director James Gunn does an excellent job portraying the future, but the story lacks some suspense.  I have seen a couple of other sci- fi fie's this year and this was my favourite.  Some good scenes and action.  A nice mix of comedy and science fiction.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first and foremost thing that I notice about This  is that it is absolutely perfect, a film that you can really watch over and over and get great enjoyment from.  I'm a big fan of horror films, and although it's a good horror film, it still stands on its own.   You can definitely tell it is a sequel, because it has a similar feel to a lot of the films from the 80s, which also have similar feel, like Halloween or the original Friday the 13th.   However, the first thing I notice is the makeup and the costumes, they all look fantastic and this film is not afraid to show some nudity.  The film has a great cast of characters, which really adds to the film.  It's funny, it's scary, it has lots of heart and it's really well thought out.  The characters really feel like real people, because you really feel for them, so unlike most of the horror films that I've seen in the past few years.  This is a really enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone who like horror, or horror films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is about a boy named Jack who lives alone in a farmhouse. He is very curious about life outside his world. He spends his days wandering around the woods. When he is looking for something he finds it- a mysterious red box that opens up into a strange world. A world that Jack may not want to be a part of.  As I am sure you are aware, this movie has two main characters: Jack and his little sister Annie. These are probably the most stereotypical children's character ever made. Jack is the tomboy who wants to "be in the big league" in whatever sport he chooses to participate. He loves sports such as baseball and football. In the end he finds his dream and his sport when he is invited to play in a football tournament. However, he becomes the victim of some "predators" that seem to want to win and take everything from the young and naive Jack. As such, his innocence is soon taken away and his body is put to use.   Annie seems to be the opposite of Jack. She is the sweet and innocent one who is often seen looking very young. However she has a very dark and mysterious past behind her. Her past has been hidden from Jack since the day they were born. It has not been explained as to what caused this and how Annie came to have such a dark past. However it is evident she is in search for something. It is not clear what though as her past is not really explained. It might just be a dream or just a mental image she has created.  I found this movie rather disappointing. I had no expectations for this film but I was rather disappointed. There was absolutely nothing special about it. There are lots of characters that you will recognize from other "kid's" movies and they all act really childish. You can be sure Annie will grow up to be even cuter than Jack. I did not have much fun in this movie. Jack was mostly bored and it was really difficult to watch him play football. There is a huge lack of humor in this film. Most of the humor was either not funny at all or had very bad jokes and didn't seem to even be a joke. The actors that did work really well in this were the children. There were a lot of them. However the other child actors did not look very good and just did not fit well with these child characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Saving Private Ryan is a great movie. In all seriousness, this is a pretty damn good movie that was made for a good cause, and this is where I say good work.  In one scene, we are given an excellent example of how to make a film good, and how to avoid a scene that only comes across as pretentious.  We are in the Normandy in the final days of the war.  This is a place that is constantly coming under attack from the German Army, but it still retains that air of a place where everyone is trying to get out.  The story takes place during one of these days, the final hours when the battle is at it's most desperate.  After some heavy artillery fire hits an area that is normally considered safe, we see the situation deteriorate further.  To make matters worse, all the soldiers are being taken prisoner.  We then see one of the most well spoken German soldiers, who we can only assume is a medic.  Here comes the medic, in full trench gear, to save the day.  As the movie begins, he does not look like a great medic, but as the movie goes on, it becomes obvious that his skills are just as amazing as his looks.  For this reason alone, he is one of my all time favorites.  He is constantly trying to do his job with the utmost professionalism, never taking his eyes off of a wounded soldier.  Despite his best efforts, some soldiers manage to escape and we see them with the dead and wounded men.  It is here, the movie gets a little convoluted.  During an air strike, we find out that a few soldiers are trying to go over to the US side of the line so that the rest of the men can return to their own side.  Unfortunately, the enemy has decided that it is better that this happen, and they are attacking a position that is too close to a major trench system.  Thankfully, our guy saves some of the soldiers, and in doing so, allows some of his fellow comrades to escape.   The next day, the Germans attack again and this time, they are able to get through.  While still attempting to take over the position, the US reinforcements arrive, and are able once again to put the enemy to rout.  In the final scene we see a German soldier, wounded and in no fit state to even walk, being carried from the front lines to the medic
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. It is like a cross between The Little Mermaid and Pocahontas, but this is not a fairy tale, this is a serious drama with a nice story. There are a couple of flaws but nothing that ruins the enjoyment for me.  The music is beautiful. I would not say it is the best but it is pretty good. The story is good, the ending is good. I give this a good 8/10 and I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good story with a happy ending. In the end.   This story was great.  What a fantastic story that just needs a little more time to come together and I can not wait for the movie. I was so excited to see this movie because of the great reviews I was hearing around.  For me this is an exciting film, the kind of stories that I love when I was young and have wanted to see them made into a live action movie, but there are some things that I wish they had done a little differently, and I hope this story will live on in the hearts of those who love this kind of story. By the way, if you like a happy happy ending...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The book that started me off on the path to fantasy writing. It's got a very good plot. A good start that keeps the plot moving and the characters develop. The magic system works pretty much as it should. You have a pretty good cast of characters with a few new ones. The first half of the book isn't so great - just the beginning. But, the second half is pretty good and it has a nice ending to it. I didn't find any of my characters too developed but I'm not sure if that's part of the novel or a fault of mine. In either case, the book is a solid fantasy story with a nice and satisfying ending.   As a short note, I really don't know why people keep saying this is a fantasy. I don't think it is and I think the magic system is the main problem. The best of the books (and there are three) I've read so far have been of a more modern fantasy setting. The characters are well developed, the story progresses and the magic seems pretty much consistent and believable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is difficult to believe that it is almost 20 years since this famous film was first shown on TV. One has to ask whether the 'Gentlemen from Zurich' film is still as popular as it once was? As the plot was a sort of modern twist on the tale of two burglars from Zurich who, being arrested for an attempted burglary, are brought to a prison in Italy in order to prepare themselves for trial. Whilst they are there, they meet two prison convicts whose stories and experiences have similar themes of robbery and revenge that, in the hands of a skilled director like Roddie Jones, are all the better for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot is not really as complicated as you would expect from a film that centers around the theme of "evil." The movie opens with a scene where the man (Michael Douglas) who is obsessed with his wife (Toni Collette) leaves her house. It takes him many years to finally find her again. Meanwhile, his son (Richard Briers) takes care of his father while he is away. As the son's (Charles Durning) life progresses, he begins to suspect that his father (who has a tendency to disappear after a few days) has been killed. He soon learns that the woman in the "haunted house" is in fact his mother and, in fact, it is she who is responsible for the death of her husband. As they leave the house in the hopes of escaping the "monster" that now surrounds them, it becomes clear that this "monster", while being much larger in size than a small child, is actually a good-natured (and, as it happens, somewhat well-meaning) old lady who is really a kind and loving person. There are some very frightening scenes that take place in the house that are as memorable as any horror film I've seen. It is a horror film filled with great ideas and scares. The acting from the main cast is superb. It's a great film. —Tom Minkler
Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- I have to admit that there was nothing I could have done to improve upon this movie. For starters, the story is rather simple, you have a man, named Ben, who has a very small penis, and who, after experiencing the pleasure of having sex with an attractive woman, is left feeling rather bored. After several days of the same routine, Ben sees a very attractive girl again who offers herself to him. He decides to have sex with her, after all he is a man after all, what other choice can he have? A few hours later, Ben is again bored, when he sees the beautiful girl, he decides to ask her a few questions to see if her answers are any good, he is soon to find out that she isn't the perfect woman he expected at all. It is all rather silly, but the overall theme is just too good to pass by without a laugh.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (I'm being sarcastic.)   The title may not have given this film a title of it's own, but it certainly gave it the "it" factor. "Wanted" is a well-crafted (though no doubt too long and slow), fun movie starring a great cast, great songs, and an epic finale that leaves you breathless with anticipation.   There's an amazing montage sequence in the film that depicts the characters as they slowly go through their lives. In one such sequence we meet the gang that goes after the "Hooker" (Juan L. Ortiz) and his goons (Ed O'Neill, Richard Gere, Gary Cooper and a bunch of other actors) with the help of a young boy that knows every detail about the place and the criminal.  The gang members are all funny; O'Reillys the funniest in this picture. There are some great performances and it's all a lot of fun to watch the gang members try to keep a straight face and follow the plan as it's laid out for them.  This is one of the great "It" movies; a movie about good and evil and the way the characters think and act.  "Went Down Easy" is also a fun movie that's worth watching on it's very own.  Recommended!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born in a small town, had a father who didn't like me, and never cared for anything I did as a child. I was an only child who grew up in the mountains, and went to a small private school where a bunch of losers got their butts kicked by an all-star team of cheerleaders. My older brother and I went to the high school in town, where one of the coaches became obsessed with making a good team. He went overboard, and gave us a hard and fast rule: if you get a win, you make all the other players suck. So he told us to beat the other team by the skin of our teeth. We did a little practice and won our first game. Then we played an all star game at the highschool, and won. The coach was a huge dick about this; he was very proud of us, and he kept us on the bench for the rest of the year, and we had our only loss of the season against another all-stars team. The following year we went on a road trip to a regional. We got blown out by another all stars team, and I got a black eye. We ended up in another all star city in the same town, we lost another regional, and the coach quit on us. That is my only memory of high school.   It's a very simple story, but I still liked it a lot.  What would a young man learn in high school if he was given this: It was a typical Saturday morning, I was still in my pajamas with a pillow on my head, and was listening to "I'm a Little Teapot" on the radio when I heard the news of the "Black Friday Massacre," that happened in Chicago's South Side on October 30th, 1968.  The black Friday Massacre was a riot in the South Side of Chicago. The area had become a ghetto with all the problems that come with it, crime, drugs, gangs. The Chicago Police were unable to control the riots and the situation got out of hand. The riot was a result of the Black Friday riot.  There are two stories concerning the Black Sunday Massacre in Chicago in 1967. The first has a very different set-up.  One gang of black males, the "Shooters," had gotten into a fight with another gang called the "Pelicans." Both gangs had had the same name, Black Friday. The Pel

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________ A film from 1987. A group of people try to get out of a situation that they don't understand. One group are very bad at making a decision that will make them happy, but will destroy a family. The other group have a secret, but it's very important. There's also a young woman trying to protect her younger brother. This is a movie that will keep you guessing. It's a good flick and makes you laugh at all the things that happen. A little bit too slow at times. Don't wait to see it, unless you're a good cinephile. A must see flick. ___________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A group of young people, each with a unique perspective, must all come together in a strange New York City to try to uncover a mystery and a conspiracy that threatens the very existence of the entire species.  The story of A Dark Song follows three young men, each of whom is burdened with the same problem: their mother, who, after being abandoned by her husband, has given birth to a son and two daughters who will never be the same. The young men must try to put aside their differences and work together to find the answers to who and why. A Dark Story, by Ken Russell, is a very good movie. It's a simple story set in the most difficult of times. It takes place in New York around the turn of the century, during the Panic of the Twenties. The movie is set in and around the area of Greenwich Village, with a good portion being in Greenwich Village itself. It is a beautiful movie. Ken Russell's direction is perfect, the cast is great, and there is a perfect amount of humor in the movie. The story of the movie is very simple, and it does an excellent job at not getting in the way of what it wants to accomplish. There is a lot of tension in the story, and while it may seem that it's not something to worry about, there are a few scenes that will make you chuckle. The music is amazing, the plot will keep you thinking through the entire movie, and most importantly, there is enough suspense to keep you in suspense. The film's ending will leave you wanting more, and more. It will make me want to see all 3 of the films as they are essentially the same movie. As I write this review, I'm in the middle of watching them as they come out on DVD. I know I've only just begun, and I look forward to reading all the comments about this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ (8/10) I think the most amazing aspect about this film is its cast. All the performances are just perfect. From the creepy and menacing "Rasputin" to the sweet "Sally" to his faithful butler, Harry and the wonderfully witty, lovable "George," this film truly delivers on its reputation, and is very well done indeed.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â The Last Samurai Â is a fantastic samurai film about a samurai who is asked by the king of Japan to be the chief of a new army. I know of the two movies made by the same studio, but I have only seen the first one,      The Magnificent Seven. Â One of my favorite action movies from the westerns with its amazing fight scenes, I would recommend this movie to anyone with an appreciation of the great samurai movies. Â All the action is excellent and all the characters are great.  This is not a good film about the samurai as the film is a very funny film with a lot of jokes and humor.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is about a man who, during a trip to a nature sanctuary is attacked by an angry tiger. He is badly mauled by the tiger. The film gives a very realistic view of the attack on the body and in terms of the acting. It is a very good movie with a very touching story and a lovely screenplay by a very talented director. The tiger is played by Shrimant Kulkarni. The best thing about the movie is the beautiful forest and the lush scenery. One may wonder about the authenticity of this film and the answer is yes and no. The tigers in the film were not real wild cats but tame cats used for a circus. However, most of the action in this film was real and there was plenty of wild tiger fight in this movie. The production design was very good. The actors also did a good job and the whole film is really a good example of how to do a special effect in a film. The soundtrack is great. It does not contain any lyrics from the Indian classical music but its a very authentic Indian music. It will surely make you smile.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There isn't anything bad about this movie so I can only recommend it if you are looking for a good Sci-Fi flick.   If you like it and you didn't watch it before.  If not, watch it then.  The plot is nothing much to see. You may find the alien's plan a bit complex and convoluted. It is also hard to follow as this movie is so slow paced.  There is an evil organization that is trying to turn Earth to the dark side by creating a virus. They also try to turn all living things to the virus by using them as a weapon. The hero, who works for the organization, uses this virus to turn back the tide of their plan. The aliens, after being cured of the virus, decide to continue the plan. If you have seen the original movie, you will see very similar plot to the sequel. The alien, the big blue alien is back as he tries to turn the Earth into his planet.  This movie may have been very bad but the acting is very good. The effects work very well.  It is one of those Sci-fi movies that is good. It's a nice little Sci-FI movie that is hard to put down. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. I loved this movie because it had action with no dialogue, which made this movie a lot more fun than it sounds. The main bad guy (a killer bunny?) is played by a very entertaining Christopher Lee (he does a very good Chris). You can tell that there is more to this guy than meets the eye. He is very much a human being, but he's also a super hero. I believe this is one of his best films. It has some of his greatest performances. The only thing that bothers me about this movie is that there are so many sequels that have come out to this film. It's just kind of tedious. I'd give it a 4 1/2 out of 5!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After a while, I had gotten sick of this movie. The plot, which was a little over half the movie (not really much, but a good amount) was about two sisters of high social standing who were getting ready for a big family celebration. One of them was on a business trip and the other one was taking care of some matters in her family. A little while later a man named George and his friend Carl entered the party. Both George and Carl were dressed in black suits with dark sunglasses and their hair was in braids. Their attitude made me wonder if they might have been part of a mafia or some sort of organized crime. I know the movie has some strong images to it. The girls seem like normal girls who are really trying to live a normal life, but things don't go their way. They are interrupted in their little parties by this stranger named George. This guy comes in very slowly and then, he is ready to "punch" one of the girls. Well, he didn't mean to, but it didn't matter. The girl was scared and ran away. The other girl ran away and hid in the back room of the house. But just as I thought she was done, the guy comes back. He was ready to give her the punch, but there was one more problem. Her name was Mary. Mary didn't feel like taking George's punches. So, she said "NO!". And then she got up and left. She made a big commotion, but she was left alone. I can't say this movie got me, but I can say that it definitely left some impressions.

There is no way a guy like this can not make a successful career in porn.  His first scene is the best yet. **************** The director is a very good performer. ************ ************ My favorite role in the film is the main character.   His sexiness is out of this world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen this movie quite a few times, and each time I find a better movie to get the evening started off, even though I was only in High School. As a teen, I loved horror movies of the classic type, but what the hell did I have to do with the movie. The story is the same each time. A college student, who goes to a local amusement park called "The Wild Wolf", when he has an uncanny feeling that he is going to die there. He goes to the doctor (a psychiatrist, it's not explained what his job is) for treatment, but the doctor is in a very bad way with himself (which he always seemed to have trouble with). After getting his bad self fixed, the college kid does a bit of "crying in his mother's kitchen". And when he wakes up with his mother there with a knife in her hand and a smile on her face, the man begins to do what comes next, slowly cutting his body to bits until he can't stand up anymore. I must say that the picture quality is excellent, but there are some shots that are not as good as others, and the action of some of the scenes seem a little rushed. Still, it is a great movie, so don't get too scared by the title, because this isn't your standard "gore" movie, it has a bit more to it.
